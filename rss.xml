      <title>Valve speeds up Steam Deck production some more, all existing reservations this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3413183219974913052" target="_blank">has announced</a> that they've sorted out various issues with their Steam Deck supply chain, so they will get through reservations much faster than expected now. This means a lot of people will be bumped up the list a bit getting their Steam Deck purchase email a lot sooner.</p>
<p>Everyone who has an existing reservation will get their purchase email this year. So many who were in "Q4 or later" were bumped up to the Q3 window and Valve said everyone else is now sitting properly inside Q4.</p>
<p>Any new reservations will be in the Q4 list but if those fill up, naturally they spill over into next year. Either way it's good news, as Valve can get Steam Deck units shipping a lot sooner than before.</p>
<p>We don't know exactly what has changed, as Valve only said that "the supply chain shortfalls that affect Steam Deck are gradually clearing up, and we're continuing to ramp production, so we're able to produce more Decks faster than ever before"</p>
<p>Valve also said to expect "more news soon".</p>
<p>This is awesome news, I'm excited to see more of you getting your units. Every single device shipping is a new potential Linux gamer!</p>

      <title>Yars: Recharged from Atari launches August 23rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yars: Recharged is the latest remake from Atari with developers Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox and it's launching on August 23rd with Native Linux support. This is the latest entry in the Recharged series following Missile Command: Recharged, Centipede: Recharged, Black Widow: Recharged, Asteroids: Recharged and Breakout: Recharged. No doubt they have more planned too.</p>
<p>They also teamed up with award-winning artist and composer Megan McDuffee for the the beat-heavy, pulsing original soundtrack. Plus a new teaser trailer up too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nae3tQy08IA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4556766b60365cd8d71be2ca46ce666.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nae3tQy08IA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade mode: Boss rush of 30 enemies. It’s not endless, but it’s VERY difficult to get to the end of this mode. Three hits and you die, but don’t worry, that hit-count resets when moving to the next fight.</li>
<li>Missions: 30 unique, challenging bosses and only one life to beat each. Like Gravitar: Recharged, there’s one global leaderboard for mission mode, so you need to be on your game. Bosses pose a challenge, so you will need to take them head on with a barrage of bullets or start with the smaller, Minor Cores first and work your way to the boss.</li>
<li>Power-Ups: Minor Cores will drop power-ups when attached. Shoot in all directions at once, rapid fire, explosive shots, or fire a railgun – the nature of the power up is tied to the nature of the core that dropped it.</li>
<li>Co-op: Yars: Recharged is a local co-op game in both arcade and mission mode, a big change from the original and a ton of fun for you and a friend.</li>
</ul>
<p>Will be available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019990/Yars_Recharged/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Modern Diablo game engine devilutionX sees new release, how to get it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you want to play the classic Diablo RPG? Well, not only does <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/diablo" target="_blank">GOG</a> have it and the Hellfire expansion but the Native Linux devilutionX game engine can make it even better. Here's how to get it working on Steam Deck (and Linux desktop!).</p>
<p>Why would you want to use devilutionX? Well, it's constantly updated to improve playing Diablo for modern platforms! It just keeps on getting better. Many advanced features like high FPS support, more resolution support, skippable movies, quick casting, better multiplayer, UI improvements, better saved games and the list goes on.</p>
<p>How to:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, you're going to want to install the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> as that makes managing games from GOG <em>really</em> easy. You can get it easily as a Flatpak from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, and on the Steam Deck from the Discover app.</li>
<li>Sign into GOG with Heroic and download Diablo.</li>
<li>Next up, download the AppImage from the devilutionX GitHub <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases" target="_blank">releases page</a>.</li>
<li>Make the AppImage executable. Right click -&gt; Properties -&gt; Permissions -&gt; Tick the "Is executable" box.</li>
<li>Move the AppImage into the folder where Diablo is installed.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it, now it will run via the AppImage and detect the content properly and work. However you can also add it to Steam, to launch it directly there.</p>
<p>How to add to Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your Steam Library, go to the top menu where it says Games -&gt; Add a Non-Steam game.</li>
<li>Find where you installed Diablo and select All Files from the bottom of the file picker.</li>
<li>Select the devilutionX AppImage and add it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Done! Now you can launch it from Steam and it works on Steam Deck in Gaming Mode nicely too.</p>
<p>Now here's all that in video form to give you a walkthrough and a quick bit of gameplay just to show it working:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tqu_BNGgxDA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ba01beb8d09fa328dcba20fe59652f0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tqu_BNGgxDA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for devilutionX, it's had a few massive upgrades recently that massively improved gamepad support, updated translations, improved game stability, added a new settings menu, improved multiplayer and so much more. It's really coming along nicely.</p>
<p>Remember you need to own Diablo, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/diablo" target="_blank">buy it from GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>itch.io has another Creator Day live with 100% going to developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The game store <a href="http://itch.io" target="_blank">itch.io</a> is running another Creator Day, this is where they don't take any cut from developers. Developers will then get all of the proceeds from each sale (minus any required fees and taxes).</p>
<p>It's a great idea because it can give developers a nice little boost, and for itch as well it's an easy bit of advertisement — hey look even I'm writing about it, free press!</p>
<p>Here's a few ideas to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arieljurkowski.itch.io/please-fix-the-road" target="_blank">Please Fix The Road</a></li>
<li><a href="https://abbyhoward.itch.io/scarlet-hollow" target="_blank">Scarlet Hollow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons" target="_blank">Dicey Dungeons</a></li>
<li><a href="https://graffiti-games.itch.io/tbcte" target="_blank">Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sleeper-games.itch.io/hyperspace-dogfights" target="_blank">Hyperspace Dogfights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Check out all that's <a href="https://itch.io/sales" target="_blank">on sale here</a>. I also have a collection of some <a href="https://itch.io/c/1674813/best-linux-games" target="_blank">great Linux games here</a>. Creator Day only runs for 24 hours until midnight PT (7AM UTC tomorrow Sat 30th).</p>
<p>If you do pick up something good, or see a particularly great deal going, do let other readers know in the comments!</p>

      <title>OUTRIDERS officially gets a Playable Steam Deck rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking for your next RPG-shooter hybrid with online co-op? OUTRIDERS from People Can Fly recently released the WORLDSLAYER expansion and it's now actually Playable on the Steam Deck (and Linux desktop too). Previously it had problems with Easy Anti-Cheat but that is no longer an issue.</p>
<p>Currently you <u>need</u> to set it <em>manually</em> to Proton Experimental (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">guide</a>), as a very recent update stopped it working on Proton 7 and if you have any problems, just ensure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed in your Steam Library. I imagine very soon it will be re-verified and set properly to Proton Experimental so you won't have to do that.</p>
<p>The developer even <a href="https://twitter.com/Outriders/status/1549411774738432000" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a brief announcement video about the official Deck Playable status. It appears it's Playable and not Verified due to needing the on-screen keyboard to be opened manually (Steam + X).</p>
<p>Here's a look at it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BzVuBV_zJgY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a48a10557c355e30256dd96d00ef282.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BzVuBV_zJgY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>I think I'm going to enjoy this one…</em></p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/outriders?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Just King blends Vampire Survivors action with Slay the Spire progression</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just King is going to be my next game to be fixated on. It's ridiculously cheap and offers up gameplay where you keep wanting to come back for more. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Offering up combat that's perhaps a bit like what Vampire Survivors made popular again, with you running around facing off against waves of enemies. It's also an auto-battler, so you don't attack directly. Here though, you're protecting your little King with other classes of units surrounding them in a circle that you can manually move position around the King. It's some very clever design and looks great too.</p>
<p>After you beat a round, you then go through a Slay the Spire styled map where you pick a node to go through battles, random events and more. You also repeatedly get to change your roster of fighters that you build up like a little deck, upgrade them and more. It has a <em>lot</em> going for it and the price is great too at only £2.89.</p>
<p>Tested working great on my <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> laptop with Pop!_OS and works great on the Steam Deck too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ISSGWxMwCsI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e5f01dd5f8c4d61c4c28cc7c3e1b84b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ISSGWxMwCsI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently though it doesn't have <em>proper</em> controller support. You can enable a "twin stick mode" in the settings but it's not quite correct as only the left stick works for King movement, and then you get the Dpad for swapping around your guards. I preferred to keep it in mouse / keyboard mode on Steam Deck with the right stick or right thumbpad as a mouse as it worked quite well overall and i had no troubles with it. Hopefully though they will get proper controller support in.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Destroy tons of enemies using multiple gameplay styles</li>
<li>Move the party to engage or run from chaotic combat</li>
<li>Hire and upgrade awesome heroes in an auto-battler shop</li>
<li>Use 17 characters and their synergies to creates powerful combinations</li>
<li>Discover and wield many legendary items to boost your party</li>
<li>Fight deadly bosses to unlock new areas, enemies, heroes and mechanics</li>
<li>Defeat wave after wave after wave of hundreds of zone enemies</li>
<li>Endure environmental challenges across 3 different biomes</li>
<li>Be patient with the Bard, he's trying his best</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I am honestly loving these smaller indie games that keep appearing like this lately. Small, cheap, repeatable and a lot of fun. Now if you need me, I'm off for another round. I wouldn't be surprised if this quickly becomes a big hit, what an absolute gem.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059980/Just_King/" target="_blank">Just King on Steam</a>. Works out of the box with Proton 7. It is currently in Early Access with the developer expecting it to remain there for 6 months at a minimum.</p>

      <title>You can now play DOOM as the Cat from Stray</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yes this is a real thing, DOOM modders will quite literally do anything and I'm here loving it. You can now play DOOM as the cat from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/run-around-a-cyberpunk-city-as-a-lost-cat-in-stray-out-now/" target="_blank">Stray</a>.</p>
<p>It's not the most in-depth mod out there and it's another mostly silly one, but still somewhat amusing to try out. Playing DOOM as a cat in third-person is not what I had in mind when starting my day that's for sure. The developer said they are planning numerous improvements and additions like multiplayer, more cats, more effects, more cat abilities like scratching and drinking, the actual Doomguy as a combat partner to pet you and more.</p>
<p>Check out the dev footage below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="p-c0LchkzLA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b75ecd7f8f8c5c36350016b30534e630.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/p-c0LchkzLA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To run it on Linux / Steam Deck you just need a copy of GZDoom installed, with a DOOM wad file in the correct folder. Download the zip file from the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/stray-doom" target="_blank">Mod DB page</a> and place it next to your DOOM wad, this would usually be in:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">./config/gzdoom </code></p>
<p>Or if you've installed via Flatpak (like on a Steam Deck):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/strayDoom.v01.zip</code></p>
<p>Then run it (using terminal command as an example or use your favourite launcher) with:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">GZDoom -file strayDoom.v01.zip</code></p>
<p>Or if you've installed via Flatpak (like on a Steam Deck):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file strayDoom.v01.zip</code></p>

      <title>Wine manager app Bottles makes rolling back configs real easy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bottles is the free and open source app that allows you to easily manage Wine, the Windows compatibility layer on Steam Deck and Linux. Another <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release-2022.7.28/" target="_blank">new version</a> is live, with a whole new versioning system to help you roll back changes.</p>
<p>Their versioning system is part of what makes it unique and this is a huge advancement for the app. This new version allows you to basically have snapshots of each Bottle where things are installed, which includes the files inside and the main configuration of the Bottle itself so you can roll it back to a different point in time - perhaps before you broke it.</p>
<p>As they gave a demo in the below video when they installed a component and they restored to a previous state:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="astxMzyxk0E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8493235dabce36054e380a0abf6d7a58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/astxMzyxk0E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So with this new system, it allows you to install various Windows launchers, games and programs and mess about with them while also getting to restore the Bottle they're inside to a different state. Sounds incredibly useful for quickly testing various things.</p>
<p>More work has gone into the UI too, with the Library Mode now basically finished and they even implemented image covers taken from <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/" target="_blank">SteamGridDB</a> too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9543619411659027306gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9543619411659027306gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They said work is ongoing to allow custom covers, and manually picking one too if the one picked automatically from SteamGridDB is not what you want.</p>
<p>Main new additions includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New versioning system which allow versioning the whole bottle (also configuration)</li>
<li>Automatic versioning can now be toggled on and off</li>
<li>Exclude paths from versioning using patterns</li>
<li>Use compression for versioning states</li>
<li>Improve Launch Options saving without update the UI multiple times</li>
<li>Improved YAML performance using libyaml (the python-yaml package must provide support for it)</li>
<li>New About dialog</li>
<li>Covers support in Library mode (thanks to SteamGridDB)</li>
<li>Removed DXVK HUD option, use the Environment Variables section instead</li>
<li>bottles-cli shell option now provide command output</li>
<li>The Health Check is now in the About´s Troubleshooting section</li>
<li>Extended Core dependencies check, packagers are invited to double-check their packages</li>
<li>New default permission for the Flatpak package: xdg-download</li>
<li>Added credits for Third-Party Libraries in the Credits section</li>
<li>Minor UI improvements</li>
<li>Various bug fixes</li>
</ul>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-27 has the Halo Infinite campaign and videos working on Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/you-can-now-get-halo-infinite-online-to-work-on-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">showed off Halo Infinite</a> running quite nicely online on the Steam Deck and now <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton 7-27</a> that just went up makes the process even smoother and the campaign and videos now work too. This is another great step forwards.</p>
<p>Note: GE-Proton (formerly Proton-GE), is a community-built version of Proton not controlled by Valve. Not to be confused with Proton Experimental, which is from Valve.</p>
<p>Here's the new steps to get Halo Infinite working on Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opt into the Steam Deck Preview branch, if you don't see it then opt into the Beta on both options for the Client and OS</li>
<li>In desktop mode: download GE-Proton 7-27 info in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">previous guide</a> (using ProtonUp-Qt)</li>
<li>Set Halo Infinite to use GE-Proton7-27. Open Halo Infinite in your Steam Library and click the little Cog Icon -&gt; Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3349564631659023973gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3349564631659023973gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7387406361659023972gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7387406361659023972gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The GE-Proton developer does mention that there will still be some issues, as the code to get it all working is very fresh. Right now honestly I wouldn't really recommend it, as the audio stutter is <em>very</em> distracting and there's still some noticeable graphical glitches but it's truly getting close now to being properly playable in all parts. I'll keep testing at each release to let you know when it's really good to go.</p>
<p>A bunch of other updates in GE-Proton 7-27 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>protonfix added for Halo CE mod tools (confirmed working) -- thanks Oro!</li>
<li>protonfix added for Halo 2 mod tools (still has issues) -- thanks Oro!</li>
<li>protonfix added for Halo 3 mod tools (confirmed working) -- thanks Oro!</li>
<li>protonfix added for Halo 3: ODST mod tools (confirmed working) -- thanks Oro!</li>
<li>Fall Guys protonfix updated to fix hang after EOS install on clean prefix setup.</li>
<li>Witcher 2 protonfix added to fix failure to launch on systems with large core counts</li>
<li>Farcry 3 protonfix added to fix failure to launch on systems with large core counts</li>
<li>Battlefield Bad Company 2 protonfix removed, no longer needed and was causing DXVK not to load for the game</li>
<li>Endless Space 2 protonfix removed, was causing game to crash. Game now works but videos are upside down (known proton issue)</li>
<li>Gwent: Rogue Mage protonfix added</li>
<li>SQUAD protonfix EAC blob updated to last-known working version</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta gets Firefox as Flatpak, mentions &#34;future controller hardware revisions&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3413183219978214106" target="_blank">SteamOS Beta update</a> for Steam Deck and it finally sorts out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/you-should-avoid-the-stock-firefox-install-on-steam-deck-as-its-badly-outdated/" target="_blank">Firefox situation</a>, along with hints of hardware changes, or a new controller coming?</p>
<p>With Firefox previously being installed with the OS, it would only update with the OS updates and Valve were lagging behind on it (a lot). Now it's a Flatpak from Flathub, so it will get installed and updated via the Discover app so you will be able to sort updates yourself in desktop mode.</p>
<p>They also added a "VGUI2 Classic" desktop theme, made it so network connections made and edited in desktop mode will now be system wide to work properly in Gaming Mode, initial IBus IME input support on desktop mode for Chinese / Japanese / Korean keyboards, and fixed up Xbox login window for Flight Simulator and Halo Infinite not rendering certain characters properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20555171591658960215gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20555171591658960215gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - VGUI2 Classic.</em></p>
<p>One that really catches the eye though is the note that there's been updates to "controller firmware utilities to support future controller hardware revisions". Before getting overly excited about a Steam Controller 2 though, it's most likely aimed towards adjustments to manufacturing of the Steam Deck as we already know it's had a few adjustments since the initial first batch. That said, I would love a Steam Controller 2, please Valve.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> — not too long after, Valve also released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3413183219978165742" target="_blank">Steam Deck Client Beta</a> with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added favorite and popular guides to the Steam Overlay for easy access</li>
<li>Added notification when Steam Deck temperature goes outside the safe operating range</li>
<li>Achievement progress notifications (ie. You've collected 5/100 berries) will no longer play sounds</li>
<li>Resized virtual keyboard in Desktop mode to the appropriate dimensions</li>
<li>Fixed some performance problems for users with many screenshots</li>
<li>Fixed some navigation issues on an app's Achievements page</li>
<li>Fixed some touch styling issues with the virtual keyboard</li>
<li>Fixed sound playing for achievement progress notifications</li>
<li>Fixed overlay menu issues with games that do not have achievements</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Excavation of Hob&#39;s Barrow has some real fancy pixel-art</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gimme! The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is an upcoming adventure from developer Cloak and Dagger Games with publishing from Wadjet Eye Games and it instantly grabbed my attention.</p>
<p>Originally called INCANTAMENTUM, the developer decided on the name change because it was a bit difficult to remember and pronounce. Can't really argue with that. Teaming up with Wadjet Eye also means they are getting help to expand and polish the game with voice acting, along with getting Linux and macOS ports too.</p>
<p>Check out the new teaser trailer below:</p>

<p>Story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Antiquarian Thomasina Bateman is writing a book on the barrows of England, documenting the treasures she finds buried within. When an intriguing letter summons her to the small village of Bewlay, tucked away in the remote countryside, she sets off by train with her assistant a day behind.<br/>
<br/>
Upon her arrival, however, the mysterious man who summoned her is nowhere to be found. Her assistant never arrives. A stubborn landowner refuses access to the barrow, and the locals are wary of this woman who is traveling alone and (gasp!) wears trousers.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The excavation of Hob’s Barrow is off to a rocky start. And then Thomasina starts having strange dreams…</strong></p>

      <title>September will bring the melee focused Steam Bash Bash event</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3330988721845691320" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Steam Bash Bash event will be going live between September 19 and September 26. This particular event is more of a violent one with the focus on hack and slash, spectacle fighters and whatever games focus on some form of melee fighting hence the bash bash.</p>
<p>This isn't just another little genre-focused sale event though, it's going to be a little more like Next Fest it appears with sections for unreleased games and demos to get their own bit in the spotlight too.</p>
<p>Looks like this time it's invite-only by Valve too, as Valve will be reaching out to developers about it as long as they have the Steamworks permission "Receive Steamworks Communication" set.</p>
<p>Valve list various criteria for games and those that are primarily thought of as one of these types: Character Action Games, Spectacle Fighter, Hack-and-Slash and Musou. Games must have melee combat as the "primary game mechanic" too and Valve said they typically have some of these too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>RPG elements</li>
<li>Third-person gameplay</li>
<li>Fast-paced combat</li>
<li>Swordplay, shooting, etc.</li>
<li>Tracked combat combos or a visual representation of damage being dealt</li>
<li>Character moveset/weapon customization</li>
<li>Score/ranking system </li>
</ul>

      <title>Cancelled space sim Limit Theory opens up the source code</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Limit Theory was a once very promising looking space sim that was funded on Kickstarter. Sadly the developer cancelled it but now as promised they've <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshparnell/limit-theory-an-infinite-procedural-space-game/posts/3564318" target="_blank">opened up</a> the source code. Most of the code is under the "The Unlicense", which is OSI approved so it is properly open source too.</p>
<p>Why did it all end though? Well after multiple years in development, back in 2018 the developer put a post on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshparnell/limit-theory-an-infinite-procedural-space-game/posts/2270873" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> mentioning how they were out of funding and out of energy for the project as a whole. They also underestimated the sheer amount of work that would go into making such a big space sim.</p>
<p>It's a shame it never got finished but open sourcing was the right thing to do, since other people helped to fund it.</p>
<p>As an example of what it could have been, the developer did plenty of videos on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/LimitTheory/videos" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel showing off various stages of progress on it. The below video is the last one they put out on it:</p>

      <title>Terminal-based game inspired by Pokémon gets a big upgrade with audio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pokete is a game we introduced you too recently that's inspired by Pokémon but you play it in a terminal. A new release is out bringing some nice advancements.</p>
<p>A big one for version 0.8.0 is the addition of audio and it's suitably retro and fits right in with the theme too. Really helps bring the game to life just that little bit more. Easy to run too, with an AppImage included with the release that you can just drop into a terminal and get going.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15111054061658919676gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15111054061658919676gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4481361791658919675gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4481361791658919675gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the highlights from the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added audio</li>
<li>Removed pynput as a dependency on windows</li>
<li>A lot of spelling and grammar fixes</li>
<li>Fixed Poketes not beeing freeable</li>
<li>Added some game ballancing</li>
<li>Trainers can now obtain more than one Pokete</li>
<li>Made run away random</li>
<li>Added remappable controls</li>
<li>Save location is now based on XDG dirs, no intervention needed</li>
<li>Added quick attacks using <code class="inline-code">yzcv</code> so the attackamenu can be skipped</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can grab it free from <a href="https://github.com/lxgr-linux/pokete" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>VRChat adds Easy Anti-Cheat, community not happy but Linux and Steam Deck work fine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite the name, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/438100/VRChat/" target="_blank">VRChat</a> is not a VR-only space and it's incredibly popular. Recently though, they added in Easy Anti-Cheat and the community is currently very unhappy with it.</p>
<p>Why does such a social space need anti-cheat though? As they said in their <a href="https://hello.vrchat.com/blog/vrchat-security-update" target="_blank">announcement</a> modified clients became a big problem. They allowed users to "attack and harass others" which caused endless moderation problems. Plus, they explained that every month "thousands" of people have their accounts stolen due to these modified clients. So it is a big issue.</p>
<p>The downside is that some big features that a lot of people enjoyed have been lost, since no modified clients can be run, and some people can't play at all due to it. The developer said addressing those concerns is their "highest priority" and they're moving around their roadmap for it.</p>
<p>Since Easy Anti-Cheat supports Linux, the developers ensured and tested it working for Proton and Steam Deck so there should be no issues continuing to run it. As they said in their blog post announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1658767962113_13675">
<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p><strong>Does this prevent people from playing VRChat on platforms like SteamOS on the Steam Deck? What about Linux via Proton?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No,</strong> we’ve tested this! EAC works fine on these platforms. Thanks to Valve and the Proton team for all their hard work.</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly they've hit a nerve with the community though, as it's now getting review-bombed on Steam with the most recent user reviews hitting Overwhelmingly Negative.</p>

      <title>Total War: Warhammer III cautiously builds upon a tried and true formula</title>
      <author>BTRE</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest entry in the Total War franchise was ported by Feral Interactive over to Linux last month. After spending a good chunk of time commanding armies and bringing chaos to the land, I have a few thoughts to share.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GcG6dVTsv1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e18024e573ceb21d904fd7d83ceb0447.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GcG6dVTsv1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Key provided by Feral Interactive</p>
<p>For those of you who might be unaware, the mouthful-of-a-name Total War: Warhammer III is the third entry in the crossover over franchises of the strategic Total War games with the setting of Warhammer Fantasy. It sees players picking between various races and factions and fighting for supremacy, either trying to save or covet the power of an imprisoned and dying god. The game mixes a strategic turn-based layer where armies are recruited and directed, cities conquered or sacked, with real-time battles where hundreds of units might be pitted against one another.</p>
<p>I’ve played a great deal of the Total War series over the years and the core formula remains more or less unchanged. The developers have gotten good at polishing the heart of things and so, even at the game’s worst, it never fails to be at least somewhat entertaining. Effort has been made in this latest entry to add unique mechanics to every faction, mainly choices that can be made every couple of turns that allow for some sort of strategic advantage or boost to units or cities. The technology trees are unique and, often, there might even be different ways to approach city construction and income generation.</p>
<p>The bloodthirsty demons of Khorne may, for example, raze a settlement upon capture, spawning a smaller army from the chaos that can then go on to cause more mayhem before dissipating a couple of turns later. They then have a chance to expand into depopulated settlements automatically, so long as they own another settlement in the region. If not, they can use their unique secondary currency, skulls, to create a settlement. These same skulls are gained from battle or by razing cities and are spent on technologies or to perform special rites that gain the player the favor of Khorne.</p>
<p>Another faction, Grand Cathay, is a Warhammer Fantasy's answer to the Chinese Empire and incorporates a mechanic of harmony between yin and yang, providing bonuses if your empire keeps the elements balanced. Units, buildings and commanders all are either one or the other and some building chains are mutually exclusive. So keeping an eye on the overall situation of your empire is a must. Additionally, trade caravans may be sent to far-off cities, taking several turns to reach their destination and liable to events and possible battles by hostile factions that attack it. If the caravan reaches its destination, a large return on the invested gold is given to the player.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how these base factions are all different, given that previous titles only really reserved these more obvious differences for the DLC factions that were added in a steady trickle after launch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12957111751658715083gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12957111751658715083gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Most of these bells and whistles are found in the singleplayer campaign, the real heart of the game. Every faction essentially competes with one another to reach the dying bear-god Ursun before it dies. While there’s a simplified diplomacy and trade system, by and large interactions with factions will inevitably end with war. To break up the usual map-painting and territory-conquering, every couple of turns portals that lead to the realm of the Chaos Gods open on the map. Factions may then venture forth in order to claim a Daemon Prince’s soul from each god, navigating the hazards of each realm in the process.</p>
<p>I think that this is a particularly good innovation compared to the previous titles, as it’s easier for the AI to keep up with the player throughout the campaign. I had to keep an eye on AI opponents’ progress and be mindful of balancing my expansion; if my main army was too far away from a portal at the wrong time it could mean the difference between snatching a soul before the AI or not. In two of my campaigns, an AI faction got all four souls before of me. I was still able to eventually win, however, as armies can be intercepted before they reach the site of the final campaign battle. Defeating a faction leader makes them lose their collected souls, and so I was able to buy myself a little time and make it myself before Ursun finally succumbed.</p>
<p>The downside to this more focused advancement is, however, that every faction’s win condition is more or less the same. The pre-scripted battles in the Chaos Realms as well as the final battle are a little underwhelming if you do them more than once. There are some faction-specific quests and expansion targets, along with some unique buildings that can be built in specific towns—if conquered—but that does little to offset the general focus. Overall, I’d take this more precise approach over the slogs that characterized the first two titles.</p>
<p>Unit rosters are fairly varied between factions, with some favoring ranged units, cavalry, special abilities, hit and run tactics and all the other things that are, by now, standard to Total War games. There ‘s still some room for experimentation within your faction’s roster, with a few alternative units and heroes potentially emphasizing certain thematic aspects of the faction more than others. For example, Kislev’s infantry tend to also have some ranged capabilities that can either be a basis for a flexible core of all-rounders or be used as distractions for powerful cavalry and ice witches to really do a lot of damage. As units unlock towards the end game, there’s still often good reason to use more basic units in your army as well, thanks to unlocked technologies and bonuses given by commanders.</p>
<p>That said, not every faction is equal. While it’s less obvious in the singleplayer campaign, during single battles with the AI or in multiplayer, these disparities become more obvious. Despite a few patches addressing balance issues, things aren’t quite all there yet. The fact remains that some factions are less competitive than others. Especially when it comes to auto-resolving combat which, again, has been addressed with patches, but still can be needlessly harsh. In a long campaign this can mean a few more hours spent winning relatively-unimportant battles manually in order to preserve the strength of your carefully-recruited armies.</p>
<p>The battle AI itself remains on par with other Total War titles. In other words, it can win against a weaker player but it is usually tactically incompetent. It is easy to flank units, bait it and otherwise apply basic counters to (usual) numerical superiority. The most interesting types of battles came about when trying to hold off a far-flung outpost against a surprise attack using only garrison troops. Part of this is due to the asymmetry but also due to the new siege battle system which allows defenders to place their own obstacles and structures according to available resources. The longer the siege (or with certain technologies unlocked), the more toys defenders will potentially be able to set. It’s a nice novelty but one that ultimately becomes less and less thrilling over the course of a campaign, let alone multiple ones.</p>

<p>Visually, I think that Total War: Warhammer III is generally nice to look at. The Chaos Realms are very unique and have lots of little details and animations that are worth appreciating. Other areas of the map are likewise vibrant, with their own landmarks and special features. But, sadly, all of that gets relatively little opportunity to shine. Because the main conflict will be between the various Chaos factions in the northern, icy wasteland and others, the battlefields tend to repeat themselves a lot. I couldn’t begin to tell you just how many times I fought on similar-looking snow-capped hills or in dead borderlands.</p>
<p>To be fair, this is true to the lore of Warhammer Fantasy. Still, given the ostentatiously colorful lizardmen of the previous entry with their jungle environs, the green and messy orks in the badlands or the cool dead civilization of the desert tomb lords, I can’t help but feel that fighting in predominantly icy areas for most of the game is comparatively bland. It is only in far-flung areas on the periphery of the map—where there is little reason to expand and fight—that jungle, forest, badlands and other areas can be found. An average playthrough will see little-to-no player involvement in those places as you'll be too busy dealing with the AI and the Chaos Realms to send expeditions there.</p>
<p>This particular complaint is already set to be addressed soon. The upcoming Immortal Empires update is expected the be released into beta next month and will combine the map and factions of previous games into a sort of mega campaign. Owners of previous titles will get access to this new campaign along with other free content. It’s something to be excited about and I look forward to seeing how all the disparate factions will alter the feel of the game.</p>
<p>On the technical front, Feral’s Linux port is a solid affair. It easily outperforms the Proton version of the game across the board. The difference is smallest at higher graphical settings (likely due to bottlenecking from my own hardware) but I noticed higher minimums and more higher, and more consistent, frame rates with the port. My aging RX 480 was able to hit a 60 FPS target on both the campaign map and in battles using a mix of settings, mostly in the mid range. Cranking up certain details or options short of ‘ultra’ still provided a very playable experience that staying above 30 FPS. I should also note that the Linux port also has an FSR option that’s not found in the Windows version, allowing players on older hardware to sacrifice a little visual fidelity for higher performance.</p>
<p>There are a pair of very notable drawbacks to the Linux port, however. First and most noticeable is the lack of cross-platform multiplayer. Those playing the port will be unable to play with Windows users. So if you’re into the more competitive multiplayer side of the Total War fandom, it might be best to stick with playing the game via Proton.</p>
<p>Secondly, patches are likely to be delayed for the port. Shortly after the port’s release, the game got its 1.3 update which had a few important balance and quality-of-life changes. It took several weeks for that patch, and a few hotfixes, to make it to the Linux side of things. Given that it was much the same for older releases done by Feral, I would expect that it might be a long while before Linux gamers get their hands on the hotly-anticipated Immortal Empires patch with its expanded campaign and map.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I think that Total War: Warhammer III is a fine game that is likely to get even better with time. It might stay a little close to the tried and true formula for my tastes but the things that are new, such as the Chaos Realms, are welcome attempts to shake things up a little. Elsewhere, it's pretty much just the usual Total War fare. I’m willing to overlook the weak battle AI because the general experience of trying to survive and thrive amidst the challenges from all directions is compelling enough to provide satisfaction upon the completion of a hard-fought campaign. But others might not be so generous and more hardcore players might be put off by the lack of progress on that front. Still, if it's any consolation, there is already a vibrant mod scene. The usual difficulty and balance mods, quality-of-life improvements, and ambitious overhauls and player expansions can be found in the workshop.</p>
<p>With big changes only a month away, it might be prudent to wait until then before hopping into the game for the first time. No doubt large balance changes will follow, as well the usual additional free content that Creative Assembly is known to include with big updates.</p>

      <title>DIMENSIONAL SLAUGHTER is an absolutely wild sounding fast-paced retro shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have the need for speed and love a good retro first-person shooter? DIMENSIONAL SLAUGHTER is what you should take a look at.</p>
<p>The developer calls it a "movement shooter" that has taken " the best parts of what makes both modern and retro shooters such as DOOM ETERNAL and QUAKE fun, then sticks them in a blender with fast paced Rogue-Like progression and Perma-Death, leaving for an even more intense experience with absolutely NO space for filler". I know that description will certainly pull in a few eyes. There's also "no intrusive story", it's all about the gibs.</p>
<p>It seems to do a few curious things like sending you through different dimensions with different enemies, and a unique weapon for each area. In a way, the way you progress sounds perhaps a bit like Risk of Rain 2 but the order of the areas you go is randomized. Why is it a movement shooter then? Well, everything is fast as hell and ammunition is a reward for moving around so you have to stay on your toes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v7DaHlI6uZk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3db3b504d91563eb5ac571a7b1360c96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v7DaHlI6uZk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's definitely not the prettiest around but I'm sure the action will make plenty of FPS fans happy.</p>
<p>The system requirements are mildly amusing too noting it needs "Sound Card: LOUDEST POSSIBLE DAMMIT", and on the macOS side "Additional Notes: shouldn't have bought a mac" — ouch.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2086060/DIMENSIONAL_SLAUGHTER/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>hexceed is a free hexagonal Minesweeper out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new relaxing puzzle game that doesn't require guesswork? Recently hexceed gained a Native Linux port. While the main game is completely free, it does have paid DLC which includes a ton of extra content. The main game has a Very Positive review score on Steam so looks like another quality game to add to your collection.</p>
<p>The Linux port was noted in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1463920/view/3399672421079102870" target="_blank">news post</a>, which also went over another DLC pack that went up adding over 100 new levels to play through. I don't think the gameplay needs much explaining really, it's just an interesting small twist on the well-known mechanics of Minesweeper but looks worth a go.</p>

      <title>Free and open source multiplayer voxel RPG &#39;Veloren&#39; version 0.13 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking more promising than ever, the in-development free and open source RPG <a href="https://veloren.net/" target="_blank">Veloren</a> has a big new release out. A fully original open source game although it does take inspiration from Cube World, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20014498271658760226gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of what's new in this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modular weapons</li>
<li>Real-time weather: rain, wind, thunder, lightning</li>
<li>Cliff towns</li>
<li>Interconnected cave networks with cave biomes</li>
<li>LoD trees (looks more visually interesting far-off)</li>
<li>More character customisation options</li>
<li>NPC personalities</li>
<li>Loot ownership for drops from mining</li>
<li>New ambience sounds</li>
<li>Slider for ambience volume</li>
<li>+ Loads more</li>
</ul>
<p>Good to see it continue to advance. It's properly playable, although a lot of the work currently is still going into the technical implementations of all the features so it's not quite a proper game yet, still somewhat fun to go exploring in though.</p>

      <title>Slay the Princess is an upcoming choice-driven psychological horror visual novel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Tabby Games have just announced Slay the Princess. It's a choice-driven psychological horror visual novel / dating sim with dramatic branching, light RPG elements and hand-penciled art. This is the same developer who created Scarlet Hollow, a popular episodic visual novel.</p>
<p>I found Scarlet Hollow to be pretty great so it's nice to see the developer do more, and with Native Linux support again. See the new reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RByDoYQpFa8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6705218599bf8407c1d6cad9042962b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RByDoYQpFa8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A princess.</strong> She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.</li>
<li><strong>No, the Princess isn't a cosmic horror.</strong> She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.</li>
<li><strong>Don't even think about trying to romance her.</strong> It won't end well for you.</li>
<li><strong>Hopefully you won't die.</strong> But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!</li>
<li>Time loops <strong>No time loops.</strong> Don't be ridiculous. Time is a strictly linear concept and it certainly doesn't "loop," whatever that's supposed to mean.</li>
<li><strong>A branching narrative</strong> where what you say and what you believe determines both your build and how the story unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>A new roleplaying experience from the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/" target="_blank">Scarlet Hollow</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fully voice-acted</strong> by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Looks like upcoming brawler MultiVersus works great on Steam Deck &amp; Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/" target="_blank">MultiVersus</a> is a very exciting one that has a lot of people talking right now. It's a brawler much like Smash Bros made by Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games and it's already looking pretty great.</p>
<p>You can currently get a key by watching one hour of it on Twitch, if the streamer has drops enabled or buy buying a Founder pack. Or, just wait until July 26th when it goes into Open Beta. I managed to get a key to take a look, and it seems out of the box it just works with Proton.</p>
<p>Why are people so excited about it? Well, Smash Bros has a huge fanbase and people have been wanting something properly <em>popular</em> like this on PC for a while, plus you have a roster of rather fun characters included in this like Shaggy that appears to power up like he's in Dragon Ball — what's not to love? Since it will be free to play, there's no barrier to entry either.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WSmayHK7Nl4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13be42bdd800d8fab9b471efb1dd1b70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WSmayHK7Nl4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One thing I did notice when testing it on my Fedora Linux desktop with an Xbox controller, was to turn off Steam Configuration support in the Big Picture settings for Xbox controllers, otherwise the game wouldn't detect it. Apart from that, on desktop Linux it works great too.</p>

      <title>GameMode performance tool from Feral Interactive version 1.7 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" target="_blank">GameMode</a>, the system optimization tool from Feral Interactive recently had a new small release put up.</p>
<p>What does it do? When you run games with it the tool can do things like tweak the CPU governor for performance, change the I/O priority, process niceness, kernel scheduler, inhibit the screensaver, set your GPU into performance mode, allows custom scripts and so on. The point is that it can in a lot of cases ensure you're giving a game as much power as possible but it doesn't always work so well.</p>
<p>Version 1.7 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added new utility: <code class="inline-code">gamemodelist</code> to show running processes using it</li>
<li>Run executables from <code class="inline-code">PATH</code> instead of <code class="inline-code">/usr/bin</code> to work across more distributions</li>
<li>Add a trivial <code class="inline-code">gamemode.conf</code> file, which creates the gamemode group to help control permissions</li>
<li>Various minor bugfixes and updates to documentation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once installed to run it on specific games with Steam, all you would need to do is add this as a launch option for example:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gamemoderun %command%</code></p>
<p>Or for standalone games:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gamemoderun ./game</code></p>

      <title>You can now get Halo Infinite online to work on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's taken quite a while but you can at least now play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240440/Halo_Infinite/" target="_blank">Halo Infinite</a> multiplayer on Steam Deck (single-player not tested). This is all unofficial right now, so try it at your own risk.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest updates to <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> and the latest Steam Deck Beta (the <u>Preview</u> branch), you can get it to work. If you need to know how to install GE-Proton on Steam Deck, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">follow this guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the main steps to get it working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opt into the Steam Deck Preview</li>
<li>In desktop mode: download GE-Proton 7-26 using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">linked guide</a></li>
<li>Open Halo Infinite local files and delete or rename the "videos" folder</li>
<li>Set Halo Infinite to use GE-Proton7-26. Open Halo Infinite in your Steam Library and click the little Cog Icon -&gt; Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that's all done, online play with Halo Infinite on Steam Deck should just work. There's still a few lingering issues though like some audio stutter plus some textures can flash a bit but it's quite playable overall. Here's a video of the steps needed plus the settings used and some rough footage:</p>

      <title>Ex-Zodiac is a fast-paced 3D rail shooter inspired by the likes of Star Fox out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love classic 90s rail shooters like Star Fox? You should take a look at Ex-Zodiac, which just hit Early Access. Built in Godot Engine it comes with Native Linux support right away and it's looking good, it also works great on the Steam Deck too and feels like a really good fit there.</p>
<p>"Ex-Zodiac is a fast-paced rail shooter with a stylized look reminiscent of early 90's 3D games. Join protagonist Kyuu as she fights to free the worlds of the Sanzaru Star System, overrun by the intergalactic terrorist organization known as Zodiac."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I5wDKWydhjs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5fbb82c0676fd1803d614100d31b5265.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I5wDKWydhjs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style</li>
<li>6 main levels and 6 bonus levels currently (more than 12 will be available after full release)</li>
<li>Major bosses at the end of each level, each piloted by a member of the Zodiac</li>
<li>A 16-bit style soundtrack by +TEK combining FM and wavetable synthesis</li>
<li>Barrel rolls</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, I've been having a lot of fun with it. Firmly bringing back memories of playing classics like it on Sega Mega Drive, Nintendo 64 and others around that sort of time. Some of the boss battles can be quite a challenge, as is getting used to the way the ship moves all around the screen with the camera focus continue forwards. The presentation is simply wonderful too!</p>
<p>Some footage recorded on the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lMWQc1aDq94"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e849f92459718db6b05702dd6bef21d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lMWQc1aDq94" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer thinks it will remain in Early Access for 1 year with plenty more content to come yet.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1249480/ExZodiac/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>System76 gives the Oryx Pro laptop a powerful refresh</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a really powerful laptop with top-tier Linux support? System76 has <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/oryx" target="_blank">refreshed the Oryx Pro</a> and here's all the details.</p>
<p>This is their popular flagship NVIDIA graphics laptop that now sports a new 12th Gen Intel Core processor with the i7-12700H giving an impressive 14 cores with 20 threads. Not only that, you're also getting an open source friendly laptop too since System76 continue to support their open firmware and open source embedded controller firmware. The graphics options have been bumped up too from the previous having an RTX 3070 or 3080, users can now configure the Oryx Pro with an RTX 3070 Ti or 3080 Ti graphics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For gamers, Protondb.com is a helpful resource for double-checking Steam game compatibility, and add the ProtonUp-Qt application to expand compatibility for your game library with Proton-GE.

      <title>Dell XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition gets certified for Ubuntu 22.04</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out for a new laptop and perhaps the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/initial-thoughts-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> didn't take your fancy? Well now the <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13-plus-laptop/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/ctox13w11p1c4001u" target="_blank">Dell XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition</a> has been properly certified for Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p>Canonical announced the update today on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/dell-xps-13-plus-developer-edition-now-certified-with-ubuntu-22-04-lts" target="_blank">their blog</a>, noting that the roll-out will begin in August for those who want the up to date experience on solid hardware. As Canonical also <a href="https://ubuntu.com/certified/laptops?q=&amp;limit=20&amp;release=22.04+LTS" target="_blank">showed</a>, this is the first mainstream hardware to be certified for Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p>While anyone can download Ubuntu (and other distributions) and attempt to run them on various devices, the point of the official certification is so that Canonical can ensure "that all of the components in a certified computer work as expected, so the user can be sure of the best experience out of the box". Of course, buying one with Linux pre-loaded like this also shows there's a market for more.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21 Beta now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux Mint team are gearing up for another major release with Linux Mint 21 now available in Beta to download.</p>
<p>This is their next long-term support release, so you'll be able to continue running it until 2027 thanks to it being based upon Ubuntu 22.04. You will get Linux Kernel 5.15 and depending on which edition you go for Cinnamon 5.4, MATE 1.26 or Xfce 4.16.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8421569051658404427gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8421569051658404427gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Quite a lot is new with this release, especially with the Cinnamon desktop environment which had a huge change to the window manager to be based on a much more modern version of Mutter. Their last fork was 11 years ago, so a lot has changed in that time. Their priority has been to make them as close as possible, which should enable them to do more upgrades earlier in future.</p>
<p>They've also ported over the display settings from Gnome, plus plenty of theme tweaks to make applications match with the GTK theme.</p>
<p>Some of the other major changes includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A switch from Blueberry to Blueman for Bluetooth</li>
<li>New Xapp project called xapp-thumbnailers, providing thumbnails for many more file types</li>
<li>Upgrades to the Sticky Notes application</li>
<li>A process monitor to inform you when automated tasks are happening that might slow your PC down</li>
<li>Webp support was added to xviewer and thumbnailers.</li>
<li>The WebApp manager supports additional browsers and custom browser parameters.</li>
<li>In Software Sources, the repository list, PPA list and key list support multiple selection. This allows several items to be removed at a time.</li>
<li>Mint now uses IPP (Driverless Printing and Scanning)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus lots more.</p>

      <title>Mojang say no to NFTs and blockchain with Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hey look, some good news about NFTs for once! Mojang has put out a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-and-nfts" target="_blank">new guide</a> on the rules surrounding NFTs and blockchain.</p>
<p>You've probably seen the ridiculous amount of scams when it comes to NFTs especially, and companies using the "blockchain" when they have absolutely no need for it. Thankfully, Mojang have listened and put out some rules and the gist is that "integrations of NFTs with Minecraft are generally not something we will support or allow" they said.</p>
<p>Their news post goes over a brief intro to what NFTs actually are and giving a brief overview of why they have rules for server owners and content creators, which in brief is to "ensure that Minecraft remains a community where everyone has access to the same content". Part of the problem is how NFTs "create models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with our Guidelines and the spirit of Minecraft".</p>
<p>Mojang make their position firmly clear on it all stating that "As such, to ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our Minecraft client and server applications nor may they be utilized to create NFTs associated with any in-game content, including worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods.".</p>
<p>This is good, because it should hopefully prevent another Blockverse, which was supposed to be a "on-chain Ethereum NFT that enables a unique P2E on Minecraft". Can you guess how it went? They took a lot of money and then <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/unofficial-minecraft-nft-game-blockverse-disappears-with-more-than-dollar1m/" target="_blank">vanished</a> with it.</p>
<p>However, they're not ruling out using blockchain in Minecraft if it might "allow for more secure experiences or other practical and inclusive applications in gaming" but they currently have no plans for it right now.</p>

      <title>GOverlay for configuring the MangoHud performance overlay new release out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud is a great performance overlay for Linux, one that's used on the Steam Deck too and GOverlay helps you configure it really easily. A new release is out with GOverlay 0.9. The developer mentioned this release was due for a while but they ended up catching COVID, lost access to their GitHub and more but it's here now.</p>
<p>GOverlay isn't just for MangoHud though, it can also help you set up the vulkan post processing layer vkBasalt and the quick video replay tool ReplaySorcery too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5132959381658400493gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5132959381658400493gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new in version 0.9:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Added frame_count option to display the number of frames since start</li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Added GPU throttling option to show if GPU is throttling based on Power, current, temp or "other" (Only shows if throttling is currently happening)</li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Selected quick layout button will keep the active color</li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Added Option to run vkcube with Gamescope in the Hamburguer menu</li>
<li>FIX: Removed Breeze theme dependency/style. GUI will use the current system theme but it is optimised for Breeze (QT) and Adwaita (GTK) themes.</li>
<li>FIX: Mangohud - Driverversion wasn't selected on the complete quick layout</li>
<li>FIX: Mangohud - Displayed Kernelversion will update automatically now (not attached to a text file anymore)</li>
<li>FIX: Mangohud - Notifications didn't expire, now they are transient</li>
<li>FIX: VKbasalt - Changed menu icon to standart hamburguer menu</li>
<li>FIX: Vkbasalt , replaysorcery - Display wrong hint message from the mangohud toolbox</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/releases/tag/0.9" target="_blank">download from GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Vulkan Beta Driver 515.49.10 out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released a fresh upgrade to their special developer-focused <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Drivers</a> with version 515.49.10.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Restored old shader disk cache behavior to remain enabled even if the app uses its own pipeline cache</li>
<li>Fixed issue with optimized graphics pipeline library final link using the wrong shaders</li>
<li>Fixed issue with some fp16 shader operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open-gpu-kernel-modules release:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.10" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.10</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the new Vulkan extension supported the description of it from the official docs reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness</code> allows users to request robustness on a per-pipeline stage basis.</p>
<p>As <code class="inline-code"><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-robustBufferAccess" target="_blank">robustBufferAccess</a></code> and other robustness features may have an adverse effect on performance, this extension is designed to allow users to request robust behavior only where it may be needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Reminder: This special Vulkan beta driver is where all the shiny new stuff goes in before making its way into the stable release for everyone. Really, it's mostly aimed at developers and serious enthusiasts. Unless you need what's in them, it's generally best to use the stable drivers.</p>
<p>The newest stable versions of the main NVIDIA driver for Linux are at<a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/190425/en-uk" target="_blank"> NVIDIA 515.57 </a> released on June 28, 2022 from their "Production Branch" series or<a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/184432/en-uk" target="_blank"> 495.46 </a>released on December 13, 2021 from their "New Feature" series. Confused? It's a lot of numbers to remember but both Production and New Feature series are fine for normal use.</p>

      <title>Unreal Engine 5 editor quietly gets a proper Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm not entirely sure when this went live but it appears that Epic Games have finally released a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux" target="_blank">full proper download</a> of Unreal Engine for Linux developers. Seems a lot of people noticed only today, although the page mentions the build was released Jul 12 - 2022, with GOL getting messages about it everywhere so it seems like a fair few find this quite exciting.</p>
<p>Previously, to use Unreal Engine on Linux you would need to compile it yourself from the source but now that's no longer the case. To get it you need to have accepted their EULA and be logged in with an Epic Account, once done it will offer up the ~20GB download to get you going but it mentions needing ~60GB for the full thing. Additionally, it seems their main supported Linux distribution is Ubuntu 22.04 although it appears to run just fine on Fedora 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13301450491658347635gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13301450491658347635gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see more of the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine/" target="_blank">Linux requirements here</a>.</p>
<p>Considering all the issues with Unity lately from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/unity-to-merge-with-ironsource-with-a-buzzword-salad-press-release/" target="_blank">joining with ironSource</a>, their CEO <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/interview/79190/unity-ironsource-john-riccitiello-marc-whitten-merger/" target="_blank">calling some</a> game developers "fucking idiots" and when that made the news that same CEO said on <a href="https://twitter.com/johnriccitiello/status/1547734634590392322" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it was "Clickbait" only to then later <a href="https://twitter.com/johnriccitiello/status/1548326529217679365" target="_blank">apologise</a>, this might be a good time for Epic Games to push their way through to pull in even more developers into their ecosystem.</p>
<p>So much great news for Linux gaming and even Linux game development lately, it's nice to see so many moving parts.</p>

      <title>Classic inspired brawler Pulling No Punches arrives on August 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for more beat 'em up action? Pulling No Punches from developer BrainDead Broccoli is confirmed to be launching on August 10 along with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>"The game follows the fictional story of a global pandemic that engulfed the world and is being ignored by fanatics who do not believe that the disease is real. It is up to the main characters, 4 common citizens adequately protected with gloves and masks, to deal with these fanatics and solve the situation with the force of their own fists."</p>
<p>To get an idea of the gameplay you can see the below trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-mZV01C-4rA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef8aafe5e46c7b0b4876681f8f9c7190.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-mZV01C-4rA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They do have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgGlPul3Y9w" target="_blank">release date trailer</a> that's a bit newer, but due to age-restrictions you can only view it on YouTube directly. It's been in development for 2 years now and the release follows a crowdfunding campaign on the Brazillion platform <a href="https://www.catarse.me/punhosderepudio" target="_blank">Catarse</a> where they pulled in around £8,194 (around $9,816) some time ago. At release they said it will be available for $9.90.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy it on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1425760/Pulling_No_Punches/" target="_blank">Steam store</a> and there's a demo available.</p>

      <title>Epic Games now supporting the O3D Foundation and Open 3D Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://o3d.foundation/" target="_blank">The O3D Foundation</a>, who oversee the free and open source <a href="https://www.o3de.org/" target="_blank">Open 3D Engine</a>, have announced that Epic Games are now officially one of their supporters. Epic Games has joined as a Premier member joining the likes of Adobe, AWS, Intel, Microsoft and others in supporting their mission to produce a AAA FOSS game engine.</p>
<p>What we don't exactly know, is what being a supporting member actually gives the The O3D Foundation. Unlike other projects, they don't list the kind of expected resources these companies give over. What we do know at least from this one is that Marc Petit, VP of Unreal Engine Ecosystem at Epic Games, will join the O3DF’s Governing Board.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The metaverse will require companies to work together to advance open standards and open source tools, and we believe the Open 3D Foundation will play an important role in this journey,” said Petit. “With shared standards for interoperability, we’re giving creators more freedom and flexibility to build interactive 3D content using the tools they’re most comfortable with, and to bring those amazing experiences to life in Unreal Engine and across other 3D engines.”</p>
<p>“We applaud Epic Game’s commitment to the open source community and welcome them into the Open 3D Foundation as our newest Premier member, underscoring our mission in championing the deep integration of open source with commercial solutions to accelerate growth in a sustainable, balanced ecosystem that fuels the flywheel of success and innovation,” said Royal O'Brien, Executive Director of Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. “It’s truly exciting to see how the industry is responding to the real-time 3D needs of content creators around the globe, providing them with best-of-breed tools.”</p>

      <title>Visit a new dimension in the Avorion - Into The Rift expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avorion - Into The Rift is a pretty big sounding expansion to the space sandbox game that will arrive in August. This is the second expansion, following on from Black Market released back in 2020. For those who haven't played it, Avorion is a massive space exploration game where you build your ships block by block. Think a little Minecraft in space, plus a touch of Eve Online and you sort of get some of the idea.</p>
<p>For the addon: "In this hardcore add-on you'll explore the mysterious and dangerous Rift dimension. Thanks to new technology, it is now possible to send smaller amounts of mass (i.e. a few ships) into the Rifts. Scientists are now intensively researching these Rifts - and they need your help. Travel into the Rifts and uncover their secrets. Face their dangers, complete research expeditions, and earn powerful new rewards."</p>
<p>A new trailer went live recently you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ti0X9bIU23w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19da1f5adf447c1e9f570c9bbb8c693c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ti0X9bIU23w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DLC Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a new dimension unlike anything you've seen before in the galaxy.</li>
<li>Prepare your ship accordingly to master the dangerous new environments and uncover the secrets surrounding the origins of the Rifts.</li>
<li>Complete Rift Expeditions for the Rift Research Center, and receive new, powerful hybrid subsystems in return - or simply keep everything you find in the Rifts.</li>
<li>Remember, the deeper you venture into the Rifts, the more lucrative and dangerous they become.</li>
<li>New story campaign.</li>
<li>New captain classes.</li>
<li>+ Loads more</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Avorion on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/avorion?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve warns about Steam Deck temperatures, plus a Deck Beta Update out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put up a bit of a notice / warning recently, one for those of you experiencing a heat wave and trying to game on the Steam Deck might want to keep a note of. Plus a new Steam Deck Beta update.</p>
<p>The official OnDeck Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1549467955754217473" target="_blank">said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For our friends in the midst of a heatwave, a quick note about Steam Deck in high temperatures. Steam Deck performs at its best in ambient temperatures between 0° and 35° C. If the temperature gets higher than this, Steam Deck may start to throttle performance to protect itself.</p>
<p>A bit more detail about this – Steam Deck’s APU runs well at temperatures up to 100°C. At 100°C, it will start to throttle performance, and at 105°C it will shut down. Again, this is to protect itself (and you) from damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do want to know how hot your Deck is running, that's easy enough thanks to the built-in performance overlay. If you hit the Quick Access button (the three dots) and go to the Performance menu (the battery icon) and set the Overlay Level to 3 it will show temperatures for the GPU and CPU like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16078063811658312453gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16078063811658312453gol1.jpg"/></a><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/run-around-a-cyberpunk-city-as-a-lost-cat-in-stray-out-now/" target="_blank">Game Pictured - Stray</a></em></p>
<p>As for the latest Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6272968438254558051" target="_blank">Beta update</a> here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Sucheng (Quick) keyboard for Traditional Chinese (requires Preview channel)</li>
<li>Added Achievements page to overlay (while in-game press Steam button)</li>
<li>Fixed notification for claiming digital rewards firing endlessly for some customers</li>
<li>Fixed Night Mode automatically kicking in, even if the toggle is set to OFF</li>
<li>Fixed desktop mode keyboard sometimes failing to show or dismiss</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There was also a silent Stable Steam Deck update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Stable update channel for the Steam Deck OS has just been updated with a hotfix to enable compatibility with future system and input firmware. It will download an update, but there are no user-visible changes included at this time.</p>

      <title>Run around a cyberpunk city as a lost cat in Stray - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stray, a game about a lost cat in a cyberpunk city, became something of a viral hit even before release. It's out now with a Steam Deck Verified rating from the get go. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Developed by French team BlueTwelve Studio, with this being their debut game they've hit quite a mark with it getting some pretty high scores from various other publications. So once again, it's fantastic to see such a high-profile release working out of the box on Steam Deck and Linux desktop right at release thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>Here's some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7TFpgCZbqsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e6c9f9ccbfd886cb2cd83d9b7d4af75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7TFpgCZbqsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even though it has a Steam Deck Verified rating, the out of the box graphics settings for the Steam Deck aren't the best. I saw quite a number of drops well below 30FPS but after switching a couple of settings down like Textures and Mesh Quality (as shown in the video) it performed well enough. That said, like a lot of bigger 3D games, battery life is really not your friend here. Aside from that, it's a genuinely <em>lovely</em> game and one cat lovers simply must grab. Being able to be a bit mischievous knocking things off high places, and the game actually using that is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>The official bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stray is a third-person cat adventure game set amidst the detailed, neon-lit alleys of a decaying cybercity and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by curious droids and dangerous creatures.<br/>
<br/>
See the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world.<br/>
<br/>
Along the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B-12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out.</p>

      <title>Into the Breach: Advanced Edition update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making a thoroughly difficult yet great strategy game even better, <a href="https://subsetgames.com/itb_ae.html" target="_blank">Into the Breach: Advanced Edition</a> is out now for all owners as a free upgrade. If you love turn-based strategy games, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. I both dread and love it, since it sucks away so much time as I just want another run through when I fail and then it's 2AM.</p>
<p>From the makers of FTL, you help the remnants of human civilization who are being threatened by massive creatures digging their way up through the earth. There's also a little bit of time-travel involved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e8DCsU8MJxE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c97a38e5983b47f8ff39f5c0f2a4fdc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e8DCsU8MJxE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the main bits of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>5 New squads &amp; 15 new squad achievements!</li>
<li>7 new Vek, 3 new Psions, &amp; 10 new boss battles!</li>
<li>12 new missions &amp; 3 new bonus mission goals!</li>
<li>4 New pilots &amp; 10 new random pilot abilities!</li>
<li>39 New weapons &amp; equipment!</li>
<li>2 new music tracks from composer Ben Prunty!</li>
<li>Even more challenging difficulty mode, Unfair Mode!</li>
<li>7 New Languages! (Arabic, Thai, Swedish, Korean, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, and Latin American Spanish)</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Other Changes</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Optional Content Toggles - All of the new content (enemies, pilot skills, etc) other than balance changes are possible to turn off if you would like the base-game content experience.</li>
<li>Weapon reactor usage reduced - We wanted to encourage players to immediately try out equipment they find, so we reduced the reactor power to equip most gear.</li>
<li>Store Changes - Since you can now instantly equip most weapons without needing an additional reactor core, the reputation cost to purchase weapons has increased by 1 and the store options are limited in the first 2 islands.</li>
<li>New weapon mechanic: KO effects - Certain weapons will trigger an additional effect if the primary target is killed by the attack.</li>
<li>New tile mechanic: Cracking - Certain weapons will cause the ground to crack. If the tile is damaged again, it will shatter, destroying the tile and anything standing on it!</li>
<li>New status effect: Boost - This will increase the next attack’s damage by 1. Highly effective for AoE attacks!</li>
<li>Unlocking Squads with Coins Change - The cost of unlocking squads with coins has been reduced to account for the extra squads.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a huge upgrade, especially surprising that it's free when many others would put it into a DLC. Subset Games certainly treat their players well, as they did a similar upgrade for FTL years ago.</p>

      <title>Exanima gets vastly improved Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Exanima is an unforgiving 3D isometric RPG set in an original dark, low fantasy world. Currently in Early Access, it seems the developers have been paying attention to user requests for better Linux and Steam Deck support with Proton.</p>
<p>In the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/362490/view/6277472037877215678" target="_blank">update</a> released on July 17, 2022, the developer noted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the lack of proper support some of you were already using controllers and it's a frequently requested feature. Steam Deck support was also requested and we worked on Proton compatibility, special UI scaling, control schemes and various input and performance optimisations with surprisingly good results.<br/>
<br/>
Exanima is a game that does not naturally lend itself well to controller input, some aspects of interaction by necessity remain cursor based, but we developed dedicated control schemes for all core gameplay and user interface. The game can be played fully on controller and it's quite a fun and different experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the specific changes to help include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck support, performance, UI and control optimisations</li>
<li>Proton and Linux GPU driver compatibility fixes</li>
<li>Full controller support via Steam
	<ul>
<li>Dedicated movement and aiming controls</li>
<li>Feathered object and UI cursor interaction</li>
<li>Full menu and UI navigation and interaction</li>
<li>On screen keyboard support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's really great to see developers of all sizes and genres looking to improve Linux, Proton and Steam Deck support. The Steam Deck continues to be a huge boon for Linux gamers and controller users and hopefully this trend will continue. Curiously, Exanima was actually set as Steam Deck Verified multiple months ago even though it clearly had a number of issues that needed to be resolved so it's another case of a false-positive for the Deck Verified system — but at least now it might be accurate.</p>

      <title>Tesla to demo Steam for more in-car gaming soon using Linux &amp; Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tesla and Steam? It's coming and it sounds like it's progressing nicely with a demo to come soon to show it off.</p>
<p>Something that has been in the works for a while, and we already know their entertainment software uses Linux so it will use the Linux version of Steam. This will also include the Proton compatibility tool for running Windows games as well to enable plenty more gaming in your fancy Tesla.</p>
<p>We actually saw hints of this back in 2021, as Tesla were advertising for "Linux Game Development at Tesla" position which you can see via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211028165545/https://tesla.avature.net/Careers/Jobdetail?jobId=91676" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>. This involved working with "Linux, Mesa, Vulkan, OpenGL, Proton/Lutris, Wine, etc." so it was pretty clear where they were going with it. Add to that Elon Musk said on <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1496245381084200961" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in early 2022 that "We’re working through the general case of making Steam games work on a Tesla vs specific titles. Former is obviously where we should be long-term.".</p>
<p>Just recently on July 16, 2022 again on Twitter, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1548085294188019717" target="_blank">said</a>: "We’re making progress with Steam integration. Demo probably next month.".</p>

      <title>Hot swapping SD Cards on Steam Deck is okay but Valve plans improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a lot of talk about the Steam Deck and SD Cards lately around hot swapping and apparently bricked SD Cards but Valve say it's fine, although improvements are coming.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that, to be blunt, there's a lot of really bad SD Cards out there that will brick themselves and while some may work properly for a while, they can die easily. Sticking with good known-vendors is always worthwhile for them. Valve has done a few upgrades to the Steam Deck and SteamOS to help, like switching to a quick format in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-gets-a-lock-screen-window-switcher-and-more/" target="_blank">warning you</a> if your card isn't what's advertised and more.</p>
<p>You still see scattered reports across Reddit now about SD Cards apparently messing up, and so one user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/w1ah76/kept_seeing_conflicting_info_so_i_asked_valve/" target="_blank">decided to ask</a> Valve Support about hot swapping Micro SD cards and Valve said there that "performing a full shutdown prior to swapping out your SD cards is always best practice" and that you can also "toggle Desktop Mode, and Dolphin file explorer will allow you to eject the SD card before removing it".</p>
<p>However, Valve designer Lawrence Yang said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1548761877462691840" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that "Ejecting and swapping microSD cards while in game mode is safe (not while running a game off the SD card though, of course). We’ll update our support agent messaging around this question." and <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1548854928814198785" target="_blank">another</a> "(Also don’t eject while writing to the microSD card, ie while moving files or downloading a game / update)".</p>
<p>Some updates will come to help though. In reply to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/w21r3i/dont_risk_hotswapping_microsd_cards_my_steam_deck/" target="_blank">post</a> about having a wrong mount-point so it wasn't detected correctly, Yang mentioned on Twitter "Thanks for the report - we'll implement a fix to prevent Deck from mounting to /run/media. We're also looking into adding a software eject button for the SD card just to be extra safe.".</p>

      <title>Relive memories of going to the arcade in Point Rescue Arcade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Point Rescue Arcade is a game that very much leans into the experience you might have had when going to a real Arcade, grabbing a big gun and sticking in some coins.</p>
<p>Developed by Magellanic Games LTD, who some might know from their various games released on <a href="https://magellanicgames.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a> over the last few years. I've quite a fan of their retro approach, having played a few of their previous games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/office-point-rescue-out-the-office-is-a-wonderful-homage-to-retro-shooters/" target="_blank">Office Point Rescue - Out the Office</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Point Rescue Arcade hearkens back to light gun shooters of the 90's. Bright, chunky graphics and fast mindless action. Uncover the dodgy dealings of City 2 through various missions in a variety of bright and colourful environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Retro graphics</li>
<li>Body based hit detection and enemy reactions</li>
<li>Dynamic mode where you improve your weapons and each play through offers different levels.</li>
<li>Multiple weapons</li>
<li>Amateur voice acting</li>

      <title>Dead Cells has an exciting roadmap ahead as it&#39;s far from finished</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells is the absolutely brilliant game from Motion Twin and Evil Empire. A rogue-lite, metroidvania inspired, action-platformer and it's not finished, far from it. The developers have just recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/3346754034231946658" target="_blank">revealed</a> a roadmap, that mentions how 2023 will be the "most exciting year in Dead Cells' history" which is a pretty bold claim.</p>
<p>Some players apparently thought the game was near the end after the latest big update and DLC but it's far from it. The developers mention how "we're very much in the mid-life of Dead Cells" so there's plenty yet still to come. Spoilers below on what's to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663054831658218963gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663054831658218963gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So the slightly spoilery info about what's to come includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A panchaku and a new flame head outfit, based on their animated trailers</li>
<li>A ton of rebalancing and a rework of the legendaries system</li>
<li>A Soul Knight weapon and outfit</li>
<li>You'll be able to "pet the pets"</li>
<li>A Boss Rush Arena, where you get to fit all the bosses you've met so far, with plans for different modes</li>
<li>Another updated planned before Christmas but they're keeping it secret</li>
</ul>
<p>You can pick up Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.13 rolled out recently continuing the PE conversion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fashionably late on this one. <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.13" target="_blank">Wine 7.13</a> rolled out just before the weekend rolled in, so here's a quick run down of what's new in this Windows compatibility layer.</p>
<p>This is the compatibility layer that allows you to run various Windows applications and games on Linux (and forms part of Steam Play Proton). Once a year or so, a new stable release is made but the development versions are usually fine to use.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gecko engine updated to version 2.47.3.</li>
<li>USB driver converted to PE.</li>
<li>Some theming improvements.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're getting close to finishing the PE conversion now, which should bring compatibly improvements. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> instead.</p>
<p>For bug fixes they noted problems solved with: The Witcher 3, Photoshop C 2018, CLIP Studio Paint, SnowRunner, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1, Skyrim Legendary Edition, Wizard101, Wireshark and others.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher adds GOG Cloud Saves, Epic Overlay support, anti-cheat helpers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher for Epic Games and GOG on Linux has a huge new Beta release (plus a bug fixes for the stable build) with loads of fancy new features.</p>
<p>Why should you use the Heroic Games Launcher? Well, Epic Games and GOG don't support Linux with their launchers and so playing games from them can be a bit of a nuisance on Linux and Steam Deck. This way you get a handy launcher to keep them nicely up to date. It's free and open source too, so anyone can help improve it!</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta.2" target="_blank">2.4.0 Beta 2</a> release now out it adds in:</p>
<ul>
<li>GOG Cloud Save, which works with Windows games run through Wine / Proton, as GOG doesn't support it for Native Linux games.</li>
<li>Epic Overlay Support.</li>
<li>Support for the Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye Runtimes (for games that have support hooked up). They also list anti-cheat status on game pages supplied by <a href="https://areweanticheatyet.com/" target="_blank">areweanticheatyet.com</a>, although that might not be too accurate.</li>
<li>A new easier way of adding environment variables or wrappers to launch games with.</li>
<li>A way to add a game shortcut directly to Steam (as a Non-Steam Game).</li>
<li>Electron was updated to v19.</li>
<li>Legendary was updated to v0.20.27.</li>
<li>GOGDL was updated to v0.4.</li>
<li>Various other improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of that the stable <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.10" target="_blank">version 2.3.10</a> was also released fixing up a couple of issues.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive gets procedural maps, better gameplay</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is a free and open source science-based game about evolution, currently allowing you to swim around as a little cell and attempt to survive. The latest release brings in some major improvements. It's in Early Access and they have a long way to go before it's a complete game but it's still a really interesting idea, very much like an expanded early-stage version of Spore.</p>
<p>With the latest version they've now added in procedural generation for the map, so each game will be somewhat different now instead of the same each time. This includes new settings like entering a seed to play a specific map, along with multiple other new-game options like a "LAWK" toggle (life as we know it) to be more strict to realism. Swallowing up other cells has also been made much more interesting, a new 3D editor for the macroscopic portion of the Multicellular Stage, the addition of cilia as as placeable organelles, a spawn system revamp and much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3D3u88bSHSc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d661e31faf612fe2008c0018d4a9ee79.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3D3u88bSHSc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the next release they're hoping to continue improving these recently added features, performance improvements and continue expanding the Multicellular Stage prototype along with adding more features to bring the Microbe Stage closer to completion.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development or grab it free with the launcher on <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive-Launcher" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>iFixit have the Steam Deck Fan in stock if you&#39;re in the U.S.</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get rid of the whine that certain models of Steam Deck have with their fan? Good news, at least if you're in the USA, as iFixit have fans in stock.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the problem is that Valve use two different fans in the Steam Deck. One is like a more gentle blower sound, the other gives a thoroughly annoying high-pitch whine. iFixit are the official way to get replacement parts and they now seem to have quite a few <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Miscellanous/Steam-Deck-Fan/IF260-002?o=2" target="_blank">replacement fans</a> in stock for the US.</p>
<p>You can get just the fan for $24.99 or the full kit for $29.99 which comes with Angled Tweezers, Opening Picks and a Precision Bit Driver.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12174723901658138852gol1.jpg"/>Image Credit - iFixit</em></p>
<p>This time at least it seems they have enough stock that it didn't just vanish within an hour or two. They've remained available now for a couple of days so it appears the initial rush to buy replacements fans might be over, or with the newer fan curves and other upgrades Valve has put out for the Steam Deck perhaps it's annoying people less.</p>
<p><em>No word yet on when the fan will be back for the EU, UK and others.</em></p>

      <title>Swirl W@tch is a blindly-vibrant upcoming stealth-action rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sleeper Games have revealed their latest game with Swirl W@tch, a very colourful and bright stealth-action rogue-lite that will release later this year.</p>
<p>Coming with Native Linux support as usual from Sleeper Games, it takes place on an "over-exploited gas giant". You need to fly around and infiltrate industrial installations, evade or eliminate guard ships, commit corporate sabotage and grow the movement to unlock new gear. From what the developer said over email the setting blends a space-shooter with an arcade-style submarine-sim, wrapped up in a rogue-lite gameplay loop of randomized missions.</p>
<p>You can see the first teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2nFGIEiEVBY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ebf9ffb0fd606eb3a0d3d815cc1e6251.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2nFGIEiEVBY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looks like one to watch.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081970/Swirl_Wtch/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>fheroes2 game engine for Heroes of Might and Magic II gets even more AI upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fully playable but they're not done yet. The team behind the Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine reimplementation continue to improve it even further for playing it on modern platforms. This free and open source reimplementation is simply awesome, the best way to play the classic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17538617791658136865gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17538617791658136865gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Version 0.9.17 was released recently with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further audio improvements: add a sound for Freeman's Foundry, fix delays in MIDI music, fix many issues and crashes related to audio</li>
<li>Expand initial Evil Interface to another in-game dialogs and elements</li>
<li>Add huge AI improvements: add Courier role for heroes, AI defend castles more aggressively and hires heroes efficiently</li>
<li>Add ability to change hotkeys within the game</li>
<li>Improve Polish, Ukrainian, French and Norwegian translations</li>
<li>Fix several places related to logic on Adventure Map</li>
<li>Over 40 bugs are fixed since 0.9.16 release</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving a little more information to us over email, one of the developers gave us a longer explanation of the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Audio was significantly improved since the previous release. The team fixed issues with MIDI music playback delays on Adventure Map, multiple possible crashes with audio synchronization, extra sounds appearance in castle's window and etc. Such cases were very rare but nobody likes a buggy game. As a bonus Freeman's Foundry now has its own ambient sound on Adventure Map. Walk your hero nearby it to hear!<br/>
<br/>
"Evil" interface finally got some proper attention. In the original game this type of interface was applied only to a limited number of dialogs. The list of dialogs was expanded and now some windows to have a proper "evil" look.<br/>
<br/>
AI has been greatly enhanced in this release. The team added a new Courier role for AI heroes to focus on supplies delivery for more stronger heroes. AI now is smart enough to use Adventure Spells efficiently and also to estimate the number of needed heroes for the kingdom. Lastly, AI will defend its castle more aggressively instead of leaving them empty and defenseless.<br/>
<br/>
As per many player requests the team added an ability to change hotkeys for in-game events within the game. Now you can set any combinations to improve your gameplay skills.<br/>
<br/>
Besides this the team fixed multiple places with logic on Adventure Map, closed some visual issues with dialogs and improved translation for multiple languages. As usual more than 40 bugs were fixed since the last release.</p>

      <title>AYANEO to have their own AYANEO OS based on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Linux is truly becoming a gaming platform for the masses now, as AYANEO are throwing their hat in the ring with AYANEO OS on their hardware with the AYANEO AIR. While their new <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-air-first-ultra-thin-oled-windows-handheld#/" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a> crowdfunding campaign focuses on it being a Windows handheld, they're also developing their own full Linux distribution for their hardware which will be available to download "in the future".</p>
<p>So that's the Steam Deck with SteamOS, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/gpd-talk-about-cooperating-with-valve-for-steamos-on-their-devices/" target="_blank">GPD looking at SteamOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">OneXPlayer also planning SteamOS</a> and now AYANEO too. Seems like AYANEO OS will go a lot further than SteamOS in some ways though, with built-in ways of finding games across different stores you own. They said it directly supports the Linux version of Steam and they talked about running both Native Linux games and Windows games through Proton too along with other stores and they sound extremely positive about the Linux experience here.</p>
<p>Not only that, it will also have integrations for retro emulation too. A special app store was talked about to download other applications like Spotify, OBS, Firefox, Discord and plenty more (much like SteamOS has access to Flathub).</p>
<p>You can see them talk about it in the below video at around 1:46:30:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eNPF_LdqT6A?rel=0&amp;start=6388"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ed5ed3e411f6742514eab6d7b1e0a86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eNPF_LdqT6A?rel=0&amp;start=6388" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely didn't imagine any of this happening a year ago, did you?</p>

      <title>Slimbook recently refreshed a bunch of their Linux laptops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Summer is getting hot and perhaps you want a new laptop to take somewhere cooler to do a little work and light gaming? Slimbook recently upgraded a bunch of their machines. This is all in addition to the recently announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/slimbook-ready-up-their-amd-ryzen-5700u-powered-kde-slimbook-4-laptop/" target="_blank">KDE Slimbook 4 laptop</a>.</p>
<p>The latest is the <a href="https://slimbook.es/en/executive-en" target="_blank">Executive</a> model which comes with an Intel Core i7-12700H and there's two different models with a 14" and a 16" screen. The smaller of the two comes packed with Intel Irix Xe 4K while the bigger model sports an NVIDIA RTX 3050Ti. That's not the only difference, you also either get the 14" with 2880 x 1800 or 16" with 2560 x 1600 although both are 90 Hz panels with anti-glare included. You also get a minimum of 16GB RAM and a 500GB SSD NVMe drive included.</p>
<p>As for ports there's plenty including 2 x USB-A 3.2 Gen1, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen2 w/video output (DisplayPort 1.4), 1x Thunderbolt 4 w/video output (DisplayPort 1.4a) and PD charge (90W) and 1x HDMI 2.0.</p>
<p>Pricing starts at €1,299 for the 14" model and €1,599 for the 16".</p>
<p>Slimbook also recently upgraded the lower-end but still powerful <a href="https://slimbook.es/en/pro-x-en" target="_blank">Pro X</a> which is an AMD model with the Ryzen 7 5700U that you can get as either a 14" or a 15.6" model both with a 1080p IPS screen. With this you get Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, 8GB RAM on the base model, 250GB SSD NVMe minimum.</p>
<p>For the ports you get 2 x USB 3.1, 1 x USB 3.1 Type C (video out 1.4 &amp; PD Charge), 1 x USB 2.0 and 1 x HDMI 2.0.</p>
<p>On the Pro X, Slimbook say they include their own AMD Controller which enables you to get "full control over your AMD's processor performance and power consumption" along with a "firmware level performance profile (disguised as a BIOS switch) built-in that will let this power efficient U series processor reach the same performance levels from the top tier H series processors".</p>
<p>Pricing for the Pro X starts at €999.95 for 14" and €1,049 for the 15.6".</p>
<p>Looks like there's plenty of options nowadays for people after a new laptop that fully supports Linux!</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Yars: Recharged marks a return of the 1982 Atari 2600 classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari continue to get their classics revamped and remade for modern audiences, with the latest being Yars: Recharged that's a reimagining of the 1982 Atari 2600 classic and best-seller Yars' Revenge in partnership with Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox the same teams behind Gravitar: Recharged and Breakout: Recharged.</p>
<p>"Yars: Recharged thrusts players to the center of a daring attack against the enemy homeworld, guarded by mechanical hives that pulse deadly cannons and emit flurries of swirling missiles. Find pockets of safety amongst the hail of incoming fire, and then dart forward in daring forays to chip away at the enemy's defenses. Gather enough energy by destroying enemy shields to power up the massively destructive Zorlon cannon, pulsing searing blasts of cosmic energy and annihilating enemies. Yars: Recharged challenges players to remain acutely aware of visual and audio cues that hint at impending danger, and master the smooth flying controls as they navigate increasingly complex levels."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arcade mode: Boss rush of 30 enemies. It’s not endless, but it’s VERY difficult to get to the end of this mode. Three hits and you die, but don’t worry, that hit-count resets when moving to the next fight.</li>
<li>Missions: 30 unique, challenging bosses and only one life to beat each. Like Gravitar: Recharged, there’s one global leaderboard for mission mode, so you need to be on your game. Bosses pose a challenge, so you will need to take them head on with a barrage of bullets or start with the smaller, Minor Cores first and work your way to the boss.</li>
<li>Power-Ups: Minor Cores will drop power-ups when attached. Shoot in all directions at once, rapid fire, explosive shots, or fire a railgun – the nature of the power up is tied to the nature of the core that dropped it.</li>
<li>Co-op: Yars: Recharged is a local co-op game in both arcade and mission mode, a big change from the original and a ton of fun for you and a friend.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019990/Yars_Recharged/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>. It releases on August 23rd.</p>

      <title>Wine manager Bottles default runner now based on Valve&#39;s Wine fork and Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bottles is a thoroughly great application for managing Windows applications and games on Linux. It's fast moving and a <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release-2022.7.14/" target="_blank">new release</a> is out with their new default runner called Soda, which is based on Valve's fork of Wine and Proton patches.</p>
<p>The problem was their previous runner called Caffe was based directly on Wine and moved with its updates. Given how often Wine updates, it introduced plenty of regressions so this is their attempt to provide a more stable experience. Soda actually takes Valve's Wine fork, Proton patches and updates from TKG and GE too. So it's a big mixture of things that should hopefully make running games with Bottles easier. As for the name Soda, they say "we think it will be a sparkling experience".</p>
<p>A new experimental feature added with this release is sandboxing per-Bottle. The idea is to restrict the environment and hopefully be more secure and stable with it using flatpak-spawn when Bottles is installed as Flatpak and bubblewrap for all other formats.</p>
<p>There's also a new UI for installers that looks a lot cleaner and clearer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10272487691657794397gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10272487691657794397gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>You also get a nice status bar along with info on what it's actually doing when setting up these apps.</em></p>
<p>More integrations have arrived with support for the Ubisoft Connect launcher. If you turn it on, it will list games you have installed directly in the Bottles application. They also worked to continue to improve the Library view, performance improvements, various fixes, improvements to the Epic Store integration which they say can now use "using Cloud Sync and Anti cheat", improved translations and so on.</p>

      <title>Armello removes advertising Linux and macOS support due to their party system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Armello, a grim fairy-tale board game from League of Geeks no longer advertises that it supports Linux and macOS due to their new party system that landed with the cross-play update.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/290340/view/3319732436466228376" target="_blank">news post</a> they mention how there's "No Party Functionality (including Private Games) on MacOSX &amp; native Linux. Due to the severity of this one, we've removed any advertising of support for Linux &amp; Mac from Steam (and shortly Humble Bundle), though folks can still purchase and play those versions.".</p>
<p>Giving a little more detail on their <a href="https://armello.com/partysupport/" target="_blank">official site</a> it mentions how "The service provider we use for Armello’s multiplayer infrastructure has decided to cease support for their party services on MacOSX and Linux. Unfortunately, this means that Party Functionality, including Private Multiplayer, is no longer available in Armello on MacOSX and native Linux platforms." but they don't go on to name whatever company that is.</p>
<p>For the Native Linux and macOS versions, they're still functional and up to date they just don't have the new party system or private matches. For Linux users though you can use Proton to run the Windows version, which fully works. It also has a Steam Deck Playable rating, which uses Proton now too.</p>
<p><em>This isn't the only game to go a similar route, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/ark-survival-evolved-switches-away-from-linux-native-to-use-proton/" target="_blank">ARK: Survival Evolved</a> recently putting the Linux Native version behind a Beta.</em></p>

      <title>GPD talk about &#39;cooperating&#39; with Valve for SteamOS on their devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GPD, the company behind many portable devices like the upcoming GPD WIN Max 2, made a claim about "cooperating" with Valve to get SteamOS working on their hardware. This is the same GPD that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gpd-are-getting-quite-desperate-against-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">blocked us on Twitter</a>, after we confronted them about pinching videos that didn't belong to them.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-max-2-handheld-gaming-pc-4g-lte-amd-6800u#/" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a> crowdfunding campaign for the GPD WIN Max 2, which will be powered by a either a AMD Ryzen 7 6800U or an Intel 12th gen Core i7-1260P, they were asked in the discussions section if they had plans to integrate it with SteamOS. The two replies they gave officially are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Appreciate for your support! As earlier of March this year, Valve contacted us about cooperation proposal. But for this cooperation, Valve needs to match the appropriate Steam OS system for our 6800U handheld.We need to provide the device to Valve official, and Valve also has to improve the Steam OS system for the 6800U handheld, this process may take half year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your support! Yes, Valve has contacted us to consult if we are interested in the built-in Steam OS system, they can promote our products on the Steam official website, we will agree to this cooperation, we think this cooperation will be the best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Can't link to them directly, as IndieGoGo doesn't have direct-comment links but <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1940741661657732335gol1.png" target="_blank">here's a shot</a> I took. </em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IZjdouksgng"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/88eac53b5a0ad51b3b61908215bfdbef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IZjdouksgng" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I reached out to Valve, and today they replied and sent over a statement that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're excited to eventually make SteamOS available for all devices, including handheld PCs manufactured by other companies. The team is still working on finalizing SteamOS, and we don't have anything else to announce today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't exactly breaking news by itself, since we already knew for a long time that Valve planned to release SteamOS fully to the public and so of course other hardware vendors would be able to use it too. However, GPD are clearly planned to do something with SteamOS on their devices much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">OneXPlayer are also planning</a> to do.</p>

      <title>Unity to &#39;merge&#39; with ironSource with a buzzword salad press release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unity Technologies, the company behind ridiculously popular proprietary game engine Unity has announced a merger with another company called ironSource which is raising some eyebrows.</p>
<p>The first thing is that Unity has been acquiring a few other companies, but this time their wording is completely different with it being a "merger". Problem is, we don't know what that really means for Unity or game developers as their <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-ironsource" target="_blank">press release</a> was one of the biggest jumbles of technobabble buzzwords I've ever read. With this coming not long after Unity <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/unity-layoffs-game-engine" target="_blank">just sent</a> hundreds of their staff packing, it's likely not going to be received too well.</p>
<p>For those who don't know ironSource, they were behind a piece of software called installCore, an installer that bundled other apps with it. Basically, it was one of those horrible pieces of tech that looked like a proper official installer but it was pretty-much nasty adware / malware and ended up getting a poor reputation (as it was abused) and started getting blocked by Microsoft and others. It's no longer around but it does make the deal between Unity and ironSource look a bit odd. Don't take my word for it either, there's plenty of articles out there about how bad it was, a basic search for "installcore malware" and similar gives lots of details on it (<a href="https://www.benedelman.org/news-021815/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://blog.infostruction.com/2018/10/26/adware-empire-ironsource-and-installcore/" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-giving-up-its-cash-cow-paved-ironsources-way-to-nyse-1001376256" target="_blank">#3</a>).</p>
<p>I do wonder what this means for the future of Unity. If you're a game developer, maybe it's time to consider a free and open source kit like <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Just a thought.</p>

<p>As a reminder: you can upgrade the version of DXVK used in Proton, without waiting on a new release. To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of DXVK 1.10.2. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. Do so at your own risk but it's usually harmless. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>It&#39;s possible to run Doom inside of Doom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've all seen how Doom has become one of the ways people test electronics, the whole "I got Doom to run on x" but this is something else. Running Doom inside of Doom, Doomception here we come.</p>
<p>YouTuber kgsws managed to find a code execution exploit in the original DOS version of Doom 2. As they noted it's a good thing it only works with the DOS version "as you don't want code execution exploit on modern systems" since it would open up some unfortunate issues. Here though, it means you can run Doom inside of Doom and even Heretic too.</p>
<p>Completely ridiculous of course but it's a very interesting, although very technical video. A fun point is that they're doing all this on Linux too. Not only that, they built a little cinema for it in Doom and you can even control the full game inside. This honestly blows my mind a little.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c6hnQ1RKhbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8ba27b2ad5ed96c348388181e4b63cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c6hnQ1RKhbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The modder has put the source code up on <a href="https://github.com/kgsws/doom-in-doom" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for anyone interested in trying it.</p>
<p>For a bit of extra fun, I decided to see how easy it would be getting it running on a Steam Deck and it turns out it was amazingly simple. Just a case of downloading the release zip file, extracting it and putting the contents into the same folder as the DOOM2.exe file. Then you can just edit the "doom2.conf" and "doom2m.conf" files to add "-file kgdid.wad" to the end of the line where doom2.exe is listed and then it will run with the Steam release.</p>
<p>Here's just a quick take on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Devs are discovering the Steam Deck is good for making games too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Part of the power of the Steam Deck is that not only is it a great portable for gaming, it's Linux and has a full desktop mode and so you can also create games with it.</p>
<p>There's a ton of game engines out there that support Linux natively including Godot Engine, Unity, Unreal, Defold, GDevelop and the list just goes on and on. Game Maker too, although they only officially support Ubuntu right now and it's in Beta.</p>
<p>YouTuber Taranasus Videos decided to actually attempt to build a game on the Steam Deck and play it on there. Obviously to do this you really would need to hook it up to a monitor, with a mouse and keyboard but the point is that it's absolutely possible to do. Not only that, it gives developers a pretty good baseline for what to optimize against too. The idea has Valve excited too, with designer Lawrence Yang mentioning on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1545846717915926528" target="_blank">Twitter</a> "Hey look, game development on Steam Deck, no other PC required! This is one of the things we were really excited about enabling with Steam Deck, and it’s awesome to see folks already getting their feet wet.".</p>
<p>Really fun to see things like this, how you can just download a game engine onto a Steam Deck and get going.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tGJmQreOJgk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a070da0023dcab6000b20b0a17ac80d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tGJmQreOJgk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if we see plenty more of this. We've all seen how devices like the RaspberryPi opened up a new world to people, seems like the Steam Deck could too.</p>

      <title>System76 announce the 67% Launch Lite keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have revealed the Launch Lite, a smaller version of their rather fancy and highly customizable keyboard that will properly launch for ordering tomorrow.</p>
<p>Featuring the same fancy tricks as the bigger Launch keyboard like custom multi-layer layouts, solid aluminum chassis, RGB LED patterns, magnetic angle bar and secure open source firmware. The difference of course is the size. This is a 67% keyboard and doesn't have the USB hub integrated so overall it's a bit more portable.</p>
<p>You will be able to customize the layout with the updated System76 Keyboard Configurator application allowing you to set 4 different layers, LED patterns and more with it all saved directly to the keyboard so you can take the layout with you anywhere to any system.</p>
<p>System76 say the Launch Lite comes with a "key and switch puller, as well as a few extra essential keys (Esc, Shift, arrows) in different sizes and accent colors" and in addition to the Jade and Royal switches you can also pick it up with either Silent Pink or Silent Brown switches. Additionally, the newer switch options will also be available for the bigger Launch keyboard too!</p>

      <title>43 of the Top 50 most highly-reviewed Steam games are Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently I went over the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/73-of-the-top-100-most-popular-steam-games-are-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">top 100 most-played games</a> on Steam by player count but what about the most highly rated games on Steam? Here's how the top 50 most positively reviewed Steam games work on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Making use of the wonderful <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">Steam 250</a> website, taking a snapshot of the titles listed on July 12, here's what you can expect to see on Steam Deck and 99% will work fine on Linux desktops too of course, since the Steam Deck is powered by Linux. For the rating, I'm sticking to Valve's official Deck Verified position for now. As a reminder though, there are quite a few that are <em>Playable</em> or <em>Unsupported</em> that really do work fine. For desktop Linux users, the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating was added too (if it's not Native) which goes Platinum - Gold - Silver - Bronze - Unsupported.</p>
<p><strong>The Numbers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>29 Verified</li>
<li>14 Playable</li>
<li>3 Unsupported</li>
<li>4 Unchecked</li>
</ul>

<p>Another interesting thing I noticed only recently, the Steam Top 250 website also has a dedicated <a href="https://steam250.com/steam_deck_verified" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified section</a> for the top 250 titles there too. That's pretty great.</p>

      <title>Valve gives the Discovery Queue a makeover to help you find your next game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Discovery Queue is a feature that many people probably miss or just don't use. I use it from time to time but it was a little basic. Valve has put live the next <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/labs/" target="_blank">Steam Labs experiment</a> to overhaul Discovery Queue.</p>
<p>With the Discovery Queue the idea is that Valve picks a bunch of games based on your interests, then you click through to see if something grabs you. It is a wonderful idea but it definitely was in need of a facelift for sure.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of their changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Launch into the queue without leaving the page you are on</li>
<li>Simplified presentation of key details about each game to give you a taste of what that game is about</li>
<li>See why each game is being recommended specifically to you; maybe it's because you have friends who play it, or it's similar to other games you play, for example</li>
<li>Add a game to your wishlist with the click of a button or view the game's full store page for a more in-depth view</li>
<li>Ignore games that just aren't your jam. We'll make sure to hide them in the future.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also plan to add in future a new display on the Steam homepage, the ability to launch it from any store page, layout optimizations for different screen sizes and full support for the Steam Deck gamepad UI too.</p>

      <title>Veil of Dust: A Homesteading Game arrives for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Veil of Dust: A Homesteading Game is a story-driven historically-grounded homesteading game about finding your way after loss inspired by games like Don't Starve and Stardew Valley with a healthy sprinkle of fantasy elements too. Just recently they had a Native Linux version released on Steam.</p>
<p>"Veil of Dust: A Homesteading Game is an environmental exploration of what comes after devastating loss. Survive in a sparse landscape and find new meaning through your adventures. Make peace with the past and forge a new future by building relationships, creating a new home, and discovering a world beyond the veil."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z4rS2c_B1wg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a8f3e1d9bd66870f90d541493969fee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z4rS2c_B1wg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like quite an expansive game in terms of features. Filled full of farming, foraging and hunting but then you also have the relationships side of it, a cooking system, crafting and much more. The story sounds pretty interesting too with the blending of historical with fantastical. More about that below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our protgonists' relationship is simultaneously a rock to both of them and a source of conflict, as chaos and circumstance tests the roles laid down by their personalities, birth order, and restrictive 1860s gender roles. Shane, the older brother, is trying to be true to the directive his late father left - protect your sister from those who would find her magic frightening enough to do her harm. Áine, the younger sister, is trying to be her own person and shoulder some of the burden with her remarkable abilities. Will they come to support one another with their unique talents, or will the sudden appearance of ferocious monsters push them to the breaking point?</p>

      <title>Among Us modding on Steam Deck is quite easy here&#39;s a quick guide</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Among Us works quite nicely on the Steam Deck but what about if you want to get some mods going? It's actually surprisingly easy to do so here's how to do it.</p>
<p>The problem is that often games designed for Windows need certain adjustments done to work in Proton, and that's the case here although it's a single extra step and rather easy to do. Focusing on the <a href="https://docs.bepinex.dev/index.html" target="_blank">BepInEx</a> framework, with the example mod of The Other Roles in the below video I go over all the steps needed to get it working. The text guide is below the video.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5vGUqyvOUgM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07c29be13965f6757a15c1d1c91b7f45.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5vGUqyvOUgM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide, which applies to Linux Desktop too:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add this as a launch option for Among Us: <code class="inline-code">WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%</code></li>
<li>Open the Local Files, where it's installed</li>
<li>Here you <em>may</em> want to make a backup, so you can replace if needed with the original default experience</li>
<li>Head to <a href="https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles" target="_blank">The Other Roles page</a> on GitHub, to the Releases section and download TheOtherRoles.zip</li>
<li>Extract the zip file, and copy the insides into your Among Us installed folder</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically for Steam Deck, you will want to setup Steam Input to have the Right Trackpad as a Mouse, and set Right Trackpad click as a Left Mouse Button. Otherwise, you won't able to access the extra menu items some mods like The Other Roles add into the UI.</p>
<p>Step number 1 will be needed for any mod using the BepInEx framework. You could use Proton Tricks on desktop to set it, but that never seemed to save properly on Steam Deck and simply setting a launch option is actually much simpler to do.</p>

      <title>Tiny Tina&#39;s Wonderlands out on Steam, appears to work well on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands from Gearbox has now launched on Steam with its Epic Exclusive period now over and it's looking pretty good on Steam Deck and Linux desktops. <u>Note</u>: 2K sent over a key.</p>
<p>Curiously though, the game on desktop Linux at least won't play the videos with Proton 7 or Proton Experimental so you see a test-screen instead but they do work just fine on the Steam Deck. So for desktop Linux, you're going to need GE-Proton for now (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">guide here</a>). Apart from that, it all seems to work just fine on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>However, one big missing feature for the Steam release are cloud saves. So you will not be able to sync characters easily from one system to another. This feels like a really big thing to miss now, especially with the Steam Deck gaining more popularity and just — backups in case your system fails.</p>
<p>A look at it across Steam Deck and Fedora:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D3ObJNrBay0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c1d588b84ba06d27068b96e711d8ee1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D3ObJNrBay0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Steam Deck, setting into into the Medium preset with FSR 2 set to Balanced and the screen locked to 40Hz seems to give a pretty good experience. There's the usual drops and slight stutter when it's loading something new but other than that it's fine. Meanwhile on desktop I've been testing the High preset with no noteworthy performance issues encountered there.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/tiny-tinas-wonderlands?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1286680/Tiny_Tinas_Wonderlands/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO announce the Pulse 15 second-gen laptop with AMD Ryzen 7 5700U 35W</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The second-generation TUXEDO Pulse 15 is up for pre-order with shipping expected in late July, which comes with the powerful AMD Ryzen 7 5700U that TUXEDO have pushed up to 35w.</p>
<p>TUXEDO claim their Pulse 15 is one of the "most popular Linux notebooks on the market", so they made sure to keep that crown and bump up the performance quite a lot with their changes to the model in the second-gen. Coming with the Ryzen 7 5700U, which AMD state should run at 10-25W, TUXEDO did something a little more unique here pushing what's possible with the chip.</p>
<p>Not only have they bumped up the wattage to give solid performance, they're also keeping it quiet and cool with 2 fans and 2 heat pipes, which they say most vendors have only 1 of each. The result should be cool surface temps and low fan noise under full load without throttling.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8319202881657537126gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8319202881657537126gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Main Specifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>15.6 inch WQHD IPS Display (2560 x 1440 | 165 Hz)</li>
<li>Very lightweight and thin magnesium chassis</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 5700U-35W (TDP: 35 Watt!)</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 Graphics</li>
<li>91 Wh Lithium-Polymer battery</li>
<li>USB-C (Power-Delivery | DisplayPort 1.4) &amp; HDMI 2.0</li>
<li>Max. 64 GB DDR4 RAM (Dual Channel)</li>
<li>2x M.2 SSD PCIe NVMe &amp; SATAIII</li>
<li>Backlit keyboard with TUX super-key</li>
<li>3x USB-A ports (2x USB 3.2 Gen2, 1x USB 2.0), LAN RJ45, a Micro SD card reader</li>
</ul>
<p>With a base price of €1,149.</p>
<p>My criticism here continues though, why do vendors keep sticking in such a low amount of RAM with obviously power-focused machines? Realistically, if you're going for such a machine, you're going to up the RAM to 16 GB minimum which brings the price up to €1,194.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TUXEDO Computers works with barebone manufacturers for its Linux notebooks and PCs, optimizing them to run flawlessly with Linux through driver and firmware adaptions, extensive "reverse engineering" and testing, as well as in-house software development, cloud services and Linux customer support.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 2 mod FIREFIGHT RELOADED gets a Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FIREFIGHT RELOADED is a Half-Life 2 mod that gives you fast-paced horde-mode FPS gameplay with a ton of customizations and features inspired by other Source Engine mods.</p>
<p>Just recently on July 8th the developers put up a Native Linux version of the game that's ready for some more testing. It's not advertised on Steam just yet outside the announcement, as they continue work to improve it. One known issue is that the "Killfeed" doesn't show up properly, and they suggest <em>not</em> using the Flatpak version of Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17034576651657536246gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17034576651657536246gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<li>Blends in gameplay elements inspired by other Source mods, like kicking, aiming down sights, bullettime and more.</li>
<li>Players can customize almost everything about the game, from changing how enemy spawners work to how much speed the player walks at.</li>
<li>Endless horde mode-style gameplay.</li>
<li>Fight vicious enemies from the past, present and future such as Bullsquids, Houndeyes, Hunters, the Cremator and the Combine Female Assassin, along with new encounters such as the Combine Ace.</li>
<li>A variety of weapons from a Crowbar to a OICW, along with the ability to add in up to 30 custom weapons.</li>
<li>A in-game store that allows you to buy weapons, ammo, and supplies with in-game currency that you get by killing hordes of enemies.</li>
<li>A brutal gore system that allows you to shred enemies with your Shotgun and RPG.</li>
<li>A whole host of add-ons and custom content created by other players on the Steam Workshop.</li>
<li>Free regular updates which add new content and features to the mod.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Play it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397680/FIREFIGHT_RELOADED" target="_blank">free on Steam</a> (as long as you own Half-Life 2).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You need to opt into the "endgame-beta" to get access to the Linux version.</p>

      <title>Stray is the most wishlisted Steam game and it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the release of Stray on July 19th, Stray has become the most wishlisted game on Steam and it has been fully Steam Deck Verified. Good news for Steam Deck fans and Linux desktop gamers, since it should work great on both.</p>
<p>Stray has been doing headlines for quite some time since the initial trailer that was shown by Sony, as it will be coming to the PlayStation 5 too. The Steam release is what we're interested in though of course and the publisher Annapurna Interactive noted on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/A_i/status/1545198497376284672" target="_blank">Twitter</a> the Steam Deck compatibility. This is great to see for multiple reasons though, not only being Steam Deck Verified but the publisher and developer ensuring it's done <strong>before</strong> release. Hopefully more will do the same.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fOm_9N9ksBY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5cbe7e355da5fa40114eb2781162df44.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fOm_9N9ksBY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Stray is a third-person cat adventure game set amidst the detailed, neon-lit alleys of a decaying cybercity and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by curious droids and dangerous creatures.</p>
<p>See the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world."</p>
<p>You can pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. I'll be taking a look at how it runs at release.</p>

      <title>Point and lick adventure Nine Noir Lives releases September 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cat lovers and adventure game aficionados alike may want to keep an eye on this one, as the point and lick (get it?) game Nine Noir Lives releases September 7 along with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Taking a heavy dose of inspiration from classic film noir, Shakespeare and what they say is the "absurdist comedy style of writer and director Taika Waititi", it sounds like we're in for a bit of a treat with this one. While comedy-based, they do say it does follow a serious subject matter too so my curiosity is piqued. However, curiosity killed the cat as they say, so good job we have nine lives huh?</p>
<p>"In Nine Noir Lives, players will take on the role of Cuddles Nutterbutter, a feline private investigator with a taste for solving crime… literally. Cuddles will poke, talk, and lick his way through his toughest investigation yet: a murder case that threatens to upset the tenuous relationship between the paw-erful Montameeuw and Catulet crime families. Along the way, players will interact with dozens of fully-voiced characters, beautifully hand-drawn scenes, and devious puzzles to answer the most important question of all: how many things need to be licked to solve a murder in this town?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PAqKUfJEZA0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20e2a4d0195a932c5dc7998a3fdd29a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PAqKUfJEZA0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play through a charming comedy-noir storyline inspired by every cat ever, with fewer cat puns than you might expurrct.</li>
<li>Explore the unique and intriguing city of Meow Meow Furrington across over eighty attractive, hand-drawn screens.</li>
<li>Interact with over twenty-five hilarious characters.</li>
<li>Discover a whole new dimension to everything in the game by using your wits tongue. Lick first, and ask questions later. Questions like "what did you <em>expect</em> that to taste like, Cuddles?"</li>
<li>Experience the city from two very different perspectives as you switch between Cuddles and his capable assistant, Tabby Marshmallow.</li>
<li>Laugh and learn about the world of Furth with over a hundred thousand thousand words of fully-voiced dialogue.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles both fun and fiendish - but never unfair.</li>
</ul>

      <title>ARK: Survival Evolved switches away from Linux Native to use Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You wouldn't know this looking at the Steam page for ARK: Survival Evolved but Studio Wildcard have now put their Native Linux version behind a Beta on Steam as they now prefer Linux users to play with the Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>They didn't announce this change on Steam, instead leaving it somewhat hidden on their <a href="https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/664670-report-steam-proton-issues-accessing-the-legacy-native-linux-version-of-ark/" target="_blank">official forum post</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Proton has been enabled by default on ARK: Survival Evolved for Steam Linux players, include complete BattlEye support. If you are experiencing any issues with the Proton version of the game, please let us know in this thread and we'll work with Valve (Steam) to get these resolved as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do, for whatever reason, wish to use their rather poorly supported Native Linux build you can access it by opting into the "linuxnative" Beta on Steam.</p>
<p>Not overly surprising. As someone who followed along ARK ever since release, their Native Linux version always had a ridiculous amount of issues and they never seemed to pay much attention to it at all. In this case, it has been preferable for quite some time to just play it through Proton anyway. Given the time and resources Valve puts into Proton, and Studio Wildcard ensuring the BattlEye anti-cheat works, it's a far better experience.</p>
<p>ARK was Steam Deck Verified some time ago, which was also using the Windows version run through Proton which you can see some footage of mine on below:</p>

      <title>Dicey Dungeons &#39;Reunion&#39; is a huge free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dicey Dungeons Reunion is a big free update for the brilliant dice-rolling dungeon crawler and it's out now. With lots of new content, it's going to suck you right back in to get rolling. A deck-builder that's like no other, Dicey Dungeons has you build up your abilities through the card system and then you roll the dice during battles to activate them. It's pretty darn clever and easily one of my favourites.</p>
<p>This major new update adds in six new episodes (one for each character), new music, new artwork, new equipment and plenty of new gameplay.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fVsWXAAccVg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a33a9ea2cbe6048fca33aa942607c4ec.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fVsWXAAccVg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Six wildly different playable classes: Warrior, Thief, Robot, Jester, Inventor and Witch.</li>
<li>Dozens of enemies, ranging from Vacuum Cleaners that want to suck your blood, to creatures from Irish mythology, to suave malevolent snowmen.</li>
<li>A catchy, upbeat and energetic soundtrack by Chipzel (previously, the musician from Super Hexagon).</li>
<li>Beautiful and adorable artwork by Marlowe Dobbe.</li>
<li>Procedurally generated for endless play-throughs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I certainly know what I'm playing through again this weekend…</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets a big update with Valve back in action</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Valve are really back in action on updating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, with a fresh update out now and it's quite big compared to previous patches.</p>
<p>As the bot problem continues on, Valve previously said on the official TF2 <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank">Twitter</a> "TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things." and this is the third update released since then.</p>
<p>Thanks to the updates, the popularity of TF2 has exploded on Steam once again with it regularly seeing over 130,000 online playing together, although it's probable a good portion are bots and bot makers trying to get around the latest changes.</p>
<p>Here's what landed in the July 7th patch:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Several fixes to address exploits and stability issues</li>
<li>Added a game server setting, "net_chan_limit_msec", which allows server operators to limit amount of processing time the game server can spend on processing packets for each client per tick. Clients that send packets causing server CPU processing time to exceed configured number of milliseconds will be kicked from the game server.</li>
<li>Added a game server setting, "net_chan_stats_dump" which, when enabled, will dump statistics of each network channel when that network channel is closed. Statistics include messages, bandwidth, and CPU processing time breakdown.</li>
<li>Added a game server setting, "tf_fall_damage_disablespread", to disable random fall damage (default: 0)</li>
<li>Fixed not being able to adjust the offset for a cosmetic item's Unusual effect</li>
<li>Fixed some players seeing [unknown] for their player name</li>
<li>Fixed broken transparency on cosmetics</li>
<li>Fixed lag compensation when melee-ing teammates</li>
<li>Fixed not being able to hit a player's hitbox if it extends outside the player's bounding box during an animation</li>

      <title>Void Scrappers is an upcoming space horde shooter inspired by Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors has basically reignited the horde shooter genre now right? Developer 8BitSkull (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/fates-of-ort-is-an-rpg-where-time-stops-until-you-move-its-absolutely-great-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank">Fates of Ort</a>) has announced their next game with Void Scrappers.</p>
<p>They said it is inspired by Vampire Survivors but clearly they're going their own way with it. This isn't just another auto-attacking horde shooter, they've blasted off into space like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/uh-oh-gunlocked-is-like-vampire-survivors-in-space-and-just-as-absorbing/" target="_blank">Gunlocked</a>. However, unlike Gunlocked this isn't a vertical scrolling-shooter as it gives you a proper arena to fly around in.</p>
<p>"Blast hordes of alien ships into junk. Collect the scrap to upgrade your ship into an unstoppable force of destruction. Unlock new characters and weapons and upgrade your stats between runs.</p>
<p>Collect scrap dropped by your defeated enemies. Use it to upgrade your ship until it becomes unstoppable. Fight and destroy bosses and grab the weapons they drop. Blast hordes of aliens with various projectiles, explosions and kinetic orbitals. Unlock new characters with unique abilities and new weapon and upgrade types. Permanently upgrade your ship stats in between runs."</p>

<p>Just like their previous game Fates of Ort, they do plan full Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta gets scaling for external displays, new &#34;Preview&#34; testing branch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of goodies have arrived in a fresh Steam Deck Client Beta, along with a small update to SteamOS 3.3 Beta too.</p>
<p>Valve continued to improve how the Deck handles external displays, as they work towards getting the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-delay-the-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">delayed official Dock</a> ready to release. I think it's pretty clear the software just wasn't ready, and there's not a whole lot of point in them releasing it officially when there's still so many issues when docking but this is a good step forwards. You also no longer pick a different update channel for the Client and the OS, with the options being unified now into one.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the Steam Deck Client Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3323108691081569180" target="_blank">released July 7th</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an option to scale the Steam Deck user interface for external displays</li>
<li>Added a toggle for automatic scaling of the Steam Deck user interface for external displays</li>
<li>Added a scheduled night mode feature, allowing players to choose if and when they’d like night mode to automatically turn on</li>
<li>Added a Japanese (Kana) keyboard option</li>
<li>Added a new Steam Deck software update channel selector – there are now three option
	<ul>
<li>Stable: Recommended experience for most users. This option will install the latest stable Steam Client and SteamOS.</li>
<li>Beta  Testing for new Steam features. Updates frequently. This option will install Steam Client Beta and the latest stable SteamOS.</li>
<li>Preview: Testing for new Steam and system-level features. Updates frequently. You may encounter issues. This option will install Steam Client Beta and the SteamOS Beta.</li>
<li>You will only see patch notes for the update channel you've selected. As this feature is in Beta, if you opt into the Stable channel, you will not see this selector anymore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Korean keyboard user experience</li>
<li>Improved Adaptive Brightness slider user experience</li>
<li>Fixed flatpak Chrome closing improperly when quit through Steam</li>
<li>Fixed on-screen keyboard showing up under the Steam or Quick Access menu</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1545201445716185090" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that the SteamOS 3.3 Beta had a small update that reverted the new built-in controller driver, plus there's a fix for a long-standing crash for Red Dead Redemption 2 when using Vulkan. The Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3410929607716145819/" target="_blank">forum post</a> mentions the controller driver is waiting on an issue with firmware updates being resolved.</p>
<p>Here's a quick run over what's new:</p>

      <title>Expansive open world country-life sim The Ranchers gets funded in less than a day</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Ranchers from French developer RedPilz Studio is a very promising looking open world country-life sim, which will be coming with Native Linux support and optimized for the Steam Deck. It recently launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redpilzstudio/the-ranchers/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with it seeing the full funding in less than a day so clearly there's plenty of people out there wanting more farming life sims.</p>
<p>With the developer being inspired by various games like Harvest Moon, The Sims, GTA, Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing they wanted to combine their many mechanics and parts they found fun into a modern game that "pushes all the boundaries of the classics" and so The Ranchers was started.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OMqDwzgYB04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6bc506d39636fce91b0542bd80bed15a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OMqDwzgYB04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to play completely offline in solo, or you can team up with four players total online to do some ranching with others in co-op. You'll be able to explore a village, buy vehicles like cars, trucks and yachts and explore a huge open world filled full of mines, shipwrecks, uncharted islands and the occasional monster encounter too. Then you add in all the main mechanics of farming, fishing, sports and much more.</p>
<p>Seems it's been quite popular on Steam too, with it getting over 225,000 wishlists.</p>
<p>I spoke with the developer, who confirmed their full Linux support plans which will happen quickly after the Windows release if they don't make it on day-1. The Kickstarter campaign additionally confirms their intention to ensure it's optimized nicely for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can help fund it on Kickstarter and follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501310/The_Ranchers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>JSAUX are filling the Steam Deck accessory gap and have a Docking Station ready</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want some accessories for your Steam Deck? Well JSAUX recently put out their Docking Station, along with some other goodies for you to look into.</p>
<p>They have two models available with the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-docking-station" target="_blank">Docking Station for Steam Deck</a> and the newer and more expensive <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Upgraded Docking Station for Steam Deck</a> which come with plenty of ports available. The main difference between the two appears to be the upgraded version having three USB 3 ports and Gigbit Ethernet, with the original having two USB 2 ports and slower Ethernet. Both also have a 4K@60Hz HDMI 2.0 output too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8902082371657203148gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8902082371657203148gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It of course also supports power delivery at 100W max, which is plenty to charge and power the Steam Deck at full speed.</p>
<p>Seems like it might be worth picking up, especially since Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-delay-the-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">delayed</a> the official Steam Deck Dock and we have no idea when they plan to make it available as they haven't said much on it lately.</p>
<p>Additionally JSAUX also sell various other accessories like the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-protective-case" target="_blank">Silicon Protective Case for Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-screen-protector-1" target="_blank">Plain Screen Protectors</a>, <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/printing-screen-protector-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Screen Protectors with a fancy border</a>, a <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-stand-protector" target="_blank">Protective Standing Case</a> and more. Perhaps there might be something you like the look of.</p>
<p>I've been told we're getting some sent over here, so I should be able to take a look at them at some point.</p>

      <title>You should avoid the stock Firefox install on Steam Deck as it&#39;s badly outdated (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I spoke with Valve about the issue and they confirmed change is coming — "Yes, we're aware of the issue and will soon be shipping an update to the SteamOS Beta to address it. After the update, Firefox will be installed as a flatpak, making it easier to keep up to date."</p>
<hr/>
<p>For all the pros of the Steam Deck like the full KDE Plasma desktop mode, there's a bit of a sore spot with Valve being too slow to update some of the included software.</p>
<p>Right now, the version of Firefox that is available on the Steam Deck is stuck at 96.0.3 even if you've opted into the very latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/steamos-33-beta-out-plus-a-steam-deck-client-update/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.3 Beta</a>. This is actually rather important, because web browsers are constantly under attack and new vulnerabilities appear all the time. With this version of Firefox, there's various flaws still present in it.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear why Valve don't just remove the Firefox package included directly in SteamOS, and have the Flatpak version installed instead like they give you the option for with Chrome with their built-in installer that keeps it up to date too.</p>
<p>For now if you want a secure browsing experience on the Steam Deck you should either install and run the Firefox version available via Discover as Flatpak or use Chrome that Valve has an easy installer for either via Discover or through the Non-Steam section in Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve directly about this, will update if / when they reply.</p>
<p>Need help installing software on the Steam Deck? See our guide example video below:</p>
