      <title>AMD announce RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT, plus FSR3 teased</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today at the AMD "together we advance_gaming" event, AMD revealed their new RDNA3 architecture along with the RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT GPUs. Both of these new cards will be available on December 13th, and AMD threw plenty of shade at NVIDIA of the power use and connector issues during the event talking about how "easy" it is to upgrade to it and noting the power use. </p>

<p>They also teased FSR3, which will be due out next year but didn't go into much detail on it. According to AMD FSR3 is "expected to deliver up to 2X more FPS compared to AMD FSR 2 in select games".</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMD RDNA 3 Architecture</strong> – Featuring an advanced chiplet design, new compute units and second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology, AMD RDNA 3 architecture delivers up to 54% more performance per watt than the previous-generation AMD RDNA 2 architecture. New compute units share resources between rendering, AI and raytracing to make the most effective use of each transistor for faster, more efficient performance than the previous generation.</li>
<li><strong>Chiplet Design</strong> – The world’s first gaming GPU with a chiplet design delivers up to 15% higher frequencies at up to 54% better power efficiency. It includes the new 5nm 306mm Graphics Compute Die (GCD) with up to 96 compute units that provide the core GPU functionality. It also includes six of the new 6nm Memory Cache Die (MCD) at 37.5mm, each with up to 16MB of second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology.</li>
<li><strong>Ultra-Fast Chiplet Interconnect </strong>– Unleashing the benefits of second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology, the new chiplets leverage AMD Infinity Links and high-performance fanout packaging to deliver up to 5.3TB/s of bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Memory and Wider Memory Bus </strong>– To meet the growing requirements of today’s demanding titles, the new graphics cards feature up to 24GB of high-speed GDDR6 memory running at 20Gbps over a 384-bit memory bus.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the pricing, they seem like pretty great value to me. Having a flagship under $1K is a very good move when compared to what NVIDIA are offering. If the performance is in any way comparable, it should sell quite well.</p>
<p>From the press release: “These new graphics cards are designed by gamers for gamers. As we were developing the new cards, we not only incorporated feedback from our customers, but we built in the features and capabilities we wanted to use,” said Scott Herkelman, senior vice president &amp; general manager, Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “We also realized that we needed to do something different to continue pushing the envelope of the technology, and I’m proud of what the team has accomplished with AMD RDNA 3 and the Radeon RX 7900 Series graphics cards. I can’t wait for gamers to experience the powerhouse performance, incredibly vivid visuals and amazing new features these new graphics cards offer.”</p>
<p>Full event can be seen below:</p>

<p>Also, it's still fun to see the Steam Deck picture on such events. AMD made the APU so it's only natural for them to highlight it but nice to see it again like this for a device that's helping to do so much for Linux gaming as a whole.</p>

      <title>Play one of the greatest co-op shooters free this weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up on Steam right now is a free weekend for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, easily one of the best co-op shooters around. It works out of the box on Linux desktop and it is Steam Deck "Playable" too. Also 67% off until November 17th.</p>
<p>I've got a ton of hours in this game and honestly, it's incredible. Even though it's tailored for online co-op play, doing it solo is still pretty fun too thanks to the upgradable helper drone you're given. The developer just launched Season 3 "Plaguefall" too adding in a new event, spikes that spread across the map, new tools to deal with the infection spreading, new types of grenades, new cave types to explore, and much more so it's a great time to jump in:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SfNWg_xbRfE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e4f6c9b335aaacf4324025f29041c38.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SfNWg_xbRfE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've shown it off across various livestreams and it's one of my most played games, if you've not tried it yet you've got nothing to lose since you can play free until the very end of the weekend on Steam. A GOL Livestream showed off more of it only recently and you can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu_BXaiI92M" target="_blank">VOD here</a>. You can also see a full mission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeeVEvcSjAE" target="_blank">play-through on Steam Deck here</a>.</p>
<p>Safe to say I'm going to be putting a lot more time into it with this update it looks awesome.</p>
<p>This is by far one of the best co-op shooters ever made, and I'm not exaggerating that. I've obviously played a great many shooters over the years and I will still happily keep coming back for more in this.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players specifically, I recommend putting it to Medium settings on all the presets and lock the FPS to 40 and you will get a pretty good time there. Desktop Linux obviously depends on your GPU and CPU but it's not a particularly hard game on resources so lower spec machines can perform nicely.</p>

      <title>Steam on Chromebook is now in Beta with AMD support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is exciting! Even more people will be able to play games on Linux from today, as Google announced Steam on Chromebook is now in Beta. For those less technically-minded reading, Chromebooks run ChromeOS, which is Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announce-alpha-quality-steam-on-chrome-os-is-now-actually-here/" target="_blank">Back in March</a> it was in Alpha, and it was pretty severely limited in what systems it supported and what it could play but that changes today. In the <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/steam-on-chromeos-beta" target="_blank">announcement</a>, it's mentioned that this stage brings with it "broader availability, an improved user experience, and better performance and compatibility for more of your favorite games".</p>
<p>Part of bringing it to more people is that it moves from ChromeOS Dev to ChromeOS Beta, meaning while Chromebook users still need to switch over to it they're likely to see far less system issues overall while testing. On top of that, Google are now supporting AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series and Intel 12th Gen Core CPUs and lowering the minimum CPU requirement to i3 / Ryzen 3.</p>
<p>Another big improvement is how they handle storage. Some games need to download additional data outside of Steam, so they entirely reworked that and this gave an additional benefit like improved filesystem access performance for Windows games in the Proton compatibility layer. Power management was also upgraded, adding in power notifications on top of full-screen games.</p>
<p>Tons of other improvements like DirectX 12 and Vulkan 1.3 support, improving shader storage and so on. The list of games they've tested and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/steam-on-chromeos/#game-list" target="_blank">recommend</a> has grown but still on the small side.</p>
<p>Full changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added various game-specific tweaks</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5000 C-series support</li>
<li>Avoid sleeping when game indicates activity via dbus</li>
<li>Changed shader cache format to reduce disk footprint</li>
<li>Initial DX12 support</li>
<li>Enable pointer lock by default (without the #exo-pointer-lock flag)</li>
<li>Fixed some cases previously resulting in GPU hangs</li>
<li>i3/R3 device support</li>
<li>Improved battery life from reduced CPU overhead in Vulkan and DirectX titles</li>
<li>Optimized display pipeline when scaling</li>
<li>Improved GPU rendering performance with transparent huge page support</li>
<li>Improved handling switching between apps and full-screen</li>
<li>Improved keyboard handling; for example, the launcher key now works when the Steam client is focused</li>
<li>Improved window management support</li>
<li>Include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai fonts</li>
<li>Increased size of shader caches</li>
<li>Intel 12th Gen core support</li>
<li>Low battery notifications</li>
<li>Mouse cursor fixes</li>
<li>New installer and splash screen</li>
<li>Revamped storage management
	<ul>
<li>Fixes games that install additional content outside of Steam</li>
<li>Improves file access performance for Proton games</li>
<li>Note: alpha users will need to uninstall and reinstall Steam so these changes can take effect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Device no longer sleeps while games are downloading in the background.</li>
<li>Shader caches persist until software update</li>
<li>Show all low-battery notifications while gaming in fullscreen</li>
<li>Vulkan 1.3 support</li>
<li>Vulkan and GL performance improvements</li>
<li>xshape support for games/launchers with transparency</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve has improved the new Big Picture Mode for Desktop quite a bit in a new Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> for Desktop has been released, and Valve continue fixing up more issues with the new Big Picture Mode to have it make sense on Desktop. Some of the issues are because it was clearly taken directly from Steam Deck, but now they're getting some proper desktop tweaks in there too.</p>
<p>Reminder: to show the new UI, you need to launch Steam with "-gamepadui" as a launch option as shown <a href="https://youtu.be/ztW9LP8bmvg" target="_blank">in my previous video</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3487041261667492156gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3487041261667492156gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where uninstall dialogs were showing up twice (this may still happen after bringing up the controller configurator or standalone keyboard).</li>
<li>Fixed issue [where] exiting a game would bring up the new Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed virtual keyboard being scaled incorrectly inside its window</li>
<li>More improvements to reduce login time for users with large libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to Exit Big Picture Mode and go back to the regular Steam desktop client. In this situation, clicking the Enter Big Picture Mode button will enter the new Big Picture (only happens if you use -gamepadui)</li>
<li>Fixed some instances [where] focus was lost</li>
<li>Updated Steam Controller LB and RB button images</li>
<li>Force GPU acceleration for the UI</li>
<li>Fixed recently exported Controller Layout Templates not showing up in the Layout Browser</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They still haven't fixed it showing what's behind Big Picture Mode on a KDE Plasma Desktop with NVIDIA though. A bug I find thoroughly odd, since the overlay from the Quick Access Menu works just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4890583661667492155gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4890583661667492155gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Update —</strong> an additional Steam Client Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948436064009" target="_blank">update</a> went out today (November 3rd) with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed overlay not working properly in non-Steam games</li>
<li>Fixed scaling issue in the desktop UI when exiting Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed issues with some dialogs not showing in the Steam Overlay</li>
<li>Removed some options in the Quick Access menu that are not currently supported outside of Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the Friends List was not accessible after exiting Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the re-order controllers dialog stopped working from the Quick Access menu</li>
<li>Fix issue starting any game with multiple Launch Options</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>The controller overlay now respects the "Use Nintendo Button Layout" setting in the New Big Picture</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve fix new EA app in Proton Experimental for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, EA starting removing Origin from games on Steam and replacing it with the EA app <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/ea-begins-swapping-out-origin-for-ea-app-on-steam/" target="_blank">which as I noted before</a>, caused numerous issues. Now, Valve should have solved it in Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Some games just didn't work at all with the change, others needed a re-install, some needed a couple of re-loads and so on. It was a big nuisance and quite annoying that EA seemingly didn't work with Valve on it before pushing out such a big change. Anyway, should be all good now.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Edge Webview installer throwing an error when starting Vermintide 2 for the first time.</li>
<li>Fix the new EA launcher displaying a blank window.</li>
<li>Fix The Anacrusis not displaying video when joining a match (experimental regression).</li>
<li>Enable nvapi for: Red Dead Redemption 2, Red Dead Online.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder (for desktop), you now need Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer for Proton Experimental. On Steam Deck, Valve control the drivers for you so it's fine.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video that goes over the changes and shows you what to do on Steam Deck:</p>

<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Access your Amazon Prime Gaming library on Linux with the Nile Project</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon's<a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home" target="_blank"> Prime Gaming</a> service has been dishing out free-to-keep games to its subscribers for some time now, but accessing these games required running the Amazon Gaming client through Wine.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/nile" target="_blank">Nile Project</a> provides a native interface for your Prime Gaming library by interacting with the Amazon API to download and play your games from the command line. A nice advantage to using Nile is that you can change your Wine environment on a per-game basis, rather than installing a copy of Amazon Games for each. I spoke with project developer <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin" target="_blank">Linguin</a>, who also works on <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a>, and he plans to incorporate Nile into Heroic in the near future, so if you aren't keen to use the command line you can consider this a quick sneak peek. The developer also mentioned it's not ready for Steam Deck yet and while possible it's not recommended, so this is for desktop Linux for now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20004241041667433213gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20004241041667433213gol1142.png"/></a><small>SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech running through Nile</small></p>
<p>The project is still in early days, and as such the documentation is a bit sparse. Let's take a look at using Nile to access some of those Bezos freebies. Most of this information can be found in the project's README.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Get Nile and dependencies</h4>
<p>Nile is not (yet) packaged for distributions, so grab it from the GitHub repository using git:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">git clone https://github.com/imLinguin/nile</code></p>
<p>You will also need the project dependencies, which you can install system-wide for Arch Linux like so:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">pacman -Sy pyqt5 python-pycryptodome python-zstandard python-requests python-protobuf</code></p>
<p>or or for Ubuntu like so:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pycryptodome python3-requests python3-zstd</code></p>
<p>If you are on a different distribution you could instead install the required python packages system-wide with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/" target="_blank">pip</a>, although personally I wouldn't recommend it. A better option is to make a virtual environment, then activate the environment before running Nile. To do this, run: <code>python3 -m venv env &amp;&amp; source ./env/bin/activate &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements.txt</code>Note that the virtual environment will only be active for the terminal you ran <code class="inline-code">source ./env/bin/activate</code> on, so you will need to re-run it for new terminals before running Nile.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Download your Games</h4>
<p>In the Nile directory you downloaded from GitHub, run <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile auth --login</code>, which will pop open a window with the Amazon login. Once you have logged in, you can list your games with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile library list</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3991698761667433471gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3991698761667433471gol1142.png"/></a><small>Nile listing my Prime Gaming library</small></p>
<p>Choose the game you would like to install and copy the associated ID string, then run <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile install </code>, replacing with the string you copied. The download will start - there is no indication of download progress so you'll just have to be patient. You can verify that the game has been installed with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile library list</code>.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Play</h4>
<p>Once completed, you can launch the game using the default system Wine prefix with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile launch </code>. A nice feature is that you can instead use one of your pre-existing Wine bottles from <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to run one of your Amazon games with GE Proton you could create a bottle using the Bottles GUI  or from the command line<br/>
<code>bottles-cli new --bottle-name ge_proton --environment gaming --runner GE-Proton7-38</code><br/>
Then use that bottle to play your game<br/>
<code>./bin/nile launch --bottle ge_proton</code></p>
<p>While it's still early days for this project, I think it's great how easy it's getting to access games on platforms besides Steam, and the Nile project moves us that little bit farther into the glorious Linux gaming future.</p>

      <title>JSAUX teasing a clear Back Plate for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX, maker of many Steam Deck Docking Stations, might be teasing a clear Back Plate they're designing for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>They seem to be never far away from releasing something new, with on Docking Station after another but now it seems they're onto something different. I'm surprised it actually took any company this long, as no doubt a clear Back Plate would be popular as we all know clear tech is awesome. I fondly remember my see-through Game Boy Pocket, what a glorious thing it was.</p>
<p>Anyway, on <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1587097997828988928" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, JSAUX teased "We are designing a new product, related to the shell on the back, let me see if anyone guesses correctly what it is.👀" with this image:</p>

<p>Would you buy one? I 100% would.</p>

      <title>Microsoft upgraded Xbox Cloud Gaming for Linux and ChromeOS (so Steam Deck too!)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On the community Reddit for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/play" target="_blank">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, an Xbox employee put up a small announcement about an upgraded experience for Linux and ChromeOS game streaming.</p>
<p>Something we've been waiting on for some time, as without workarounds you were limited to a low resolution. You could make it better by spoofing Edge on Windows for example. Even with that, I noticed it didn't perform as well as expected. Now, that should no longer be the case.</p>
<p>Xbox Cloud developer Jordan Cohen said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xcloud/comments/ykb1v1/performance_and_quality_improvements_on_linux_and/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone! We've just released a set of performance improvements on Xbox Cloud Gaming for gamers playing via browser on Linux and ChromeOS devices. You can expect a higher resolution and smoother streaming experience. </p>
<p>These changes also complete a long journey of upgrading our browser gaming experience to a different streaming technology. You should now have a more consistent experience in the browser, no matter what device you use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it myself today on both desktop Linux and Steam Deck, and it does seem to work just fine.</p>
<p>Despite what Microsoft like to say, you <em>don't</em> need Edge and it works just fine in Chrome. Nothing extra is needed on desktop Linux, it's click and play. But for Steam Deck, you can set it up like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure Chrome is installed (available via the Non-Steam menu in the Steam Library), or via Discover in Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>In Desktop Mode enter this command into the Konsole terminal app: <code>flatpak --user override --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.google.Chrome</code><br/>
<em>This enables the Gamepads to work.</em></li>
<li>Load Chrome and go to Xbox.com/Play, and setup your login. It's easier in desktop mode.</li>
<li>If you wish to auto-launch Xbox Cloud Gaming with Chrome with no address bar, add this to the very end of the launch options (Properties menu on Chrome in your Steam Library): <code>--window-size=1024,640 --force-device-scale-factor=1.25 --device-scale-factor=1.25 --kiosk "https://xbox.com/play"</code></li>
<li>In Gaming Mode on Steam Deck, tap Chrome in your Steam Library and set Steam Input (the Gamepad icon on the right) into Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad. Also set the Right Trackpad as Mouse Click, as it helps you deal with any browser pop-ups.</li>
<li>Launch Chrome, and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>As a side-note, if you really do need or want to use Edge instead of Chrome, you can just change the end of point 2 to have this at the end com.microsoft.Edge instead of com.google.Chrome.</em></p>
<p>Here's a video reminder on how to do it along with some quick footage:</p>

      <title>Loading bigger libraries should be faster in the new Steam Deck Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available in the Beta and Preview channels, Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3425577645359615159" target="_blank">released</a> a new Steam Deck Client Update with a few useful little fixes. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some instances were focus was lost</li>
<li>More improvements to reduce login time for users with large libraries</li>
<li>Fixed issue where spotlighted games in the Whats New section could not be interacted with</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with trackpad typing</li>
<li>Updated Steam Controller LB and RB button images</li>
<li>Fixed Main Menu not adjusting size/position when adjusting UI scale</li>
<li>Fixed recently exported Controller Layout Templates not showing up in the Layout Browser</li>
<li>Fixed issue with sign in refresh UI when the user had already signed in once during the current session</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do find the initial login is still a little sluggish myself, with over 2,000 games it gets me into the Home screen fine but it's not very responsive still for a few more seconds. Hopefully they will keep at it.</p>
<p>Hopefully we shall soon hear more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steamos-34-beta-to-update-the-arch-linux-base-new-steam-deck-updates-out-now/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4</a>, as I'm exciting for all the software updates that will come along with it like a much improved version of KDE Plasma for desktop mode. What are you looking forward to?</p>
<p><strong>Update —</strong> an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3425577645362930709" target="_blank">additional</a> Deck Client Beta went out today (November 3rd), here's what changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where the re-order controllers dialog stopped working from the Quick Access menu.</li>
<li>Fixed issue in Desktop mode where the Steam Library was not loading properly.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection.</li>
<li>Fix issue starting any game with multiple Launch Options.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Fun Steam Deck Verified &amp; Playable games from October 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the Steam Deck hit over 6,000 games marked as Playable and Verified together, so I took a little look at some of the entries across October to point out some fun picks.</p>
<p>Featuring games both new and old, games going through Deck Verified can be a fun reminder of what existing games are out there to go through your back catalogue. You can see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=DeckCompatDate_DESC&amp;deck_compatibility=3%2C2&amp;os=win%2Clinux" target="_blank">Valve's list here</a>, although they really need to upgrade it as sorting by the verification date ends up showing games that had a small tweak to their listing without a change to the verified status so it can confuse people.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vKs_kTg4B1Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47f8b7c583be6a57e6ac6a42b30f3521.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vKs_kTg4B1Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>My quick picks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337920/Serial_Cleaners/" target="_blank">Serial Cleaners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/" target="_blank">UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684930/CULTIC/" target="_blank">CULTIC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/" target="_blank">Unrailed!</a> (Native Linux)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank">Anger Foot Demo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/637090/BATTLETECH/" target="_blank">BATTLETECH</a> (Playable - Native Linux but Steam Deck uses Proton)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1647550/NEO_The_World_Ends_with_You/" target="_blank">NEO: The World Ends with You</a> (Playable)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2087030/Shatterline/" target="_blank">Shatterline</a> (Playable)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them should work on desktop Linux too thanks to Proton or Native Linux builds.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe is the next Steam release coming from Q-Games and they've managed to get it Steam Deck Verified ahead of release. Originally released on Apple Arcade, it's getting a full Steam release at some point but there's no exact date on that yet.</p>
<p>Valve seem to be rating more demos recently, as they also did the same for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank">Anger Foot</a> but in that case only the demo is verified. Here it seems the entire game and demo has verification.</p>
<p>"In PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, clean up the streets of Junktown and trash anyone who gets in your way!</p>

      <title>Narrative adventure Where Birds Go to Sleep has a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love text-based narrative adventures that look a bit insane? Where Birds Go to Sleep is releasing next year and they now have a demo available. The game will also have Native Linux support, and the demo already does.</p>
<p>"Slip into the subconscious of Cormo, a primitive criminal sent on a mission to chart new, mystical lands shrouded in a mind-altering fog. You never directly assume control, but you will mould him through every decision and every sentence you put in his mind. Uncover the dark mysteries of the island and of the human psyche. Become what you hate in Where Birds Go To Sleep."</p>
<p>The developer mentions it touches on sensitive topics, and won't be suitable for a younger audience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ms71dctwfNc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d25d96ac680a12d616bea0536de0f899.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ms71dctwfNc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introspect: Reflect on your actions along with the protagonist; exchange your thoughts on what happened; regret or rejoice, grieve or laugh together… or independently of each other.</li>
<li>Choices: There is no “Mission Failed”; saying “No” opens new avenues. There is no golden path.</li>
<li>Consequences: Lie to others, and you’ll be more likely to hide the truth from yourself. Fail to justify your actions and you might find your character not heeding your commands.</li>
<li>Narrative: Sprawling, naturally flowing dialogue: react in intense back-and-forth conversations.</li>
<li>Survive: You must prepare for every journey inland, anticipating the challenges ahead. The provisions are scarce… but the others need them less than you.</li>
<li>You’re NOT fully in control: you are the whisper in the back of the mind. Manipulate your crew-mates and your protagonist into doing your bidding… and deal with the mental toll.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer mentioned over email that the demo will remain up until the end of November.</p>
<p>Try it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1387640/Where_Birds_Go_to_Sleep/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>The free and open source game engine Godot Engine continues to grow, and now the team behind it has formed a Godot Foundation to continue funding it.</p>
<p>Previously they teamed up with the Software Freedom Conservancy charity, who handled the donations and ensured it was used correctly but as they've constantly grown, they feel the need to run it themselves now. In <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godots-graduation-godot-moves-to-a-new-foundation" target="_blank">a blog post</a> from founder Juan Linietsky, they noted having their own organization gives them the "opportunity to explore broader funding sources" while mentioning crowdfunding like Blender and Krita do.</p>
<p>On top of that, a "highly requested" ability for users to be able to sell assets through some sort of asset library, with a share going to the new Godot Foundation. Having merchandise is also an option and other miscellaneous extra forms of funding.</p>
<p>Linietsky also believes that doing all this will "project a stronger image of the Godot Project, which will allow us to have stronger footing when negotiating big donations with donors". Additionally "we want the Foundation to serve as a home for community initiatives, by allowing it to have its own funding lines (this means, so they can raise funding on their own for a specific goal, but the Foundation receives and uses it according to what was agreed), such as initiatives to promote education, communication and diversity".</p>
<p>All sounds reasonable and just goes to show how popular Godot has become that they can now do this. This is all on top of the formation of W4 Games, which is their company to commercially support Godot that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/w4-games-raised-8-5-million-usd-to-support-godot-engine/" target="_blank">raised quite a lot of money</a> recently.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator recently had a big update with a free Graveyard level</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the most popular games of its kind on Steam, the co-op escape room puzzler Escape Simulator recently had a nice update.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1435790/view/5722411638188322462" target="_blank">Steam post</a> going over stats and plans, they noted they've seen over 1.4 million people try it out on Steam which is impressive. Plus, a Wild West DLC was announced that will release in December adding in 4 new official rooms, 4 new music tracks and new outlaw and sheriff outfits.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1309400171667387697gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1309400171667387697gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the recent free update it added in a free Graveyard room, which they added for Halloween and it came with a special soundtrack too and a new outfit. On top of that they said the update has "600 fixes and quality-of-life improvements for the game".</p>
<p>Have to say, their design in this game is pretty great and the Graveyard felt suitably spooky, although a little over the top with the fog perhaps. They also said they have a few more rooms to add still yet so that should be fun to see, as usually you get all the items to play with in the Room Editor too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13099232891667388907gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13099232891667388907gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Void Scrappers blends Vampire Survivors mechanics with a space shoot &#39;em up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Void Scrappers recently released with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. A pretty great game if you love the mechanics of Vampire Survivors but want something different. I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/void-scrappers-is-my-new-favourite-coffee-break-game-m-try-the-free-prologue/" target="_blank">previously took a look</a> at their Prologue but the full game is out now.</p>
<p>Joining the growing list of horde-survival games, you blast various types of alien ships into junk that you then collect to upgrade your ship and blow up more. Destroy bosses and take their weapons, unlock and equip powerful new abilities and you can permanently upgrade your ship stats between runs too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qq7i-Kb00WI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0cd971a262e18ba801c1f6b703f62406.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qq7i-Kb00WI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A note: it seems currently it has an issue on Steam Deck where you might see a black screen while docked, the developer hasn't figured out why it happens but it works fine handheld.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun with the Prologue, and that quickly became a favourite. This full release with expanded content will quite likely become a regular coffee-break game for me, or a quick run or two before bed. It's incredibly easy just to pick up and play, has good battery life on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005210/Void_Scrappers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

While based on TTD, OpenTTD had a wide array of improvements including bigger maps, better multiplayer, dedicated servers, better AI and so much more.</p>
<p>Version 13.0 has a first Beta release out with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag.</li>

<p>One of the biggest and longest-running open source games, OpenTTD is simply magnificent for those that love the classics. A good reminder it exists if you somehow haven't heard of it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck pushed Linux to the highest share on Steam in years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh month, which means a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out. Looking over the October 2022 data, it appears we've hit a fresh high point.</p>
<p>At the end of October, Linux hit 1.28% on Steam against 2.23% on macOS and 96.50% on Windows. Going by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, where we've been tracking the Linux user share for a few years, it is the highest it's been in over 4 years now! Still tiny compared with Windows of course but it's some clear steady progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14921006971667370820gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14921006971667370820gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This growth at the moment is largely thanks to the Steam Deck, which you probably already guessed. That much is clear when looking over the Linux-specific data page on the Steam Survey which shows these as the top Linux distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 24.98% +7.94%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 12.27% -0.21%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.12% -1.45%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.92% -0.88%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.71% +0.90%</li>
<li>Other 40.99% -2.00%</li>
</ul>
<p>SteamOS (at least going by that list on face value) is the most popular Linux distribution for gamers on Steam, by a wide margin there too with the caveat being we don't know exactly what's in the "Other" category, which could be full of various forms of Ubuntu that could push it to the top when added together.</p>
<p>When checking further, in the GPU list for Linux, the growth is clear with it noting that "AMD Custom GPU 0405" (the Steam Deck) has hit 25.01% (+7.94%). I should note as well, that this GPU still doesn't even show up when filtering to just Windows and so it's clear that the vast majority of gamers on Steam Deck are sticking to SteamOS which goes to show just how good it is as an experience overall.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress releases December 6 on Steam and itch.io, Native Linux support later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress is finally getting the big Early Access release on Steam and itch.io on December 6, although the Native Linux support is to come along later. Many years in the making, with actual proper graphics and more, it's nearly here!</p>
<p>With Bay 12 Games at the helm and Kitfox Games publishing, no doubt it will be one of this year's biggest Steam releases. New trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2K7T5LXQPJI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50f94258d46f59c5096234037ff352bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2K7T5LXQPJI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About Linux (and macOS) they said this under the "Soonish" heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also not able to approach Mac and Linux by ourselves, since we've never notarized a Mac build or managed Linux libraries, and will need to get help with that to do it properly. But obviously we'd love to get that whole pipeline working so people can play on non-Windows computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an email to us, the publisher additionally noted "support for Linux and Mac is not planned for the initial release, but is relatively high in the priority list after the initial bug fixes/content updates are complete".<em> At release though, I will be surprised if a title like this doesn't work well in Proton.</em></p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not just generated geometry -- a whole simulated world. Generated rise and fall of civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures, etc. Infinite hours of gameplay.</li>
<li>Now with beautiful pixel graphics!</li>
<li>Learn the basics with in-game tutorials</li>
<li>A lifetime “living” project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight</li>
<li>Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise.</li>
<li>A new endless hobby, just for you!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Beta update tweaks the new Big Picture Mode from Steam Deck for desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has today <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3379415101027242699" target="_blank">released</a> a new Steam Client Beta, which amongst other things tweaks the new Big Picture Mode that is also in a special Beta that was taken from the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For the new Big Picture Mode here's the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removed Steam Deck Rewards section from Account page.</li>
<li>Fixed issues interacting with spotlighted games under What’s New.</li>
<li>Forced GPU acceleration on for Linux users who may have disabled it a long time ago. This is needed for the UI to be performant. This can still be disabled with the command-line option -cef-disable-gpu. It can also be forced enabled via -cef-force-gpu.</li>
<li>Temporarily hiding System Info under Settings as a work-around for crashes for users with older NVIDIA drivers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a reminder: to use the new Big Picture Mode you need to launch Steam with "-gamepadui" as a launch argument as I showed in a previous video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ztW9LP8bmvg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9883a0e9dbe34964845eca4b22871e70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ztW9LP8bmvg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Other changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue where new Big Picture Mode notifications were showing up in desktop mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Sign In</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a case where if the sign-in UI had cached credentials which had become invalid, it could get stuck and not accept valid credentials thereafter</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Gyro Enabling: The "Touch" option is now available to controllers which do not have capacitive touch sensors - Moving joysticks out of their deadzone now counts as a "Touch".</li>
</ul>

      <title>Competitive tactics game Duelyst is being revived with Duelyst II</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love competitive games? How about when they're free to play? Dream Sloth Games are reviving Duelyst as Duelyst II, with approval from Counterplay Games. A game that originally reviewed quite well, but it was shut down and delisted on Steam back in February of 2020. Duelyst II was originally started as a fan-game but it's now turning into a full complete sequel.</p>
<p>They say "The epic battles of Final Fantasy Tactics and Advanced Wars have been distilled into focused 10 minute PvP matches, where every decision you make can be the difference between victory and defeat.". It offers up the positional aspects of traditional turn-based strategy games, with "the deep customization and dynamic gameplay of CCGs". So it's a turn-based deck-building battler.</p>

<p>Since it will be free to play, they're aiming to keep it away from any pay to win mechanics with you being able to "quickly" build your collect by playing with monetization focused on cosmetic items.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It will have full Native Linux support and it is crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dreamslothgames/duelyst-ii/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the $25,000 goal not only hit they've managed to nearly double it and there's 10 days left on the campaign.</p>
<p>Their current plan is to have an Open Beta this year. They said "Q4" but we're already inside that and they haven't given a more clear date yet exactly. Likely shortly after the campaign ends.</p>

      <title>These were the most popular Steam Deck games for October 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1587193499174465536" target="_blank">revealed</a> <em>two</em> fresh lists of popular games for the Steam Deck through October, sorted by both daily average player count and time played overall.</p>
<p>The first is sorted by daily average user count of games released in October which are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/" target="_blank">UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1496790/Gotham_Knights/" target="_blank">Gotham Knights</a></li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158160/Coral_Island/" target="_blank">Coral Island</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/261550/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord/" target="_blank">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/" target="_blank">Victoria 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850510/TRIANGLE_STRATEGY/" target="_blank">TRIANGLE STRATEGY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/" target="_blank">SIGNALIS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second, is sorted by hours played total across the whole month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/" target="_blank">ELDEN RING</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" target="_blank">No Man's Sky</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/Fallout_4/" target="_blank">Fallout 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/" target="_blank">Hades</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These lists both show just how amazing the Steam Deck is as a device. When it can play games released for Windows, through the Proton compatibility layer, often on the day of release like Persona 5 and UNCHARTED. They were never designed for the system and yet thanks to the work going into Proton, they work so amazingly well.</p>
<p>Then with the second list, you can see another great point, on how people are continuing to play their favourites that were released many years ago. The back catalogue you get access to with Steam and the Deck is just awesome. Just the very fact that some absolutely huge games like GTA V and Skyrim work on it still amazes me. Both lists also go to show just how varied the games are that people play on Deck, there’s seemingly no genre that’s bigger than the other.</p>

      <title>Missile Command: Recharged gets a revamp and relaunch on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari and Adamvision Studios have taken down the original Missile Command: Recharged, and replaced it with another Missile Command: Recharged of the same name but it has been upgraded. It's seen a bump in the price too.</p>
<p>Answering the question of why they decided to re-do it, they said: "To address the elephant in the room: there was indeed an original release of Missile Command: Recharged. Being the first title in the Recharged series' lineup, Atari decided to go back and upgrade the title with all they've learned after releasing six additional Recharged games. Atari's revamped Missile Command: Recharged equips the game with fresh content and a whole new gaming experience, drawing inspiration from later releases such as Gravitar: Recharged, Yars: Recharged, Black Widow: Recharged, Asteroids: Recharged, Centipede: Recharged, and Breakout: Recharged."</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Ups:</strong> Don’t just target missiles – take aim at all-new power-ups that will give you special tool, including powerful missiles, shields, and even a screen-clearing special blast.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrades:</strong> In Arcade, use accumulated points you earn to upgrade defensive attributes that will keep you in the game longer – if you use them wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Local Co-op:</strong> Tag in a friend to play any mode in local co-op and coordinate to fend off enemies even longer.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> Compete in global leaderboards and aim to claim bragging rights as the top missile commander.</li>

      <title>Open source kart racer SuperTuxKart 1.4 is out now with Vulkan in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source kart racing game, SuperTuxKart, has released a major new version with lots of fresh goodies to play with. Focusing on fun gameplay and not realistic physics, it could (and often does) get compared to Mario Kart, except it's made by volunteers but it is quite impressive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12307998961667303764gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12307998961667303764gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the big new stuff in version 1.4 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Lap Trial game mode.</li>
<li>Items and stars animation.</li>
<li>HiDPI support in SDL2.</li>
<li>Beta Vulkan renderer.</li>
<li>Balanced starting positions in all official soccer fields.</li>
<li>Lots of other smaller balancing changes, track updates and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap between the Vulkan and OpenGL renderer with a "--render-driver=vulkan" or "--render-driver=opengl" launch argument, and it seems to stick to the last one you picked. Currently, Vulkan doesn't seem to have a lot of the graphical effects present in OpenGL so it's very much a work in progress.</p>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine 7.20 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wine hackers have put out a new development build of the Windows compatibility layer in Wine 7.20. This is part of Steam Play Proton, which allows you to play tons of Windows games on Steam Deck and Linux desktops. Once a year they make a big new stable release, and eventually Proton updates to it too.</p>
<p>Here's the highlights of <a href="https://www.winehq.org//announce/7.20" target="_blank">version 7.20</a> include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 7.4.0.</li>
<li>Font linking improvements.</li>
<li>A number of fixes for exception unwinding.</li>
<li>Support for dumping EMF spool files in WineDump.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>29 bugs were noted to be solved including issues for: Crysis 2, Tequila City of Heroes Launcher, Autonauts, Axiom Verge 2, Obduction, Shin Koihime † Eiyuutan 4 and more.</p>
<p>For those that don't know: Wine Mono is their version of Mono, meant to replace .NET (v4.8 and earlier) in Wine. The improvements in Wine Mono 7.4.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression in string formatting in WPF. The bug is in WPF code but was triggered by an implementation change in Wine's dwrite. (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53552" target="_blank">Winehq bug 53552</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed build on systems that have a "python3" command but no "python".</li>
<li>Fixed build error with glibc 2.36.</li>
<li>Updated the Vagrant build VM to Ubuntu 22.04.</li>
<li>Some work on System.Configuration tests.
	<ul>
<li>Nunit tests now use .exe.config files.</li>
<li>Stand-alone System.Configuration tests now run as part of the test suite.</li>
<li>A default case was added to fix a failing test. It's not known if this helps any real application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IL code storing a 64-bit integer to a "function pointer" type field is now accepted. This fixes an Invalid IL error in Grounded.</li>
<li>Imported System.Speech.dll from .NET Core. This does not work yet with Wine's SAPI implementation, but allows for further development.</li>
<li>Updated SDL to 2.24.0.</li>
<li>Updated FNA to 22.09.01.</li>
<li>Updated Mono from upstream.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Video recording app OBS Studio v28.1 out with NVENC changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a> has a new release out now, and it comes with some changes for NVIDIA GPU owners who use NVENC. Some of the changes (as usual) only affect Windows, but there's still some goodies in there for Linux too.</p>
<p>Easily one of my favourites bits of FOSS software, couldn't imagine being without it now for video recording and livestreaming, well worth supporting directly!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18936427741667302669gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18936427741667302669gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When it comes to NVENC, in v28.1 they've changed the way you can configure it with quite a lot more options, so you can really tweak what your videos will look like now with this encoder:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Presets have been split into 3 different settings: Preset, Tuning, and Multipass mode</li>
<li>Presets are now P1-P7, lower numbers being lower quality, higher numbers being higher quality. Note that higher presets may incur higher GPU usage which could impact the performance of games running simultaneously with OBS. The number of simultaneous NVENC encoding sessions may be lower when using the highest presets. OBS will automatically map your current NVENC settings to the closest preset when upgrading.</li>
<li>Tuning is used to determine whether to prioritize latency or quality. It has three settings: High Quality, Low Latency, and Ultra Low Latency.</li>
<li>Multipass Mode is used to determine whether a second pass is used in encoding, and has three settings: Disabled, Quarter Resolution, and Full Resolution. Enabling this will give higher quality at the cost of more GPU resource usage.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9197958741667302603gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9197958741667302603gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additional changes for all platforms include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Moved "Always on Top" to the View menu</li>
<li>You can now select a specific source for the Virtual Camera</li>
<li>Fixed Stats widget appearance issues</li>
<li>Fixed Blend Method in Studio Mode</li>
<li>Fixed case where video capture is darkened when both luma wipe and scale filtering are set</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.5 Beta adds Download Manager, external game / launcher installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> is growing with the 2.5.0 Beta version out now, putting it in competition with the likes of Lutris and Bottles a little more with the new features.</p>
<p>One of the major new additions is the ability to add applications from basically anywhere. Heroic is no longer limited to GOG and Epic Games, as you can just add anything in from Native Linux game installs to Windows games / launchers to then run through Wine. This is great since it's such a popular application on both desktop and Steam Deck and should perhaps even make certain launchers easier.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3012696731667235982gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3012696731667235982gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's now support for custom user themes, a Download Manager so you can queue up a ton of games to download and a "more robust online checking system". They also upgraded the version of Legendary they use, which is the magic behind the Epic Games support along with performance improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>I'll probably take a proper look in a video likely when 2.5.0 is out stable.</p>

      <title>Elon Musk completes Twitter takeover, Nextcloud to ship their own social network app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just a bit of big industry news to cover today, as an update to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/twitter-agrees-to-elon-musk-buyout-a-reminder-were-on-mastodon/" target="_blank">previous article</a> talking about Elon Musk and Twitter — as the sale has completed. Plus a reminder on Mastodon and Nextcloud doing some fun social stuff too.</p>
<p>To get one thing out of the way: no, this is not gaming news, but we've covered big industry stuff for years. In this specific case, we (or should I say <strong>I</strong>), use Twitter a lot for sharing our news and interacting with people, spreading info about Linux gaming, Steam Deck and more. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GOL on Twitter here</a>, our account is not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>It's certainly going to be interesting to see what happens, with changes already underway. For one, Musk said Twitter is now <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792" target="_blank">building up</a> a "content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints" and that the verification process (where you get a blue tick) is also being <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586848033550934016" target="_blank">revamped</a> and they're even <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/elons-first-big-move-pay-to-remain" target="_blank">reportedly</a> looking at charging people to stay verified.</p>
<p>Seems like a good time to remind people of alternatives, like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>. We're on it too and have been for a long time now, you can follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GOL on Mastodon here</a>. It's a little different to Twitter since it's open source and federated, it works a lot more like email: you sign up anywhere, or host your own, and then chat with everyone.</p>
<p>Linking into that, Nextcloud <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/no-need-to-trust-musk-we-go-federated-with-nextcloud-social/" target="_blank">announced</a> their own "Nextcloud Social" platform which will ship in Nextcloud by default, and it will have support for the the Activity Pub standard and Mastodon directly too. That could be interesting, as they have quite a lot of people using it.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader for Steam Deck (plugin loader) gets fixed up for newer SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems each time Valve do a big update to the Steam Deck with SteamOS, it ends up breaking the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> plugin system but a fresh update is out now fixing it again. From what one of the developers said it now works well across the Stable, Beta and Preview update channels.</p>
<p>There's some known issues including Valve breaking some things on the Preview branch that may need you to restart Steam, if you open the Quick Access Menu right after booting / sleep you may not see the Decky Loader icon until you re-open the menu a couple of times and for people using the Animation Changer you need to re-run the installer.</p>
<p>What's Changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add timeout to get tabs request, wait for network online target before booting decky</li>
<li>Merge Tabs and Injection Fixes, bring back native Valve toaster</li>
<li>Systemd service updating</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've not seen it, check out my guide and intro below with a few plugins being shown off:</p>

      <title>Better Linux support for OneXPlayer coming, likely for SteamOS like Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We already know that OneXPlayer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">have it in their plans</a> to put SteamOS on their devices, and perhaps this Linux kernel work is a step towards it.</p>
<p>They have just launched the "<a href="https://onexplayerstore.com/products/onexplayer-mini-amd%C2%AE-ryzen%C2%AE-6800u-1920-1200?variant=41877371224244" target="_blank">ONEXPLAYER MINI PRO</a>", which comes with an AMD Ryzen 6800U and a 1920x1200 screen. Expensive though, especially compared to the Steam Deck with this 6800U model coming in at a minimum of $1,199 so it's a little eye-watering.</p>
<p>As for this new kernel work, this new driver allows the Linux kernel to deal with the fan controller and it is currently only supported on AMD chipsets. From the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/20221029225051.1171795-1-samsagax@gmail.com/" target="_blank">patch</a> that was sent in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Platform driver for OXP Handhelds that expose fan reading and control via hwmon sysfs.</p>
<p>As far as I could gather all OXP boards have the same DMI strings and they are told appart by the boot cpu vendor (Intel/AMD).<br/>
Currently only AMD boards are supported but the code is made to be simple to add other handheld boards in the future.</p>
<p>Fan control is provided via pwm interface in the range [0-255]. AMD boards have [0-100] as range in the EC, the written value is scaled to accomodate for that.</p>
<p>PWM control is disabled by default, can be enabled via module parameter `fan_control=1`.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/OneXPlayer-Linux-Platform-Drv" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, gamepad support for the OneXPlayer was already sent in previously this month too. So it really does look like they're gearing up for Linux support.</p>

      <title>Classic Unreal Tournament lives on with a new OldUnreal upgrade, 64bit now on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unreal Tournament 99 is one of the all-time great first-person shooters, and it is being kept alive by the <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a> team and contributors with a fresh release out now.</p>
<p>Version 469c has been released recently, and it remains compatible with all previous public releases of UT down to version 432. Some of the main highlights of this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the included FMOD Engine binaries for all clients to version 2.02.10</li>
<li>The Windows installer is now digitally signed</li>
<li>Removed libcurl from the patch. Server admins that use the MD5 anti-cheat protection feature and that have automatic updates enabled for the package list will have to manually download libcurl or use the version that came with the previous patch. This change should substantially reduce the number of false positive malware warnings triggered by our patch</li>
<li>Added native support for Linux/AMD64 and macOS/Apple Silicon platforms</li>
<li>Included an updated version of the UT PubSrc SDK</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Love seeing updates like this to such a great retro shooter. There's a lot more to it, that's just the basic highlights. Some awesome maps were in this game, and the feel of it continues to hold up very nicely. I had so many hours of fun playing this many years go. Nice that Epic gave it their approval too.</p>
<p>I previously showed off how to play it on Linux / Steam Deck using ProtonUp-Qt to install Luxtorpeda which then gives you access to the Native Linux release, which you can see a video on below as it makes the process quite easy:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aSXH3RwnqB4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2e598c13ffd8288b9556586cdfe0f73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aSXH3RwnqB4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It does need the original data files of course, which you can buy easily on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/unreal_tournament_goty?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13240/Unreal_Tournament_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Great smaller and casual games for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Steam Deck is a great device for the bigger lot (AAA / AA), what about some quality choices for smaller and more casual experiences? Here's my current favourites, good for a cosy Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Okay, <em>casual</em> might perhaps <em>not</em> be the best word. However, my picks here are definitely on the smaller side of the gaming scene but they're really great to pick up and play on the Steam Deck. They're also not overly intense! Just click play and enjoy the ride. Keeping them as close to around £15 or under as I can.</p>
<p>First up, a little video going over each and links below in order:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lui9Us7hjSk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b79f55d1ce515a60a0d9bfe9bd9fa82f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lui9Us7hjSk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></strong></p>
<p>This one was pretty obvious wasn't it? Much like a vampire, it will dig in and suck your life away while the sun goes down. Having a ridiculously cheap price attached is also pretty helpful here, a fantastic entry into gaming on the go.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748390/Rocket_Bot_Royale/" target="_blank">Rocket Bot Royale</a></strong></p>
<p>An online 2D Battle Royale, with jumping tanks. It's like a real-time worms or the classic artillery games. Quite satisfying to jump around and get a few frags in this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282730/Loop_Hero/" target="_blank">Loop Hero</a></strong></p>
<p>Another that will thoroughly hook you in for many hours. Watch as your hero loops around the screen, while you pause it to equip better weapons and armour and continue on. Then build up your little village, while you get a trickle of backstory.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863080/Beat_Invaders/" target="_blank">Beat Invaders</a></strong></p>
<p>It's like Space Invaders, with sleek neon graphics and some sick tunes. A classic re-invented for the modern age and a thoroughly great experience.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">Brotato</a></strong></p>
<p>Another a bit like Vampire Survivors, but with a sentient Potato that carries a lot of weapons as you face off against increasingly large hordes across various rounds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/" target="_blank">Into the Breach</a></strong></p>
<p>Small turn-based tactics that will leave you scratching your head. Difficult but great, from the creators of FTL. You control powerful mechs, against waves of creatures crashing through the floor that try to destroy various buildings. Try to think ahead.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Core Keeper</a></strong></p>
<p>A sweet 2D underground mining and crafting game that you can play in online co-op with others. Dig deep to find riches, do a little farming, discover secrets and take down plenty of creatures and bosses.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a></strong></p>
<p>I couldn't not include this right? Probably one of the most chilled and casual games ever made. Do a whole lot of farming, make some friends, possibly meet your lover and turn an overgrown mess into something beautiful and productive.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127500/Mini_Motorways/" target="_blank">Mini Motorways</a></strong></p>
<p>Build up a road map for a growing city. One by one you drag roads around to create a network, eventually coming to a rather busy metropolis. Traffic not flowing how you like it? Get redesigning and create the most sleek set of roads you can, help everyone get around.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/" target="_blank">Baba Is You</a></strong></p>
<p>Probably one of the cleverest puzzle games I've ever played. Combine logic blocks together, to change the rules of each level so that you can reach the flag to win. Turn yourself into things, make everything float or perhaps turn yourself into the flag itself to win.</p>
<p><u>A bonus</u>: <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/" target="_blank">PowerWash Simulator</a></strong></p>
<p>This one is a <em>bit</em> more expensive than the rest, but also one of the most relaxing game experiences I've personally had on Steam Deck. Make everything so shiny you can see your face in it, get down to your hands and knees and get scrubbing. Actually, don't, just pump some water at everything and hope for the best while you sip your coffee.</p>
<hr/>
<p>What games have you found to be great on the Steam Deck, that don't require a lot of thought that you can just sit back with? Bonus points if your picks are cheap too.</p>

      <title>Sackboy: A Big Adventure is another Sony port working well on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony and Sumo Digital recently put out another port, this time it's Sackboy: A Big Adventure an offshoot of the LittleBigPlanet series.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Sony releases, it didn't have a Steam Deck rating before release and still doesn't yet. The good news is that it works out of the box on both Steam Deck and Fedora Linux seemingly without any major technical issues. It does have some shader stutter, which smoothens out over time though (likely as it had no full testing before release).</p>
<p>With Proton 7, it's click and play on Steam Deck and Linux. Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WxdGZQ8ZpvE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdb96f8c0f5d6d2dcf810f194b732449.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WxdGZQ8ZpvE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Very happy with how this runs. On my desktop, max settings produced a very smooth experience overall. On Steam Deck, keeping it on High settings, with the screen locked to 40Hz and TDP set to 10 — gave a really good feeling too with better battery life than the default (a good while over 2 hours).</p>
<p>On desktop, it seems it doesn't get along with MangoHud, which vanished every time on the initial loading screen so in the brief desktop bit in the video, you will see the normal Steam FPS counter in the top left corner.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sackboy-a-big-adventure?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599660/Sackboy_A_Big_Adventure/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>VRR (external screens) and Allow Tearing options coming to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that both options for Variable Refresh Rate and Allow Tearing are coming to the Steam Deck in a future update (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/yg0ou5/variable_refresh_rate_and_allow_tearing_options/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>), here's what that means.</p>
<p>Firstly, no, the Steam Deck itself will not have VRR, as the screen doesn't support it (As confirmed by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1586208015543578624" target="_blank">Twitter</a>). This will be for <em>external</em> screens when docking. The point of VRR is to have your screen continue to dynamically change the refresh rate to match the game, enabling it to remain smooth and tear-free.</p>
<p>As for the Allow Tearing option, this is due to the current way that Steam Deck Gaming Mode works with the Wayland display server, with it always forcing VSync. Once ready, this will allow you to properly have it off, and therefore reduce any extra latency it introduces and get some tearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8292577531667046667gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8292577531667046667gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - the new options in the performance menu.</em></p>
<p>Both of these are going to be pretty big and exciting additions, especially for those with VRR capable screens and for times where you really need that little bit extra input performance.</p>
<p>The options turned up in the Steam Deck "Main" updates channel, which is one of the extra update channels you can turn on via Developer Mode not actually meant for users. As with any in-progress developments, it can change at any point.</p>

      <title>Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds gets cross-play between Steam and Consoles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the more unique fighting games available on PC (Native Linux + Steam Deck Verified), Them's Fightin' Herds has launched on consoles and it now has cross-play. This means no matter the platform you want to fight on, you're good to go.</p>
<p><em>The game currently has a Very Positive user rating from 2,578 user reviews.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709471391666976058gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709471391666976058gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Released as part of the 3.1.2 update they noted that players can find each other across the matchmaking queue, classic lobbies, and Pixel Lobbies regardless of platform plus some HUD elements were added to identify people on different platforms. However, account progress is separate between platforms. Consoles use Epic Online Services, while Steam is sticking to Steam netcode.</p>
<p>The Season 1 Pass is also now live as a DLC that gives you access to 4 new characters, an exclusive character palette pack and 4 exclusive Pixel Lobby accessories although not everything is out yet. The first of the new characters, Texas, was teased in a short trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oSM20gOntLM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e5ad30296488359d25d90b4a56570573.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oSM20gOntLM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, the update also fixed up hosting a custom Pixel Lobby server on Linux.</p>

      <title>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The third game in the popular Monster Prom series recently landed (that I missed) and this time, it's not a dating sim, instead it's all about survival in Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the dating sim style was never really for me. However, the original in the series <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/in-monster-prom-i-was-rejected-even-after-letting-a-princess-ride-me/" target="_blank">completely won me</a> over and it was a genuine delight to play. Flipping things around this time it keeps the great writing, quirky humour and multiplayer angle along with the diverse set of characters but you need to survive a roadtrip. Although, scoring a date is still possible but not the focus.</p>
<p>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip has you and up to 3 friend face "all kinds of wacky conflicts". Just like the previous entries, it has Native Linux support too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RWmddudktsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/169d768bdfba5d8a02ac79ca570ef71a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RWmddudktsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The signature style of the Monster Prom franchise: unique, charming characters and irreverent humor.</li>
<li>A co-op narrative adventure with survival mechanics.</li>
<li>You can play with friends both through local and online multiplayer!</li>
<li>YES! There's still the option of dating. This time flirting is not the core of the game, but you can still get a date with Polly, Scott, or one of the 10+ available hitchhikers by the end of the game!</li>
<li>TONS of beautiful art like you have never seen before in these series (seriously, there's A LOT of art packed in here).</li>
<li>Even if it's a co-op game, there's a social competitive aspect that will provide a thrill for the game. Choosing how much to seek your own benefit and how much to focus on the group goal!</li>
<li>Several brand new characters, and some beloved characters from previous games will be making a comeback!</li>
<li>Radio stations to choose from, with different music genres to build the perfect mood!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for monster-collecting game Cassette Beasts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is an upcoming monster-collecting RPG from Bytten Studio and publisher Raw Fury. The recent Steam Next Fest demo was pretty great and a new trailer is live now for <a href="https://www.mediaindieexchange.com/" target="_blank">The MIX</a> event.</p>
<p>An interesting idea for such a game, with you recording various creatures on retro cassette tapes and the fusion system allows you to create tons of unique and powerful monsters. New trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pydbU0FovBw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cc385239eac01f1185e1d710e07d7be1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pydbU0FovBw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?!</strong> Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li><strong>Fuse monster forms!</strong> Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li><strong>Explore a rich open world</strong> Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li><strong>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions</strong> Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li><strong>Master a deep battle system</strong> Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, I took a quick look at the previous demo on Steam Deck recently too:</p>

      <title>Valheim gets an important bug-fix for Linux players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that the survival game Valheim had quite an unfortunate bug for Linux players, which has now been solved.</p>
<p>Players discovered a little while ago, that the ability to move saves between Cloud and Local might end up deleting characters or worlds. Ouch. At least it's fixed now. This update also brings the Jack-o-turnip seasonal decoration item since it's Halloween season once again.</p>
<p>Here's the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a Linux-specific bug that deleted characters/worlds when moving them back and forth between Local and Cloud</li>
<li>Prevent joining servers from the main menu if incompatible server version right away (instead of loading and then kicking you back out)</li>
<li>More PlayFab tweaks</li>
<li>Enabled Jack-o-turnip seasonal decoration item</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>This update also brings with it an update to the desktop Steam client on Steam Deck, so that you can also now use the Gaming Mode UI in Desktop Mode too which just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-deck-ui-comes-to-desktop-in-beta-to-replace-big-picture-mode/" target="_blank">recently landed</a> for normal desktop / laptop users.

      <title>Steam Deck UI comes to Desktop in Beta to replace Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has finally done what a lot have been waiting for, made the Steam Deck UI <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3394051164709183116" target="_blank">available for desktops</a> although it's only available in the Steam Client Beta for now.</p>
<p>To access it open Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; hit the Change button under Betas and select the Steam Client Beta. After that, you also need to add "-gamepadui" as a launch argument. So in terminal on Linux you can just simply run <code class="inline-code">steam -gamepadui</code> for it to work. Or just add it to the end of whatever shortcut you're using, same can be done on Windows too.</p>
<p>For anyone who has been following any Steam Deck footage from me or others, you will know what it looks like by now but here's a couple shots from my desktop running it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4215040561666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4215040561666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6260385831666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6260385831666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3145167311666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3145167311666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3853570881666898960gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3853570881666898960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not perfected yet of course, hence it being in Beta and hidden behind a launch argument. One issue I already found (shown above), was that the Steam menu ends up showing whatever I have behind it. Weirdly though, the Quick Access Menu doesn't have that problem.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it will still be called Big Picture Mode but it just gets replaced from the old to the new, taken from the Steam Deck UI design.</p>
<p>Valve say the updated UI includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Home Screen, where you can continue playing recent games, and see what’s new with the games in your library.</li>
<li>New Universal Search, that searches across Library, Store, and your friends</li>
<li>New controller configurator, designed for ease-of-use of picking, adjusting, or creating custom controller configurations</li>
<li>Optimized Steam Store for controller navigation</li>
<li>Updated in-game overlay, with access to achievements and guides
	<ul>
<li>Press Steam / Guide / PS button while in game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New system menu, for quick navigation to different parts of the interface
	<ul>
<li>Access this with the Steam / Guide / PS button</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New quick access menu, for access to notifications, friends list, quick settings, and more.
	<ul>
<li>Access this with Steam / Guide / PS button + A</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a quick run over it:</p>

      <title>Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translator VKD3D-Proton version 2.7 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here is an absolutely huge open source release! <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton</a>, the translation tech used in Steam Play Proton to translate Direct3D 12 to Vulkan for Steam Deck / Linux version 2.7 is out now.</p>
<p>This is the first tagged release since March, which pulls together all the work done for the Steam Deck launch up until now and it sounds pretty impressive.</p>
<p>The new release does have higher graphics driver requirements including Mesa 22.0 or NVIDIA 510 series, which should be easily available in most distributions but the release notes say Proton 7.0 will stick with VKD3D-Proton 2.6 but Proton Experimental and future main Proton releases will jump to version 2.7.</p>
<p>Some of the major additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An improved pipeline cache, now enabled for all games along with it being smaller (helps performance).</li>
<li>Lots of optimizations and better GPU performance for various features.</li>
<li>It now supports D3D12 Mesh shaders and Advanced ExecuteIndirect.</li>
<li>DXR 1.1 had some more feature implemented that were missing.</li>
<li>Basic Shared resources and fences supported with Proton.</li>
<li>Preliminary HDR support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loads more including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix random GPU hangs in Hitman 3.</li>
<li>Fix crash in Redout 2.</li>
<li>Fix random GPU hang in F1 2021.</li>
<li>Fix random flicker in Guardians of the Galaxy.</li>
<li>Update some API checks required by latest AgilitySDK runtime features. Fix crash in F1 2022.</li>
<li>Add various workarounds for game bugs in Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Add workaround for amdgpu kernel issue for certain games using imported host memory and multiple Vulkan devices.</li>
<li>Workaround glitched rendering in F1 2020 due to game bug.</li>
<li>Workaround certain games that violate placed resource API w.r.t. subresource initialization.<br/>
	Spiderman Remastered and Lost Judgment are affected. More games will likely surface.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dark Reign: The Future of War, a true classic RTS is being remade in OpenRA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Anyone else remember Dark Reign: The Future of War? Released back in 1997, it's a real classic and at the time it had some pretty favourable reviews too. The good news is that <a href="https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign" target="_blank">it's being rebuilt</a> by fans using <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a>.</p>
<p>OpenRA is the same game engine that revived classic Westwood RTS games like Command &amp; Conquer,  Dune 2000 and Red Alert. It's highly versatile and open source, making it a good base to use to revive other classics too and this makes me happy.</p>
<p>Dark Reign is easily one of my all-time favourite RTS games, next to Total Annihilation. Both managed to spice things up nicely that other RTS games around the time weren't doing. Heck, I even wrote about Dark Reign <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2016/11/wine-allowed-me-to-re-live-a-gaming-experience-i-had-from-when-i-was-a-child-on-linux/" target="_blank">here back in 2016</a> when trying it out in Wine (wow — has my opinion on Wine changed or what?). Just look at how gorgeous it was:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17909460541666885980gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17909460541666885980gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14893085941666886113gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14893085941666886113gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click pictures to enlarge.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A colossal war between the Imperium and Freedom Guard is annihilating your world. To save your civilization, you must enter the heart of an empire at war. Command over 35 units with specific orders and deploy suicide bombers, hostage takers, saboteurs and more. Use precisely calculated battlegrounds to your strategic advantage and play against a highly responsive and unpredictable AI that detects and adjusts intelligently to your tactics. Vanquish the military powers to alter the destiny of a galaxy.</p>
<cite>The official blurb</cite></blockquote>
<p>I had this OpenRA "mod" on my watch-list for a long time, hoping for the best but I wasn't aware that it was being <em>actively</em> developed. To the point that you can download an AppImage from the GitHub, download the demo content inside it and then get playing and it's really coming along nicely, although far from complete.</p>
<p>What do I hope with this article? Perhaps there's a few fellow Dark Reigns fans lurking that might like it, and perhaps some might help give it a push along with code so we can see another classic truly revived for modern audiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15060194471666886645gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15060194471666886645gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Dark Reign in OpenRA.</em></p>
<p>Find the project on <a href="https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It works with the demo assets but you'll likely need a full copy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dark_reign_expansion" target="_blank">GOG</a> at some point.</p>

      <title>Guide a convoy through a ruined world in the Sandwalkers prologue demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sounding a bit like Vagrus - The Riven Realms, we have the upcoming game Sandwalkers from Goblinz Studio and the new prologue demo Sandwalkers: The Fourteenth Caravan. The demo already has Native Linux support, and the full game will too (the developer confirmed this to GOL).</p>
<p>In this world some kind of "meteorological chaos" keeps all the tribes apart, so it seems your mission is to go through a perilous journey and meet up with them all. Manage diplomatic relations, trade, explore, fight and more. Looks like it could be pretty good!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2Z65VM-utH0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3653fc3248edc65686743fb7dad2d9c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2Z65VM-utH0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Guide a caravan of adventurers through ever-changing landscapes.</li>
<li>Fight and survive in the face of acid rain, sandstorms and heat waves.</li>
<li>Tame hostile creatures, rescue refugees, seek allies for mutual aid, or follow the blood path and loot everything you can.</li>
<li>Seek rich arable soil to plant a new tree city for your people.</li>
<li>Progress by passing on your knowledge to a new caravan.</li>
<li>Repair the broken climate, and put an end to centuries of wandering.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goblinzstudio/sandwalkers-a-roguelike-turn-based-exploration-game" target="_blank">crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a>, where the developer is trying to get at least €40,000 and they're off to a good start with over €12,000 pledged and they have 29 days to go. This is the first time they've done a crowdfunding campaign too, as they usually do Early Access on Steam.</p>
<p>At release it will be up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sandwalkers" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1639080/Sandwalkers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Although the prologue demo only has a Linux version on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966290/Sandwalkers_The_Fourteenth_Caravan/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Comedy adventure McPixel 3 releases November 14th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another point and click adventure? McPixel 3, yes they skipped the number 2, is heading to Linux and Steam Deck on November 14th.</p>
<p>The developer explained that "McPixel 3 runs on 100% software-rendered McPixel Engine, so in the age of unaffordable graphics cards, you can be sure you will be able to run McPixel 3 just fine!</p>
<p>The engine has been written from scratch just for the purpose of running McPixel. That makes the game run smoothly even on the oldest computer, so make sure you install McPixel on your grandma's PC next time you visit! Additionally, that makes the game environment-friendly! McPixel 3 saves the planet (and battery life)!"</p>
<p>A fun part of this is their <a href="https://twitter.com/Sosowski/status/1585329526015684610" target="_blank">thread on Twitter</a> showing the game running across a classic Asus EEE PC 4G, Steam Deck, Windows 95, FreeBSD, Raspberry Pi, in a Linux terminal window, Haiku OS and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5895728741666881396gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5895728741666881396gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - McPixel 3 running in a Linux terminal, credit: the developer.</em></p>
<p>Some pretty amusing and clever marketing that.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Valve finally clears up Steam game release dates, also adjusts pricing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two important pieces of info today for both players and game developers, as it will affect both quite a bit with release date changes and pricing changes.</p>
<p>Firstly, prices! Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3314110913449340511" target="_blank">announced</a> to developers various updates to how they handle multi-currency. Developers and publishers are still free to set their own pricing but now Valve are giving developers a new tool to make it easier, along with adjusting their recommendation on prices across seemingly all currencies on Steam. This may result in price increases across many games on Steam in many different regions, as Valve said "with purchasing power and foreign exchange rates constantly evolving, we needed to make significant changes to those conversion recommendations to stay current".</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-price-matrix-2022-update/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, as always, keep tracking changes on Steam and did their own blog post to highlight the changes. According to SteamDB the only currencies not changing have so far been CIS - U.S. Dollar, Costa Rican Colon. Israeli New Shekel, Kuwaiti Dinar, Singapore Dollar, South Asia - USD and U.A.E. Dirham. They included various tables, showing the changes against the dollar at various price points with this one showing just how big an increase it can be:</p>

<p><em>Thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-price-matrix-2022-update/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. </em></p>
<p>Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3289340571611574692" target="_blank">big change</a> is how release dates are presented on Steam. Soon, gone will be the days of developers setting whatever format they wish for their dates, along with some including funny messages instead of an actual date. Instead, Valve will have a standard way to present dates that can be correctly formatted to your region so there will be no more confusion on days and months too.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a> for example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10741759131666866898gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10741759131666866898gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What is changing is that developers will need to put an exact date that only they and Valve can see, and then pick between these types of public views:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The exact date. “Aug 24, 2023”</li>
<li>Month-and-year. “August 2023”</li>
<li>The quarter of the calendar year. “Q3 2023”</li>
<li>The year. "2023"</li>
<li>No date at all. “Coming Soon”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This change makes sense, and was a long time coming.</p>
<p>With this change, it will also affect how developers have their games shown in upcoming lists on Steam. Valve will position games "at the last possible date of that time range", so if developers pick to have just a month and year they will appear as if they select the last day in that month. Hopefully this will also help fix the issue of some developers repeatedly changing their date to keep bumping their game in the upcoming lists.</p>

      <title>Thoughts on the official Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After having and playing with the official Steam Deck Docking Station, here's some thoughts on the experience. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">earlier in October</a>, along with the Steam Deck itself no longer having a reservation queue, I was very keen to see what Valve would give us officially. Especially since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler</a> already provide <em>great</em> docked experiences for a lower price (since they don't give you a charger too).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15625936341666864552gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15625936341666864552gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>For the basic design it's perfectly fine. All the ports are on the back out of the way, so you only see the short lip at the front when you've docked your Steam Deck. No ethernet wire poking out the side like with JSAUX (although ivoler don't have this issue). There's no problems with the design or build quality at all, except for those of you keeping thicker protective cases on where it won't fit in. It also has a nice non-slip cover on the bottom so it won't move around.</p>
<p>A reminder on what it has available: 3 x USB-A 3.1 Gen1 Ports, Gigabit Ethernet, DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, USB-C Power Delivery pass-through input and an included charger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6714503211666864544gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6714503211666864544gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>When you first get it, you'll likely need a firmware update before you really use it. A big benefit of it, is that Valve provide firmware updates directly, so there's no messing with anything external. You either get a pop-up telling you one is available, or you can go into the settings and check for updates to have it appear. It probably won't be updated often but it's still a nice touch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9711401061666863019gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9711401061666863019gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>So it looks nice and it can get easy updates — how is the overall experience? Well, that's where things aren't so good in this case. I've now used 4 or 5 different JSAUX docks (I've lost count) and one from ivoler, I use my Steam Deck docked all the time and have done since before the original release (since I was an original Steam Deck reviewer) via two different USB-C Hubs, so I think I have a fair amount of experience here.</p>
<p>The problem is that the official Steam Deck Docking Station has its quirks with actually connecting to external displays, tested by connecting to multiple TVs and PC Monitors all from different vendors. Sometimes, it works right away. Most of the time though, I have to do a little dance between powering the Steam Deck down and on again, turning screens on and off and so on. Unfortunately, for me, the official Docking Station is very much <em>not</em> a plug and play experience. Sadly, I am apparently in a long list of people having issues with it. Looking on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/3?snr=1_614_steamdeckdock_steamdeckdock_1601" target="_blank">Steam Forum</a>, there's a great many posts of people seeing the same or just not seeing a signal on their external screen at all. A few in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">our Discord</a> have also reported such issues too.</p>
<p>At 4K, the Steam Deck UI acts a bit weirdly too. Things don't always match up on the screen and the UI doesn't perform well. Thankfully, Valve added external screens settings so I can put it into 1080p and it works fine while still looking good overall. Not a big issue but one I hope they sort too.</p>
<p>Since Valve has put a lot of work into the docked experience, overall once it's actually setup <em>correctly</em> it works quite nicely. I have no big main complaints about the main docked experience right now. Bluetooth controllers both PS4 and Xbox work just fine, as do controllers plugged in via USB. Honestly, playing with the Steam Deck while docked is a really fun experience and really continues to show how versatile the Steam Deck is as a gaming device. However, I really do hope Valve add an easy way to deal with external drives as more people wish to use them to expand their storage even more. It's possible to do, like with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-jsaux-m2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-is-a-great-choice/" target="_blank">JSAUX M.2 SSD Dock</a>, but the setup is annoying to do. They have the functionality there for SD Cards, so it's not a stretch to say they could expand that for other external drives too.</p>
<p>If Valve manage to sort out the issues with it connecting properly to external screens, which is the <em>main</em> function, it might turn around into a recommendation. For now though, I would suggest going with JSAUX or ivoler instead and if you already have a spare charger, you'll be saving money too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>CD PROJEKT RED announce The Witcher Remake in Unreal Engine 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a big fan of The Witcher series you will probably love this: CD PROJEKT RED have announced The Witcher Remake. Working together with developer Fool's Theory, it will be developed in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>This is what was originally teased as "Canis Majoris", it will be a modern reimagining of the classic from 2007 and it "will use the toolset CDPR is creating for the new Witcher saga" — sounds fancy. Hopefully it will release in a better state than Cyberpunk 2077, with Fool's Theory having veteran developers who previously worked on The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and CD PROJEKT RED is providing full creative supervision. Fool's Theory have also contributed to the development of Baldur’s Gate III, Divinity: Original Sin 2 DLC’s, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, Outriders and Gord.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p><em>"The Witcher is where it all started for us, for CD PROJEKT RED. It was the first game we made, ever, and it was a big moment for us then. Going back to this place and updating the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it is just as big, if not bigger</em>," said Adam Badowski, Head of Studio, CD PROJEKT RED.<em> "Collaborating with Fool's Theory on the project is just as exciting, as some of the people there have been previously involved in The Witcher games. They know the source material well, they know how much gamers have been looking forward to seeing the remake happen, and they know how to make incredible and ambitious games. And although it will take some time before we're ready to share more about and from the game, I know it'll be worth the wait."</em></p>
<p><em>"I am very happy that my professional paths have crossed again with fellow developers from the time of working together on The Witcher 2 and The Witcher 3. Especially when it's a remake of a project that is so close to our hearts," said Jakub Rokosz, CEO, Fool's Theory. "We are excited to join forces with CD PROJEKT RED, and our goal is to give players another great game from the iconic Witcher series."</em></p>
<p>Hopefully whenever it releases, Proton will run it nicely on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. Although, perhaps by the time it's out we might have a Steam Deck 2 as no doubt it is quite a long time away from release.</p>

      <title>JSAUX cancels current Steam Deck Dock with RGB, after competitor pinched it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX were getting close to release another (yes, another) Steam Deck Docking Station, this time with RGB lighting around the bottom but due to a "leak" and a competitor "copying" it they have cancelled it and will re-do it.</p>
<p>Outlined in a <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/blogs/steam-deck/statement-on-product-leaks-and-the-new-rgb-dock" target="_blank">blog post</a>, JSAUX mentioned: "Today we are here to announce some irritating and disappointing news. In the past few months, we were dedicated to develop and test a new RGB Steam Deck Dock long awaited by our fans, and we are almost to release it. Unfortunately, someone leaked and copied our development scheme.".</p>
<p>They sent out samples to select few outlets to try it and give feedback, with GamingOnLinux (hello) <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1581207438145224707" target="_blank">being one of them</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18078343251666799574gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18078343251666799574gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - the original JSAUX RGB Steam Deck Dock.</em></p>
<p>In the blog post, JSAUX showed off what they say are shots of them designing it back in July, along with a patent application for it.</p>
<p>According to JSAUX, an unnamed company reached out to various Steam Deck content creators and told them about their RGB Dock. JSAUX caught wind of this, investigated and claim they found it was the factory they were using that leaked their files on it thus allowing a competitor to make it and so they have now "terminated the cooperation" with said factory.</p>
<p>As a result, the current design has been cancelled. However, for RGB fans, the good news is that JSAUX will still be doing it but "will start with a completely new look with different lighting effects".</p>
<p>I reached out to the company in question (who I won't name, since JSAUX didn't either), since I know who it was, and they simply denied it completely.</p>

      <title>Volkswagen begins funding Blender development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>EA begins swapping out Origin for EA app on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the time has come, EA has begun the process of swapping from Origin to the EA app on Steam, which could cause a few issues for Linux and Steam Deck with Proton. Multiple titles on Steam got updates within the last day, with no patch notes or announcements from EA that I can see. The only difference seems to be introducing the EA App.</p>
<p>Checking my existing install of The Sims 4 on Steam Deck and it seems fine. It briefly showed a new EA App screen, then showed Origin and then went into the game.</p>
<p>An existing Titanfall 2 install on Fedora Linux (desktop) however refused to initially launch, it gave me the EA screen and with Proton 7.0-4, Proton 7.0-5 (RC) and Proton Experimental it just wouldn't launch. Removing the compatdata folder, where all the Wine / Proton prefix data is stored and reloading got it a bit further, to some sort of blank EA App screen after successfully installing it that got stuck. Killing all Wine processes and exiting Steam, then reloading Titanfall 2 and after a few blank EA App screens appeared and vanished — it works again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9827645101666779604gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9827645101666779604gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Let's not.</em></p>
<p>With a fresh install of Titanfall 2 on Steam Deck with Proton 7, it had the issue again of a blank EA app screen that got stuck. Quitting and reloading, it once again showed the blank EA app screen. Forcing Proton Experimental on it, and then it actually worked.</p>
<p>Trying a new install of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order on Fedora Linux (desktop) with Proton 7, and a similar issue as the above although it didn't need a compatdata folder removal. EA App seemed to install, then I just got greeted by a blank EA App window. Seems it's actually a sign-in window, as I was able to highlight things on it by trying to drag things out of the window. Anyway, in this case simply quitting and reloading just seemed to fix it.</p>
<p>So it's a bit of a nuisance and acts differently between games, but it appears the EA app <em>can</em> still work with Proton but it <em>might</em> need a little extra work.</p>
<p><em>Note: the below can remove settings, possibly saves etc, do at your own risk.</em></p>
<p>If you find you also need to remove the compatdata folder for some EA games (for Steam Deck, be in Desktop Mode): find the Steam App ID (Right click a game -&gt; properties -&gt; updates) or grab the ID from the URL of the Steam store page for it. Then inside your steamapps folder you will find compatdata and inside a folder with the same ID. Where it is depends on what drive you have games installed on, the default is <code class="inline-code">/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/</code>.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments how things are going for you on various EA games on Linux desktop / Steam Deck now.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 6,000 games marked Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just short of two months after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-verified-and-playable-hits-5000/" target="_blank">hitting 5,000</a> — Valve has now marked over 6,000 games as formally Verified or Playable for the Steam Deck. A big milestone for still pretty early days of the system, that you can now grab <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">without the reservation queue</a> (along with the official Docking Station).</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which includes unlisted titles, these are the current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 2,401</li>
<li>Playable - 3,680</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2,196</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the recently fully Verified titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/brotato-is-going-to-be-my-next-horde-survival-arena-shooter-obsession/" target="_blank">Brotato</a></li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/" target="_blank">Unrailed!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In other (good?) news, Valve <em>finally</em> marked Paladins as Unsupported, after leaving it saying it was Playable even though it was broken by Easy Anti-Cheat for months. I definitely want them to react quite a bit quicker to games being completely broken and this was a prime example of the issues they face with game updates and Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>The Long Dark: Tales from the Far Territory announced with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Long Dark: Tales from the Far Territory is the first paid expansion to the chilly survival game from Hinterland. It was announced just recently and a teaser trailer is up.</p>
<p>With this being the first extra paid content since the game came to Steam in 2014, it should be interesting to see what they've been cooking up for it. As a reminder, they're going to be splitting the game up between the episodic story mode and the survival mode (existing customers keep both).</p>
<p>The big <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/3387295765245751414" target="_blank">announcement</a> covers a lot of the details and is worth a read but in short it's an Expansion Pass that will come with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three new Regions, connected by the long travel zones and hub region. The first of these Regions, “Forsaken Airfield”, and the travel zones all launch with the Expansion Pass. The other two Regions will be released over the course of the 12-month campaign.</li>
<li>Three Tales, narrative-themed Challenges that take place within your Survival game, each revealing insights into the Far Territory’s mysterious history.</li>
<li>New gameplay systems including: Handheld Shortwave, Travois, Safehouse Customization, Trader, Complex Recipes for Cooking, and new Item Variants. We’ll share more info about each of these features on the larger Expansion Pass site we’ll be launching closer to release.</li>
<li>20+ minutes of new Survival music (10+ minutes included in the first Drop).</li>
</ul>
<p>Free updates will still be coming and this is their current plan for free updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full global loot and wildlife refresh. We’ve redone all the loot tables, all the pre-placed loot, and rebalanced the loot economy across the entire game. The Resource refresh will go live for all players when the Expansion launches, and the full Wildlife refresh will come some time next year.</li>
<li>Visor Notes. You’ll be able to find notes under visors (and other locations) that point to supply caches and other useful things, hidden all over the world.</li>
<li>New First-Person animations. We’ve added a whole bunch of new animations for harvesting actions, and more.</li>
<li>Thermos. You know — to keep your drinks warm.</li>
<li>Visual enhancements (focused on high-end systems).</li>
<li>Burdock, a new edible plant.</li>
<li>Improvised Crampons, so you can make them yourself. Watch those ankles!</li>
<li>...and a range of enhancements to existing systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those lists are only some of what is to come, more to be revealed later. Check out the teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pc47uXSOLEY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d622452303b03ffda48e162a5b049f02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pc47uXSOLEY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will cost $19.99 at launch, plus a bundle discount for existing owners of the game, and will launch sometime in December.</p>
<p>Sounds like it has done well too, as they revealed some player numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam (paid): 4,000,000</li>
<li>Xbox (paid): 750,000</li>
<li>Xbox Game Pass (subscription): 2,000,000</li>
<li>PlayStation (paid): 500,000</li>
<li>PlayStation+ (subscription): 1,300,000</li>
<li>Switch (paid): 68,000</li>
<li>WeGame (paid): 125,000</li>
<li>Epic Game Store (combo paid + give-away): 1,500,000+</li>
</ul>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets an official Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a short Beta period, Return to Monkey Island from Terrible Toybox and Devolver Digital now has a Native Linux port available. Sounds like the game is doing well, as said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2060130/view/3389547565085212657" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "Thanks to you, loyal customers, Return to Monkey Island is now the fastest-selling Monkey Island game EVER! At least, I think so. My sales data is a little "fuzzy." But let's go with it!".</p>
<p>"It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.</p>
<p>Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAlDNn43QQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f958408d5ffd2ee1ff2f6a26be8bd30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAlDNn43QQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really great to see them deliver on it just as they said they would for those who appreciate the direct Linux versions.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>

      <title>Victoria 3 is an ambitious society sim that will engross you if you let it</title>
      <author>BTRE</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Development Studios’ latest game depicts a century of history with a focus on economics and society. Facing the challenges of a changing world can be daunting but the game is good at letting you play at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> Key provided by Paradox</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2039858541666641152gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2039858541666641152gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When I first booted up Victoria 3, I was greeted by optimistic, celebratory images that seemed to portray a world where anything could be possible. The preselected nations, categorized neatly in various sorts of tutorials or guided experiences, describe problems and background of each but all invariably have a tinge of hope in a better future. Even after several dozen hours playing the game, dealing with messy wars, social unrest, industrialization and colonialism, I find that initial impression has stuck around.</p>
<p>The map is probably the prettiest yet in a Paradox title with the art direction really hitting all the right notes. Things like major rivers, lakes, islands, mountains and other major features more or less accurately-represented around the world as delicate clouds float by, wisps of smoke rise from volcanoes, and the occasional signs of wildlife. Signs of civilization are also depicted with cities growing, railways extending and trains running about, and mines and industry popping up as you build them up. It’s a pleasure to look at even when zoomed out, as the map takes a more paper-like look and trade routes and country names appear.</p>
<p>All of this gives an impression that there’s many parts to the whole. And, make no mistake, this is a complex game. It, in fact, revels in its complexity; adjusting tariffs on exported goods, bolstering support for groups such as industrialists in order to pass legislation, and making sure your citizens have not only basic goods but can purchase luxury goods are all the meat of the gameplay. With that in mind, the game seems content to let the player figure things out at their own pace: the world continues to run more or less in sensible ways even without the player there to steer things along. Through the various in-game tutorials and guidance, the tool tip system, and good old fashioned trial and error I was able to come to grips with how things work.</p>
<p>The heart of the game is how it portrays its society. The population is broken down into Pops which are units that represent the class, education, ethnicity and the like. These are not necessarily politically active but those that are will support various interest groups such as landowners, the clergy, or trade unions. Depending on their clout and whether or not they are part of the government, it may affect which laws can be passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7931070881666641149gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7931070881666641149gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Good management makes most political realities feasible and stable. When the population’s various needs aren’t being met, it opens the door to radicalization. Enough of that and there may be demands for reforms like, say, implementing limited voting rights. And, well, those with clout and in-power who benefit from the way things are will be against that sort of thing. So pushing through any sort of change can quickly become hazardous—political instability may lead to rebellions and secessionist movements. Figuring out how to keep your country from devolving into chaos while continuing to expand the economy or your nation’s borders is a tough balancing act.</p>
<p>The tension in between potential economical and social reform makes for interesting gameplay and it’s not just the obvious big things like ending serfdom or universal suffrage that can cause a stir. More than once I found myself with long periods of tension and civil war when I pushed too hard or too fast in any given direction and had to back down and accommodate my interest groups in order to not fracture my country.</p>
<p>There is a varied bag of tools and ways to shape things in the direction that you may want over longer periods of time. Laws allowing for secret police to keep radicals down will help the more polarized things are but more subtle tools like suppressing or bolstering interest groups are also available. Incidentally, those tools are lost the more open your society becomes. Something like protected speech means that the government can no longer use some of its more heavy-handed approaches. The events that pop up from time to time with issues of the day (like a mine collapse) become a handy way of placating (or radicalizing!) parts of the population.</p>
<p>Managing the economy is something else that’s a continuous balancing act. On the one hand, growing the resource and industrial base as large as you can in order to be able to afford a large army or provide for a large population is an obvious goal. On the other, focusing too much on any one area can make things harder in the long run: being the top producer of steel is great and all but without investing in administrative buildings it’s difficult to run the country and without universities it’s difficult to find qualified workers for more modern production techniques, let alone keep up with technological research. As you might expect, those things aren’t exactly directly profitable. And go too far with certain industry and your population may not be able to afford staple goods anymore and … what’s that? In the meantime the nation has fallen into debt and has to pass higher taxes to fix its budget issues which can quickly radicalize the population which, in turn, introduces more problems into the equation.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6557602081666641151gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6557602081666641151gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Supply and demand drive growth as might be expected but things like the economic laws set in place may allow for subsidizing industry and for collecting tariffs on import or export routes. Basic, extractive, industries remain relevant all throughout the game although they may be modernized like all other industries. Part of the challenge is figuring out what to manage and when as there are often trade-offs to consider; using new techniques may create greater output but may require additional resources like coal or oil and optimizing by automating and reducing the workforce is great—so long as those unemployed laborers can find other jobs and not radicalize. I’ve experimented a lot in various short games I tried and have come to understand a fair deal over the many hours I put in. Although I’m certain there’s a lot more that I have yet to learn. I couldn’t even begin to venture on whether or not there’s an “optimal” way of playing as the circumstances of each nation affect how the economy develops.</p>
<p>That each nation has its own resource limitations is one of the main drivers of conflict and colonization in the game. This conflict isn’t usually war, however. Instead of declaring war outright, nations engage in what are termed “diplomatic plays”, a stated objective against a nation such as taking a state, forcing it to open up its markets, becoming a protectorate etc. It proceeds by phases and nations which have an interest in the region may take sides (or be swayed to take one by promises of something). Things only escalate to a war if neither side backs down and things like mobilizing troops can serve as a bluff to get others to concede. Once mobilized, however, nations can’t demobilize until their conflict is over and, worse still, may convince others that they need to intervene militarily, which may unexpectedly turn a trifle into a real costly mess.</p>
<p>It’s a clever system but not without its flaws. I found that the AI is a little too easy to sway if a little groundwork is done between plays, such as raising relationships. In essence, if a big-hitter country is trying to intervene somewhere, it is too easy to get another great power to intervene on your side and, if war breaks out, bear the brunt of the fighting. While 19th century was the century of the balance of power doctrine as best exemplified by disastrous interventions like the Crimean War, it is still odd to see a nation like France intervene against the UK in the Opium Wars instead of joining in to take a slice of the Chinese market for itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/101977251666641151gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/101977251666641151gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Ideology also seems to not really factor in; reactionary countries will intervene in favor of revolutionary ones and vice-versa in a manner that doesn’t quite feel like Bismarkian Realpolitik. Given that in the game’s time period covers the height of imperialism, the rise of (and reaction to) socialist politics and, later, fascism, it can feel a little jarring. As an example: mismanagement and internal conflicts drove me to adopt socialist policies and become a council (i.e. soviet) republic. There was an attempt at an undemocratic counter-revolution that escalated to a civil war. Austria, which had managed to remain an absolutist monarchy, took my side against its ideological bedfellows because I offered them a relatively unimportant concession. I avoided a prolonged civil war and Austria got an "obligation" from me which it used to call me into an minor conflict later on. I clearly won that exchange.</p>
<p>Likewise, I like the war system and its abstraction, overall, but find that there are strange aspects to it that likely need more tweaks. It’s a more hands-off system with mobilized troops being under the command of generals who attack and defend along fronts as best as they can. I am fine with the loss of tactical control because things like technology and personality traits go a long way in determining outcome. What I take issue with is how there’s very little intermediacy in the scale of conflicts. In other words, local conflicts don’t really exist and colonial powers will send their largest armies almost every time, often into places far from their origin like Africa or Asia to fight.</p>
<p>I’ve also failed to see any sort of World War 1-type conflicts that involve the whole world and millions of casualties happen, even when multiple great powers participate. Casualties are not nearly high enough and the stakes that are fought over aren’t large enough—there is a lack of postwar negations for particularly large conflicts. It may run counter to the diplomatic play system but the time period depicted by the game also had one of the most consequential conferences in history: the Paris Peace Conference that lead to the Treaty of Versailles. The changes to the world order went beyond the prewar stated aims. So even when larger conflicts erupt, their results feel anticlimactic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17283015011666641150gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17283015011666641150gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There’s also not enough that makes each country have its own unique feel beyond economics and laws. Yes, that does make each session play out differently but in terms of general objectives it’s much more directionless. The little potential direction that is there left me wanting more. For example, there are conditions for unifying Germany as one of the powers in the region. Another for restoring the emperor to power in Japan. Yet another for the potential fracturing of China. But these feel tacked on rather than part of the core identity of each—what drove them to act in a certain way in history beyond simple economics or vague notions of prestige or power. It’s a sandbox game, I understand, but there’s little of the atmosphere that lead to specific approaches.</p>
<p>Another strange omission, I think, is that colonialism is just treated in a rather matter-of-fact way. Setting up colonies is a matter of having the law in your country, declaring an interest in a region and hitting a button. Rarely this may lead to a war with the nation whose territory you are stealing. It is an uninteresting execution. Given that issues that concern interest groups and the characters that lead them may see events and choices, it feels odd that there isn’t anything like it for colonial management. In fact, the only event that I saw along those lines was when another colonial power attempted to rile up the natives against me. It’s not only strange that the natives have no real representation in terms of events but also that your own Pops don’t have their own events regarding their stances on the colonies especially given that all sorts of other political movements and stances are of concern to them.</p>
<p>The computer opponents are fairly competent despite my complaints about some of their oddities. They expand and secure their interests with relish and compete with the player on many fronts and are eager to pursue hegemony not only economically but diplomatically by signing treaties and pacts of all sorts. Still, overall, I’d have to say that ultimately Victoria 3 is a game that you are playing against yourself. What matters the most is your own population and economy and all that’s going on beyond your own borders is of secondary concern. It’s a game that lets you play at your own pace, with your own level of understanding and get something out of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9210924311666641573gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9210924311666641573gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With all the caveats and complaints I may have about some of the design implementations, I think that the fundamentals of the games are solid. Despite some of my complaints that boil down to “I wish there was more content,” its a game that has content galore as-is. Though I crossed the 20-hour mark without really realizing it, the 40-hour mark with pleasure. Even late last night I found myself playing more while trying to wrangle all of my thoughts into coherent form for this review. While I’m not sure I’ve managed to explain clearly, I think I’ll say that it’s easy to forgive the imperfections I’ve encountered on account of its polished and appealing core gameplay.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there’s nothing else quite like Victoria 3 out there. It may not be the perfect society simulator but it’s certainly a very ambitious one and I’m grateful that it doesn’t try to run away from that fact. It is a game as optimistic in its presentation as it is the belief that its players will enjoy themselves the more they immerse themselves in it.</p>

      <title>SCS Software hope Euro Truck Simulator 2 has another &#39;decade of further growth&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Euro Truck Simulator 2 from SCS Software recently celebrated its <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/10/euro-truck-simulator-2s-10th-anniversary.html" target="_blank">10th anniversary</a>, and it seems there's absolutely no stopping it.</p>
<p>A huge success for the developer with it having sold over 13 million copies, along with 80 million DLCs purchased. That's an incredible number, more than 1 million sales every year since release. It's no surprise then that the developer plans to keep on pushing it, as they said they "do hope that Euro Truck Simulator 2 has at least another decade of further growth in front of it" and that "there are so many features will still want to implement, and so much new stuff we plan to bring you".</p>
<p>In this case, it seems there's simply no need at all for a third entry because this one is continually upgraded, it keeps expanding and obviously it's selling well for SCS.</p>
<p>The next DLC release for the game will be with the West Balkans, with no current ETA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discover, deliver and expand your trucking company to the countries of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia.</p>
<p>From large bustling cities to the countryside filled with beautiful nature, you will be able to explore what the Western Balkans have to offer.</p>
<p>You can look forward to many new things that these countries have to offer. Whether in terms of the industry, nature, landmarks, road networks, or a lot of other exciting content!</p>

      <title>System76 upgrade the Thelio desktops with Intel 13th Gen and new AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out for a new desktop? Want one from a company that builds them for Linux and has their own Linux distribution? <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a> just gave the Thelio line a nice big upgrade. Available across the Thelio and Thelio Mira, with the Thelio Major sticking to AMD Threadripper.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20743272571666625335gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20743272571666625335gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release: "What sets the Thelio desktop line apart from other desktops is its system-specific thermal engineering. The internals are engineered for optimal airflow, allowing the user’s components to perform at their best. Now, with the addition of Intel and AMD’s latest processors, Thelio and Thelio Mira will see boosted performance thanks to enhancements from CPU manufacturers."</p>
<p>Even better, you can save a whole lot of monies right now too as System76 are running a Halloween-themed promotion where the more you upgrade the bigger the discount. This applies to desktops <em>and</em> laptops, so you don't have to grab a Thelio to save.</p>
<p>Current starting prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thelio: $949</li>
<li>Mira: $999</li>
<li>Major: $3,499</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam continues growing hitting over 30 million online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days of the original green Steam client, that no one particularly liked? Hard to believe that it now sees over 30 million people online.</p>
<p>This huge new record was hit yesterday, with the new all-time peak according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" target="_blank">Steam Charts</a> page at 30,027,003. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> lists it as 30,032,005. During this time the top games were Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, PUBG: Battlegrounds, Apex Legends and Lost Ark. So three out of the top five when Steam was at its peak work on Linux officially — not bad. About 8.5 million people were actually in-game at the time.</p>

<p>While I have you here: what have you been playing recently, what's your current top game on Linux? I've been sucked in really hard by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/brotato-is-going-to-be-my-next-horde-survival-arena-shooter-obsession/" target="_blank">Brotato</a>, trying out all the different characters and weapons has been a lot of fun.</p>

      <title>Widelands, The Settlers II inspired strategy game version 1.1 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love strategy games? Originally inspired by The Settlers II, the free and open source game Widelands has a big new release out now.</p>
<p>If you've somehow never played The Settlers: you start off with a small amount of territory, and you build up your village and gradually expand across the map. It's real-time but compared to a lot of strategy games it has a much slower and more relaxed style to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10630850521666622754gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10630850521666622754gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's new in Widelands 1.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three new scenarios</strong>: One each for the Atlantean and Frisian campaigns, and a new standalone singleplayer mission.</li>
<li>An <strong>add-ons webserver</strong> allows efficient down- and uploading of add-ons as well as interactions such as voting and commenting on add-ons.</li>
<li><strong>High-resolution images</strong> for many units.</li>
<li><strong>Multithreading</strong> provides smoother performance.</li>
<li>Multiple enhancements to the in-game <strong>encyclopedia.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong>: Manage your alliances during the game.</li>
<li><strong>Fastplace</strong>: Assign custom shortcuts to buildings to place them with one keystroke.</li>
<li>In-game loading and restarting of games and scenarios.</li>
<li>Save and load in-game windows.</li>
<li>Editor tool history dialog.</li>
<li>Various AI enhancements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's available easily on Linux thanks to <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.widelands.Widelands" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. Or see more download links of their <a href="https://www.widelands.org/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve starts roll-out of the Steam Deck controller configurator to desktop Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3428954061810264313" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> replaces the old Big Picture Configurator for individual games, with the one from the Steam Deck and it's quite an improvement.</p>
<p>Big Picture mode was always slow, wanted full-screen and was generally a nuisance on desktop. The new one from the Steam Deck, that should eventually replace Big Picture entirely is much more fluid, can be resized and allows you to easily move the window around. It is a big improvement in just interacting with it as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9110501641666434615gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9110501641666434615gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19748482271666434569gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19748482271666434569gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20511981431666434703gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20511981431666434703gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7989993241666434825gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7989993241666434825gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Click screenshots to enlarge them.</em></p>
<p>To be clear, this is available via the right click -&gt; manage -&gt; controller layout menu on individual games. Valve has not yet replaced it for the generic controller settings from the main Steam settings area. Amusingly, they haven't quite ripped out all of the Steam Deck specific language yet though with a few screens just straight-up from the Deck (woops).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Full patch notes:<br/>
<strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve responsiveness to changes in the local network connection</li>
<li>Remove “Connecting to Steam…” delay when starting a game without any local network connection</li>

<li>Improved support for third-party PS3/PS4/PS5 controllers</li>

      <title>Valve put up a few more fixes in the new Steam Deck Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Beta update is available for the Steam Deck, with Valve adding in just a few more "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3414317363016822648" target="_blank">Friday fixes</a>". It's available in the Beta and Preview channels. You can opt into this in: Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved login times for users with large libraries.</li>
<li>Fixed links to store/discussions/etc in the Library.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when trying to view emojis in virtual keyboard in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Fixed improper DPI scaling on initial load.</li>
<li>Decreased load time of virtual keyboard and standalone controller configurator in desktop mode after the first time.</li>
<li>Properly resize virtual keyboard in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Streamlined joining a voice chat in groups without multiple voice chat channels. The footer button will now directly join or create a temporary channel rather than go to the voice chat management dialog.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone with 2,623 games in their Steam Library, I very much appreciate the updates to make the experience smoother because login time and initial load time on Deck is a bit slow for large libraries.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for Valve to fix or add next to the Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>Minecraft on Steam Deck Guide with Prism Launcher (and gamepad support)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Prism Launcher</a> has been released for Minecraft, rising from the ashes of the controversy with PolyMC (that you should no longer use). Here's all the info on it, plus a fresh Steam Deck Guide. I won't reiterate what happened with PolyMC, see the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/if-you-use-polymc-for-minecraft-you-should-switch-away-now/" target="_blank">previous article</a> on that, and please keep the comments focused on Prism and the Guide.</p>
<p>What is it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prism Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that was forked from MultiMC. It allows the creation, and management of multiple installations of the game, or "instances" rather, each having their own separate mods, resource packs, settings, and more. While originally being forked over packaging/redistribution concerns, Prism Launcher brings new and exciting features developed by the community for the community. Furthermore, Prism Launcher is still just as true to its roots as ever in providing a project that vows to never bring hostility to those looking to fork, redistribute, or repackage, so long as the terms of our license are respected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, it gives you lots of features the official launcher doesn't have, along with really easy modding and it's great to use on Linux / Steam Deck too!</p>
<p>Here's a little guide video showing a fresh install, along with how to get gamepad controls thanks to <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controllable" target="_blank">Controllable</a> and some extra tips:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M8oqFUl791Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/791f47e726d2a2f07ac017f2595b78c1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M8oqFUl791Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text Guide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Steam Deck Desktop Mode -&gt; Open Discover and search for Prism Launcher, then install it.</li>
<li>From the KDE Plasma Menu, find Prism, right click and select Add to Steam.</li>
<li>Open Prism, select Manage Profiles and go through the process to add your Microsoft Account.</li>
<li>Then you can select Add Instance, and pick whatever Minecraft you want to install.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Gamepad Support:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the Edit button with an Instance selected.</li>
<li>Go to Mods on the left panel, select Download Mods.</li>
<li>Select CurseForge on the left, then search for and install Controllable.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the basic setup done.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to have Prism load a single instance, you can add this to the end of your Steam Launch Option in the Properties window of Prism: <code class="inline-code">-l *instance name*</code></p>
<p>Additionally, if you still wish to show the launcher, say you wish to pick from multiple instances, you may want to have it close automatically once you're playing Minecraft. Find those in the main Settings, select Minecraft on the left and down the bottom are two tickboxes to control this behaviour.</p>

      <title>Persona 5 Royal is a great Steam Deck experience</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With another major release from SEGA and Atlus now here with Persona 5 Royal, the good news is that it's Steam Deck Verified and it really does work nicely.</p>
<p>It's really interesting to see how far Proton has come as a Windows game compatibility layer, considering the previous game had numerous problems for quite some time and yet this works right at release. Nice to see the work from Valve and CodeWeavers on it paying off.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zQtliJ69FZY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e3426c5a41bde74b16371561891f4a26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zQtliJ69FZY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Out of the box, you'll get somewhere between 2 and a half to 3 hours on a single Steam Deck charge, if you keep at it 60FPS which is pretty reasonable. Probably even longer than that, since the power draw dips down every time there's a cut-scene (and there's many). You will easily get even more juice putting it down to 30FPS, which in this type of games feels fine.</p>
<p>Text entry even brings up a full-screen text area with the Deck on-screen keyboard, showing it was properly tested and hooked up for the release. That, and the performance is pretty much spot-on, with it mostly sticking to 60FPS. Honestly, it has been one of the best Deck Verified experiences I've seen yet.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore Tokyo, unlock Personas, customize your own personal Thieves Den, experience alternate endings, and more.</li>
<li>Become the ultimate Phantom Thief and defy conventions, discover the power within, and fight for justice in the definitive version of Persona 5 Royal.</li>
<li>Includes over 40 items of previously released downloadable content.</li>
<li>Choose between Japanese and English VO.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who never got into Persona before, this has been a really great experience and I would now somewhat consider myself a Persona fan.</p>
<p>Buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/persona-5-royal?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>RimWorld - Biotech and the free 1.4 update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ludeon Studios have just released a rather big expansion to the colony building sim RimWorld with Biotech, along with the free 1.4 update for all players.</p>
<p>This big new expansion really does change the game in quite a number of ways. With you being able to have children colonists now, who will grow up and you will be able to choose traits for them and hopefully turn them into productive workers. There's also the ability to turn colonists into a mechanitor, a person with a special brain implant that lets them psychically command semi-living machines. On top of that you also get gene editing, giving you the ability to create xenohumans with special exotic traits.</p>
<p>As a reminder on the 1.4 patch that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup performance improvements.</li>
<li>Painting and color customization for walls, floors, furniture, and lights.</li>
<li>Actually useful shelves that store lots of stuff.</li>
<li>Two new turret types.</li>
<li>Starting possessions for some colonists.</li>
<li>Rot stink from corpses.</li>
<li>New mod manager UI.</li>
<li>New options menu.</li>
<li>Heat overlay.</li>
<li>Quest search bar.</li>
<li>Tile inspector.</li>

      <title>Ubuntu 22.10 &#39;Kinetic Kudu&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical has released the latest version of their Linux distribution <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> with Ubuntu 22.10 "Kinetic Kudu".</p>
<p>This includes another 6 months of software improvements throughout the whole stack since the last release. This is not a LTS release though, with it only being supported for 9 months until July 2023. If you need to have a fully stable system that keeps being updated, stick with Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10101023211666352466gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10101023211666352466gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14759168621666352465gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14759168621666352465gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the big new features includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux kernel 5.19, which supports the new futex_waitv that can help gaming along with lots of new hardware support.</li>
<li>PipeWire for audio by default.</li>
<li>Default image apps now support the .webp format.</li>
<li>GNOME 43.</li>
<li>Various improvements for Raspberry Pi users.</li>
<li>Plus all the usual updates to various included software.</li>
<li><a href="https://ubuntuunity.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Unity</a> is now an official supported flavour.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a video overview, our friends at <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/ubuntu-22-10-video-new-features" target="_blank">OMG Ubuntu</a> gave it a fresh look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MzBsI9XZpEg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5d872fa622b2de03111ccde5aaff5892.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MzBsI9XZpEg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://ubuntu.com//blog/what-the-steam-snap-is-evolving" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Canonical also detailed more info about their Snap package of Steam. They noted it has seen "more than 75 thousand downloads", so it's clearly a lot more popular than comments across various places would make you believe. Sounds like they're doing better on getting driver updates out faster too.</p>

      <title>Valve doing quick hotfixes in Proton for big game releases on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an interesting one I came across recently. It seems Valve are doing small hotfix releases of Proton, to go along with some of the bigger releases to get them working.</p>
<p>The problem is that each release of Proton needs a fair amount of quality assurance testing by Valve and their partners CodeWeavers. Proton releases are quite a while between, and with the amount of games releasing constantly, they don't always make a new release in time to get them all working on Steam Deck / Linux.</p>
<p>So this is where quick hotfixes come in.</p>
<p>Recently there was a Beta of <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais showed off on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1578571751696797696" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. In the replies, they <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1578573603498790914" target="_blank">noted</a> "All the fixes are now deployed on Proton Hotfix and that branch is selected by default for the game for all players.".</p>
<p>This happened again recently with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, with Griffais posting on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1582138691514175489" target="_blank">Twitter</a> "We have just deployed a performance hotfix for Cyberpunk 2077 on the Deck, no update necessary beyond just restarting the device to get it picked up.".</p>
<p>Today we have <em>Gotham Knights</em> releasing, and once again Valve are on top of it. Gene Park from The Washington Post noted on <a href="https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1583080913428414465" target="_blank">Twitter</a> how it wouldn't run on Steam Deck and Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1583263905845227522" target="_blank">replied</a> "We've just made a couple fixes and backend changes - it should launch if you un-force Proton selection and try again (or force Proton Hotfix).".</p>
<p><em>Since Valve set it automatically, you don't need to do anything, unless you forced a version of Proton then you need to undo it.</em></p>
<p>No doubt there will be plenty more of these quick fixes in future, as developers find so many ways to do things differently and break things or use things that the main Proton releases don't yet support. Valve are up against a moving target for Windows compatibility with Proton. Eventually though, Proton hopefully get to a stage where things like this aren't needed.</p>
<p><em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/proton-70-5-is-coming-soon-improving-steam-deck-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-5 is currently in testing</a> to bring more game support to Steam Deck / Linux.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta adds way to view components, Valve confirms fan changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3414317363013182309" target="_blank">Steam Deck Beta</a> and it's a rather interesting one, with a few nice new features along with the ability to see what components your Steam Deck shipped with. You can also now skip the intro video.</p>
<p>Skipping the intro video was no doubt added as developers at Valve laughed at how someone set their boot video <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/y3htzd/help_ive_set_my_boot_video_to_shrek_and_now_i/" target="_blank">to the movie Shrek</a>, and had to sit through it.</p>
<p>The new ability to view your Steam Deck components is also an interesting one, Valve said they did this to "provide further clarity and transparency about the components and their sources for your specific Steam Deck" and so you don't have to open it up. Useful for repairs and replacements. You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/hardwareused" target="_blank">view via the web</a> directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8876279461666346820gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8876279461666346820gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, it also included a note about fan noise. Valve confirmed they've put in some engineered foam on the Steam Deck backplate to reduce noise, along with confirmation both fan types are still being used. This was likely inspired by a user who fixed their noise <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uckns3/how_i_fixed_my_whiny_delta_fan_with_electrical/" target="_blank">with electrical tape</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors started a craze and the 1.0 release is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors is a time-survival <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde game</a> that started something of a craze, with many games copying their blueprint and now Vampire Survivors 1.0 is out.</p>
<p>With an Overwhelmingly Positive user review score from over 100,000 people, it's clearly hit the mark and it's easy to see why. With simple pick up and go gameplay, and the still low price at the 1.0 release — it's an ideal game to sink some time into regardless of it being on a coffee break or half your evening.</p>
<p>In the 1.0 release they've added quite a lot including a new event stage, new character art, a new weapon, a new B-side soundtrack, lots more translations, Twitch integration, an "Inverse Mode" that flips the maps, an Endless Mode that gets progressively more difficult forever and lots more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aS7JqyHdQQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b0d16ad23a843acd6bd4e927d422e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aS7JqyHdQQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Going by their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/vampire-survivors-10-coming-october-20th-seems-a-linux-port-is-still-planned/" target="_blank">previously announced roadmap</a>, they're still working on a game engine port along with a supported Linux version once that's done.</p>
<p>For such a simple game, I've sunk a surprising amount of hours into it. With the 1.0 release, no doubt I will be playing plenty more of it, although it has to compete with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/brotato-is-going-to-be-my-next-horde-survival-arena-shooter-obsession/" target="_blank">Brotato</a> for my time which is very similar and also great. I really do love just how insane these games get once you've put a few minutes into them, with the screen covered by enemies as all your abilities are flying around.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2777375981666285538gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2777375981666285538gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Vampire Survivors 1.0 - my first run today</em></p>
<p>There's just something about these simple games I can't get enough of. I can easily recommend you go and pick this one up, lots of replay value and plenty to unlock as you go through it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>An interview with the creator of Deckmate, the Steam Deck attachment system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you seen the <a href="https://deckmate.me/" target="_blank">Deckmate</a> yet? I'm a big fan and use it quite often. A thoroughly useful attachment system for the Steam Deck and I had the chance to speak to the creator about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16919121991666208578gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16919121991666208578gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Q: First of all, can you introduce yourself?</strong></p>
<p>"My name is Siri Ramos. Mechanical engineer by trade, maker/designer also by trade, DIY home renovator by night."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get started making things like the Deckmate?</strong></p>
<p>"Surprisingly, it’s only recently that I started to make the connection between my childhood desires and my current skill set. I always watched How it’s Made on the Discovery Channel with intense fascination and was endlessly entertained by gadgets and product design. Looking back now it seems like destiny that I ended up doing what I do.</p>
<p>It was only by pure chance that I ended up in my field. I didn’t even know it existed until I was a junior in college. I stumbled across it during a career fair while I was searching for my first internship. Another coincidence: I studied the exact right discipline that would land me a job in this field.</p>
<p>Once I discovered Product Design Engineering, my entire focus landed on getting that first job in the field. I took design for manufacturing classes, my senior thesis was a product idea I wanted to make, I delved into the world of startup design. The field seemed endless at the time, and I was at just the right school to tackle it, Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>By the time my curriculum was complete, I had one big choice to make. On one hand, I had landed an incredible job offer from Apple as a Product Design Engineer. On the other hand, we were getting some traction with some seed round investors on our senior thesis idea to redesign the Epipen to be flat packed as an iPhone case.</p>
<p>The choice boiled down to: Do I venture out and make my own product, or do I accept the job offer from Apple?</p>
<p>In my young naivete, I turned down the Apple job.</p>
<p>We got a seed round of funding, and we all aligned our lives to try and make a brand new medical device. 3 broke and inexperienced college kids taking on one of the most complex type of product design that exists. Medical devices, in hindsight, was one of the worst entry points to release a product. Regulatory compliance, high cost of failure (people dying!), and very little money add up to a company that was doomed to fail from the very start.</p>
<p>Needless to say, less than a year later we were even broker and at each other’s throats as founders. I made the tough decision to leave on a Friday morning in October.</p>
<p>That afternoon, I emailed the hiring manager at Apple that had previously offered me the job. Tail sheepishly tucked back, I asked if he still had a role open for head count.</p>
<p>What happened next honestly astonished me. He called me immediately after opening my email saying the team was off the following Tuesday to all fly to China for work. He asked if I could come in and interview with the team on Monday before everyone flew out. Of course I said yes.</p>
<p>After a whirlwind of flights and interview prep, I arrived on Monday morning semi-ready for a full 8 hour day of back to back technical interviews. By the end of the design challenge around 4pm, my new manager walked me out and offered me the job. I had the  job offer in hand less than 1 business day after I had quit my startup.</p>
<p>I learned everything I know at Apple. From design for manufacturing to how things are actually made, I consider Apple to be my university for product design. This is where I learned how products are truly made. Not in theory, but in practice and at MASSIVE scales. I was single handedly designing products that were being manufactured at a peak rate of 1 million units per day. Needless to say the engineering side was technical, and it had to be perfect.</p>
<p>I chugged along designing stuff for other companies and startups for over 10 years. It’s only recently that I decided to delve fully  into a little side project I designed called Deckmate."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nl2o0mFkLzA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4addbdfd5d591374080bb47cc64e8957.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nl2o0mFkLzA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get the idea for the Deckmate? Why did you make it?</strong></p>
<p>"Honestly, I got the idea because the Steam Deck needed it. Some things you use and the design is begging for a slight modification. This is what happened to me and the Deck. Within one day of using mine (got an early unit around April), I knew it needed a kickstand at the very least. Then it got my design brain thinking about everything else it could do. It really made me want to have a quick system that could interchange and morph into exactly what I needed based on how I was using the Deck.</p>
<p>After posting the rough idea on Reddit, I got feedback and ideas for other use cases. This is how the VESA mount was born. To be honest this is my favorite mount of all. My Steam deck lives essentially permanently above my PC on a monitor arm unless I’m using it to go.</p>
<p>There are tons more mount ideas in the works, and the system will expand to far more devices as well. My intention is to make Deckmate the Quad-lock for video games. Every mount to fit your needs on any device you own."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you tell us a little about <em>how</em> you actually make it? What’s your process like?</strong></p>
<p>"It all starts in a software program called CAD. I use a professional grade CAD program by Siemens called NX.</p>
<p>The process goes a bit like this: </p>
<ol>
<li>Sit back and process what idea you want to make.</li>
<li>Start modeling in CAD and solidify how it will work</li>
<li>3D print a prototype</li>
<li>Repeat 50 times</li>
</ol>
<p>The modeling in CAD is where a lot of the experience comes in. As you model you need to not only know how to use the program to effectively model what you want, but you need to keep in mind all the constraints that you’ve learned over the years. Everything from manufacturing limitations and cosmetic concerns, to strength and product reliability must be kept in mind when modeling.</p>
<p>It’s very easy with 3D printing to design something that you can print. This is because 3D printing has relatively few manufacturing constraints. When you are designing for Injection molding, the parts have wildly different constraints. This is the big reason the molded parts are different from the 3D printed parts that you can download on the website.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with the design, you reach out to molding suppliers and start a process called DFM (design for manufacture). They process what it will be like to actually make in the mold. Everything from where the material shoots into the empty cavity, where the cooling lines in the steel are, how the plastic flows across the cavity, temperatures and pressures, etc. This is where the really technical stuff gets done and determines how your final product comes out and how reliable it is. Here are some screenshots of that process:"</p>

<p><strong>Q: Had any weird attachment requests from customers?</strong></p>
<p>"The one I always find a little different is people asking about a way to mount a screen above the Deck. It’s a very interesting application, but I don’t think Deckmate is the right solution for it unfortunately. With the spring system in the Deckmate, having a screen mounted wouldn’t do well with vibrations."</p>
<p><strong>Q: It’s been out for a little while now, has it been a success?</strong></p>
<p>"I would say it has been a phenomenal success! I’ve now shipped almost 3,000 orders with only 4 people who wanted to return it. That’s a phenomenal return rate.</p>
<p>More importantly, I get people messaging me every day how much they love it. And that’s my main motivator. I want to make things people love and that can make their lives easier. My biggest indicator of success came when I got an email from a customer who was using their Deckmate system to allow them to mount their Deck to their leg. It honestly melted my heart and it made me feel the most success over anything."</p>

<p><strong>Q: Any plans for more Steam Deck accessories? Or perhaps you have some more attachments for the Deckmate planned?</strong></p>
<p>"There are so many more mounts that I want to tackle: Car mount, airplane mount, ¼-20 camera/tripod mount, etc.</p>
<p>There are also a ton of other devices I want to make grips for: Nintendo switch, All the Aya devices, etc.</p>
<p>With those two approaches together I think Deckmate can become a pretty powerful mounting system for video games!"</p>

      <title>Someone released the FOSS RTS 0 A.D. on Steam without speaking to the developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve has now taken it down.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here's a "fun" one for you. The developers behind the free and open source RTS named <a href="https://play0ad.com/" target="_blank">0 A.D.</a> (pronounced “zero-ey-dee”) have announced that someone (they don't know who) has put it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2158440/0_AD_Empires_Ascendant/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>This is sometimes the perils of open source, as there's a lot of people out their looking to make a quick-buck and they don't care who they burn in the process. To be clear, the version of 0 A.D. that has released on Steam (with it missing the second dot in the name), is not actually from the people who make the game — even though Wildfire Games are listed as the developer on Steam it's not them. Confusing right? Valve allowed it and approved it, so it does make me curious what legal checks are even done for this to happen.</p>
<p>I was notified of this on Twitter, with the official 0 A.D. account <a href="https://twitter.com/play0ad/status/1582881816062873600" target="_blank">tweeting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out the only reason <a class="css-16my406 css-18t94o4 css-4rbku5 css-901oao r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-bcqeeo r-poiln3 r-qvutc0" href="https://twitter.com/YouTube" target="_blank">@YouTube</a> added the game back is because somebody uploaded 0 A.D. to  <a class="css-16my406 css-18t94o4 css-4rbku5 css-901oao r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-bcqeeo r-poiln3 r-qvutc0" href="https://twitter.com/Steam" target="_blank">@Steam</a> without our consent. It also explains the typo in the name…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/play0ad/status/1583100868236546050" target="_blank">tweet</a> sent today by the 0 A.D. team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT: The person who released the game on steam today is charging 8€ for it. Please do not buy it. The game is free and always will be. It might contain viruses and other malware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine it doesn't have anything nefarious inside it, otherwise you really would have to wonder what Valve are doing…</p>
<p>Looking on the official game forum <a href="https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/96792-will-0ad-be-released-on-steam/" target="_blank">there's a topic</a> asking about it, the developers seems to be at a loss as to what is happening.</p>

      <title>AMD to fully reveal next-gen AMD Radeon RDNA 3 in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A short but sweet announcement was sent out by AMD today, as they've now set a date for when they will fully reveal AMD Radeon RDNA 3, their next-gen GPU architecture. Something we had a very brief teaser of when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/amd-announced-qzen-4q-with-ryzen-7000-series-rdna3-teased/" target="_blank">they announced Zen 4</a>.</p>
<p>Their "together we advance_gaming" event will be livestreamed on November 3rd at 1PM PDT / 8PM UTC. As the press released noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced “<strong>together we advance_gaming</strong>,” a livestream event to unveil the next generation of AMD Radeon™ graphics. AMD executives will provide details on the new high-performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA™ 3 architecture that will deliver new levels of performance, efficiency and functionality to gamers and content creators.</p>
<p>The show premieres at 1:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday, November 3, on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AMD" target="_blank">AMD YouTube channel</a>. A replay can be accessed a few hours after the conclusion of the event at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/radeon-rx-graphics" target="_blank">AMD.com/Radeon</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are <em>you</em> really hoping for from AMD RDNA 3?</p>
<p>For me: I'm hoping for power requirements that aren't completely ridiculous (hi NVIDIA), along with cards that don't just serve the top-end. It's not much to ask really is it?</p>

      <title>Silent Hill 2 remake announced and coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A much loved action-horror classic Silent Hill 2 is getting a modern remake and the good news is that it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. So it will most likely run in some form on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet and it's likely a good while off, so it gives Valve (and their partner CodeWeavers) plenty of time to keep on improving the Proton compatibility layer to ensure it's ready for more big hits like this. The Silent Hill 2 remake is being developed by Bloober Team SA, who are known for Layers of Fear, Blair Witch and The Medium.</p>
<p>I remember trying to play the original and "noping" out of it pretty quickly. Scary stuff back then.</p>

      <title>UNCHARTED is great on Steam Deck! Here&#39;s how to fix it on Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection out now and Steam Deck Verified, I've been able to see that it does work great! However, it requires some very small tweaks to get it working on a normal Linux desktop.</p>
<p>No doubt at some point Valve will get these fixes into the Proton compatibility layer directly, but until they've sorted it (which could be weeks / months) here's what to do. Thankfully on the official Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6246" target="_blank">bug tracker</a>, users have been reporting the issues and coming up with solutions.</p>
<p>For <strong>AMD</strong> GPUs you need this Steam launch option set:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">WINEDLLOVERRIDES="amd_ags_x64.dll=b" %command% </code></p>
<p>For <strong>NVIDIA</strong> GPUs you need this Steam launch option set:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 %command%</code></p>
<p>If you don't know how to set a launch option: right click the game in your Steam Library, go to Properties and the General tab has the text box at the bottom:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14900158671666270888gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14900158671666270888gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That should be all you need to do, then the game should load properly on a normal Linux desktop / laptop. On the Steam Deck though, it's click and play. I've been thoroughly impressed with the Steam Deck experience overall, apart from an initial Deck-specific hiccup I experienced that needed a reboot. I seemed to catch a rare bug where Steam Input just stops working but all good after a reboot, so not a problem with the game but a random bug on the Steam Deck itself.</p>
<p>Here's some footage below on Medium (the default) and then later on High settings:</p>

<p>Here's what's changed in version 0.5.12-beta1:</p>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">

      <title>Lucy Dreaming is a quality point and click adventure with great British humour</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You know a game is going to be good, when you're already chuckling away in the first few minutes. Point and click adventure Lucy Dreaming is out now.  Note: the developer sent a key over.</p>
<p>It's a good time to be a point and click adventure fan right? With the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/return-to-monkey-island-gets-a-linux-beta-version/" target="_blank">Return to Monkey Island</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/foolish-mortals-is-an-upcoming-spooky-point-and-click-adventure/" target="_blank">Foolish Mortals</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/sweet-point-and-click-dino-adventure-zid-journey-is-up-on-kickstarter-with-demo/" target="_blank">Zid Journey</a> all mentioned here recently. Anyway, this time it's Lucy Dreaming. Influenced by the classics from the 90s from the pixel-art style to the silly humour, it's a great little game worth your time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OEpatYJIG4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63608b3708efd8f7b7bc4baaa1a6b6c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OEpatYJIG4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The humour might perhaps not be to everyone's tastes though, considering the very Britishness of it and some of the jokes might fly over your head a bit. I certainly appreciated it though! Some pretty clever and very funny references throughout, like the "Now That's What I Call Chill" tape that reminded me of all the classic TV adverts for the music CD collections and the "Sorny" laptop. The references keep going, even in the first room there's a good few to spot but I don't want to spoil it all obviously.</p>
<p>If you usually like these types of point and clickers, you can't really go wrong with it. Plenty of logical puzzles and item hunting, with combining various items and an unusual way to dry your clothes. Lucy Dreaming didn't have a big budget, it was a tiny team that made it and yet it's quite a memorable little experience.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a wide variety of detailed dreams and real-world locations from a neon-lit comedy club with an unusual clientele to a post-apocalyptic boulangerie<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Encounter a cast of characters from Lucy’s maniacal brother to a giant duck with a bread problem.</li>
<li>Explore rich environments with an abundance of witty retorts to almost everything you can point your cursor at.</li>
<li>Reveal hidden Easter eggs and pop culture references.</li>
<li>Enjoy the distinctive and beautifully realised voice acting (English)</li>
<li>Travel instantly between scenes with a double-click.</li>
<li>Having trouble? Just hit the space bar to get a sneaky peek of each scene’s hotspots.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532710/Lucy_Dreaming/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and <a href="https://tallstorygames.itch.io/lucy-dreaming" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>FIFA? Nah, give me more of Pixel Cup Soccer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more Football in your life? Yes, I said Football, get over it. Pixel Cup Soccer - Ultimate Edition is officially out now along with Native Linux support. This game took over from Pixel Cup Soccer 17, which the developer unlisted on Steam, as this big new version is quite different as the developer said "the essence of the new game is the same, the technological differences are huge".</p>
<p>It recently left Early Access and it is also Steam Deck Verified, so could be a good one to look at for you sports fans, especially with the latest FIFA being unsupported (and it has a Mostly Negative rating). This definitely looks promising with a Very Positive user rating too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n17quOCXIeU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eda3299ac9f58669b513ab40dc311552.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n17quOCXIeU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simplified Controls For Casual Players.</li>
<li>Easy to pick up and enjoy, with clean and challenging gameplay.</li>
<li>Retro-style art resembling old games and evoking nostalgia.</li>
<li>Women’s Soccer.</li>
<li>Penalties, Free Kicks.</li>
<li>Fouls, injuries, yellow and red cards.</li>
<li>Tactical and Strategy panels, to manage player substitutions, team formation, and attitude.</li>
<li>Deep gameplay mechanics: short pass, through pass, lob pass, aiming when shooting, controlled shots, player skills, super shots, etc.</li>
<li>Lots of Animations (overhead kick, scorpion kick, scissor kick, diving header, etc.)</li>
<li>Challenging AI. Teams with very different playing styles (ie: Catenaccio like Italy or Tiki-Taka like Brasil).</li>
<li>Many game settings, including Zoom Level, VSync, Slow motion, Assisted mode, Language Selection, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Growing up playing the likes of Sensible World of Soccer on the Amiga, this game definitely ticks a lot of nostalgia boxes for me.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620540/Pixel_Cup_Soccer__Ultimate_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There is also a demo available too!</p>

      <title>GB Operator is a fun gadget for Game Boy fans tested on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/play-real-game-boy-cartridges-on-steam-deck-linux-with-gb-operator/" target="_blank">Recently</a> I mentioned <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/" target="_blank">GB Operator</a> a little USB gadget that reads cartridges of the Game Boy, Game Boy Colour and Game Boy Advance. After giving it a go myself (personal purchase), I'm impressed and a little in love.</p>
<p>The idea is that it allows you to play games from cartridges directly using a built-in emulator with their Operator app, along with the ability to back up to roms to have your own private collection that you can then use in whatever emulator you want. You can also mess with save files, allowing you to back them up (say if your cart won't save properly) or edit them for your own entertainment.</p>
<p>Here's a first look at the device with a Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZMxK3SK30Dc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70610e4edfbb125415326b9c9c90918b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZMxK3SK30Dc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As mentioned in the video it's not perfected yet. They need an easy way to cleanly exit the cart on Steam Deck, with it currently relying on keyboard ESC which doesn't work properly. It also sometimes won't open the Operator app, unless you unplug the device and plug it back in. Some small quirks that can probably be fixed quite easily but overall a pretty fun experience to begin playing with.</p>
<p>If you're a collector of retro games, this is great. Awesome for game preservation too and the fact that it works on Linux so easily, that's another big tick in the box.</p>
<p>Once I've had more time to play with it, I'll have a lot more thoughts but if you do have any comments or questions do let me know.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck adds External Display Safe Mode setting, 30 second boot videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now the official Steam Deck Docking Station is out, a lot more people are testing the Steam Deck on external displays showing up numerous issues so Valve has added a little something to help.</p>
<p>In true Valve style when it comes to the Steam Deck, they released a Beta and then only a few <em>hours</em> later put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3414317363006517615" target="_blank">stable release</a>. They sure do love pushing things out early. This does pull in the changes from a bunch of recent other Beta versions too so here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>General</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>The Quick Access Menu will now open to the notifications tab when you have new friend chat messages, game invites, or voice chat invites</li>
<li>Notifications for Game Invites in the Quick Access Menu now have an option in the footer to accept them without having to navigate to the chat window</li>
<li>Added External Display Safe Mode to developer settings. When enabled, the next time an external display is plugged in Steam Deck will pick a low resolution configuration, which may help in some cases where the external display has issues.</li>
<li>Increase boot animation max length from 10 seconds to 30 seconds</li>
<li>Added controller-specific glyphs on the Lock screen</li>
<li>Don't show the "switch to desktop" option in the power menu when the lock screen is active.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Steam group chats with long names or descriptions could cause break the layout of the chat screen</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the Lock screen where you'd have to dismiss the On-Screen Keyboard manually if you slept the device while it was up</li>
<li>Fixed invoking the On-Screen-Keyboard while already in a full-screen keyboard input scenario causing bad behavior.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the Performance Overlay would still show when set to off.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Restore the previous behavior of using stick deflection rather than the capacitive sensor for Radial Menus that don't have center buttons bound</li>
<li>Fixed an in-game crash</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with editing command settings from inside the virtual menu screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm currently still testing the official Steam Deck Docking Station myself, and should have some thoughts up at the end of the week after I've played around with it some more.</p>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine version 7.19 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just before the weekend hit, a new development release of the Windows compatibility layer Wine went up with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.19" target="_blank">version 7.19</a>. This is part of Steam Play Proton, which allows you to play tons of Windows games on Steam Deck and Linux desktops. Once a year they make a big new stable release, and eventually Proton updates to it too.</p>
<p>Release highlights for Wine 7.19:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for storing DOS attributes on disk.</li>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.5.</li>
<li>Support for MPEG-4 audio format.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>17 bugs this time were noted to be solved including fixes for: Resident Evil Revelations 2; Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Kheops Studio adventure games, Sonic Adventure DX and various other miscellaneous bug fixes.</p>
<p>Want help managing Wine installs? I usually use the <a href="http://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> app, which makes it pretty easy.</p>

      <title>Sweet point and click dino adventure Zid Journey is up on Kickstarter with demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your point and click adventures and want to see more? Zid Journey is a new one from the team behind Zniw Adventure. It's a classic 2D point 'n click adventure game, developed in a tiny team from Poland. Just like the first game, it will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Zid Journey tells the story of Zid, and focuses on his quest of reuniting a little Daspletosaurus hatchling with its lost parents, while also trying to uncover his own mysterious origins. The developers said that their first game, Zniw Adventure, was "welcomed with enthusiasm and enjoyed by many players" and so this encouraged them to continue making more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EvwbdgQBDas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6f857bc201c59a1bf820bc716d08782.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EvwbdgQBDas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A relaxing point 'n click with an cartoon/comic-book aesthetic and familiar prehistoric world.</li>
<li>Charming visuals featuring cartoony art style, hand-drawn backgrounds, and frame-by-frame animations!</li>
<li>Over 20 dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures to meet during your journey.</li>
<li>Visit new places, landmarks, and settlements in the lore-rich, prehistoric world of Polisemia!</li>
<li>Seveal unlockables, including dinopedia pages and bonus content!</li>
<li>A safe adventure for everyone - no gore, blood, or bad language.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their Kickstarter campaign only has a small goal of €8,000 which has already been hit. A very small goal to make a game with, and it seems like it's mainly to hire a little help to get it across the finishing line.</p>
<p>Fund it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/azuremountain/zid-journey" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and try the new demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1814690/Zid_Journey/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Theme park building sim Indoorlands is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indoorlands, a somewhat unique theme park building sim has left Early Access as a finished game ready for you to get clicking around. What's the different about this one then? Well, as the name hints towards, you're building everything inside. An indoor amusement park, that you build up using these massive connected rooms. It comes with Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e80MfXtOiO8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fd005c31ed7194a446d4750cf4f60eda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e80MfXtOiO8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As a <strong>manager</strong>, you have to build and expand your park, analyze and satisfy your guests’ needs, research attractions and buildings and keep the economy running.</li>
<li>Place <strong>research </strong>centers to generate research points and unlock more attractions, restaurants, shops, halls, and rides. Research points can also be spent on general park improvements.</li>
<li>Thrill rides take center stage: As a <strong>ride operator</strong>, you realistically control your rides and record unique ride programs that put a smile on your guests‘ faces.</li>
<li>The ‘<strong>Create Your Ride</strong>’ tool even offers the ability to construct your own, completely unique rides and share them via STEAM workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Roller coasters</strong> attract visitors. You can construct your own tracks and use different types of gondolas and stations. Of course, blueprints and the Steam workshop can also be used here.</li>
<li>Different <strong>visitor types</strong> have different demands and desires. Attention should be paid to this as new types of visitors arrive at the park over time and certain buildings should be built accordingly.</li>
<li>There is no limit to your creativity: Over 1000 <strong>decoration</strong> objects from various themes to choose from. All themes and objects are freely combinable, so each hall is unique due to the individual design choices. </li>
<li><strong>Blueprint System</strong>: Show your creativity &amp; share your hall interior designs, and ride and coaster creations with other players via STEAM Workshop integration.Planning the park architecture is a challenging task.</li>
<li>Space is expensive and maintenance buildings like toilets should be built apart from the <strong>flow of visitors</strong>. Different tools like the feedback report, heatmaps, and individual visitor details provide all the information needed.</li>
<li>React to <strong>special events and temporary trends</strong>. Choose and fulfill contracts to receive rewards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Leon Jeutter, Community Manager of Pixelsplit Simulations, says: “What a ride this has been - our great community supported us all the way through Early Access. Now the game is ready we are excited to present Indoorlands to players worldwide in the form it was meant to be played, a deep, engaging theme park management simulation with lots of ways for players to experience it according to their playing style.”</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/indoorlands?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1378890/Indoorlands/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>LOST EMBER should run nicer on Steam Deck / Linux, as dev fixes video issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LOST EMBER is an adventure game all about the power of nature. Released back in 2019, it seems recently that went back to it to ensure it works nicely on Steam Deck (and so Linux too).</p>
<p>Going by various reports of people who tried to play it previously, it had a problem where the movies wouldn't work and it seems that just stopped the game working as a whole. The developer was paying attention thankfully and put up a patch to solve the issues.</p>
<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/563840/view/3328747612251304994" target="_blank">announcement</a> earlier this month, the developer posted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might have noticed that Lost Ember is finally playable on the Steam Deck! :) The game had a couple of video issues on the Steam Deck, but we've finally found a way to eliminate those soooo:<br/>
<br/>
- Lost Ember is now running on Steam Deck!<br/>
- Alongside the development for both Steam Deck and the VR version, a variety of fixes made their way into the new build. Especially a couple of crashes and collision bugs should no finally be fixed<br/>
<br/>
We love Lost Ember on Steam Deck! Let us know what you think &lt;3 And if you're still experiencing bugs, please continue reporting them!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vo7CPfVu7MY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cd29ef5424c2f4f0ce9cd4dcc44ac14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vo7CPfVu7MY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As always, great to see developers ensure their games work better on the Steam Deck. It now has a Deck Playable rating, mainly as the text can be a little too small to be Deck Verified. Hopefully the developer will solve that too, which is an issue many games have where it seems the developers made it with their eye-balls directly up against the screen.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lost-ember?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563840/LOST_EMBER/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-5 is coming soon improving Steam Deck / Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are preparing to launch the latest update to Steam Play Proton, the compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Proton 7.0-5 is now in the Release Candidate testing stage, so it's not quite finished but you can give it a test yourself. Right now, they're looking for testing and reports on anything that is broken that wasn't before. For instructions, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6240" target="_blank">GitHub topic</a>.</p>
<p>The tentative changelog (as it may change before final release):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Now playable:
	<ul>
<li>Rift</li>
<li>Unravel 2</li>
<li>Airborne Kingdom</li>
<li>ToGather:Island</li>
<li>Nancy Drew: Legend of the Crystal Skull</li>
<li>Re-Volt</li>
<li>Warhammer: Vermintide 2</li>
<li>Aspire: Ina's Tale</li>
<li>Battle Realms: Zen Edition</li>
<li>Deathsmiles II</li>
<li>Primal Carnage: Extinction</li>
<li>Pico Park Classic Edition</li>
<li>Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind</li>
<li>Darkstar One</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Emperor Tomb</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered displaying dialog about outdated drivers on AMD systems.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) having no audio.</li>
<li>Fix Return to Monkey Island not reacting to mouse clicks after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix upsidedown videos in VRChat and many other games.</li>
<li>Fix Call of Duty Black Ops II Zombies and Multiplayer hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fix Bail or Jail Demo crashing when opening the Terms of Serivce.</li>
<li>Improve GTA V situation with not loading textures.</li>
<li>Fix Red Dead Redemption 2 crashing after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher functionality after game update.</li>
<li>Fix OpenXR compatibility with Blacktop Hoops.</li>
<li>Fix cutscene stutter in Disgaea 5.</li>
<li>Fix Thrustmaster HOTAS having non-functional dial in Elite Dangerous.</li>
<li>Fix Planet Zoo randomly crashing.</li>
<li>Fix SCP: Secret Labratory not being playable after a recent game update (again).</li>
<li>Fix Tekken 7 crashing at launch.</li>
<li>Implement network video support for The Good Life and VRChat.</li>
<li>Update dxvk to v1.10.3-28-ge3daa699.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 should probably not be listed as playable, since it has some pretty major problems still.</p>
<p>Also, Valve, are you ever going to actually mark Paladins as Unsupported again? It has been broken due to the anti-cheat for months. It's really not inspiring any confidence in Deck Verified if a well-known broken game continues to be listed as Playable…</p>

      <title>If you use PolyMC for Minecraft you should switch away now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: </strong>here's a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/minecraft-on-steam-deck-guide-with-prism-launcher-and-gamepad-support/" target="_blank">fresh Steam Deck guide</a> with Prism Launcher.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems a developer on the Minecraft launcher PolyMC went completely rogue and so for your own safety, you should remove PolyMC from all systems. Last night I was made aware of the situation and posted about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1582103691762405378" target="_blank">Twitter</a> but for those who don't follow along, here's what happened.</p>
<p>14 hours ago, according to GitHub, the creator removed the Code of Conduct with a commit <a href="https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee" target="_blank">message</a> titled "reclaim polymc from the leftoids". After that, they then kicked out the other developers from the project in some kind of completely hostile takeover.</p>
<p>People thought they got hacked but unfortunately this person seemingly just decided to attack others. In a message in the PolyMC Discord, they said this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3869764111666082503gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Regardless on your views, this kind of behaviour is <em>not</em> something anyone of any sane mind should support. What they've done is only show how they are completely untrustworthy, and they've basically killed the project. You should 100% consider PolyMC to be compromised and move onto another launcher. There's nothing to indicate malware or anything like that but any trust is simply gone, who knows what they would do next?</p>
<p>Sadly, this means the various videos and guides I did on PolyMC are no longer valid, and so I will be looking to cover other launchers in future. You should also revoke any permissions you gave to PolyMC via your <a href="http://microsoft.com/consent" target="_blank">Microsoft account</a>.</p>
<p>What are your options for right now? You can try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atlauncher.com/" target="_blank">ATLauncher</a></li>
<li><a href="https://multimc.org/" target="_blank">MultiMC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gdevs.io/" target="_blank">GDLauncher</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Although, MultiMC comes with its own controversy for Linux packaging and licensing stuff but at least the developer isn't malicious.</em></p>
<p>Is there some good news? Seemingly so. The team who were kicked out have banded together to carry it on under <a href="https://github.com/PlaceholderMC/PrismLauncher" target="_blank">PrismLauncher</a> but it's very early days on that yet.</p>
<p><em>Article was updated after publishing to clarify malware was not an issue at the time. The issue is the developer and what they did.</em></p>

      <title>LEGO Bricktales is out now with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Who doesn't love LEGO? ClockStone and Thunderful Publishing just recently released LEGO Bricktales and surprisingly, it came with full Native Linux support along with being Steam Deck Verified. They didn't mention anything about Linux before release, so it caught me by surprise but a welcome one and so I picked up a personal copy to give it a go.</p>
<p>LEGO Bricktales is set across 5 different themed biomes, where it's up to you to solve various puzzles by building anything that can help you. With physics at play, you need to ensure you're building something sound that won't fall apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9607615721666006954gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've actually been really quite enjoying this one. A great atmosphere, and it really does look the part — the LEGO style here is practically perfected. Having your constructions in the world, exactly as you make them is a really nice touch too, as is the ability to go back in sandbox mode and build them all bigger. While there is an overall story of helping your grandad rebuild a theme park, it's full of little mini-adventures as you go through and it's quite charming really. Good for all ages.</p>
<p>LEGO Bricktales is not really like any other LEGO game that has come before it. Most of them focus on some sort of action, whereas this is a stripped-down puzzle adventure from the creators of Bridge Constructor.</p>
<p>My only real gripe with it is that the camera controls can be a little annoying but you eventually get the hang of it.</p>
<p>Here's an intro and some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6KZWVXyYxJM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ade00aff9ceb2afc0be856d45655fba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6KZWVXyYxJM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: currently, the Steam Deck uses Proton by default.</em></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A globetrotting LEGO adventure:</strong> Experience a whimsical and epic adventure around the world, packed with charming dialogue and fun secrets to unravel.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful diorama worlds:</strong> Explore five varied story world biomes and the amusement park hub, all fully built out of LEGO bricks.</li>
<li><strong>Build like never before:</strong> Discover the most intuitive brick-by-brick building in a LEGO video game, as you see your creations come to life in a three-dimensional world.</li>
<li><strong>Test your skills with varied puzzles:</strong> Different types of puzzles will test your building skills. Use your engineering brain in functional physics-based puzzles to build a bridge for a digger to get across a river, put your designer hat on to build a stunning new throne for the King, or customize the rides in the amusement park.</li>
<li><strong>Master your builds in Sandbox Mode:</strong> Unlock the Sandbox Mode upon completing a construction spot, then you go back in and improve your build with a huge selection of additional bricks from different themes.</li>
<li><strong>Heaps of items to collect and unlock:</strong> Find collectables in the different dioramas and use them to buy cool new items for your wardrobe or new brick color sets for the sandbox mode.</li>
<li><strong>Build your unique character:</strong> Create your own minifigure character from a huge selection of parts and unlock more options inspired by the worlds you visit as you progress through the story.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamDB makes it easier to track upcoming releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamDB, the unofficial website that tracks basically everything Steam, has a new and improved way for you to track upcoming games. With so many new releases happening all the time, it's pretty easy to get completely lost in it all. My own backlog of things to look at grows constantly and I do keep missing some pretty great looking stuff but perhaps no more.</p>
<p>Mentioned by Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1579772667879886850" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (the creator of SteamDB), the <a href="https://steamdb.info/upcoming/" target="_blank">Upcoming</a> page has been upgraded to be a weekly tracker and you can easily go back through previous weeks and check out upcoming weeks as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11356428011666010917gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>By default it's sorted by the amount of people following along, so you get the most popular titles showing at the top which is pretty useful. The trend is also a good way to see what games a lot of people are really excited about. Simple, to the point and exactly what I like without lots of big flashy banners to scroll past like on Steam directly.</p>
<p>I quite like their <a href="https://steamdb.info/calendar/" target="_blank">monthly calendar</a> too, showing off the big main game each day for an even easier glance at what you perhaps don't want to miss.</p>

      <title>Minecraft 1.20 Beta coming soon with camels and a new &#39;sniffer&#39; mob won the vote</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Live recently happened and they showed off many new things coming to Minecraft with the 1.20 update.</p>
<p>As usual, they're not announcing everything and plenty <em>more</em> will be revealed over the coming months with a first "snapshot" (a Beta) coming relatively soon with some new fun features. They also haven't revealed the name of the update just yet. Some of what's new includes: seven new default skins, a camel mob, hanging signs, a new bamboo wood set, rafts as new boat variants and a chiseled bookshelf.</p>
<p>On top of that a new mob was announced with the sniffer, which won this year's mob vote. This new mob will hatch from eggs you find hidden in chests, and when it grows into an adult it will help you find ancient seeds that you can grow into different decorative plants.</p>
<p><em>The Minecraft 1.20 update will launch in full in 2023.</em></p>
<p>Here's the Minecraft 1.20 video clip from Minecraft Live:</p>

Overall it has significant improvements in gameplay, graphics and logic (including support for high-resolution graphics, improved AI, numerous fixes and user interface improvements).</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a Linux Beta version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you own Return to Monkey Island or are you thinking of buying it? Good news, as the developer now has a Native Linux version ready for Beta testing.</p>
<p>The Steam page currently seems to indicate it has Linux support already with the SteamOS icon but it is currently only in Beta for owners of the game. Announced by Ron Gilbert on <a href="https://twitter.com/grumpygamer/status/1580990722580566018" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, they mentioned you need to head to a special Steam Community forum post, that only owners can access for the instructions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAlDNn43QQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f958408d5ffd2ee1ff2f6a26be8bd30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAlDNn43QQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We knew it was coming, as stated in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/return-to-monkey-island-is-out-now-linux-version-due-soon/" target="_blank">original release article</a> as Gilbert said previously it would be "soon after" so it's nice to see a developer deliver on their words for Native Linux fans.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>
</ul>
