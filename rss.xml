      <title>Steam Deck hits 18,000 games playable and verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another seriously impressive milestone has been hit. The Steam Deck now has 18,000 games that Valve have rated to be either Playable or Verified.</p>
<p>For a little background here on how long it's taken for the Steam Deck to hit these milestones across 2024 we had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">13,000 in January</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">14,000 in March</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-hits-15000-games-rated-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">15,000 in May</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-deck-reaches-over-16000-playable-and-verified-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16,000 in August</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-hits-17000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">17,000 in November</a>. With this being the <em>first</em> milestone hit during 2025. In case you missed it Valve also announced recently that during 2024, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">330 million hours were played on Steam Deck</a>, which was a big increase from 2023.</p>
<p>When filtering specifically just to games on Steam at time of writing there's 6,012 Verified, 11,989 Playable and 4,593 Unsupported. As shown on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA RTX Remix released, plus Half-Life 2 RTX demo arrives March 18 - looking way too bright</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released NVIDIA RTX Remix, their modding platform that allows developers to enhance games with full ray tracing. Additionally, Half-Life 2 RTX is getting a demo on March 18th.</p>
<p>After a year or so in Beta, the release of NVIDIA RTX Remix brings with it DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation support. NVIDIA said that "Since that initial RTX Remix release, over 30,000 modders have experimented with hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods". It's open source and uses DXVK (part of Valve's Proton), under the MIT license, but only available for Windows via the NVIDIA app.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4EbVvrCuOBM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e378b9344c0f731b37e144908361acf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4EbVvrCuOBM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, Half-Life 2 RTX that takes Valve's classic game and shoves ray tracing into it will get a demo on March 18th. They've shown off some more footage of it, and I'm thoroughly torn on it. I love the idea of enhancing games, and the newer textures look like a big improvement while keeping the style but overall this looks <em>far</em> too bright and shiny and just seems like it's lost part of what made it special. Still, as another sort-of tech demo of what the possibilities are with such upgrades, it's still quite interesting.</p>

      <title>As Epic Games continue ignoring Linux / Steam Deck for Fortnite they&#39;re putting it on Windows Arm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ignoring one smaller market while gleefully supporting another, Epic Games have announced they're getting Fortnite along with Epic Online Services Anti-Cheat on Windows Arm.</p>
<p>Announced March 13th by Epic Games in a <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are working with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. to add Windows on Snapdragon support to <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/services-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Online Services Anti-Cheat</a>, also known as Easy Anti-Cheat, and make Fortnite available for Windows on Snapdragon devices later this year. This will help developers bring more games to more devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that Epic's Easy Anti-Cheat <em>does</em> support Linux (including Steam Deck with SteamOS Linux), and there's many games that are supported (check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out our dedicated anti-cheat section</a>). However, EAC <em>doesn't</em> support the kernel-level side of it on Linux, which has resulted in a number of games actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing support like Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Tim Sweeney of Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously said</a> back in late 2023 that it wouldn't make sense to support Fortnite on Steam Deck until it has "tens of millions of users". I still have my doubts Epic will <em>ever</em> do it, even <em>if</em> the amount of Steam Deck users and SteamOS devices (with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a public SteamOS Beta coming</a>) continue to increase, since Epic firmly see Valve as a competitor with their Epic Games Store. Not that the Epic Store is actually doing well, as it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continues coasting on revenue from Fortnite</a> while seeing a cut in third-party game spending.</p>
<p>Still, money talks, and what Sweeney said does still make sense purely from a business standpoint — they want to see the big bucks come in from each platform they add. Especially when Epic have others to keep happy like Tencent, Disney, Sony and more who have invested in them. Windows overall is already big, and Windows on Arm is likely to get bigger quite quickly with Epic noting it's a "rapidly growing segment of the PC gaming market".</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe Epic and Sweeney will prove me wrong one day and actually get Fortnite on Linux platforms. For that, we need those millions of users, and our only hope clearly is Valve for that. So I do hope we get a Steam Deck 2 and eventually a proper living room box. Valve did only just reveal that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">330 million hours were played on Steam Deck in 2024</a> up 64% from 2023 so there's plenty of hope there.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 announced and in development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 was clearly a big success, so much so that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 has now been officially announced as in development.</p>
<p>There's no real details about it yet, other than it now being in development. Shared via a press release from Focus Entertainment Publishing, Games Workshop, and Saber Interactive they said more information will be revealed at a later date.</p>
<p>From the press release: "We have been honored by the incredible response from fans following the launch of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. We will continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years. Today, we are thrilled to announce that the adventure will continue with Space Marine 3. Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games. Developed in close collaboration with Games Workshop, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 will take the genre to new heights by introducing large-scale battles that are even more spectacular," said John Bert, Deputy CEO of Focus Entertainment Publishing, a subsidiary of the PULLUP Entertainment Group.</p>
<p>"Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber. ​ It is the culmination of everything we have learned about game development in our 25 years in the business. ​ We are now starting to develop Space Marine 3, a game that carries with it tremendous expectations from our rapidly expanding fanbase. ​ While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment. We view this as an opportunity to create a true love letter to the Warhammer 40.000 universe." said Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive. </p>
<p>Not really surprising since the developer revealed Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 managed to hit 4.5 million sales back in October 2024.</p>

      <title>Former Blue Systems devs form Techpaladin Software to work on KDE with Valve as their first client</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one I missed from earlier this week. KDE developer Nate Graham announced the formation of an open source consultancy company called Techpaladin Software, with their first client being Valve to continue improving the Steam Deck desktop mode which uses KDE Plasma.</p>
<p>Techpaladin Software is co-owned by Nate Graham and another developer Linux fans may know, David Edmundson. Plus "about a dozen of Blue Systems' current people" will also be working there.</p>
<p>Nothing really changes here, other than the formation of the new company. As Graham said "it’s the result of a mutual decision made between the owner of Blue Systems, myself and David Edmundson, and Blue Systems' other personnel who are moving over". And that "Techpaladin will sponsor almost all of the same people Blue Systems did, and they will continue to enjoy the same wide latitude to improve KDE software for a living with a high level of personal and professional freedom" and they will be a KDE e.V. Patron too.</p>
<p>As for their business model? It's similar to Blue Systems. Companies pay them to work on open source software like KDE. And they're "inheriting Blue Systems' contract with Valve Inc. as our first client" so they "will continue to maintain and develop large amounts of KDE software relevant to the Steam Deck".</p>

      <title>PowerWash Simulator 2 announced for release in 2025 with split-screen co-op</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah hell, here we go again, I'm going to be hooked on it. FuturLab have revealed PowerWash Simulator 2 is coming and it will be this year too. The first is definitely a don't knock it until you try it type of game. It's so weirdly relaxing and works great on Linux with Valve's Proton so I'm keen for an expanded sequel.</p>
<p>There's some really nice additions in this one too. Not online will online co-op return, but they're also adding in split-screen play. Awesome. Really great to see split-screen making a return to more games. It also adds in an all-new customizable home base system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cFwqxoF7MwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bbd63dbe3e50234466b2673d6fde9ebe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cFwqxoF7MwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"PowerWash Simulator 2 feels like a natural evolution from its predecessor. The original game’s design was all about eliminating anything that detracted from the pure satisfaction of taking something dirty and making it clean. PowerWash Simulator 2 is all about adding in even more avenues for players to achieve that same sense of satisfaction, with new tools, features and quality of life improvements," says Dan Chequer, Design Director at FuturLab. "We're really excited to see players dust off their power washers and get stuck into this brand-new campaign, that brings you even more to clean, and even more ways to release the pressure."</p>
<p>"We couldn't be more thrilled to finally announce the sequel to one of our most successful titles. With over 17 million players worldwide, PowerWash Simulator has allowed us to self-publish a sequel, an exciting challenge we are delighted to undertake," says Chris Mehers, COO of FuturLab. "We look forward to bringing players the next step-up in the PowerWash Simulator series."</p>

      <title>SILENT HILL f has now been fully revealed with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally revealed back in 2022, KONAMI have now properly lifted the lid on SILENT HILL f and graced us with a new trailer. The game developed by NeoBards Entertainment Ltd. with a script from Ryukishi07 who people may know from the likes of Higurashi When They Cry, Umineko When They Cry and Ciconia When They Cry.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ag157nqMV0Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e865572e648a7af49bdaec6df709c674.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ag157nqMV0Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1960s Japan, Shimizu Hinako's secluded town of Ebisugaoka is consumed by a sudden fog, transforming her home into a haunting nightmare.</p>
<p>As the town falls silent and the fog thickens, Hinako must navigate the twisted paths of Ebisugaoka, solving complex puzzles and confronting grotesque monsters to survive.</p>
<p>Immerse yourself into Hinako's world imagined by renowned author Ryukishi07, with entrancing music, including pieces by Akira Yamaoka, and beautiful visuals in a gripping tale of doubt, regret, and inescapable choices. Will Hinako embrace the beauty hidden within terror, or succumb to the madness that lies ahead?</p>
<p>Discover a new chapter in the SILENT HILL series, blending psychological horror with a haunting Japanese setting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no date for the game yet but a Steam release is confirmed so we'll be able to play it with Valve's Proton. The setting sounds really interesting so I can't wait to play.</p>

      <title>330 million hours played on Steam Deck in 2024 up 64% from 2023 - Steam Year In Review 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Valve have released their Steam Year In Review 2024 and it's full of interesting data, as well as going over all the changes Valve made to Steam during 2024. Nice to see the Steam Deck and Linux doing so well overall for Valve.</p>
<p>A large part of the post is a refresher on features Valve shipped like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-families-has-officially-launched-with-a-big-steam-client-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Families</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Recording</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cleaning up store page publisher spam</a>, launching <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/valve-makes-paid-advanced-access-a-clear-feature-on-steam-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access</a>, major <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/the-first-stable-steam-and-steam-deck-update-of-2024-is-here/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements to the Steam Workshop</a>, requiring developers to list if their game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">uses Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat</a>, improvements for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-makes-a-big-improvement-for-native-linux-games-in-a-steam-beta-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">running Native Linux games</a>, requiring <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developers to disclose their use of AI</a> and lots more. We're also currently waiting on Valve shipping that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public SteamOS Beta that should be sometime soon</a>.</p>
<p>Once you get through the details of what Valve did, then we get to some of the juicy statistics.</p>
<p>There's some interesting bits in there like how the "Steam Deck generated an incredible 330 million hours of Steam playtime in 2024 alone—a 64% increase over 2023". That's pretty impressive on the number of hours but even more so when it increased by such a huge amount. Valve said the future of their hardware is bright too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The future of hardware at Valve is bright. Steam Deck, SteamOS and SteamVR are delivering tons of value to players and devs, built on top of a decade of investments into UI, linux compatibility, input support, custom silicon, motion tracking, displays, battery efficiency, and more. Every developer making PC games benefits from these investments, and players can now enjoy their PC games in so many new contexts. Hardware teams at Valve are delighted to see Steam in the living room, the airport, the backyard, and wherever else customers want to bring their library of PC games.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the growth of Steam, Valve gave us some numbers on that too and it's quite impressive, although they're not giving us new monthly active users (sadly).</p>
<p>Valve said that 1.7 million new users who came from a "top 2023 release went on to enjoy more than 141 million hours of playtime in additional games" along with them spending "$20 million on in-game transactions across hundreds of other games—plus another $73 million on premium games and DLC across thousands more products".</p>
<p>2024 was a big year for new releases too, Valve said it was the "platform's best year ever in terms of customers buying newly released games". Giving a little more detail about how new releases did in 2024; including revenue from the first 30 days following a game release, including pre-purchase revenue and using any Early Access dates instead of a 1.0 release in 2024, Valve listed some major takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Release revenue per year has increased almost exactly 10x since 2014.</li>
<li>In 2024, more than 500 new titles exceeded $250,000 in New Release revenue (up 27% from 2023).</li>
<li>In 2024, more than 200 new titles exceeded $1 million in New Release revenue (up 15% from 2023).</li>
</ul>
<p>One success story that was highlighted is TCG Card Shop Simulator, Valve said it was one of the most successful launches of 2024. Developed by OPNeon Games from Malaysia, Valve noted how the developer is from a "territory that makes up only 0.5% of global traffic on Steam" and their game managed to get "well over a million customers in its first month". Going back to the note above about new customers sticking around from a 2023 release, Valve said about "10,000 of them went on to buy TCG Card Shop Sim".</p>
<p>In closing Valve said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2024 is in the history books, but our work to improve Steam and Steamworks continues. All year long we'll be attending conferences, hosting roundtables, reading forum comments, and working hard on Steam so that the Year In Review 2025 is packed with more improvements.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.6 brings expanded Nvidia Reflex support and lots of game fixes for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK is a tool used by Proton that translates Direct3D 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan. It's one of the projects that enables Windows games to run so well on Linux platforms like Steam Deck. Version 2.6 was just released.</p>
<p>You don't need to do anything, as Proton pulls in updates from DXVK directly in future releases. However, if you do wish to upgrade DXVK early, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-update-dxvk-and-vkd3d-proton-in-proton-and-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my dedicated guide on it</a>.</p>
<p>DXVK 2.6 includes expanded support for Nvidia Reflex when paired up with Proton Experimental for games that use DirectX 11. Noted games it works with includes "God of War, Overwatch 2, Quake Champions and some others". It does not work with "most Unreal Engine 4 games in D3D11 mode" so you should use DirectX 12 where you can.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Then there's lots of game-specific fixes for the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assassin's Creed 3 and Black Flag</li>
<li>Watch Dogs 1 &amp; 2</li>
<li>Stalker: Clear Sky</li>
<li>Baldurs Gate 3</li>
<li>Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2</li>
<li>Trine 5</li>
<li>God of War</li>
<li>Clanfolk</li>
<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</li>
<li>CivCity: Rome</li>
<li>Global Operations</li>
<li>Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</li>
<li>Silent Hill 2</li>
<li>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</li>
<li>Trainz v1.3</li>
</ul>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h2>D3D10 / D3D11</h2>
<h3>Nvidia Reflex support</h3>
<p>When running Proton Experimental and an Nvidia driver with <code class="inline-code">VK_NV_low_latency2</code> support, Reflex can now be enabled in D3D11 games that support this feature. This includes <strong>God of War</strong>, <strong>Overwatch 2</strong>, <strong>Quake Champions</strong> and some others. Approximate input latency can be displayed in these games by setting <code class="inline-code">DXVK_HUD=latency</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Reflex does <strong>not</strong> work in most Unreal Engine 4 games in D3D11 mode since <code class="inline-code">LatencySleep</code> and other related functions never get called. This cannot be worked around inside DXVK; prefer using D3D12 for affected games.</p>
<h3>Bug fixes and Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Worked around a common game bug that would cause garbled output on Nvidia when using MSAA. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4480" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4480</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4731" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4731</a>)<br/>
	This affects games such as <strong>Assassin's Creed 3 / Black Flag</strong>, <strong>Watch Dogs</strong>, <strong>Stalker: Clear Sky</strong>, and others.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This may have a small impact on performance on memory usage in affected games, including on AMD GPUs, where this issue did not manifest in rendering issues due to hardware details.</li>
<li>Potentially improved GPU-bound performance in games that use NVAPI UAVOverlap feature, such as <strong>Baldurs Gate 3</strong>.<br/>
	While this feature was supported before, our previous implementation was too conservative. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4691</a>)<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> LIke other vendor extensions, this does not work on Windows.</li>
<li>Removed <code class="inline-code">d3d11.dcSingleUseMode</code> option. Submitting deferred command lists multiple times will now behave as expected by default.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This may increase memory usage in some games. Fixes rendering issues in <strong>Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2</strong>.</li>
<li>Slightly improved GPU-bound performance in modern games that extensively use pixel shader UAVs, such as <strong>Trine 5</strong>. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4693" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4693</a>)</li>
<li>Slightly reduced CPU overhead in some games that use resource binding methods inefficiently, such as <strong>God of War</strong>.</li>
<li>Fixed layered D3D11 video processor view creation. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4651" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4651</a>)</li>
<li>Added support for the <code class="inline-code">ID3D11On12Device1</code> interop interface.</li>
<li><strong>Clanfolk</strong>: Worked around a game bug that would cause missing geometry on Intel. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4716" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4716</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</strong>: Fixed a case of invalid Vulkan usage. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4684" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4684</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Watch Dogs 2</strong>: Worked around a game bug that would cause the sky to flicker on RDNA3 GPUs. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4717" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4717</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>D3D8 / D3D9</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a race condition that could lead to crashes in games doing multi-threaded asset loading. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4613" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4613</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4646" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4646</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed various issues that would occur when disabling shader support via the <code class="inline-code">d3d9.shaderModel</code> option. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4625" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4625</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4629" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4629</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where games using both software and hardware cursors would not transition between the two smoothly. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4670" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4670</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that would cause textures to not be bound correctly in some games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4694" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4694</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where games that request half-rate Vsync would run at quarter-rate instead.</li>
<li>Fixed minor issues that would cause wine test failures. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4732" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4732</a>)</li>
<li><strong>CivCity: Rome</strong>: Added vendor ID override to make the game render shadows on Intel GPUs. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4739" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4739</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Global Operations</strong>: Fixed rendering issues (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4138" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4138</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4678" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4678</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit 2</strong>: Fixed missing fog. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4113" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4113</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4653" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4653</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Silent Hill 2</strong>: Fixed an issue where the menu would render incorrectly with the <em>Silent HIll 2 Enhancements</em> mod. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3943" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#3943</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3948" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#3948</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell</strong>: Worked around alt+tab and shadow rendering issues.

<li>Improved efficiency of multisample resolves on tiling GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression introduced in DXVK 2.5 that would cause memory allocation errors on certain unified memory setups, including the Qualcomm proprietary driver.<br/>
<strong>Note:</strong> This does not mean that DXVK will officially support Android, or proprietary mobile drivers.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash if an application unloads the SetupAPI DLL. This issue affected various AdvHD-based visual novels. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4662" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4662</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4668" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4668</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where software rasterizers such as Lavapipe would not be considered when setting <code class="inline-code">DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME</code>. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4716" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4716</a>)</li>
<li>Resource initialization is now always performed on the asynchronous transfer queue if possible, and no longer uses additional memory on drivers that support Vulkan sparse residency features. This may save up to 64 MiB of VRAM in some games.</li>
<li>Worked around an <code class="inline-code">std::regex</code> bug that would cause games to instantly crash when using Japanese locale. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4669" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4669</a>)</li>
<li>Worked around potential 32-bit crashes caused by stack alignment issues in GCC-compiled binaries. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4627" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4627</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4633" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4633</a>)</li>

      <title>Steam Spring Sale 2025 is live now - here&#39;s some great budget games for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have launched the first of their planned four major seasonal sales for 2025, with the Steam Spring Sale launched featuring plenty of big discounts and demos.</p>
<p>They also have a fresh trailer to mark the event featuring a bunch of different games:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C-4SwzW0KoA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c0ca8c3c9b72da2b26a77caee2a7e31.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C-4SwzW0KoA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For this event Valve have also put up a Deep Discounts section again, so you can look to find some of the biggest discounts they have during the sale. No sale on Steam Deck hardware though, that's more likely later on in the year.</p>
<p>Going over the list I've managed to pick out a number of different games I think are worth grabbing. All of them suitable for those of you on a budget and I've stuck to those that are <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"> Steam Deck Verified only, to ensure no matter what they should work great on <em>both</em> Steam Deck and Desktop Linux as a whole.</img></p>

      <title>Palworld is getting crossplay in &#39;late March&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have announced that sometime real soon you'll be able to team up with players across different platforms in the popular monster catcher Palworld.</p>
<p>They said it will come in "late March" but didn't give any other specifics on the date. We'll just have to wait and see. In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/541100079887417458" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This update will implement multiplayer between different platforms and the ability to move Pals between worlds.</p>
<p>Crossplay is supported between all currently released platforms, including Steam, Xbox, PS5 and Mac. Please enjoy crossplay with your family and friends!</p>
<p>For more details, please check the release notes that will be published on the day of the update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15703146961741869775gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In case you missed it, Pocketpair announced a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-gets-a-roadmap-including-co-op-crossplay-world-transfers-for-pals-and-an-ending/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap back in February</a> with plenty more planned to arrive for the game including actually having an ending. Nice to see one part of the roadmap will be coming soon! Optimization is included in their plans, which will be good to see, since it definitely could do with some to perform better on devices like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Palworld is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve and Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1623730" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>. I've played quite a lot of it and can confirm for Desktop Linux users it does run great. </p>

      <title>Hello Sunshine has you walking in the shadow of a giant robot so you&#39;re not fried by the sun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just announced from Red Thread Games (Dreamfall Chapters, Draugen, Dustborn) is Hello Sunshine, a mysterious survival game where you're following a truly massive robot and keeping to their shadow to not get fried by the sun.</p>
<p>I have to admit the whole idea of this has me fully intrigued. I love a good giant robot, and the teaser trailer certainly left me wanting a whole lot more. The trailer doesn't actually show any proper gameplay though, more just introducing the world and the giant robot.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XI-HO3uoCmQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6a9009baae43472bc0ceb247ab9e2f2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XI-HO3uoCmQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam page at least gives us a much clearer idea of what you'll be doing, along with some actual clear in-game shots. Here's some more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Sunshine is a mystery survival RPG set in the sun-scorched ruins of a corporate empire. You play the final employee. Your mission: reach the tower at the end of the road, and help decide the fate of what remains of this world.</p>
<p>To survive the blistering heat and deadly sun, you'll walk in the shadow of a towering war machine, scavenging for supplies and searching for pieces to the puzzle.</p>
<p>When the sun sets and the robot stops to charge, you'll  make camp, craft new gear, and repair your mechanical guardian. But the wasteland is freezing cold at night. Stay close to the robot to keep warm.</p>
<p>The journey to the tower is long. You won't make it on your own. As the sun rises, the robot starts walking. Follow — and stay alive until the end of the road.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely going to be keeping an eye on this one! Sounds really unique and it will be playable in online co-op too.</p>

      <title>Moon Studios developer of Ori and No Rest for the Wicked goes &#39;fully independent&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good industry news for you today. Moon Studios who made Ori and the Blind Forest, Ori and the Will of the Wisps and their current Early Access game No Rest for the Wicked have gone "fully independent".</p>
<p>The news was shared in their latest update video for No Rest for the Wicked where Gennadiy Korol, the Co-Founder and Director of Moon Studios said: "After months of negotiations, we reached an agreement to buy the publishing rights for No Rest for the Wicked back so that Moon Studios could become fully independent". Following that the Creative Director, Thomas Mahler, said: "We believe this will give you even more confidence in our vision, because we're free to build No Rest for the Wicked exactly how we want".</p>
<p>Just a small part of the below video where they talk about a huge update coming to the game on April 30th:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CzAtYaSYZms"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e85095d0a0185040f064d09eb6a2c873.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CzAtYaSYZms" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is rated Steam Deck Verified and Platinum on ProtonDB. So it appears to work well on Linux with Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>Bazzite Linux announced two new editions designed for game developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite Linux, a popular choice for people wanting to put Linux on their handhelds or living room PC, is getting two new editions designed to help developers.</p>
<p>Writing on their official forum, the two new editions will be Bazzite DX and Bazzite GDX. As developer NiHaiden said in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building upon the incredible work by the <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/container/amyos/amyos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">amyOS</a> developers, we are officially announcing the creation of Bazzite DX and Bazzite GDX (Game Developer Experience).</p>
<p>Bazzite DX will be developer focused edition which will include general developer goodies, just like Bluefin DX or Aurora DX. This will be a general developer image, so it will be scoped to match our existing developer modes.</p>
<p>Bazzite GDX is the one we’re excited about the most. This will be a game-developer focused edition of Bazzite filled with awesome tools (like Godot) and whatever goodies the community builds with us. It’s purpose is to be a kickass game developer workstation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're now available in a prototype Alpha testing stage for any developer or user wanting to help test and give feedback on how to make it a success.</p>
<p>An interesting idea, and given the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steamos-like-bazzite-linux-has-some-nice-growth-thanks-to-great-handheld-pc-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rise in popularity of Bazzite</a>, it might make sense. Giving developers a similar stable platform to develop, test and play their games across a range of supported hardware. Even though Valve have SteamOS, they haven't put it out to the public yet, so Bazzite has really been picking up a lot of slack here. It will be interesting to see what they will bring to the table.</p>

      <title>Spell-combining co-op survivor-like The Spell Brigade adds a new character and a new game mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game that continues to review well by players, with it hitting a good sales milestone not long after launch, The Spell Brigade from Bolt Blaster Games has a big update out now with a brand new character. It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about it: The Spell Brigade is a survivors-like with online co-op for 1-4 players. Team up with your wizard friends to slay hordes of dark creatures. Complete team-based objectives, unlock new upgrades, and create overpowered spell synergies. Friend nor foe is safe in this friendly fire bullet hell!</p>
<p>Not seen it before? Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xNplw0h5Qkk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e9709435bef05e3b9fe80a0965195c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xNplw0h5Qkk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">New additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Wizard: Maggie: The Spell Brigade welcomes the eleventh wizard to their ranks. Maggie uses her bird-like features to spot pickups from far away and wields a unique spell called "Aurora Wings," which casts mystic birds across the battlefield that pick off targets one by one.</li>
<li>Wizard Traits &amp; Ranks: Following community feedback, Bolt Blaster Games has reworked and rebalanced each wizard's stats and effects. Every mage now has unique attributes that define their specific role within a team. Examples include Reginald's luck-based abilities, Aldric's occasional healing powers, and Kavin's... distinctive Kavin-ness. Each wizard now also has their own rank, which players can level up to show off their shiny badges to their teammates.</li>
<li>Single Spell Mode: A new covenant called "Solitary Focus" challenges players to rely solely on their Starter Spell. As players progress, this single spell evolves to extraordinary power levels, offering a fresh strategic approach to their runs.</li>
</ul>
<p>They said it will also be discounted during the Steam Spring Sale with 25% off (it's biggest discount so far) which begins later today. Looks like another great one to add to your library, which I still haven't had a chance to properly dive into yet.</p>

      <title>A Sweeping Journey Down The Path In The Woods: Slay The Princess Pristine Cut Interview</title>
      <author>alexa_bement</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When you make your way out of the cabin in the woods at the end of a production cycle, what happens next?</p>
<p>With the release of Slay The Princess: The Pristine Cut DLC, I asked Black Tabby Games developers Tony Howard-Aris and Abby Howard about the game's past and present, as well as the future of Black Tabby Games, and even some <em>very</em> important lore about the Voices. Let's dive deeper into the woods with the developers of Slay the Princess:</p>
<p><strong>When you originally released the game, what were your expectations for its reception compared to what you've received?</strong></p>
<p>Tony says of Slay The Princess, "We had pretty high expectations for how it would sell based on a combination of wishlist data and general engagement on social media and our Steam forums. But then the actual performance wound up blowing those already high expectations out of the water, which is great! Really, really freeing. In terms of audience/critical reception, we were a little shakier before the game came out.</p>
<p>The game takes some unexpected metaphysical and poetic turns that weren’t communicated in the demo, and we figured they might be some harder pills to swallow for some players? So we were a little nervous until we sent builds of the finished game to our testers - and even though the reception there was great, we were still a little nervous before launch. We were expecting something that would maybe be around 87% positive on Steam, not 97% positive."</p>
<p>Slay The Princess: The Pristine Cut currently sits at the 97% positive review rating based on 17,513 user reviews, has sold half a million copies, and has a 90% on Metacritic and a 96/100 on OpenCritic. It also won the OTK Video Game Awards's Best RPG, The Horror Game Awards' Player's Choice, and World Soundtrack Awards' Game Music Award. It seems the Princess has climbed even higher than the height of her Tower form!</p>
<p><strong>What made you decide to expand on Slay The Princess?</strong></p>
<p>Abby said that "it was a combination of things, first and foremost being an AMA we did about a week after launch– a few folks asked us if we were planning on doing any DLC, and at the time the answer was no, but I think that very night we wound up deciding that there actually were some areas we thought deserved to be more fleshed-out. I think having a little breathing room after the launch was also a big part of it. It was such a scramble to get the base game done by our deadline that we didn’t have the opportunity to step back and give it a nice long look, and see the areas that still needed a little extra something.</p>
<p>And personally, I didn’t love that there were “holes” in the pattern of the game. Most Chapter 2 princess forms have two Chapter 3s, one that’s a fusion with another princess and one that’s unique to them, and several Chapter 2 princesses only had a fusion, leaving these little holes that I didn’t love. But I don’t see any more of those holes now! I’m very happy with where the game is, and we’ve had plenty of time to sit around hemming and hawing over it this time. The Pristine Cut was very satisfying to finish!"</p>
<p>The Pristine Cut was announced in December 2023 and released almost exactly a year to the original release date of the game after months of development. In addition to a new ending and an expanded Apotheosis and Fury, the Pristine Cut brought three new routes to focus solely on Damsel, Prisoner, and Spectre respectively. Each of these Princesses now mutate further to play with the consequences of a specific outcome from the original release.</p>
<p>Tony added to the discussion of the time constraints with finishing the original release, "Time was a huge, almost self-imposed constraint on Slay the Princess’ development so we wouldn’t spend too much time away from Scarlet Hollow, our other, ongoing title. But I think the intensity that came from constraining our time led to a lot of really interesting decisions that ultimately elevated Slay the Princess as a finished product. So much of the flow of the narrative and its game-world is dream-like, so working quickly and exploring any idea that felt natural contributed a lot to nailing that vibe. The original demo for Slay the Princess was made in about two weeks." The original demo was released on August 5th of 2022, with an expanded demo then coming out in March of 2023, and the full original game in October 2023.</p>
<p><strong>What was the writing thought process and approach like, coming back to the game to expand on the existing narrative compared to the original cut?</strong></p>
<p>Tony said "A lot of it came down to looking at the big-picture themes of the game and asking ourselves, “What haven’t we said about this?” It helped that we at least knew what chapters we were expanding — even the new Princesses all are offshoots of chapters that are already in the game, so that narrowed it down.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it felt like we needed to spend more time on the fleshy parts of being alive. The physical parts of love. Deeper explorations of what it means to be trapped in a loop that’s changing, but <em>only a little bit</em>. How does having a different vantage point change the shape of the story? How does that change or redeem the shape of a relationship? And there’s something in there that I feel is a really important farewell and book-end to the game in general, even if people wind up playing it out of order. I’ll let the readers figure out what I’m talking about with all of that ;)."</p>
<p>I suspect I know exactly which new route Tony is alluding to there, but if you know, you know. Indeed, Slay The Princess is a <em>very</em> physical game, with its ability to convey just about every single form of body horror you can think of at one point or another while still being hauntingly beautiful. Add in the love story at the center of the game between the severed halves of the cycle of transformation, and said love certainly got physical many times over.</p>
<p>"Slay the Princess is also the kind of game that, despite its heavily branching narrative, lends itself very well to updates," Abby added. "It would not be anywhere near as easy to add the kinds of sweeping updates we’ve been able to add to, say, our other game, Scarlet Hollow– that game’s narrative structure is much more of a braid, where the wide branching paths have to intersect constantly, and are held up by a delicate scaffolding of everything that came before. Slay the Princess was always about exploring these unique little pathways and seeing just how far they could be pushed, and honestly, the bits we’ve added slotted in very nicely to the existing structure– again, like filling holes!"</p>
<p>Without spoilers, certain 'what ifs' that went unaddressed in the original release about the premise of the games' looping narrative and the rules it works on were finally answered in the Pristine Cut. With these holes filled up, pretty much every possible outcome feels explored by the full game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8006686671741858281gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8006686671741858281gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>What drew you to decide to write a story about the themes present in Slay The Princess?</strong></p>
<p>"Themes in general, I feel, tend to come about organically after you’ve figured out the core story that you’re working on," Tony said on the matter. "They always just sort of happen while you’re exploring the text. For Slay the Princess, we knew we were telling a story about a being that was shaped by the perception of others (The Princess) and the story of someone who was terrified of the danger that being posed (The Narrator). But getting at the deeper themes of it took a lot of extra digging. It was a lot harder than, say, Scarlet Hollow, where the story is so detailed and so rooted in the physical world.</p>
<p>Slay the Princess is so abstract, you know? I think it was around the time I started playing with that first conversation with the Shifting Mound—the one you have after you finish your first “route”—that I really started figuring out the themes. That this was a story about change and its relationship with death. That it was ultimately a love story at its core. Once we figured that out, the Stranger chapter, which we’d been stuck on for a while, and which Abby likes to describe as an “overture” for the game, really came together, and that’s around the point the themes became very <em>conscious</em>, if that makes sense."</p>
<p>"It’s exactly what Tony said," Abby added. "I feel like themes are often not something I start with when writing. Rather, I just start playing with ideas that interest me, and as those ideas are fleshed out, the theme starts to become obvious. At a certain point when you’re working on something, it’s important to step back and try to pinpoint what you might be fixating on, the underlying fascination with whatever larger idea is lurking under the surface of your work, so you can communicate it more effectively. And I do think most things have some underlying thesis, even if the writer didn’t know it!"</p>
<p>The first conversation with the Shifting Mound happens right after where the second demo stopped. By that point, it was clear the Princess was some kind of entity changing to your perception and the Narrator was trying to prevent you from knowing this- the only way to kill her without dying yourself was to immediately do as you're told without engaging in conversation with her. Yet without the deeper theme revealed by this conversation and the rest of the original release, Slay The Princess would seem like just another horrific looping-your-choices-matter game. However, the decision to make the looping and choice mechanics directly tied to a story of the choice between a perfect stasis and letting go of something to make room for the cycle of new invokes a question of what it means to be alive or happy, elevating the game's storytelling abilities far beyond my personal expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5341535641741858307gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5341535641741858307gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>As I understand it, with the Pristine Cut the game is officially finished except for console porting. Now that you're nearing the end of the developmental journey on Slay The Princess, how do you feel reflecting back on the entire process?</strong></p>
<p>Abby said she is "mostly just very proud of the work the team has done. Everyone really gave it their all, and I love how it all came together! I feel like Tony and I learned a lot of valuable skills that are helping us make our other game even better going forward, and have broken a lot of personal barriers that are helping us understand what we’re capable of, even as a small team.</p>
<p>Animation, for instance, is something I started learning for Slay the Princess, and I’m really happy with how far I’ve come just since the very start of development! It’s so helpful in our line of work, and it was something I had always told myself I was incapable of trying. Just goes to show, the hardest part of learning a skill is defeating that little voice that’s telling you it’s impossible to even get started. The second-hardest part is getting good… and it’s a close second…"</p>
<p>Tony agreed to being proud of the work done, adding that "Something I profoundly appreciate about working in video games is that, more than any other form of media, games are living, breathing artifacts. Interaction changes them. Nothing is set in stone. I love nothing more than to look back at a release and, even if it went well, even if people <em>really</em> liked it, going back and making it better. Figuring out what more could be said. I’m very glad we had that opportunity to do that for Slay the Princess, and I am so proud of everyone who worked on it with us. Everyone has grown so much."</p>
<p>With all the success of the original release and the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the Pristine Cut, the inspiring journey they took is worth its weight in gold. The animations in the game and its release trailers are so stunning you would never guess it was done by someone learning as she went! If this development story teaches us anything, it's that nothing is impossible indeed!</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to someone wanting to make a branching narrative or psychological horror like Slay The Princess?</strong></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16540003831741858340gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16540003831741858340gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>"I think the most important thing is to figure out exactly what ideas really interest you," Tony said. "Figure out exactly what story you <em>want</em> to tell. People can tell when a project really comes from the heart, and they love that. At the end of the day, art is about connection. It’s about communicating with other people. So you have to know what you want to communicate. I’ll also say that, if you’re looking to tell a story with a video game, you need to ask yourself <em>why</em> this story needs to be a video game. You need to ask yourself what is it about <em>this medium</em> that makes it right for your story. What works for a novel won’t necessarily work for a game, and vice versa. For us, at the end of the day, it comes down to how important it is for our readers to experience the events of our stories directly, as characters, as opposed to reading <em>about</em> events from an outside perspective.</p>
<p>If it’s <em>important</em> for your player to step directly into someone else’s shoes, or if it’s important for the player to <em>wear their own shoes</em> somewhere they otherwise would never wear them… that’s when you want to make a game."</p>
<p>Visual novel games like Slay The Princess are named as such for being text-heavy and full of dialogue and choices. As Tony alludes to, video games have always stood out from other mediums for being the most interactive, making them perfect for Slay The Princess' choose-your-own-adventure narrative device. The player is always right with the Hero's constant confusion as he deals with the surreal nature of the game, and the choices feel like the players' own. While I would of course love to see the game in other formats, Slay The Princess is definitively meant to be a video game. And one full of heart and creativity, which drew me to the game in the first place and made that connection discussed. I almost cried while playing on both original and Pristine release.</p>
<p>"As for advice on narratives and psychological horror in particular," Abby added on, "I think a nice big piece of advice is to never get too precious with what you’ve already done. If you wind up zoning out or otherwise not enjoying the work you’re doing, there’s a chance that players/readers won’t enjoy it, either. This is our mantra at Black Tabby Games, that if something sucks to work on, it will probably suck to play!"</p>
<p>The developers discussed multiple times in the past having a strict policy on cutting content. If something isn't working, it's cut. Slay The Princess alone had multiple updates cutting down voice lines and other small pieces they felt unnecessary to streamline the experience.</p>
<p>"I also recommend reading nonfiction," Abby added. "Reading fiction can help a lot in understanding what kind of prose style you want to use, but nonfiction is especially helpful for writing horror. I feel there’s no better place to turn than reality to help you understand what horrifies you and why."</p>
<p>Reality is indeed very terrifying- while the game is very fairytale in nature, the body horror of every conceivable angle probably came from something much more grounded in reality, and that gives the game a harsh edge to truly lean into the horror angle. Nonfiction it is!</p>
<p><strong>What's next for Scarlet Hollow and potential future projects?</strong></p>
<p>"Well, first thing’s first," Tony said, "we’ve got a <em>big</em> patch in the oven for Scarlet Hollow that’ll be releasing at some point before Episode 5. Now that we have Slay the Princess under our belts, we’re a lot more confident in tackling some interesting narrative challenges that were left unsolved in the first couple of episodes. Like, what happens if you <em>don’t</em> go into the woods with Stella? Can we still bring everything together into the same compelling, overarching narrative if we afford our players a little more agency early on?</p>
<p>This was a big, unsolvable problem for us for a while, but having a little extra distance helped us come up with some really good solutions, and we can’t wait to share it with folks. No release date to share, but it’ll be sooner than people think. And then from there, Episode 5 sometime next year, and then we’ll be releasing 6 and 7 together."</p>
<p>Scarlet Hollow is the pair's first and ongoing game that releases chapter by chapter in an ongoing story, from which Slay The Princess was made as a smaller project they could make all at once in order to fund its future. How exciting that trying their hand at another type of visual novel has given them new ideas for the scope of their golden child!</p>
<p>"And after <em>that</em>, Abby’s got an excellent comic to finish, and we’ve already got some ideas for a third game that we’re <em>really</em> excited for," Tony continued. "We might be branching out from visual novels a little bit with that one."</p>
<p>You heard it from him, we may see a new genre of game from Black Tabby Games in the future! With how quickly they mastered visual novels, what else could they learn and grow and succeed in?</p>
<p>Now that we've heard a lot about the development process behind Slay The Princess, it's time for the <strong><em>real</em></strong> questions…</p>
<p><strong>Which Princess would be the most difficult ghost to contend with in Phasmophobia?</strong></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7510811721741858358gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7510811721741858358gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>On this question, they disagreed.</p>
<p>Abby's vote was "The Wraith, she’s already a ghost, plus she’s mad at you. The possession angle would also be fun when it comes to multiplayer, as your friends can haunt you while their bodies are being twisted horribly by her." Meanwhile, Tony simply said this: "Adversary. I’ve played Phasmophobia. Those guys don’t have any weapons. Get punched to death."</p>
<p>With the exception of Damsel, every Princess is dangerous in their own way. No matter which one you pick to be a ghost in the ghost-hunting video game classic, those players are in for a world of hurt. I have to say that Tony's answer is objectively the funniest, but Abby's is objectively the scariest and would make for a fun mechanic. Watching people scream as their friends die in Phasmophobia never gets old, imagine if they got to watch that?</p>
<p>While this is valuable information, nothing comes close to the ultimate question of the interview I had to put on the table:</p>
<p><strong>You said before the hero and his voices have Minesweeper in their head. Which voice is the best and worst at Minesweeper?</strong></p>
<p>I am referring to a question on their post-original release Reddit AMA. When asked what else is in the Hero's head besides stiff drinks and corners, Tony's response was Minesweeper. We cannot leave it there. We need to know <strong>how</strong> they play Minesweeper.</p>
<p><strong>"</strong>Ooooooh this is a GOOD question," Tony said. "I don’t know if you knew this about me, but I was actually <em>really</em> into Minesweeper for a while. Even now, it’s still my go-to thing to do when I’m stuck on an airplane without WiFi."</p>
<p>In Slay The Princess, we have the following voices to work with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hero</li>
<li>Broken</li>
<li>Cheated</li>
<li>Skeptic</li>
<li>Contrarian</li>
<li>Paranoid</li>
<li>Cold</li>
<li>Stubborn</li>
<li>Smitten</li>
<li>Opportunist</li>
<li>Hunted</li>
</ul>
<p>Eleven voices in your head, and only one can win. Who will come out on top?</p>
<p>He began to explain how this goes down. "There’s a bunch of voices we can rule out quickly. Smitten has no Minesweeper related strengths, Hero is generic. Broken is… Broken. I’m not sure he has the confidence to get good at the game." Indeed, Smitten would be too distracted by thinking about the Princess, the Hero is just a basic protagonist, and you can't get Broken to do anything at all. So that's three of them eliminated off the bat. What about the remaining nine?</p>
<p>"So there’s two important components of Minesweeper," Tony explains. "There’s accuracy, of course. If you hit a mine, you’re donezo. But there’s also speed. You only really “win” if you’re faster than other people. Skeptic’s an overthinker, so he’s out. Cold’s too bored all the time to do anything quickly." Two more eliminated by being too slow. We're down to six in the lineup. If speed wasn't a factor, perhaps Skeptic would still be in the game, given he's one of the more strategic voices, but it's no surprise Cold doesn't care enough. It's worth noting that Contrarian wasn't mentioned at all, presumably because he's automatically eliminated by nature of never wanting to do what you're supposed to.</p>
<p>"Another important thing to know about Minesweeper is that it’s <em>bullshit</em>. Specifically, the way the game’s set up, it’s <em>really</em> easy to get stuck in a position where you literally have a 50/50 chance of losing, with nothing you can do about it. This knocks out Stubborn, who would start raging at it, and Cheated, who would also rage at it. Paranoid is out of the running because he would just spend way too much time on those spaces, unable to commit." Alas, both Cheated and Stubborn do get mad very easily when they can't win a game. If there was a Minesweeper computer in the headspace to flip off a table, you know they would be rushing to flip it first.  Four eliminated! Only two voices left in the run to win at head Minesweeper, which means...</p>
<p>"This leaves us with Hunted, who’s a good all-rounder, and Opportunist, who’s a backstabbing sleaze, but who has such I-work-in-an-office energy that you just <em>know</em> he’s played too much Minesweeper while other people were doing most of the heavy lifting." Of all the Voices, Hunted tends to have the most practical input besides Hero, being one of the only ones good at keeping you alive besides Paranoid and Skeptic, so it's no wonder he made it to the finals. So if it's between the conniving backstabber and the straightforward but helpful survivalist Voice, who comes out on top?</p>
<p>"But ultimately I’ve gotta go with Voice of the Hunted. He’s fast, but he also has that survival instinct that would screw over some of the more persistent voices." Opportunist has been defeated! Considering his spine tends to disappear so he can suck it up and gain the upper hand, it's not a surprise he lost to Hunted. Hunted has much more of a spine to work with and sticks to trying to survive. No time to bend like a folding chair, got too many mines to sweep!</p>
<p>"I don’t play Minesweeper like that," was all Abby had to say to this question.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9812460141741858409gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9812460141741858409gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the cabin door open and the outside world visible again, it's clear the path to Slay The Princess' finish was a rich and vibrant one full of learning experiences and growth in every area of creativity, and of course, Minesweeper too. And all of it was done with the focused self-discipline of a due date to ensure everything stayed flowing and brought us the masterpiece of a horror visual novel we have now. Abby and Tony's development story just goes to remind all of us that anything is possible if you set your mind to doing it. Even Slaying a Princess' Development!</p>

      <title>Ubisoft announce Steam Deck support for Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows at launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a surprise turnaround after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/no-support-for-assassins-creed-shadows-on-steam-deck-at-launch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously stating</a> the Steam Deck would not be supported for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft have now said it actually will be.</p>
<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on X/Twitter <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1899863156995903687" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10051083501741857803gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have been asking about Steam Deck.  We are happy to say that we are supporting Steam Deck at launch and are currently awaiting the level of classification from Valve. More info to come soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, Valve rated it as Unsupported on Steam Deck with their rating that went live on February 8th. At time of writing, the Steam page still shows this Unsupported rating so it will be interesting to see what Ubisoft have changed to actually get it supported. Hopefully Valve will give it an appropriate rating and not just bump it up to Verified if it has poor performance like we've seen a couple of times in the past.  Valve's rating is usually correct though, just a few random outliers that don't match up.</p>
<p>The game is due to release on March 20th on Steam so we don't have long to find out.</p>

      <title>Machine Mind blends real-time action with survival and RTS elements to make a fun mix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chudo-Yudo Games are working on Machine Mind, an interesting mixture of strategy and action genres blended together. There's a demo available to try with Linux support, along with an expanded playtest.</p>
<p>Set on a barren world after some sort of nuclear war following a virus that swept the planet (that sounds familiar…), Earth has become a wasteland filled with raiders. Your ship has crash-landed, and now you have to survive. Here though, your consciousness was stored in some sort of computer system, so you take control of a customizable vehicle and go on your way to build it up and create a base of operations. The game appears to be about you surviving long enough, so that you can launch yourself back into space.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eCse8YS6qeQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9093b8c8febc64c7b807b43fa92421f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eCse8YS6qeQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot of customizable vehicle action games, but not many blend in the strategy side of it like this too. An interesting mixture that I'm definitely keen to see more from and the demo worked great.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Crafting: Create weapons, modules and equipment from the resources you gather to improve your vehicles and fortify your base.</li>
<li>Building: Reconstruct dilapidated bases, build fortifications and facilities to ensure your survival in the dangerous environment.</li>
<li>Fighting: Join exciting battles against raiders and bosses by using advanced weapons and combat modules.</li>
<li>Modular machines: Build and modify your rovers using various modules to attune them to different tasks, from resource gathering to fighting.</li>
<li>Tactical control: Plan your actions and assign roles to your vehicles to maintain your strategy.</li>
<li>Automation: Assign transport rovers to complete various objectives like gathering, building and defence by using strategic game mechanics.</li>
<li>Survival in extreme conditions: Face not just your enemies, but forces of nature, such as sandstorms and radiation.</li>
<li>Exploration of different biomes: Navigate various locations, from deserts to abandoned factories, each full of resources, enemies and secrets.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint the cyberpunk XCOM-like hits full launch on May 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by games like XCOM 2, Shadowrun and Invisible Inc the latest from Trese Brothers with Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is set to leave Early Access on May 15th with a new update out now. <em>It's also on sale for the next 24 hours.</em></p>
<p>Much loved for their previous games including Star Traders: Frontiers and Templar Battleforce, their cyberpunk heist adventure with squad-based stealth and RPG mechanics has expanded a whole lot during its time in Early Access. One addition that's live now is their first retirement storyline, a sort-of end-game point and they plan to add multiple of these in for when one of your characters is ready to retire.</p>
<p>There's even a new trailer to show off all their progress:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5cumHBWrUGE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77c189eb3f9c18113cefc258f40434f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5cumHBWrUGE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking more about this retirement feature they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retirement Storylines are pinnacle opportunities in your Cyber Knight's career, accessible only when you've built a rep as the Knight that gets things done. Multiple offers will give you the opportunity to get started on a chain of escalating missions leading to one last big heist that could get you out of the game for good.</p>
<p>Come out on top, and you'll have a window of time to decide (and complete any lingering unfinished business with your mercs or other contacts) if you want to take the retirement opportunity, or continue running the streets.</p>
<p>Some Knights can't give up the thrill of the heist, and will continue to play hard and fast until they go out in a blaze of glory. Others are convinced better opportunities will come, for either a better life offworld or with more room in the opportunity to set up the squad members they've become closest to with a better life as well.</p>
<p>When you retire or die, you'll get a series of game-end screens sharing what becomes of you and your squad members, a key stats &amp; achievements summary, and your save-game will be memorialized so you can come back and export appearance or talent tree builds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to a proper full playthrough with the 1.0 content. They have plans post-release too but they haven't revealed what just yet.</p>

      <title>Amazon GameLift Streams allows devs to run their own streaming platform - supports Linux and Proton runtimes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon recently announced their new GameLift Streams service, allowing game developers to spin up their own game streaming solutions.</p>
<p>This reminds me of what happened with the shutdown of Google Stadia, where Google also attempted to turn it into a solution developers could directly use but that died with Stadia's shutdown. Perhaps Amazon will be more successful here, although this may be a sign their own Amazon Luna is not doing particularly well.</p>
<p>Amazon first announced this on March 6th noting it allows developers to upload their games onto fully-managed GPU instances in the cloud, and then get streaming in minutes with "little or no modification of their code". For players the service will work across PCs, phones, tablets, smart TVs and WebRTC-enabled browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox and Safari were named directly). This is a white-label solution, meaning developers can fully integrate it with their own services, stores, websites and so on.</p>
<p>Companies already using it include Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc., Jackbox Games, Ludeo, and Xsolla.</p>
<p>From the press release: “With more than 750 million people playing games running on AWS every month, we have a long history of supporting the industry’s game development, content creation, player acquisition, personalization, and more,” said Chris Lee, general manager and head of Immersive Technology at AWS. “Amazon GameLift Streams can help the game industry transform billions of everyday devices around the world into gaming machines without rebuilding game code or managing your own infrastructure. For game developers, this creates exciting new revenue and monetization opportunities that weren’t possible before.”</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2025/3/amazon-gamelift-streams-empowers-developers-to-stream-games-to-virtually-any-device" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> also specifically noted how it supports "Windows, Linux, and Proton runtimes".</p>

      <title>Time-travelling adventure Old Skies from Wadjet Eye Games arrives April 23</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wadjet Eye Games have announced their next game, the time-travelling adventure Old Skies, is now set for launch on April 23rd. It will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>More about it: "Fia Quinn is a time traveler, accompanying clients of the ChronoZen Time Travel Agency on jumps to other eras to make sure they don't rewrite important aspects of history. Some of these people are merely curious. Others have unresolved business. As long as they can pay for the trip, their motivations don't matter to Fia... until they do."</p>
<p>There's also a new trailer:</p>

<p>Some info from behind the scenes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old Skies' designer, Dave Gilbert, has been releasing story-driven adventure games for almost two decades through his tiny independent studio, Wadjet Eye Games. Nearly all of his games have been set in a supernatural version of his beloved hometown of New York City.</p>
<p>Although he has collaborated with other indie developers more recently, Old Skies is Dave's first personal project since IGF-nominee Unavowed in 2018. He's been working on Old Skies for almost six years, after first playing with the time travel concept in a game jam that he entered using a pseudonym.</p>
<p>Old Skies ups the ante for Wadjet Eye's output with high-res 1920x1080 graphics hand-drawn by artist Ben Chandler, an original musical score by composer Thomas Regin, and professional voice acting from Wadjet Eye's largest cast to date. Though Old Skies can be enjoyed by anyone, plenty of references and Easter eggs are waiting for those familiar with Unavowed and the Blackwell mysteries.</p>

      <title>Get ready for some chaos as POSTAL 2: VR has been announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Running With Scissors along with Flat2VR Studios and Team Beef have announced the chaotic action game Postal 2 is coming to VR with a completely overhauled experienced. POSTAL 2: VR sounds like a lot of fun, I'll definitely have to check this out with my Valve Index.</p>
<p>From the press release: "POSTAL 2 VR isn’t some half-baked port—it’s being meticulously rebuilt for maximum virtual reality debauchery. Manual weapon handling, gesture-based NPC interactions, and physics-driven melee combat let you get your hands dirty (sometimes literally). The inventory and mini-map have been completely redesigned for VR, giving you easy access to every tool of destruction at your disposal. And of course, bodily function mechanics are fully interactive—because whether you're lining up the perfect shot or streaming for a live audience, accuracy matters. "</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>I hope Valve are watching closely with Microsoft working towards an Xbox Handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Microsoft pushing to improve Windows on handhelds, and reportedly working with a specific partner on an Xbox-branded gaming handheld, Valve should be watching closely with their Linux plans for Steam Deck and SteamOS.</p>
<p>This news comes across two reports. There's <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a> that noted how there's an actual Xbox-branded gaming handheld that Microsoft are working on with a third-party hardware vendor. And then also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reporting on Microsoft's wider plans to improve Windows on handhelds.</p>
<p>This could end up being a big problem for Valve, potentially derailing their efforts on the Steam Deck and Linux as a whole. You may think I'm being perhaps a bit <em>alarmist</em> here but vendor lock-in is a <em>serious</em> thing. It makes me think back to the time where Valve's Gabe Newell <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/valves-gabe-newell-talks/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">called</a> Windows 8 a "catastrophe" and how Valve had embraced Linux as a "hedging strategy" against more Windows lock-in.</p>
<p>I hope Valve are watching closely on this, because you can be guaranteed that Microsoft will be continuing to try and push more people towards the Microsoft Store, Game Pass and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Naturally they will be, Microsoft will want any hardware that's first-party or third-party to be properly worth their time and money investments into them. As they continue to refine the Windows handheld experience, potentially making it look more Xbox-console like, then of course it will be tied more to the Windows Store too. And if done well, that's less people looking to Steam. Not everything lasts forever.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve preparing a public Beta of SteamOS</a>, and all their work that has gone into Proton to get Windows games running on Linux (that I noted in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/happy-three-years-to-the-steam-deck-the-linux-gaming-machine-that-changed-everything/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three years of Steam Deck anniversary article</a>), it's clear that Valve are still on the right track not to be tied to one operating system and having their own software and hardware together. So, with that in mind, I sure do hope they're continuing to work on a Steam Deck 2 and eventually a proper more powerful living room console — all powered by Linux.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.1 will default to Zink+NVK instead of the old Nouveau OpenGL driver for NVIDIA on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time for a bit of modernisation. With the upcoming Mesa 25.1 release, Collabora developer Faith Ekstrand announced a big change for NVIDIA GPU users. If you're not using the proprietary NVIDIA driver, that is.</p>
<p>The old Nouveau OpenGL driver will no longer be used by default, and instead they're going to be switching it out of the box to use Zink + NVK. A <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/29232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merge request</a> for Mesa to do the change for "turing and above", that being the likes of the GeForce RTX 20xx series and GeForce GTX 16xx series and newer, was opened back in May 2024 with it just about to be pulled in now.</p>
<p>Confused? As a reminder — Zink is an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan. While NVK is a Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs. Ekstrand mentioned how Zink has "matured a lot" and they're "fairly confident that Zink+NVK will be an improvement over Nouveau GL across the board".</p>
<p>Mesa 25.1 is due a fourth release candidate on May 7th, or the 25.1 final release if it's deemed ready. So not that long to wait on this.</p>

      <title>The Triple-i Initiative gaming showcase returns for 2025 with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like we're set for a bunch more interesting game reveals! The Triple-i Initiative gaming showcase has announced a return for 2025 and it's likely another good one.</p>
<p>This is something that was teased by many indie game devs <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/triple-i-initiative-teased-by-devs-of-vampire-survivors-darkest-dungeon-risk-of-rain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in March last year</a> and then a showcase arrived in April where we had announcements like Slay the Spire 2, The Rogue Prince of Persia, Brotato DLC and many others.</p>
<p>A very brief teaser is live now featuring Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, The Alters, Endless Legend 2, No, I’m Not A Human, and Enshrouded:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q-kxf97IwQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d8464878f8867d88546061aed136196.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q-kxf97IwQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We’re still newbies in this whole ‘video game showcase business’, so our goal with the second edition is not to try to fix something that isn’t broken. The show was well-received last year so we stuck to the same short and impactful formula while making it bigger and better of course! Players can expect a show packed with back-to-back exciting announcements and… that’s it. No ads, no hosts, no sponsors, just games,” said Benjamin Laulan, Evil Empire’s COO.</p>
<p>The whole idea for it started with Evil Empire wanting a flashy way to announce The Rogue Prince of Persia, but they decided to pull in other studios to show off their next big thing. From what they say the reveals from last year picked up over 13 million views on YouTube.</p>
<p>“This year, Evil Empire doesn’t have a flashy new game to unveil (sorry!), but since we loved making the show we want to keep the party going for everyone anyway. Dropping all these announcements from our corner of the gaming world in one big blast makes sure the entire show is fun to watch for our players, and for us too! We’re very thankful to all our fellow studios who worked with us to make this possible again.” said Bérenger Dupré, Evil Empire’s Marketing Director.</p>
<p>It's a great idea to build up support for some smaller studios, especially with how certain other events seemingly go on forever with lots of adverts, sponsors and all sorts stuffed in. Nice to see such a focused event with no fluff. Various developers have begun teasing their inclusion in the event like Shiro Games, 11 bit studios, Amplitude Studios, SHUEISHA GAMES, Square Glade Games and more as time goes on now the 2025 has been teased.</p>

      <title>First trailer live for Skull Horde where you command an army of dead soldiers as a floating skull</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer 8BitSkull (BORE BLASTERS, Void Scrappers) their next game is Skull Horde, an auto-battling dungeon crawler where you raise up an undead army while floating around. It's going to release this year with Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>I really liked both BORE BLASTERS and Void Scrappers, so I'm keen to see more from 8BitSkull. Hard to really get a good idea from the trailer though but looks quite chaotic during all the battles.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g7xEcIPxSr0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf1034cf9be996eaff19591b1d78023e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g7xEcIPxSr0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Betrayed by his own flesh and blood, buried, and forced to spend an eternity underground, our necromancer protagonist has a literal bone to pick, and goes on a revenge mission against the rest of his body. Call upon your fellow living-challenged and watch your minions do your bidding independently, in real-time auto-battles.</p>
<p><em>Skull Horde</em>’s procedurally generated dungeons are populated with unique enemy types, each with their own strategies to send you back from whence you came. Each run provides new ways to take down fleshfolk as you collect loot and boons from chests and shrines, upgrade and merge units, and unlock powerful perks that combine with each playable character’s strengths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Body? No Problem!: Stunt on the haters (your own body) as one of multiple playable characters with unique special abilities, including the option of being a floating skull.</li>
<li>Super Soldier Squad: Turn your army into the finest assortment of expendable minions that money can buy, combining loot found in the dungeons to gain great advantages, and merging multiple units to make them stronger.</li>
<li>Procedurally Generated Dungeons: No two dungeons are alike and each level features a variety of enemy types, ensuring that builds must be tinkered and tweaked to overcome their attacks. Unique challenges that reward new unlocks and content will also keep you on your skele-toes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Hilarious physics-based 2D multiplayer brawler Oblin Party is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tellus Games have released Oblin Party, a physics-based 2D party party brawler where you have direct control over your two hands made with Godot. It has Native Linux support and should work great on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>A highly dynamic funny brawler where you use your wiggly arms to throw yourself around the various chaotic maps. You can play it via local multiplayer or online too for 2-4 players. The main idea is to force your friends off the map to win, by whatever means necessary. Outwit them using physics fun with your arms or pick up a weapon.</p>
<p>It's not just you with the physics though. The maps are wobbly as well and react to both of you, so things do get pretty funny in it. There's even a single-player time-trial mode so you can get better at the physics system.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xQO_PdqUehM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/56c3ad37a74a1b6e9b8039b18849f847.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xQO_PdqUehM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Well worth a look if you have people to play with.</p>

      <title>Muffles&#39; Life Sentence is a new dark comedy RPG where you swap your face</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a first episode that's completely free, Muffles' Life Sentence is a really weird dark comedy 2D RPG where have to swap your face and it's well worth a look. </p>
<p>Here you've been sent to prison where their doctors do clearly pretty terrible things to you depending on your crimes. Your new body has no face and they've sewn your mouth shut, and so you end up being called Muffles. You do have a rather overly-chatty cellmate though to make up for it, who clearly can't understand a word you're trying to say. It has card-based combat and deck-builder elements, with you unlocking more as you go with the face and memory system and so far it just seems thoroughly great.</p>
<p>It's seriously weird and quirky, and a rather unexpected pleasure to find this week. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7G-M6zQ3xWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8213ae0ba2f16838dc01b631c03c5fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7G-M6zQ3xWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features (from the Steam page):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlockable faces to swap identities and gain new abilities.</li>
<li>Deckbuilding card combat without grinding or random encounters.</li>
<li>A colorful cast of absurd criminal monsters.</li>
<li>Statuses that include: Panic Attack, Looking for Shiv, and Poison.</li>
<li>Visuals boasting 3 whole colors.</li>
<li>A great soundtrack you need to see to believe.</li>
<li>A serial story released in episodes.</li>
<li>Puzzles that aren’t TOO tedious.</li>
<li>Dee is in this games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A dark comedy RPG with quirky characters and a pretty interesting looking story. You can play it on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> where I tested it working great. A game that definitely deserves a lot more eyes on it. One of the most unusual games I've tried out recently.</p>
<p>With the first episode free, the second episode is out now (paid) and a third episode is on the way.</p>

      <title>Completely ridiculous online 1v1 shooter STRAFTAT added a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STRAFTAT originally launched in October 2024, and just recently the developer added a Linux version. It's a completely ridiculous competitive 1v1 online shooter with quick rounds and lots of weapons.</p>
<p>Each round in the game takes place on a different map, with each map having a different set of weapons. The weapons are pretty ridiculous, as is the game as a whole. Pretty fun though. The Linux version arrived with the Music Update v1.2.2 which also added in a whole bunch of new music tracks, a match history feature, new maps and a new "overpowered bukanee-like smg".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SofVVFEkWNg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cba9faff7d937d3e78fad2bbe3070ea1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SofVVFEkWNg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the game is free to play there is also a single DLC you can buy that gives you over 70 additional maps and 10 extra guns. The DLC content is available to both players, as long as the game host has it, which seems entirely reasonable to me.</p>
<p>A really over the top game for when you and a friend (or a random person online) fancy blasting each other to pieces for a few rounds when you have some free time.</p>
<p><em>The Lemaitre Bros previously released BABBDI in 2022, which is a short, first person exploration experience.</em></p>

      <title>Worms 2 Plus patch for the Team17 classic gets revamped online multiplayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the classic Worms 2? Modders continue improving it with the Worms 2 Plus patch, which recently had a major update that makes playing online way easier. I previously wrote about this mod patch <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/play-worms-2-on-linux-with-the-worms-2-plus-patch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in April 2022</a> and it's great to see it continue on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12488220111741697976gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Carlmundo/W2-Plus/releases/tag/1.7" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Version 1.7</a> of the patch was just released with all these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Revamped online multiplayer!
	<ul>
<li>Play via TCP over a Worm2NAT Relay Server (thanks to fkWorm2NAT by Dawid8)</li>
<li>No port forwarding required</li>
<li>IP addresses are now hidden</li>
<li>Multiple computers with the same external IP can now play on the same server and games</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IPX is now used for LAN/VPN games only</li>
<li>Added 9 terrains from Worms 1/Reinforcements/United (Ported to W:A by CarmineLynx, converted using W2TerrainConvert by Dawid8)</li>
<li>Installation automatically sets the recommended resolution for your screen</li>
<li>Settings app improvements - new option for separate Cavern map resolution</li>
<li>Improvements for Wine in online games</li>
<li>Improved the "disabled LAN" image in the menu</li>
<li>Updated menu text to reflect the purpose of IPX</li>
<li>Fixed:
	<ul>
<li>In-game crash that occurred when you zoomed in during an online game</li>
<li>Layout of the game statistics screen for high DPI users (Dawid8)</li>
<li>TOOLS level (from W:A) now has it's background image (Dawid8)</li>
<li>Issue with limits of "Amount of fire" and "Override fuse" in Weapon editor</li>
<li>Minor typo present on game statistics screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated cnc-ddraw to v7.1</li>
<li>Updated C++ Redistributables</li>
<li>Optimised modules: fkMissions, fkSettings (Dawid8)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The patch has loads of other extras included from previous updates. Making it the best way to play. I sure do love seeing classics get such huge community support like this.</p>
<p>You need a copy of the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/worms_2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">game from GOG</a> which is currently on a 79% discount until March 15th. So good timing! Then you can then run games from GOG on Linux with the Heroic Games Launcher making it really easy. In this case it needs Wine / Proton.</p>

      <title>Isle of Reveries looks like a fun classic Zelda-like with some interesting game mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired clearly by the likes of classic Zelda and the Game Boy Color, Isle of Reveries is one for fans of retro games that want something new and fresh.</p>
<p>Here you'll be travelling through the overworld and various dungeons, each of them split into distinct biomes with each area having their own unique mechanics from puzzle-focused areas to "open-ended, straightforward combat gauntlets".  You play as a little owl named Lief, who has a fairy companion that can copy various objects in the game world. As the developer said: "Need to shoot an enemy from a distance? Copy and spawn the arrow-shooter. Need to keep a switch pressed? Copy and spawn a block." — sounds fun.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A large world that doesn’t hold the player’s hand, filled with charming anthropomorphic characters.</li>
<li>Eight dungeons, each with their own distinct theme and key item.</li>
<li>Key items that are useful in both combat and puzzle solving, and remain so after completing the dungeons they’re found in.</li>
<li>Use the fairy companion to copy and spawn various objects found in the world, including puzzle blocks, torches, mushrooms, and more.</li>
<li>Dedicated jump button so that there’s always space to equip the most relevant items.</li>
<li>Take a break from the adventure and enjoy bug catching and fishing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam right now and it's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/desertcucco/isle-of-reveries/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a> with the goal really close to being hit.</p>

      <title>Control Ultimate Edition is adding HDR, ultrawide, FOV scaling, updated DLSS and DLAA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice surprise! Control Ultimate Edition is set for a big update today to bring in a bunch of extra graphics features and tweaks along with some bug fixes. <em>It currently works on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verifed.</em></p>
<p>Here's all that's changed in update 1.30:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OUTFITS</strong><br/>
The following outfits are now available to all players. The outfits can be accessed and equipped from the Control Point in the Central Executive Sector area.</p>
<p>• Astral Dive Suit (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br/>
• Tactical Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br/>
• Urban Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br/>
• Extradimensional Suit (formerly obtainable in the AWE DLC by finishing SHÜM)</p>
<p><strong>MISSIONS</strong><br/>
All players will receive the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima. The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector. (This mission was previously exclusive to the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe version of Control.)</p>
<p><strong>GRAPHICS</strong><br/>
• Added HDR support<br/>
• Added new Ultra ray tracing preset, which gets you more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability<br/>
• Added ultrawide monitor support for up to 48:9 monitors<br/>
• Added an FOV scaling setting for the gameplay camera<br/>
• Updated SDR to 10bit (from 8bit), which reduces visible color banding<br/>
• Improved graphics adapter detection at startup, with automatic selection between DX11 and DX12<br/>
• Implemented screen aspect ratio fixes for ultrawide monitors<br/>
• Your current monitor resolution can now reliably be selected from the screen resolution and rendering resolution menus<br/>
• Added rendering resolution support beyond 4K<br/>
• Implemented texture streaming fixes<br/>
• Ray tracing bug fixes</p>
<p><strong>DLSS SUPPORT</strong><br/>
• Added DLSS support for arbitrary resolutions<br/>
• Added DLAA support<br/>
• Updated DLSS to DLSS 3.7, with higher temporal stability<br/>
• Film grain added back to DLSS SR<br/>
• Fixed shadow resolution when DLSS is enabled<br/>
• Added resolution dependent mip map bias for DLSS. This enhances texture quality, for example when applying the DLSS Performance setting.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL</strong><br/>
• Updated the audio on cinematics and end credits to remove unintended channel mixing. You will no longer hear anything that isn’t intended to be heard. (It wasn’t the Hiss, it was us. Sorry.)<br/>
• Several bug and crash fixes</p>

<p>I really enjoyed playing through Control, it had me absolutely hooked when it arrived quite a few years ago now. If you haven't played it yet you're in for a good time. One of those where you just keep on pushing through, as you just really want to know more.</p>

      <title>Fallout and DOOM get combined in the Fallout: Vault 666 mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one to start your week off right. Modder Carl Asami has combined the worlds of Fallout with DOOM for you to blast through. Originally released back in January, the modder has continued improving it since release. You even get your own Dogmeat companion that will fight along side you.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the Mod DB page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>War. War never changes. And neither does-</p>
<p>THE DOOM DWELLER- you were chosen by THE OVERSEER to enter VAULT 666 and locate THE WATER CHIP. If you fail, your home, your friends, and your PET BUNNY will perish.</p>
<p>Traveling the Wasteland, your investigations lead you to a CAVE ENTRANCE. But what's this? No vault dwellers in sight, but more mutants than you can shake a boomstick at! It stinks like rotten meat!</p>
<p>So, pump that POWER FIST, rev that RIPPER, and unload your 10MM, right into the face of HELL! Welcome to VAULT 666!</p>
<p>Death in the Vault is about to change!</p>

      <title>Roll20 co-creator reveals bullet hell MMO Wyld Land with a demo up now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the co-creators of the popular Roll20 virtual tabletop Roll20 has revealed Wyld Land, a free to play bullet hell MMO. Made in the spirit of similar games like Realm of the Mad God and Nuclear Throne, it's sure to be a delight for bullet hell fans that want an easy game to quickly jump into.</p>
<p>A demo is available now, although it appears to be fully-featured. Giving you "over 30 hours of content, including 14 dungeons to explore and unique bosses to encounter" and I've tested it working perfectly on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n4aCiwoQyW8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57bb9178200b2d328a35839e3de91e0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n4aCiwoQyW8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intense bullet hell combat:</strong> Masterfully maneuver through waves of bullets as you unleash destruction. Wield assault rifles, fusion cannons, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Built for solo and multiplayer:</strong> Dive into the run alone or team up with runners in real-time. <em>Wyld Land</em>’s servers are purpose-built for the most frenetic twitch gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>Death is not the end: </strong>You can’t retrieve your equipment if you’re dead. But persistent upgrades – known as Echoes – gradually make you better prepared for your next run.</li>
<li><strong>Deep build customization: </strong>Customize your build through equipment, mix and match weapons, and discover new abilities mid-run to create your perfect dungeon delving character.</li>
<li><strong>Ever-changing dungeons: </strong>Dungeons in <em>Wyld Land</em> are procedurally generated – no run is ever the same. And when you’re ready for the next challenge, mutate the world through corrupted shards. The bigger the challenge, the greater the rewards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More about the developer: Bag of Holding is a new game development studio founded by Roll20 co-creator Riley Dutton, focused on "creating sustainable games for passionate communitie"s. Wyld Land is their debut title.</p>
<p>Riley Dutton said: “Bag of Holding was created to make the games we want to see in the world. We make no secret of our inspirations – we love Realm of the Mad God, Enter the Gungeon, and Nuclear Throne, and so many others, and we want Wyld Land to join this incredible pantheon. We can’t wait for players to get their first taste of what Wyld Land offers, and with our plans for the future, we want you to be playing for years to come.”</p>

      <title>Death Stranding 2 has a new trailer and PS5 release date - hopefully a PC release isn&#39;t far off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p style="text-align:justify">I am so unbelievably excited to play Death Stranding 2, and the new 10 minute trailer gives us a healthy dose of what to expect from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">A release date for PS5 has been announced for June but they're not talking PC release date yet, so we likely have a while to wait on this one. Going by the dates of previous Sony PS5 to PC releases, we're probably going to be waiting at least a year on it. Shame, but it gives Valve a lot of time to continue to improve Proton, so hopefully when it releases we won't see any Linux compatibility issues.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eT_A2gPhTIw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95b5dd8a9d36e972bfe798674fa109e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eT_A2gPhTIw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Few trailers make me really sit back and laser-focus like this. That was definitely something. I need it.</p>
<p>In addition a special concert tour was announced, to celebrate the music in Death Stranding. This tour will have a full orchestra that will start on November 8, 2025. More on that <a href="https://www.deathstrandingconcert.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>At least by the time it comes to PC we should have any expansions and updates all done too.</p>
<p>See all the details in the Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-june-26-collectors-edition-revealed/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VoxeLibre the free and open source Minecraft-like game available via Luanti (formerly Minetest), just had another big release made available. The new v0.89 brings lots of improvements to gameplay and performance.</p>
<p>A game that likely needs no real introduction here. You know the drill. It's an open world survival sandbox game. Do whatever you want in it. Unlike Minecraft though, this is free and open source.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what's new and improved includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved signs with partial UTF-8 support, sign cleaning and more.</li>
<li>The reworked item frames, including invisible ones for creative mode, can now be placed on floors, ceilings, walls, etc.</li>
<li>Maps can now be zoomed-out on the cartography table.</li>
<li>The structure generation is more deterministic, making it easier to share your experience with others when you find great world seeds.</li>
<li>Multiple performance improvements to make the game smoother.</li>
<li>Mob spawning is now more reliable and efficient.</li>
<li>You can now sit on stairs, slabs and blocks from mods supporting it. Plus commands to sit and lay anywhere.</li>
<li>The hollow logs now have a ladder variant, allowing players to climb through them.</li>
<li>Multiple textures have been improved.</li>
<li>More sounds have been added for a more immersive gameplay.</li>
<li>Dropped kelp no longer plagues the waters.</li>
<li>Knockback and critical hits got fixed.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cities: Skylines 10th anniversary will bring updates and DLC for both games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox and Colossal Order have announced that to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Cities: Skylines that both the original and sequel are getting updates (and of course more DLC). <em>It's Paradox, so of course new DLC was coming.</em></p>
<p>For the original (which has a Linux version) on March 25th the free anniversary patch will release with "dynamic parks" that will "change in appearance to reflect the different expansions each player has added to their game, to give a personalized tribute to players’ unique experiences with Cities: Skylines". Additionally these creator pack DLCs will also release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emerging Downtown, a pack focused on adding a variety of building sizes and construction styles to cities’ busy downtown areas.</li>
<li>Countryside, adding a selection of rural charm from small-town libraries and food markets to quaint, humble town halls.</li>
<li>The Harvest Harmony Radio Station, a country-inspired selection of musical tracks to fit any rural construction project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Earlier on March 18th, Cities: Skylines II also gets an anniversary patch with "a selection of new in-game parks and buildings themed around celebrating the series’ birthday". Plus these creator packs which can be purchased individually or free as part of the Ultimate Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Gate, a content pack inspired by Chinese architecture and “market quarter” locations.</li>
<li>Leisure Venues, including new entertainment options, parks, and leisure locations.</li>
<li>Mediterranean Heritage, which adds buildings inspired by 15th-19th century architecture from Spain, Italy, Portugal, and Southern France.</li>
<li>Atmospheric Piano, Jade Road, and Feelgood Funk Radio Stations.</li>
</ul>

<p>“We founded Colossal Order with the dream of creating a city-builder that would bring more freedom and creativity to the cities players can build,” said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order. “With Cities: Skylines, that dream not only came true, but thanks to the continued support of our amazing fans, we had the opportunity to keep growing and building this game and community many years after its release and take it even further than anticipated. It's been an incredible journey that's taught us so much — and still has more to teach — and we are forever grateful to everyone who made it possible and who joined us along the way.”</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 mod for Stardew Valley is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The big and impressive Baldur's Gate 3 mod for Stardew Valley is out now bringing with it a bunch of new content for fans of both games. It's not just some basic skin on top of the game either, a lot of love went into this one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual.  You can find the entrance to Baldur's Village at the top of the southern mountain map, right next to Linus' tent.  </p>
<p>Baldur's Village is a large expansion mod for Stardew Valley, inspired by Baldur’s Gate 3. It introduces a brand-new village map and NPCs while staying true to the game's original atmosphere. Among them, Astarion features a fully developed personal storyline and is available for marriage. </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2756481441741599271gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2756481441741599271gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>New map and NPCs.</li>
<li>General event for players to quickly meet new characters.</li>
<li>Fully romanceable character Astarion | Events with Astarion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mod named Baldur's Village is available from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Nexus</a>. You might even be able to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/nexus-mods-app-makes-improvements-to-collections-fixes-baldurs-gate-3-script-extender-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus' new cross-platform mod launcher</a> for it since Stardew is one of the supported games.</p>
<p>While it's now available, they're not done with it. Depending on support they do plan to expand it further with Halsin’s romance storyline, and then expand the world-building, gameplay and more.</p>

      <title>Tactical FPS Due Process has a permanent price reduction</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due Process the tactical FPS from Giant Enemy Crab is seeing a small resurgence thanks to the recent big discount and renewed development, and so their team have given it a permanent price drop now.</p>
<p>It's gone from $14.99 to $9.99 / £11.99 to £8.50 which should hopefully pull in a few more players. Apart from a update small blip recently, the game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-tactical-fps-due-process-anti-cheat-now-supports-linux-plus-it-has-a-huge-discount/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has the anti-cheat now enabled</a> for Linux / Steam Deck so you should be good to go on it.</p>
<p>See the most recent update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oHi8G6iXFg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1df80afd7421c417751e743fd1ca8ff5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oHi8G6iXFg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due Process is a tactical FPS about planning and teamwork that rewards communication with teammates, allows players to draw a "playbook" directly onto the map during the planning phases, and presents a novel situation each play session thanks to a bounty of procedurally generated, hand-curated maps.</p>
<p>Fresh maps make Due Process great. Levels are built in-house via a procedurally assisted level generation process and are delivered weekly via steam update, which means you won't be playing on the same stale level. Our level designers edit each level before it goes out and are constantly trying new concepts.</p>
<p>Teamwork starts with a goal. Discuss your strategy over voice chat, and use the planning phase to draw up a plan of attack. Deploy your assets wisely over the course of three rounds, as anything fielded from your armory won't come back if destroyed or lost.</p>

      <title>Wine release their first build of Mono with the new name Framework Mono v6.14</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/microsoft-donates-the-mono-project-to-the-wine-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in August 2024</a>, Microsoft donated (or offloaded if you wish) the Mono project to the Wine team, and now the first post-move release is out under the new name Framework Mono.</p>
<p>From the release announcement: "This is the first release of Framework Mono from its new home at Winehq. It includes work from the past 5 years that was never included in a stable release because no stable branch had been created in that time. Highlights are native support for ARM64 on macOS and many improvements to windows forms for X11."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Native support for macOS on ARM. Cis-compilation on ARM macOS is now assumed to be compiling for macOS, not cross-compiling for iOS.</li>
<li>System.Windows.Forms:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed various resource leaks on X11.</li>
<li>Redesigned Clipboard and Drag And Drop implementation on X11.</li>
<li>Stability improvements on X11.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved support for generated COM interfaces.</li>
<li>Fixed some common cases where processes would hang on exit.</li>
<li>Added Georgian translation.</li>
<li>Many warning fixes. The Linux amd64 build no longer warns when compiling the C portion of the codebase, and this is enforced for new changes via CI.</li>
<li>Many bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For people confused on all the naming, this was also explained as there's multiple projects that use the name Mono</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Framework Mono is the project previously hosted at <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mono/mono</a>, which was then simply called Mono. I have made this change to distinguish it from "monovm" and "Wine Mono", which are different projects. Framework Mono is a cross-platform runtime compatible with .NET Framework.</li>
<li>"monovm" is a separate fork of the Mono runtime that's part of modern .NET and can be used instead of CoreCLR.</li>
<li>"Wine Mono" is a downstream distribution based on Framework Mono that is used in Wine to replace .NET Framework.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And to clear up .NET:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>.NET Framework is a proprietary Windows component that supports cross-platform executable code using an object-oriented model.</li>
<li>.NET Core was an open-source project supporting many of the same languages and APIs as .NET Framework but mostly incompatible with it. .NET Core was renamed to ".NET" when version 5 was released. I call it "modern .NET" to distinguish it from .NET Framework.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Whisker Squadron: Survivor does a barrel roll with Star Fox and survivor-likes smashed together - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a while in Early Access, Whisker Squadron: Survivor has launched that attempts to blend together the on-rails shooting from Star Fox with a few elements of the bullet heaven survivor-likes popularised by Vampire Survivors. <em>Note: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>Unlike a traditional on-rails shooter this is based on you completing randomised 30 minute runs, with everything changing each time you go through as you take on what's known as The Swarm. For those unaware, on-rails basically means you never stop, everything moves with you, so it’s like you're on rails. Get it? Here you destroy enemies, and collect their scrap to level up and unlock abilities as you go through a run.</p>
<p>With the full release now available they've added in a full 3 act campaign mode with a final mission, voiced characters, a finished more in-depth story along with new upgrade items.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a__GX7rE-kA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/deed3e3dcd51b7ec6854a70939f7b340.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a__GX7rE-kA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The visual style is <em>impeccable</em>. I really do love the vibrant artwork on it, all fitting with the theme so perfectly. When you're in some of the tougher battles with lots of enemies, it really looks spectacular. The action as well is great overall, especially once you get part way through a run with the mixture of enemy types, there’s plenty to keep you on your toes and to ensure the game grabs your attention. Enemies all have different attacks too. So with the randomness you never do entirely know what to expect from it. Especially intense when you have enemies firing lasers directly at you, another setting off a circular disc area attack and others firing beams across the whole area. <em>It can be a little crazy at times.</em></p>
<p>There's a lot of replay value here too, since it's a survivor-like game with randomisation in enemies, upgrades and what you'll face in it.</p>
<p>I think given people's love of Star Fox, it was always going to be <em>tough</em> for them to hit the mark with this one. The movement especially has to be pretty-much perfect. The developer has received a fair bit of negative feedback on that, since they removed the "Tilt" ability allowing you to more finely tune where your ship was pointing. There's been a lot of complaints on its removal but it could <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2140100/discussions/0/597393615056019724/#c597393727567215582" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">possibly</a> return sometime.</p>
<p>For me though, I think it all feels pretty good. Accessible with the basic movement around the screen, then there's your roll to parry enemy bullets and also a little side-swipe barrel roll too. Together they feel like it does enough right on movement to make it feel good while also remaining a challenge.</p>
<p>Some parts I wasn't a fan of though.</p>
<p>When you finish each level you pick a node from a map. You probably know this feature well by now from many different games and genres. Each node has something potentially different from new enemies to rewards. The map for each section is quite small though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17533264861741364150gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17533264861741364150gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here’s where some odd design comes in. Some nodes contain Cursed Choices that are forced on you. Pick one and get a buff, but also an (at times maddening) debuff like one hit death or get stunned every time you’re hit. For a game that’s pretty streamlined, it’s a bit punishing. Annoyingly so, because the progression in it is so god damn <em>slow</em>. You have to play a <em>lot</em> of runs to get even some of the basic extras in it and the permanent upgrades are even worse at how slow they are to unlock.</p>
<p>Another annoyance is that you also have to go through a whole entire run. You can’t save and quit during it. That may work for some types of games, but in my opinion, not this one. Picking a node on the map is literally the perfect time to let people save and come back, I don't get why this wasn't added.</p>
<p>Personally as well I found the characters distracting and a little annoying for this. I just wanted to blast through a chaotic Star Foxy take on the survivor genre. I think they should have left the story side for their other in-development Whisker Squadron game where it would have been a better fit.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12321683631741364662gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12321683631741364662gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>At its core it’s a pretty fun on-rails shooter that blends in rogue-lite progression with survivor-like features, but with a few odd design choices and one that really could have benefited from more player choice and more rewarding progression to create chaos as you fly through it. Tough to really give it a final thought, I'm a bit torn on it overall.</p>

      <title>Secret Agent Wizard Boy is Harry Potter meets Goat Simulator and it&#39;s chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From John, Evan and David Szymanski - names you might know from the likes of DUSK, My Friendly Neighborhood, Kyle is Famous, Butcher's Creek, Squirrel Stapler and more it's a thoroughly chaotic and ridiculous game about toppling an evil crime syndicate hidden beneath a prestigious wizarding school. <em><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/all-three-szymanski-brothers-are-working-on-a-chaotic-harry-potter-inspired-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I tried the demo back in October </a>which worked great on Linux with Proton.</em></p>
<p>A sandbox-style chaotic sim that really is Harry Potter meets Goat Simulator, that's probably the best possible way to describe it because it's thoroughly nuts. You know you're in for a good time when the Steam page notes how it has a "complete lack of safety nets or boundaries", so it firmly leans into the comedy of what might happen with the physics simulation going on. You'll likely find numerous ways of doing things they don't expect or plan for and that's part of the point of it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5-VikuMq7_A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a608b40e89d67aaf7fd051902e683c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5-VikuMq7_A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game runs perfectly as expected with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. As perfect as an Early Access from a tiny team can be, that is. The developers noted: "Building such a game is difficult in several ways. Mainly, designing and developing a game driven by emergent physics and object/AI behaviors is difficult without lots of feedback from players and testers. We need lots of feedback to ensure the game keeps the right balance of open-ended sandbox gameplay and interesting world progression, and to identify what bugs and general quirks work against the fun rather than adding to the fun."</p>
<p>A lot of things will kill you in it, and it can end up pretty funny. There's a target in the opening courtyard, and if you hit it a big bouncing pad appears. For science of course, I tested hitting it again while in the air and yep - fell then to my death as the bouncing pad vanished.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12045695041741355506gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I respawned, accidentally picked up a plant (was aiming for something else), so I threw it away to the side. Ah — but I didn't think of the physics. The plant <em>must</em> have hit someone, as a watering can came flying at my head and…dead again. Either that, or the watering can was hit and just bounced back at me. Never can tell with the physics in this one, it's so over-the-top. There's also actual traps to worry about too, some deaths just made me facepalm because they were <em>obviously</em> a trap. At this point I've completely lost track of how many times I've died, or what I'm supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Brings back fond memories of playing various PS1 games for endless hours doing as many stupid things as possible.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A multitude of spells to learn and inflict on others.</li>

      <title>Competitive FPS &#39;FragPunk&#39; has launched on Steam and works on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The new kid on the block here is FragPunk, an online competitive FPS that feels like a noisy flashy version of Counter-Strike blended with Valorant and the good news is the anti-cheat is enabled for Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Compatibility notes: this was tested on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> on Desktop where it was fine, but on Steam Deck there's an initial problem with you seeing a black screen (with audio) in Gaming Mode. Remembering on Desktop I had to accept their Privacy Policy, I loaded FragPunk in Desktop Mode on Steam Deck where it worked - I could use the touch screen to accept it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12793829551741346799gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4119417621741346683gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then I switched back to Gaming Mode once that was done, where it then worked fine on Steam Deck. <em>This was the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/marvel-rivals-out-now-free-on-steam-and-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exact same problem that Marvel Rivals had at launch</a>.</em></p>
<p>It's free to play with some pretty in-your-face monetization but it's clearly quite popular. Although, it remains to be seen if it will manage to do what few do and actually stick around for a while. Are the gimmicks of it good enough to keep people interested? Maybe!</p>
<p>Here you unlock over 150 "Shard Cards" as you play more of the game. These give each team certain bonuses, with each player voting on what cards to add into the game at the start of each round. It makes it a little weird, silly and actually pretty refreshing. You could get more HP, a turtle on your back to block bullets,</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4279810071741342389gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4279810071741342389gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20725042801741342391gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20725042801741342391gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Nice to see the anti-cheat enabled too. It claims it's called "Phanuel Anti-Cheat" when you load it, but it seems it's actually a variant of NEAC, which works in other games with Proton like Marvel Rivals and NARAKA: BLADEPOINT. <em>See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>
<p>Performance on my desktop (Kubuntu 24.10, AMD Ryzen 5800x, Radeon 6800XT) on max settings at 1440p seems pretty much perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11495601901741342548gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11495601901741342548gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15034419991741342550gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15034419991741342550gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>An issue I have observed on my desktop though is that the mouse likes to leave the screen. I had to set it to Fullscreen, instead of a Borderless Window to get around the issue. I thought perhaps Gamescope might help, but that then caused mouse input in matches to be broken.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck performance on Low is initially a bit all over the place though. It seems to default on Steam Deck to DirectX 11, so changing it to DirectX 12 and reloading then allowed me to use FSR 3 (FSR 3 seems locked behind DX12, you get FSR 2 for DX11). After that the performance with FSR 3 on Balanced during matches stuck pretty close to 60FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19694866231741346059gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19694866231741346059gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>

<p>Changing it over to FSR 3 Quality, and it still performed well there too.</p>

      <title>Bullet heaven survivor-like shoot &#39;em up Gunlocked 2 announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FromLefcourt have announced Gunlocked 2, a bullet heaven survivor-like shoot 'em up that takes all the goodies from the first game and greatly expands on it. The first game is really good, and works well on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton, taking all the fun stuff from games resembling Vampire Survivors with the upgrade system but in a neat space shoot 'em up package.</p>
<p>More about it: "Movement is your weapon. A sci-fi action roguelite and shmup combined, in Gunlocked 2 you'll pilot and upgrade a state-of-the-art warship against endless waves of deadly aliens. Deep customization, branching paths, truly novel weapons, and tons of unlockables offer endless replayability set against the infinity of outer space."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GFG5OTNJIeU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73c5e9e93d8136850e5d757d51f1d333.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GFG5OTNJIeU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the press email to me the developer mentioned: "A rebuilt, heavily optimized version of the previous engine, Gunlocked 2 should run even better on Steam Deck and Proton than the original."</p>
<p><!-- squire --></p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>New in the sequel:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expanded Customization: </strong>18 unique pilots, customizable warships with their own strengths and styles, and 100+ infinitely stackable upgrades offer new creative freedom.</li>
<li><strong>Branching Paths:</strong> Warp gates let you seamlessly jump to different zones that offer unique battles and rewards. Every run offers new choices!</li>
<li><strong>Refined Control:</strong> A new dodge ability gives players more control. And 360-degree analog movement brings Gunlocked out of the retro era and firmly into the present.</li>
<li><strong>Play How You Want:</strong> Play for 2 minutes or 20, Gunlocked 2 fits perfectly into whatever free time you have, then save and resume later. But death is still permanent!</li>
<li><strong>Modular Difficulty:</strong> Difficulty modifiers now come in multiple levels, and can make the game as hard or as easy as you'd like.</li>
<li><strong>Glorious Pixel Art:</strong> Huge, full color sprites with detailed animations make every bullet, bomb, and laser explode with style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fromlefcourt/gunlocked-2/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a> and has 26 days to hit the $13,500 USD goal. They're hoping to launch it in Early Access for community involvement in Q3 2025.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to fix The Finals and Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced (offline) on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released a new Proton Hotfix update which solves issues with both The Finals and Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced (offline play) on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For The Finals, the game broke once again <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/the-finals-broken-on-linux-steam-deck-yes-again-with-update-5-12-0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">after a recent patch that I covered recently</a>, so it's great to see Valve reacting quickly to fix the problems.</p>
<p>The story for Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is a bit different though, as like the previous Grand Theft Auto V "Legacy" edition, this will <em>only</em> work for single-player offline play. Rockstar updated the anti-cheat to BattlEye <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in September 2024</a>, and have chosen not to enable its support for Linux as they continue to say Linux platforms like Steam Deck are simply not supported.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14821354771741337184gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced</em></p>
<p>Announcing the update Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3ljr2gyatic2c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>: "A Proton Hotfix has been deployed for The Finals, as well as GTA V Enhanced's offline mode".

<p>If you have manually picked a version of Proton for either title, just uncheck the box for it in the properties, as Proton Hotfix will be set as the default now by Valve.</p>

<li><strong>Supersized Boss Fight –</strong> Take on Nimruza, Queen of the Burrowed Sands, in this colossal fight against a supersized insect. Tackle Nimruza alone or buddy up with friends online in one of <em>Core Keeper’s</em> biggest boss fights yet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's just the main highlights, there's going to be a fair bit more to the update. They said to expect new content throughout the whole game with plenty of community requested features.</p>
<p>Sounds awesome. Core Keeper has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Trailmakers 2.0: Pioneers is out now and it&#39;s like a whole new game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trailmakers has managed to pull in a lot of happy players since the original 2019 full release, and the developers at Flashbulb have been busy building up the massive free update with Trailmakers 2.0: Pioneers that's out now. <em>Note: my key was originally provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jIPBtURAWxU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2bbf95c845d821dd54623523936ef8d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jIPBtURAWxU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just to remove any doubt right away if you're excited to jump in — the game works great on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>It's currently rated Steam Deck Playable, due to Valve noting it requires manually bringing up the on-screen keyboard. In my testing, that was still the case with this update. Not a big deal though, but it would be good if the developer fixed that and it's not an issue on Desktop Linux of course. For the Steam Deck, I would suggest tweaking the graphics settings down just one level with the default being "Pretty but Slow" down to "Middle Road", as it just helps it keep more at 30FPS to make it smoother.</p>
<p>What we've been given with this update is practically a whole new game. It's a huge update, and quite surprising to see it be released free for all existing players as a plain update. While all the sandbox stuff is still there, it's a lot easier to get into now thanks to the brand new cinematic intro, new tutorial and a full campaign mode to play through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Trailmakers: Pioneers </strong><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>

<p>“Our players have shaped Trailmakers since its release in 2018, constantly pushing the boundaries of creativity and making vehicles that amaze us at every turn. Pioneers expands the breadth of possibilities, deepens exploration, and challenges players to build and survive like never before,” said Flashbulb Games Co-Founder Ole Teglbjærg. “Pioneers is a major step forward, but the future of Trailmakers is even brighter. Player creativity has always been at the heart of our game, and their feedback continues to shape what’s next.”</p>
<p>They also shared a roadmap of more to come:</p>

<p>If you enjoy games where you get to explore and be creative, this is definitely one to go and grab. You can get lost in it for so many hours as time just fades away.</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH gets a smaller download on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix have updated FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH and they've managed to cut down the download size for the Steam Deck and by quite a bit too.</p>
<p>Version 1.003 was released today, March 6th with these notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall game stability, including several bug fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the application sometimes crashes while playing the game on a PC using certain AMD Radeon products.</li>
<li>Reduced the package size when downloading on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparing a fresh download between my Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, the Steam Deck download for it is now 88.1GB whereas on Desktop it's showing as 144.2GB. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2599237011741273177gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Developers can actually set up a special Steam Deck only content depot on Steam which they could use to put in smaller texture packs, smaller movies and so on (as just two basic examples). <em>Not many developers actually do this. </em></p>
<p>Nice to see our favourite handheld get the update treatment from major studios, especially making it easier to actually get the game downloaded saving a whole lot of time and bandwidth for people.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS broken on Linux / Steam Deck (yes again) with Update 5.12.0 </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A reoccurring theme here with THE FINALS from Embark Studios is that it appears to break on Linux / Steam Deck each major upgrade, and it has happened again with the launch of Update 5.12.0.</p>
<p>It's not clear yet what's happening, but it could be anti-cheat related. Their update notes did mention a tweak to their anti-cheat, but it may also be unrelated since this situation has happened before multiple times and then fixed by Valve in a Proton update.</p>
<p>For me, when I go to launch it gets to the Easy Anti-Cheat loading screen and then quits with this error box:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5500218841741272607gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's already replied noting this on the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub ticket</a>. Hopefully Valve's Proton developers can take a look soon, and we may see a Proton Hotfix update like we've seen in the past.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 gets a fix for Linux / Steam Deck being detected as cheating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grinding Gear Games are showing clear support for Linux / Steam Deck with Path of Exile 2, ensuring it continues working properly.</p>
<p>Ahead of the huge Content Update 0.2.0 coming that they keep teasing, it seems a recent smaller patch to the game caused problems. Playing on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton would throw up a pretty alarming warning, noting how they'll only tell you once about using cheating software and continued use would terminate your account.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was a false alarm. The developer released 0.1.1f Hotfix today that <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3732353" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a>: "Fixed Steam Deck and other Wine-based clients being incorrectly warned for modifying the client."</p>
<p>Great to see continued and prompt support on issues like this.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>11 bit studios working on getting Frostpunk 2 up to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>11 bit studios latest game Frostpunk 2 was recently rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve, with the developer noting they are working towards getting it bumped up to Verified.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on Steam the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455087556" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re glad to inform that Frostpunk 2 is playable on Steam Deck!<br/>
<br/>
The Story Mode is fully stable and playable, with solid performance. Thanks to your feedback, we’re aware that Utopia Builder mode has some UI issues, and late-game saves might take longer to load.<br/>
<br/>
We're working on further performances and an official control layout fixes to earn the Steam Deck Verified badge ✅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see another developer keen to improve their game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BuvJAcptUd0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30653c36defa9b4b7e1cd3851567f646.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BuvJAcptUd0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Frostpunk 2 elevates the city-survival genre to a new level. Take the role of a Steward and lead your city through a cascade of calamities taking place in a postapocalyptic, snowy setting. Build large city districts with their string of endless needs and demands. Navigate through conflicting interests of factions that populate your metropolis.

      <title>FINAL FANTASY XVI removed Denuvo Anti-tamper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix released a fresh small update to FINAL FANTASY XVI on March 4th, noting a couple of minor fixes but it appears they also removed Denuvo Anti-tamper. The game originally launched on Steam on September 17, 2024.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/520831973411782758" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> only notes these two changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphics not displaying properly on certain screens.</li>
<li>Textual errors in select languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2515020/history/?changeid=U:58860670" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> picked up that Denuvo was also removed and it's no longer listed on the Steam page.</p>
<p>So if you stick to skipping over titles with Denuvo, it may be time to give it a try. This change also means it will no longer have problems with you switching Proton versions on Linux / Steam Deck, which can end up causing you to be locked out for 24 hours.</p>

      <title>Humble Choice for March 2025 has Pacific Drive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Humble Bundle have released <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Choice for March 2025</a> and it has Pacific Drive, making it a good deal even just for that one game.</p>
<p>This bundle isn't getting a good reception from subscribers though for two reasons. The first being that two of the headline games in this bundle have a below 50% review score on Steam (Homeworld 3 and Wild Hearts). That and there's <em>two</em> EA / Origin keys this time, which has caused mass complaints across Reddit and other social media (people really prefer their Steam keys), which also makes them more of a pain to claim and play on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Aside from that when you consider the lowest price of Pacific Drive on Steam being £14.99, with the Humble Choice bundle being £8.99, it's a good price even if you only want that. And Pacific Drive is a fantastic game.</p>
<p>Here's all that's included in it this month:</p>
<p><strong><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified</strong></p>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake launches in July</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Galaxy Studios and Activision have revealed that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake is real and it's going to release on July 11. This time around it will not be Epic Games Store exclusive, and appears to be entirely skipping the Epic store. <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 was Epic Exclusive for multiple years.</em></p>
<p>With Iron Galaxy Studios at the helm this time, it will be interesting to see what they can do with it. They've been co-developers on the likes of UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection and The Last of Us Part I. A few original games too like Killer Instinct and Extinction.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D-PedsiljOc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64a1dc67661b87b109e027da16673864.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D-PedsiljOc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They're also offering a Digital Deluxe Edition, which gives you 3 days early access (although they haven't correctly added it as Advanced Access on Steam yet), the Doom Slayer and The Revenant as playable skaters, additional songs for the in-game soundtrack and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1hGDSTGCTso"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/41190fd5aa4f39f05ed307205ac7ddf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1hGDSTGCTso" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reunite the crew with cross-platform online Multiplayer for up to 8 skaters in new and returning game modes.</li>
<li>Drop in to new parks or tear it up across the timeless parks from both Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 3 &amp; Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 4, authentically remade in jaw dropping 4K resolution with streamlined goals and the epic 2-minute format.</li>
<li>Hit ‘em with some drip in the expanded Create-A-Skater and Create-A-Park modes, including the ability to create custom goals to share with friends for the first time ever.</li>
<li>Shred harder than ever with more challenging goals and an enhanced New Game+ mode.</li>
<li>Whether you’re a total casual or a grungy pro, the same smooth handling and simple-to-learn controls from Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 1 + 2 will have you shredding like a Pro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The online multiplayer requires an Activision Account. </em></p>
<p>If you pre-purchase you will also get access to the "Foundry Demo" in June that lets you play "two playable skaters, two parks, and a selection of songs". So basically, you get a demo if you pre-order any edition of the game.</p>

      <title>Absolum is a beat &#39;em up RPG from the makers of Streets of Rage 4 and TMNT Shredder&#39;s Revenge </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pulling together the teams behind hits like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge and Streets of Rage 4, today we have an exciting reveal of Absolum. It's an all-new fantasy "rogue 'em up" from Dotemu and Guard Crush, with animation from Supamonks.</p>
<p>Considering both of the aforementioned games were reviewed so well, clearly their teams know what they're doing when it comes to the classic beat 'em up style. This is the first properly original game being co-developed by Dotemu, so one to watch for sure.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YvI172bkKDk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71e2702709b2fb5bb38a5ad47b748031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YvI172bkKDk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Absolum is Dotemu's boldest creation yet, standing as our first original IP and a crucial new venture for the future of Dotemu," said Cyrille Imbert, CEO of Dotemu. "Absolum builds on knowledge gained from our previous beat ‘em up collaboration with Guard Crush Games and our publishing work on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, as well as a lifelong passion we share with Guard Crush Games for classic and modern beat 'em up titles. Our ultimate goal is to fundamentally evolve the genre’s potential in a way that’s unique from the traditional brawlers we’ve all come to love, and I knew the team was well suited to accomplish this from the first time I played Absolum."</p>
<p>More from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After revitalizing the beat ‘em up genre with acclaimed titles, beat ‘em up experts Dotemu and Guard Crush Games teamed up with the incredible animators and artists from Supamonks to master a rogue 'em up subgenre in Absolum. The vision for Absolum is twofold: thrilling arcade beat ‘em up action akin to Dotemu and Guard Crush Games’ previous collaboration is at the heart of Absolum, with intricate, refined combat offering a rewarding level of depth; equally important is Absolum’s innovation of brawler design conventions, resulting in maximized approachability and replayability. Unlock items, quests and permanent warrior upgrades while mixing character skill combinations, exploring Absolum’s depth of combat in runs steeped in variety, excitement and challenge.</p>
<p>With branching pathways to explore, quests to discover, intriguing characters to encounter, and a deep variety of challenging bosses in store, Absolum’s gripping fantasy tale unravels a challenging adventure and channels the spirit of classic brawlers like Golden Axe and Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara. The entirety of Absolum’s journey is playable solo or in two-player local and online co-op.</p>
<p>Fight as one of four different rebels, each with their own unique skill set, personality and motivations, navigating through the original fantasy world of Talamh, a mysterious land filled with wonder and twisted cosmic horrors. Absolum’s announcement trailer introduced two of its distinctly formidable playable warriors: Galandra, an agile, sword-clad fighter suited for close-quarters combat; and Karl, a tanklike dwarf commanding devastating punches as well as a rifle to foil foes from a distance.</p>
<p>Absolum features an engaging narrative with themes of foiling an unbridled, dictatorial power and cheating Death itself. In the world of Talamh, a cataclysmic event caused by magic prompts the Sun King Azra to conquer all lands and sources of magic through brutal warfare, slaughtering any wizard unwilling to serve him. Talamh’s hope now lies with a defiant band of rebels aided by a mysterious, mythical mentor known as Uchawi and the similarly powerful Root Sisters, who together oppose Azra’s pursuit of total power by wielding an ancient, forbidden magic. These mythical forces empower our rebels with astonishing magic as they stoke a resistance, fight Azra's iron grip on Talamh, and discover the secret behind Azra’s ever-growing dominion.</p>

<p>Definitely one to watch! We don't yet know exactly what platforms will be supported.</p>

      <title>Studio Fizbin will be closing after releasing Reignbreaker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another developer closing up due to a tough industry. Studio Fizbin have announced they will be shutting after releasing Reignbreaker which arrives this month. Posted in an <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on their website from Alexander "Pepe" Pieper, this follows their studio being in the industry for 14 years.</p>
<p>Studio Fizbin were responsible for developing The Inner World, The Inner World - The Last Wind Monk, Say No! More, Minute Of Islands and the upcoming Reignbreaker.</p>
<p>Their announcement can be found below in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Studio Fizbin's Last Magic Trick: “Reignbreaker” </strong></p>
<p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>The name of our studio comes from a fabled magic trick, because game development often feels like an impossible feat of conjuration. But every magic show has an end, and after 14 years of giving it our all, Studio Fizbin will be winding down operations this spring after releasing <em>Reignbreaker.</em></p>
<p>The games industry is in a tough situation right now, and we’ve been affected like countless other incredible studios in recent months. Our parent company Thunderful made the decision to drastically reduce internal development in November 2024 (<a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LINK</a>), which, as Thunderful’s CEO Martin communicated in the latest quarterly report (<a href="https://www.redeye.se/events/1067750/live-q-thunderful-group-3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LINK</a>), also affected Studio Fizbin. Since then, we’ve been exploring various opportunities to work on after finishing <em>Reignbreaker</em>. Unfortunately, none of these projects will move forward, leading us to make this difficult decision.</p>
<p>This means that <em>Reignbreaker </em>will be Studio Fizbin’s final game. We believe it's going to be the best game we’ve ever released, and our amazing team will be working hard to launch it on the 18th of March as well as providing post-launch support. In our remaining time, our focus lies on two objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping the best game possible after two and a half years of hard work</li>
<li>Supporting our exceptionally talented team in finding new opportunities in the industry</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to support us, please spread the word about <em>Reignbreaker</em> and play the demo (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3384770/Reignbreaker_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LINK</a>), and support our team by reaching out to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#41292833282f260132353425282e6c27283b23282f6f2524" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f59d9c879c9b92b5868180919c9ad8939c8f979c9bdb9190">[email protected]</span></a> if you’re looking for amazing talent in a wide range of disciplines.</p>
<p>We want to thank every single one of our fans for your purchases, your fan art, your comments, your reviews, your passion, and your seemingly endless support.</p>
<p>We also would like to thank all our business partners, Medienboard, the MfG, Creative Europe, and the federal funding partners for all their support.</p>
<p>And finally, we’d like to give the biggest thanks to our team – those who are here until the end, and the many others who have found a different path on the way. Fizbin and its games are defined by its team members, and you all made this the most inspiring place to perform the world’s most difficult magic trick: making games.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Alexander “Pepe” Pieper</p>

      <title>Acclaim Entertainment returns to &#39;support indie developers and reignite classic franchises&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another old name has returned. Acclaim Entertainment that was originally founded in 1987 has relaunched, with a plan to bring back some classic games as well as new indie games.</p>
<p>They're a name I've not heard of in a long time, after filing for bankruptcy in 2004. They were previously involved with titles like Burnout, Mortal Kombat, Alien Trilogy, Turok and NBA Jam. It will be interesting to see what classics they bring back, as well as what indie developers they will pick to fund. The industry is having a tough time right now, so hopefully this opens up some opportunities for more developers.</p>
<p>According to the press release the leadership and board "spans the entertainment industry—licensing icons, professional athletes, living music legends and seasoned veterans". One such name is wrestler Jeff Jarrett: "For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the ‘80s and ‘90s," said Jarrett. "From my early involvement with the publisher’s hit 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>They've also pulled in industry veteran Alex Josef to lead as CEO, who has worked in various places across the industry, including previously leading Graffiti Games: "It’s an absolute honor and pleasure to be leading the charge in bringing Acclaim back to the forefront of the games industry," said Josef, "We’re fortunate that we have an extremely talented team and that we’ve already signed some incredible indie titles, which we’ll be revealing soon."</p>

      <title>Inspired by classic 90s animation Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon has a new trailer you need to see</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OutOfTheBit have put up a brand new trailer for their action-platformer that's inspired by the style of 90s animations. Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon is looking really good! <em>The developer previously made the positively received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1859580/Full_Void/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Full Void</a>.</em></p>
<p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/interview-with-outofthebit-on-their-cinematic-platformer-nanuka-secret-of-the-shattering-moon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my previous interview with the developer</a> for some more background on the game, their inspiration and plans for it. I was already pretty excited for this one, and this trailer has absolutely sold me on the design of it. The world looks wonderful, the action looks pretty intense and I just love the presentation here. </p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_-zerAtFGqY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f9f451f95dcae609db7da919b498d73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_-zerAtFGqY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nanuka will take players on an adventurous expedition through diverse regions, each with its own distinct environmental and architectural influences. Along the way, numerous enemies will endeavor to block your path and fellow allies will come to your aid as the mystery and secrets behind the planet’s moon begin to unravel.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Sicilian landscape, the journey begins on an island that, while initially portrayed as peaceful and picturesque, soon reveals a tale of magical abilities and a looming disaster that players must strive to avert. As the adventure and story progresses, the importance and acceptance of diverse races and beliefs will shine through preciously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At release it will have Native Linux support and no doubt work perfectly on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Monster Prom 4: Monster Con now has a demo live on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Beautiful Glitch has put up a brand new demo of Monster Prom 4: Monster Con, so you can give it a try early and see what's new in this upcoming dating sim with a whole new setting.</p>
<p>Just as crazy as previous games but unlike Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip, which focused on the adventure, Monster Prom 4 returns  more to the series dating roots.

      <title>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 gets an Easy Anti-Cheat upgrade - finally works properly on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 from developer Fatshark just got an upgrade for Easy Anti-Cheat, and this finally makes online play work properly on Linux. The developers have moved from the old-style EAC to the newer version supplied by Epic Online Services.</p>
<p>Before this update if you were playing on Linux with Proton, you would have to host the game to play with friends, otherwise it would crash quite quickly. Now that appears to no longer be a problem, although the developers aren't directly supporting it.</p>
<p>There's still one problem though! The default stable version of the game fails to launch on Linux due to the launcher, so you have to opt into the "Bypass Launcher" Beta on Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13497731581741096337gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13497731581741096337gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>After that, you'll then get launch options when you go to play the game. Select Bypass Launcher.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16462169161741096630gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16462169161741096630gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The game will then load up correctly. I've personally tested it working perfectly online joining others with Proton 9.0-4.</p>
<p>From their Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/546728306451416317" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve just pushed a patch that swaps our old version of Easy Anti-Cheat for the newest version. The previous version is scheduled to shut down on March 4, which would’ve meant no protection to the game from cheats or tampering unless we did this upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things to note about this change:</p>
<ul>
<li>For normal gameplay, <strong>there should be no notable difference.</strong> The game will continue to run normally in both Official and Modded realms, and no extra actions need to be taken from you as players to continue playing.</li>
<li>Operating Systems that had incompatibility issues with our EAC may find those issues gone with this update. We still can only officially support Windows 10 &amp; 11, but nonetheless there might be one barrier less in that aspect.</li>
<li>The system necessary to support Sanctioned Mods is changing. This means that <strong>until sanctioned mods are updated by their authors, they might not work in the official realm.</strong>
<ul>
<li>We are currently in communication with mod authors to find the swiftest solution to this issue for all sanctioned mods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connecting to other lobbies might take longer than usual at first. Will go back to normal after some time.</li>
<li><strong>Versus Quickplay will be temporarily disabled</strong> as we update the servers.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
We're working to fix the issues with Sanctioned Mods and Versus Quickplay Dedicated Servers as soon as possible, we'll keep you updated.
<blockquote>
<p>Hotfix 6.3.4 patch notes - 3rd of March</p>
<p>Features &amp; Tweaks</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the Kamu Easy Anti-Cheat for Epic Online Service</li>
<li>Improved error messaging for banned players to show reason &amp; duration.</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled Versus Quickplay / Dedicated Servers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Really nice to see.</p>
<p>I've updated our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to note the change in the status. Along with this I've added support for us to add a comment to each game on the page, like in this case where it needs the Beta as noted above.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.4 is out now with Jolt Physics, Ubershaders, Interactive in-game editing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine 4.4 has been released bringing with it a plethora of advancements for game devs, so it might be time to give it another look.</p>
<p>From the update page: "Look forward to plenty of quality of life improvements hidden within this release. Faster load speeds, reduced stutter, streamlined processes — spotting all the optimizations that have been applied in the background will take some time. On top of that, long-awaited comfort features like embedded game windows and interactive in-game editing will feel more in line with other software on the market, making transitioning between them an even smoother experience. The editor overhaul alone takes up a big chunk of this release, after all."</p>

      <title>Scarlet Hollow - The Roads Untraveled update out now, first episode free in the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scarlet Hollow is an award-winning gothic horror narrative adventure developed by Black Tabby Games (who also made Slay the Princess). Now it's better than ever with a soft relaunch with The Roads Untraveled update out now.</p>
<p>The relaunch comes as part of the Steam Visual Novel Fest that also launches today on Steam. The demo currently available features the entire first episode with progress carrying over to the full game. Plus, the full game is 25% off if you decide you want more.</p>
<p>In this big upgrade to the game you can expect to find an expanded script of more than 70,000 words from Abby Howard and Tony Howard-Arias across four episodes. As they said in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved player agency in the first two episodes of the game.</strong> Over <em><u><strong>70,000 words</strong></u></em> of new story content in Episodes 1 and 2 to explore previously unseen paths. What happens if you don't venture into the woods in Episode 1? What happens if you do your best to stay out of any and all danger at the start of Episode 2?</li>
<li><strong>A user interface and visual overhaul.</strong> That means a bigger textbox to see more options at once, and it means more immersive UI elements. Please note that while the new textbox has a little more transparency than the old one, if you'd like to remove that transparency, there's a toggle in preferences if you'd prefer the older, more opaque style (high contrast textbox).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a new trailer to go along with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pjBop46lTn8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/919a9171ea1c9d3e8646716f32133801.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pjBop46lTn8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We’re still hard at work on chapter five and beyond, but we didn’t want to wait to make significant changes and improvements to the Scarlet Hollow experience,” says Tony Howard-Arias, co-founder of Black Tabby Games. “Try the first chapter for free – and see what dangers await.”</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Secret Mode splits from Sumo Group (Tencent) to be an independent publisher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Secret Mode is a name some of you may know from publishing titles like Wobbledogs, Still Wakes the Deep, Eternal Threads and more have announced a split from Sumo Group (Tencent).</p>
<p>In their announcement they said they're going to be an "independent publisher, focused on supporting indie PC and console games". The buyout from Sumo was helped by Emona Capital, an investment firm that already has the likes of Relic Entertainment and Blackbird Interactive under their wing, with this being Emona Capital's first investment into game publishing. Emona Capital partnered with Ed Blincoe (VP Publishing) and James Schall (Co-Founder) of Secret Mode to lead the buyout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5517820011741014944gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>James Schall at Secret Mode said: “By becoming independent, we can now put all our efforts into uncovering the indie gems that gamers never knew they needed in their lives. We are committed to bringing our players the very best indie titles; not just of the future, but also by helping them discover existing indie masterpieces that have undeservedly flown under the radar in years gone by. We are working hard to empower independent developers across the globe, and hope to make some exciting announcements on this front in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Dominik Dolenec, Managing Partner at Emona Capital said: “Secret Mode has made great waves in its formative years as a publisher of independent games. We look forward to supporting Secret Mode’s mission within the independent games sector across PC and consoles.”</p>

      <title>The MechLock wall mount for Steam Deck looks ridiculously slick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want to mount your Steam Deck to a wall, you could do so with something like the Deckmate but the MechLock looks far slicker with the super-smooth locking system where you can add a charger. I have no need for it, but I definitely want it just purely based on how cool it looks.</p>
<p>This just makes me wish Steam Deck had a bottom USB-C port, so you could dock it in one smooth motion like you do with the Nintendo Switch. But hey, attach a USB hub to this and you might be able to do something similar. As I type this out, I really feel like I need to try it. Check out their quick video below:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8234236171741013405gol1.mp4"></video>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>MechLock, credit: DesignMakeShip</em></p>
<p>From their Etsy page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>𝖬𝖾𝖼𝗁𝖫𝗈𝖼𝗄 stands for "mechanical locking". This unique design uses a gearing system to secure the SteamDeck in the mount as well as ensure the USB-C charging cable is engaged. The gearbox has a gearing ratio between the upper and lower rack that causes the upper rack to move faster than the lower rack. As the lower rack moves down the upper rack engages with the top of the SteamDeck securing the system in place.</p>
<p>𝒕𝒍;𝒅𝒓: Your SteamDeck will be secured at top and bottom by its own weight.</p>
<p>This mount also offers the ability to add your own charging cable so that you can dock and charge your SteamDeck in one smooth motion. No more free hanging cables!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a few different versions available depending on what you want. One that will fit a standard Steam Deck, and then different tweaked versions for those of you that keep it in a case like JSAUX or dbrand and others. You can customize the logo colour on it too.</p>
<p>Personally, I just think it's neat.</p>

      <title>Bored? Check out the Museum of All Things and dive into Wikipedia in 3D</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a really clever idea. The Museum of All Things is a free to download experience made in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> that allows you to explore various subjects pulled from Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons data.</p>
<p>It's a living museum of knowledge you can run on Linux, macOS and Windows. You walk around and pick a subject, and then it will generate a room full of things to read and look at. A really clever idea to get more people interested in learning. The developer said they were "Deeply inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR0vRuZkxdw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">educational videos</a> that I watched as a kid, and the liminal spaces produced by early CGI, I want to recapture the promise that the internet can be a place of endless learning and exploration".</p>

<em>Pictured - Museum of All Things on Linux. Brushing up on my history. Maybe you should too.</em></p>
<p>The Godot team even <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/museum-of-all-things/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">did an interview</a> with the developer recently. While it's had the 1.0 release, the developer isn't done with it. On the <a href="https://may.as/moat/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a> they talked about some future plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the Museum of All Things version 1.0 is released, I plan on continuing to update and improve it in the future. Some features which I would like to add in the future include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiplayer support</li>
<li>Greater variety in room theming and layouts</li>
<li>Support for more media types, like audio and 3d models</li>
<li>Support for Wikipedia languages aside from English</li>
</ul>

      <title>R.E.P.O. is a new co-op horror game with silly physics currently exploding on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a Steam image of a stupid smiley face that made me initially ignore it when seeing it (the kind I would expect from some basic cheapo game), R.E.P.O. is actually pretty darn amusing and it's rocketing up the charts on Steam.</p>
<p>It runs out of the box on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. It also works on Steam Deck but you'll need to change the controls in Steam Input (there's no proper controller support yet). If you enjoy games like Lethal Company, you'll probably quite like this one too. <em>Hopefully it will have a longer life than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/horror-scavenging-game-kletka-is-like-lethal-company-but-an-elevator-wants-to-eat-you/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KLETKA</a> though.</em></p>
<p>Here you and up to 5 friends (6 total players) can run around together collecting valuables in various dark locations. It's a lot more on the <em>silly</em> side compared to Lethal Company and various other similarly styled co-op horror games that have appeared.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O. is all about the <em>physics</em> with you needing to be careful not to break your acquired valuables, or reduce their worth by smacking them into everything, especially when you're running for your life and hiding. I've lost count of the amount of loot I'm smashed to pieces. <em>The characters are all pretty stupid looking too…</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19502734681740998093gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19502734681740998093gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - R.E.P.O on Linux</em></p>
<p>You have a little beam you shoot out to interact with everything from doors to valuable loot. Using this you'll fill up a special cart you'll be pushing around, to eventually push it into an extraction point to complete the level and earn some monies. A job that's easier said than done, as there's a lot of strange stuff going on that will make you jump, run for your life and maybe even let out a little squeal.</p>
<p>I'll admit seeing a bunch of little gnomes for the first time was creepy as hell, and when I realised they were moving and then they all suddenly turned to me and chased me — I did let out a little "aah!".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4716260421740999645gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4716260421740999645gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - R.E.P.O on Linux</em></p>
<p>The vibe in this one is great, I actually like it a lot and look forward to pulling in some friends to play this with. Check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0jke-4sBcMw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92e1655eeb0f674299d896b60b299758.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0jke-4sBcMw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam release (February 26th) in Early Access just rocketed up to 54,854 concurrent players in the last 24 hours, making it one of the most popular games on Steam. However, they were a bit <em>unprepared</em> for this and have forced the online play to be friends-only due to "hackers" jumping into games. So now they're also working on a matchmaking system and a server browser, which hopefully won't take too long. So for now, you have to have Steam friends to play it online.</p>

      <title>No support for Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows on Steam Deck at launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One from earlier in February I missed was a Q&amp;A post from Ubisoft about Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's bad news for players hoping to run it on Steam Deck. It releases soon on March 20th.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Q&amp;A</a> post a question was posed from someone in the Ubisoft Creator Program of "Will the game be Steam Deck certified at launch?", to which Pierre F, Technology Director on Assassin's Creed Shadows, replied: "At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC".</p>
<p>Not exactly surprising though. An increasing amount of brand-new AAA games are just beyond the capability of the Steam Deck. However, their wording of "at launch" leaves me at least a little hopeful they might have some further optimisations they can do. Who knows, maybe Valve can get some updates into Proton to make it run better too, like we've seen numerous times in the past.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Xs2w3qSEBCs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8940cc5cc7829ead0ca3510584129c23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Xs2w3qSEBCs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At least if you're on Desktop Linux or a more powerful handheld, you likely won't have too much trouble. Unless the Ubisoft Connect launcher ends up being a nuisance.</p>

      <title>EchoPatch mod is a great way to modernise the classic shooter FEAR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the news recently about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/wb-close-f-e-a-r-and-shadow-of-mordor-dev-monolith-productions-and-other-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Monolith Productions closing</a>, perhaps you might be wanting to jump back into the classic shooter FEAR (stylised as F.E.A.R.). Here's a mod to make the experience better. At least perhaps until we know any improvements GOG will make with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/gog-adding-f-e-a-r-to-their-preservation-program-with-monolith-games-on-sale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their plan to put FEAR into their Preservation Program</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Wemino/EchoPatch" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EchoPatch</a> was released recently bringing with it a bunch of enhancements like HUD Scaling, a Framerate Limiter, an FPS Drop Fix, the option to Disable Letterboxing, Auto Resolution detection, an option to Skip Splash-screens, an Infinite Flashlight and more.</p>
<p>I've tested it and thanks to the improvements for modding in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-experimental-adds-initial-speech-synthesis-support-lots-of-game-fixes-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Proton Experimental update</a>, the mod will run out of the box if you set it to use that on Steam. Or, if you're running it outside of Steam (like GOG with the Heroic Games Launcher), the latest GE-Proton will also work.<em> I couldn't get it to work with Proton 9 even with setting WINEDLLOVERRIDES.</em></p>

      <title>Sonic Unleashed gets a full fan-made PC port with Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Unleashed from the Xbox 360 has made its way onto PC, although not by SEGA. This is a fan-made port created through the process of static recompilation.</p>
<p>The developer notes it offers Linux and Windows support with "numerous built-in enhancements such as high resolutions, ultrawide support, high frame rates, improved performance and modding". However, it does not include the game assets, you need to provide them yourself by owning a copy of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5563991291740993453gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5563991291740993453gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17451592251740993455gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17451592251740993455gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Sonic Unleashed on Linux</em></p>
<p>Nice to see there's even a dedicated Steam Deck / Linux section in the readme, which notes there's a Flatpak version available so it can be easily installed. For Steam Deck you'll need to be in Desktop Mode to install it.</p>
<p>For modding it includes a loader that supports the Hedge Mod Manager, a mod manager for Hedgehog Engine games on PC. Interestingly, there's a new version of Hedge Mod Manager in progress (Hedge Mod Manager 8 Beta) that has a Linux version too!</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>GOverlay app to help you configure the MangoHud overlay v1.3 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOverlay can help you set up the performance display MangoHud with buttons and checkboxes, instead of needing to edit a config file. A new v1.3 was released making it portable. Now it should run on most Linux distributions out of the box with an AppImage, along with some further enhancements to the app itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5133188721740990948gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5133188721740990948gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - A customized MangoHud with GOverlay</em></p>
<p>From the developer in the <a href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/releases/tag/1.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "Since the early days of GOverlay, packaging for different distributions has always been a challenge. While some distros worked flawlessly, others required extra effort. A portable format seemed like the ideal solution, but creating something that "just worked" felt like an impossible task for me. That's when our incredible community stepped in and gave me the boost I needed. In just a matter of days, AppImage specialists from PkgForge not only created a fully functional AppImage for GOverlay but also set up an automated process for nightly builds. This is a game-changer for accessibility and usability across all Linux distributions!"</p>
<p>What's new in the release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Portable AppImage Support</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GOverlay now comes as a portable AppImage, making it compatible with virtually any Linux distribution, including those using musl libc.</li>
<li>Nightly builds are now automated, ensuring you always have access to the latest features and fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Kaizen: A Factory Story announced from former Zachtronics developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coincidence, which includes a bunch of former Zachtronics developers, have announced the open-ended puzzle automation game Kaizen: A Factory Story.</p>
<p>Zachtronics are pretty legendary in the programming-puzzler space, although not a huge name, their games are much loved by their fans. It was a shame when they announced their closure back in <a href="https://kotaku.com/zachtronics-farewell-goodbye-closing-eliza-last-call-bb-1849096767" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2022</a>, but now they're sort-of back under a new name and with a new game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about Kaizen: A Factory Story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of Opus Magnum, SpaceChem, and Infinifactory comes Kaizen: A Factory Story — another masterfully engineered game.</p>
<p>Weld, rivet, cut, and drill the optimal design and share your solutions to build the simplest, fastest, and sleekest items in your factory. Export animated GIFs to show them off.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the weekend Steam managed to break yet another concurrent online user record, smashing the previous that was set back in December 2024.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, just after 2PM UTC today Steam hit <strong>40,270,997</strong> online with <strong>12,727,475</strong> actually in-game playing something.

<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ul>
<p>The release of Monster Hunter Wilds has certainly helped with the numbers here, as it's been a huge release for Capcom. It's seen a 24 hour peak player count of 1,373,805 online at the same time.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.16 released with improved Steam Deck / Linux game compatibility </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher continues to evolve into an even more impressive cross-platform game launcher for GOG, Epic Games, Amazon Prime and more with v2.16 bringing some great enhancements.</p>
<p>For people using it on Linux / Steam Deck there's some nice compatibility improvements to see from it. For starters, the UMU project is now the default, which is a unified way to run Windows games with Proton outside of Steam, including various automatic fixes being applied for you. This also switches the compatibility layer to GE-Proton, from the now unmaintained Wine-GE.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12125036671740937041gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's a ridiculous amount of other changes, making it what they said is "one of our biggest releases yet".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Env Variables in Known Fixes: Customize game fixes with environment variables for better compatibility.</li>
<li>Launch Arguments via URLs: Pass game arguments directly through protocol URLs for streamlined launching.</li>
<li>Steam Shortcuts for Uninstalled Games: Add Steam shortcuts for games you haven’t installed yet.</li>
<li>Anti-Cheat Logging: Anti-cheat details now appear in logs for easier troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Gamescope "Force Grab Cursor" Toggle: Prevent cursor escapes in full-screen games.</li>
<li>GOG game setup improvements.</li>
<li>DXVK-NVAPI Enabled by default for NVIDIA GPU users on Linux.</li>
<li>+ various UI improvements and other smaller updates.</li>

      <title>Steam sees a big rise in Simplified Chinese for February 2025 bringing Linux down below 2%</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey numbers for February 2025, and there's a pretty massive increase in Simplified Chinese as language which has pushed about all the numbers everywhere else.</p>
<p>As a result of this there's also been a big increase in Windows 10 (+10.47%), which as we've seen repeatedly in the past ends up bringing down the overall Linux numbers. The +20.88% for Simplified Chinese in a single month is pretty striking though (although not the biggest swing we've seen) so I've asked Valve if this is correct.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Taking the numbers as they are right now gives us overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 97.58% +1.03%</li>
<li>Linux 1.45% -0.61%</li>
<li>macOS 0.97% -0.43%</li>
</ul>

<em>See the interactive version on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a>.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">On the Linux side Valve list these as the most-used distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 34.67% -0.26%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.70% +0.29%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.16% +0.15%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 4.53% +4.53%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.21% +0.08%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS 64 bit 3.56% -1.28%</li>

      <title>A Review and Dev Interview: Broadside Renegades</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This ain't your dad's Vampire Survivors. We take a look at a hidden gem and talk to the developer about the development process.</p>
<p>​The diligent reader will know that GamingOnLinux is no stranger to the Vampire-Survivors-like genre. Liam has been captivated by<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/brotato-abyssal-terrors-is-going-to-ruin-my-free-time-especially-with-co-op/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> several</a><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/void-scrappers-is-my-new-favourite-coffee-break-game-m-try-the-free-prologue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> titles</a>, and the author of this article once made an (unsuccessful) attempt to<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> name the genre</a>. In brief, this group of games attempt to combine run-based roguelike upgrades with hordes of encroaching enemies that get steadily more difficult to survive. The genre has matured considerably over the past five years, so much so that it is rare that one breaks through enough to re-capture that original spark.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14977431201740913597gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14977431201740913597gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Enter Broadside Renegades, a new horde survival game hybrid by indie developer Joseph Renzi. I had the fortune to get an interview from Joseph about his game, which you will find below the review section.</p>
<h4><strong>The Review: Broadside Renegades</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Gameplay</strong></h5>
<p>In Broadside Renegades you play as a pirate out to loot the galaxy. You kill enemies and collect coins to level up and choose between a selection of randomized weapon upgrades and passive abilities. You unlock passive meta-upgrades between runs like more HP, faster speed, and so on. There's a danger meter that ramps up the longer you play, which means more and scarier enemies. You are virtually guaranteed to die, but hopefully not before you turn your ship from a plinking little tugboat into a rocket-propelled Death Star that spews missiles, lasers, drones, cannons, mines, sentient plasma, and all manner of horrifying space ordnance. This is done alongside great pixel art and an absolutely slapping original score. So far so good- these are all elements of a good Horde Survival game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8598593241740913616gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8598593241740913616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, there are also features that distinguish Broadside Renegades from its horde survival competitors. First, the combat is much more active than your typical horde game. Most player ships have a primary active ability that you need to aim to use. You manually control your ship's speed, which changes how quickly you can turn. The dogfighting is much more skill-based and feels more like<a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Starsector</a> or<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Space Pirates and Zombies</a> than your usual horde survivor.</p>
<p>"Bah," I see you typing in the comments, "there are plenty of games that combine more active combat with horde survival." I beg your patience, reader. Broadside Renegades has a number of other features that bring it to the cutting edge of the genre.</p>
<h5><strong>Spaceships That Switch Up Your Style</strong></h5>
<p>The first ship is a slow-moving brick in which you manoeuvre your sides to the enemy to hit them with broadside attacks. This is a fitting starter ship, as playing it feels like you're a pirate sailing captain ship bringing your broadside cannons to bear on your enemies. Personally, I couldn’t wait to get out of it and into something more agile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20407239441740913663gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20407239441740913663gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The ships you will unlock, though, play completely differently. My current favourite, the rail gun ship, is extremely fast in a line but slow to corner, and has to stop and transform to fire a huge spike through enemies. This, combined with a shield ability, favours long-range hit and run attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20404633841740913690gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20404633841740913690gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Next is a high-agility ship that dodgerolls and can flip 180 degrees. The gameplay here is space dogfighting, getting behind enemy ships and pulling off crazy dodgeroll stunts through blobs of enemies. Close-range weapons are your friend here. There's a literal space tank where you manually rotate the turret independently of the ship’s orientation. This favors a kiting playstyle with midrage damage. There’s a fighter that shoots waves of torpedoes. The most recent ship I unlocked has a giant steel beam across its prow for hurtling yourself into smaller fighter craft, which sends them careening off into space very satisfactorily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10656437481740913719gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10656437481740913719gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<h5><strong>New and New-ish Mechanics</strong></h5>
<p>Perhaps my favourite mechanic that is entirely new to the genre (as far as we are aware) are "scavenger" ships. These ships putter about the arena with no weapons, scooping up any XP coins they find before making their way to a jump gate to escape. If you find and kill one, all the XP they looted is yours for the taking. This is by far my favourite solution to the problem this genre has with XP being scattered all across the map. The genre solution is to add some kind magnet pickup which collects all the XP strewn across the map. Having these scavengers is a great solution to this problem because it turns the magnet-pickup into a much more active gameplay mechanic. Each scavenger ship is like a miniature flying magnet pickup, and if you don't find them in time they might escape with your hard-earned XP.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11505891991740913745gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11505891991740913745gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There are other great additions as well. There are two basic resources for you to loot: fuel and gold (XP). Fuel allows you to escape and move to the next level, while XP makes you more powerful. This means there is a strategic trade-off between staying in a level longer to power up, or focusing on fuel so you can progress to the next stage while minimally increasing the danger meter.</p>
<p>There are also bosses that appear which you can fight or flee from (although they will chase you to the next stage and demean you if you decide to run). There are different factions of enemies that have distinct ships and combat styles. There are different kinds of stages with different dangers and visual appeal. There is full mouse-only mode support. There is controller support. Did I mention the soundtrack is fantastic?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11000135621740913768gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11000135621740913768gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After about 10 hours in the game we reached out to Joseph Renzi for an interview on his game and the development process. There has been some light editing for clarity and conciseness.</p>
<h3><strong>Developer Interview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>GOL: First off, tell us something about yourself and how you got into video game development.</strong></p>
<p>JR: I have always loved world building and making little pen and paper games for my friends, or my little brother. I originally intended to get into concept art as I love worldbuilding, but around 2021 I came down with an autoimmune disease pretty bad (Ulcerative Colitis). More or less, being stuck inside for a solid year made me eventually just dive in solo. I was always waiting for coder friends to be open to work on a project, but it's hard to convince people making good money at their day job to commit to a game project. Luckily I ended up liking the coding part too!</p>
<p><strong>GOL: Give us your one-sentence pitch for Broadside Renegades</strong></p>
<p>JR: Broadside Renegades combines the auto-firing weapons of bullet heaven games with skill based active abilities to get you into space battles as fast as possible!</p>
<p><strong>GOL: How did you develop the game? Is this your first solo game? How was the experience of developing?</strong></p>
<p>JR: It's my first solo game (and game in general). It was a learning experience all around, from art to coding to design (I still don't know how to social media). I developed it mostly on nights and weekends over the course of about 18 months. Before that I worked on eight ideas that I felt I could finish at some point, and luckily many of those ideas gave me tools (and sometimes even code) I could port over to Broadside Renegades. There was a lot of burnout, but it was worth it to get something out there into the world.</p>
<p><strong>GOL: The game works perfectly well via Proton. Was Linux or Steam Deck compatibility something that was on your radar during development? </strong></p>
<p>JR: I had a lot of people around me raving about Steam Decks when I was developing, so I considered Steam Deck compatibility pretty important. I believe roughly a third of my players use a Steam Deck to play. I am impressed that Gamemaker didn't really require me to do anything for Linux in particular; the version you're running is actually the out-of-the-box Windows build. I was lucky enough that two of my testers both preferred Steam Deck, so I knew at launch it at least didn't have critical failures!</p>
<p><strong>GOL: What feature of the game are you most proud of, or turned out better than expected? What feature did you find surprisingly difficult to implement?</strong></p>
<p>JR: For better-than-expected it's actually the post-launch mouse steering system. I severely underestimated how much demand there was for mouse controls, assuming WASD or controller was sufficient given the arcade style of the game. Now it's primarily how I play if I'm not testing a feature with the other control sets. The boat-like steering feels much more intuitive with a mouse cursor.</p>
<p>Menus across the board are significantly more difficult for me than I'd like to admit, but I've learned a lot in the process. Menus (and polishing menus) took much more time than I had budgeted.</p>
<p><strong>GOL: BR has a chaotic mix of genres. What were the big inspirations behind BR? What are some of your favourite games to play?</strong></p>
<p>JR: Vampire Survivors is the most obvious. Originally the main concept was just that but with angles (hence the ship controls and broadsides). The game getting harder with time probably came from how many hundreds of hours I've put into Risk of Rain 1, its sequel, and Risk of Rain Returns. The original concept was actually very inspired by Star Sector, which is much less apparent in the final game. Not necessarily for BR specifically, but games from the Trese Brothers really inspired me creatively in general to get into development. Templar Battleforce in my mind stands next to bigger projects like XCOM (which I also love), despite being from a much smaller development team. I hope eventually I can bite off a bigger project like that myself. <em>(Interviewer note: Trese Brothers are also the author's favourite indie development team, and always support Linux with native builds. Check out their</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/TreseBrothers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><em> gameography on steam</em></a><em> and their newest project: a turn-based tactical cyberpunk simulation,</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><em> Cyber Knights</em></a><em>).</em></p>
<p><strong>GOL: BR has an amazing soundtrack that really complements the gameplay. How did you find your musical artist and what was it like working with them?</strong></p>
<p>JR: He usually goes by Joseph Lee/Dramamine. I showed my original trailer with my "developer music" to my friends, and my composer pretty much demanded that I fix it. It was a first game project for both of us and I am pretty blown away with every track. It helped a lot that he was enthusiastic about the closed demo builds, so he sort of came to get the feel for the battle tracks just from playing the game himself. It's also a good lesson that we can't do everything ourselves. I cannot emphasize how bad my own music was.</p>
<p><strong>GOL: Any final thoughts on the development process? </strong></p>
<p>JR: Mainly that I encourage anybody even a little bit curious about game development to just jump in. Work-life balance is essential though. My biggest lesson learned was how easy it was to burn myself out trying to do everything solo with a day job. Set realistic time frames, especially if you don't have a publisher/deadline. Finishing a project is as important for learning as they say it is.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>So, what are the negatives? The most significant factor for your enjoyment will be whether you enjoy the combat system, which is significantly more active than your usual horde survival game, but not as complex as larger games like Starsector. I find that BR strikes a good balance between the two, but that’s subjective. Less subjective are a few persistent bugs, notably with audio, that might impact your enjoyment. In particular, some of the audio mixing is still a bit wonky, with some effects sounding too loud or quiet relative to others. There is also a bug where the rail gun sound effect plays twice for a single shot in some instances. Mouse support was added recently to the game, and there is one clickable menu button that could not be clicked. The developer is responsive, though, so I expect these bugs to be ironed out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5365182421740913796gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5365182421740913796gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So, for those who skipped everything above, the short version is that Broadside Renegades is an instant pickup for fans of space fighters and horde survival fans. I haven’t talked much about the negatives, but there are some. Some of the brighter level backgrounds make the HUD difficult to see. The sound mixing is inconsistent and still being patched. The railgun sound effect sometimes plays twice instead of once. That said, the developer is very active on steam and pushing out updates. The game is also affordably priced at around the Vampire Survivors price point.</p>
<p>There's one final thing to mention. The game is <em>criminally</em> underappreciated, with six reviews at the time of writing (all positive). This is a chance to pick up a great game that you can mention at fancy dinner parties when the topic of undiscovered gems comes up. It's sure to impress.</p>

      <title>March 25 reminder - GamingOnLinux needs your support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome to March 2025 readers! Here's a gentle reminder that GamingOnLinux is primarily funded by readers - that's you! And we need your support. GamingOnLinux is entering its 16th year, and I hope to continue it on for a long time.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone reading, commenting, sending in tips and leaving comments!</p>
<p><em>Want to help support GamingOnLinux? See below!</em></p>
<p>Firstly, the <em>best</em> way is regular support via<a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Patreon</a>. For Patreon, a <em>suggestion</em> is to pledge around the <em>start</em> of a month, as it charges at the beginning of <em>every</em> month (although that is changing at the end of this year to the date <em>you</em> started each month). Generally the Patreon is just to have <em>regular</em> funding to keep bringing you the news.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">All other donations, without any special rewards can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=P85ZZX9W8HFMW" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paypal Donations</a> or Monthly donation/sub suggested levels: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-6MU983833N166101WL3ZRB5I" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supporter</a> - <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-54T30471MU837021GL3ZRCMY" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supporter Plus</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">You can also bookmark and buy games using our affiliate/partner links (and they really do help!):</p>

</ul>
<p>You can find all the links to support us on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated page</a> any time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since the last time I posted, Humble Bundle <em>completely</em> changed their partnership system from a dedicated one they ran directly to a third-party called Impact. It's been far less generous and helpful, so our overall funding has reduced quite a <em>lot</em> and it has been felt. So any support you can give will be firmly appreciated.</p>
<p>Additionally, our Forum was closed in December 2024 due to the UK's new wide-reaching Online Safety Act. Not many at all actually used it as most of the community is on <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>, but it's still a shame. There's been a few other smaller changes in comments and profiles to keep us out of scope of the law to hopefully not have any issues. No changes are up for discussion on that. This does <em>not</em> affect our regular news posting at all.</p>
<p>Onto brighter news - it’s going to be another big exciting year!<br/>
