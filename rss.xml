      <title>Check out the demo for Turnbound, a clever haunted boardgame inventory battler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turnbound looks like it could be a really good one, a PvP inventory management auto-battler that does things quite differently to others in the genre. It also has a demo available you can try out right now, and the game will be coming to Early Access sometime soon.</p>
<p>Like other inventory battlers, it's all about what you stick in your bag and building up combos. However, it sets itself apart in a big way. Instead of your combined inventory battling your opponents, you battle all the individual tiles from the items in the bag. Really think the idea, setting and style of this are fantastic.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8OKXNyU13Jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f89ab1ccddbf5ba645a907f2024a9263.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8OKXNyU13Jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Of the Early Access release, Designers Tom and Donald said, “We have seen creators refer to us as ‘Indie Hearthstone Battlegrounds’ - that is a big goal and one we aspire to live up to.” “Because of all the possible combinations and builds, games like this turn out best if they are community driven. Being in Early Access gives us the opportunity to start involving players early.”</p>
<p>It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> and has Native Linux support. You can also follow the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/1tkgames.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt to fully shut down in April 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to say goodbye completely to another game, as Sharkmob AB have announced the full shutdown is coming for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt.</p>
<p>A battle royale game that originally launched back in 2022 after Early Access in 2021, it never really fully hit the mark. It lost most of the players in the space of two months after the full release, which is pretty striking when looking back on it on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/760160/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they've confirmed the servers are being closed on the 28th of April, 2026. They've also just closed up in-game purchases with the closing announcement. From the developers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Bloodhunt Community,</p>
<p>When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did. From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, Bloodhunt has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways.</p>
<p>During these past 4 years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to Bloodhunt. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p>
<p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take Bloodhunt offline.</p>
<p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the Bloodhunt servers on the 28th of April 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6910324721761569700gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It may not have been as popular as some other multiplayer games, but it really is a shame to see all the developer effort now go completely to waste. No option of player-run servers, once again just a game that is going to end up as nothing more than a memory. A kick in the nuts for game preservation and history.</p>

      <title>The huge TimeSplitters Rewind fan project launches in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TimeSplitters Rewind is a massive upcoming fan project that pretty much remakes the original trilogy of TimeSplitters games and it finally has a release date. <em>It will be completely free since they don't own the IP.</em></p>
<p>A new website for it has been launched, which has a very brief teaser trailer and going by the countdown it will launch officially on November 23rd. Here's more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
<p>TimeSplitters Rewind is a fan project that serves as a greatest hits collection of maps, modes, leagues, challenges and story content across the original trilogy of TimeSplitters games.</p>
<p>Rewind is not a traditional remake in that there aren't 3 separate executables, it is one game that, as closely as possible, captures the spirit of the 3 games in one. So, unlike a traditional HD collection or remake, it is its own title. By the end of this game's development, the goal is to have extensive content spanning the three games but our initial launch will focus on a subset of both existing content from the original games and some new content.</p>
<p>Across the past decade, nearly 200 hundred contributors have committed hours to this project, ranging from a few hours to thousands of hours of development time, some hobbyists and others AAA game developers. This is the largest amount of free content ever provided in a video game (without monetized elements) and it was not easy to make.</p>
<p>We made this game from pure passion and an interest in seeing more TimeSplitters content. Feel free to read the full project history below!</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>According to their latest info, the are setting the Steam Deck with Proton as the minimum specifications required to run the game. Nice to see, so it should run well across a variety of systems. </p>
<p>Latest teaser from the website is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wtWQ3cp5foI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/29905e1b8feb6961c1cde23fde668f0f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wtWQ3cp5foI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">At launch it will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>28 Maps.</li>
<li>Online and Offline Story Mode.</li>
<li>50 Arcade Leagues.</li>
<li>32 Challenges.</li>
<li>91 Characters.</li>
<li>41 Weapons.</li>
<li>20 Arcade Game Modes.</li>
<li>New Game Mode - Team Elimination.</li>
<li>Updated Game Mode - Last Stand.</li>
<li>Online and Offline Arcade w/Bots.</li>
<li>10 Players Online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, the original developer of the series Free Radical Design was closed by Embracer Group back in 2023. This will likely be the closest we'll get to a new game in a long time.</p>

      <title>MISERY is a new rogue-lite Stalker-like co-op survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A rogue-lite Stalker-like to play with friends designed to look like a game from retro consoles? You can sign me up for some MISERY right now. Set in a post-apocalyptic exclusion zone you have to scavenge abandoned locations, survive deadly anomalies and mutants, and try to survive another day in solo or with friends (5 players total).</p>
<p>While not based on Stalker directly, the inspiration is pretty darn clear. In fact, there was already a Stalker mod called Misery but they don't actually seem to be directly related.</p>
<p>How it works: you wake up in the basement of some sort of fallout bunker, and as you try to leave for the first time a siren goes off because a nuclear bomb is coming. The next 60 seconds become a mad-dash to collect a bunch of items to help you survive the rest of the game. Once ready and you extract before the 60 seconds are up, the real survival then begins as you enter into a rather spooky looking procedurally generated world full of anomalies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18358689321761567939gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18358689321761567939gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This loop is quite interesting, although much like classic Stalker it's pretty brutal on the difficulty. The rogue-lite loop here does seem quite clever though, as you repeatedly go scavenging to craft new and improved items or go speak to some traders and then back you go for some more exploration. And as time goes on, you build up your shelter into something more useful too.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see a whole lot more from this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BLMcHh2-cDQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b6256220d3d9f073b7889a1cf5bb542a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BLMcHh2-cDQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable. In my testing, it worked just fine on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>The useful AI warning for Steam script has been turned into a proper browser extension</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/want-to-avoid-ai-gen-on-steam-this-browser-userscript-might-save-your-day/page=2/#comments" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux highlighted a useful browser script</a> to give you a better warning for games on Steam using AI, and now it's even easier to use.</p>
<p>To save you clicking around: instead of the generative AI message being buried at the bottom of a Steam page, it gives you a big warning box to ensure you cannot miss it. It doesn't stop you doing anything, just ensures you're properly aware. Much better. And now, it has been turned into a full browser extension for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ai-warning-for-steam/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-warning-for-steam/clegcobheppnnigaaeelfkeomjcngmnh?pli=1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Chrome</a> so you don't need to mess with userscripts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1364128541761565950gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - an example of it in action, using the Firefox plugin.</em></p>
<p>I really do love this. It has been saving me a lot of time recently on skipping over games that use generative AI. Something I try my best not to cover, since there's absolutely tons of games releasing all the time without it.</p>
<p>Full source code is still up on the <a href="https://github.com/seeeeew/aiwarningforsteam?tab=readme-ov-file" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>You can grab 911 Operator for free to keep on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A free game to start your week? Wonderful. 911 Operator from Jutsu Games is currently free to claim and keep on Steam. Always nice to be able to build up your Steam account.</p>
<p>Why is it being given away free? It's part of the Games Operators publisher sale, so it's a good way for them to get more eyes on everything, and if you like 911 Operator they have a few DLC you can grab as extras too. Jutsu Games also recently launched a major update for their latest game Infection Free Zone.</p>
<p>More about it: "In 911 OPERATOR, you take on the role of an emergency dispatcher, who has to rapidly deal with the incoming reports. Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity. Keep in mind, that the person on the other side of the line might turn out to be a dying daughter’s father, an unpredictable terrorist, or just a prankster. Can you handle all of this?"</p>

<p>It's free until October 29th. It's rated Platinum on ProtonDB.</p>

      <title>GOG asking for more donations from gamers with the new GOG Patrons program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it hasn't been properly publicly announced yet, GOG Patrons is a new system launched by GOG to hopefully pull in more people to donate. This isn't the first time GOG have asked for people to donate, as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/gog-now-ask-for-donations-when-you-buy-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in June</a> they added a donation form to the checkout page but this goes one step further.</p>
<p>The main point of the GOG Patrons program appears to be directly supporting their game preservations efforts as part of the official GOG Preservation Program. Not to paywall anything on the GOG store, just as an additional way to support GOG directly.</p>
<p>It seems a lot like a built-in form of Patreon, and anyone who has used Patreon (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">like ours</a>) will be familiar with the idea. You pay a small amount each month to something / someone you like, and potentially get rewards for your support. In the case of GOG they say you get access to an exclusive Discord, voting on Preservation Program priorities, credit for your support on game store pages and behind the scenes content.</p>
<p>GOG have so far only sent an email out to some customers to let them know about it, as it's currently in "Early Access" according to GOG staff. As <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/gog_patrons_thoughts/post5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on the GOG forum from staffer "king_kunat":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey hey, everyone! :D Just wanted to quickly jump in and shed a bit of light on the topic:<br/>
<br/>
We’ve indeed launched the GOG Patrons program today in its early access phase. Long story short, it’s a new way for players who care about game preservation to directly support our ongoing work. And as we’ve mentioned (and will keep repeating everywhere): it’s not a game subscription or a paywall and everything you’ve ever bought on GOG remains fully yours, forever.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is simple: Patrons help fund our efforts to keep classic games alive by restoring, maintaining, and improving them. In return, they get access to an exclusive Discord community, behind-the-scenes content, and small recognition perks across GOG, just as Shanuca mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
The initial response has been positive, and we’re already learning a lot from the feedback we’ve received. This early phase helps us fine-tune the program before it opens more broadly, ensuring it truly meets our community’s expectations and reflects GOG’s values. We'll update you more and more as we go and make the program public.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this clears things up a bit!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't give any guarantees that your support will actually lead to anything, as that would be impossible to do, it all depends on what rights holders they can convince or track down to actually let GOG revive their games.</p>

      <title>Halo: Campaign Evolved announced for release in 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft / Xbox Games Studios revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will be releasing sometime in 2026 and it will have a Steam release too. As long as there's no major annoyances from Microsoft here, it should hopefully run well enough on Linux based systems using Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>Coming from Halo Studios, the original is being remade in Unreal Engine 5. It will be coming with "stunning new 4K visuals, updated animations, remastered music, and re-recorded voice lines". Plus we're getting treated to weapons and vehicles from later games in the series, and three new bonus prequel campaign missions. We also get up to 4 player online co-op with cross-play, but split-screen is once again console-only.</p>
<p>See the main trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efThjRym-ks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0a0ae828c5dbcaf12d015bab34b7636f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efThjRym-ks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And additionally 13 minutes more gameplay:</p>

<p>So how many times has this Halo been released now? We had the original on Xbox, then Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo PC, Halo: The Master Chief Collection and now Halo: Campaign Evolved. Did I miss any?</p>

      <title>Cronos: The New Dawn now has a demo available on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you were interested in Cronos: The New Dawn but weren't sold on picking it up yet, you can now try the demo that's recently released. The demo actually released earlier this week, but Steam only just today sent me a notification to say it's available. Bit of a delay there.</p>
<p>More about it: Cronos: The New Dawn is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.</p>
<p>Unlike the full version, there's only a Windows build of the Cronos: The New Dawn demo. It doesn't have a Native Linux version for it, but it <em>does</em> have one for the full game which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/bloober-team-announce-a-native-steam-deck-release-for-cronos-the-new-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released to improved it on the Steam Deck</a>. The developer, <br/>
Bloober Team, never did reply to GamingOnLinux when we asked what improvements they actually put in for the Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="muJlwDnk9Dk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee96a02b969ea2f489283b255c1c7ad5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/muJlwDnk9Dk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see demos make such a big comeback over the last few years, which we partly have Valve to thank for all the Steam Next Fest events that really bring attention to trying out games before buying them. Hopefully we'll see this continue, especially with the absolute onslaught of games being recently constantly — developers need more ways to hook players in and a demo is a good way.</p>
<p>The demo for Cronos: The New Dawn gives you the first ~30-40 minutes of the game and saves transfer to the full package.</p>

      <title>From former Telltale Games veterans, Dispatch is out and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While only two episodes are currently live with the rest to follow soon, Dispatch from former Telltale Games veterans has arrived. All of the episodes are due to be out by November 12th which is an interesting way to do a release, to build up hype as more people discover it and play through it and talk about it. You're <em>supposed</em> to think of it more like a TV series in that way.</p>
<p>It's a star-stacked game too with voices from the likes of Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad), Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part II), Erin Yvette (The Wolf Among Us), Jeffrey Wright (Westworld), Travis Willingham (The Legend of Vox Machina), Alanah Pearce (Cyberpunk 2077), Matthew Mercer (Critical Role), MoistCr1TiKaL, Jacksepticeye, Lance Cantstopolis, Joel Haver, and THOT SQUAD, a wild mix of actors, comedians, and creators from across games and entertainment.</p>
<p>Don't go into this expecting a traditional Telltale-like experience though, it's <em>very</em> different.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fTVgX7b1N8E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/444c3351e23583fb51435577a1cd32cb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"We built Dispatch to be something people can play, watch, and talk about together," said Nick Herman, Creative Director and co-founder at AdHoc Studio. "Some of our favorite gaming moments come from comparing choices with friends, and we hope this series sparks those same kinds of conversations."</p>
<p>Since it's based on episodes, and most aren't out yet, you can't properly review something like this just yet. So keep that in mind. But here's a few thoughts anyway…</p>
<p>Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified and it works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9. I've played through on Kubuntu 25.10 and haven't encountered a single problem. I'm genuinely <em>extremely</em> happy that thanks to all the work Valve puts into Proton, that we can experience episodic stuff like this from the day of release. Makes me think back to a good few years ago when this would have been near impossible without fiddling with Wine directly which often got messy.</p>
<p>I know some people probably have superhero fatigue, but not me. I'll soak up anything I can related to it. And what great timing, with Gen V Season 2 just finishing and now I get to play Dispatch. It's interesting for another two reasons: the first because you didn't have any powers to begin with. You were originally a hero in Dispatch but more like a Temu version of Iron Man in a mecha before it gets ruined whereas now you're one of the suits managing everyone which makes it quite a different experience; and also that you're not dealing directly with standard hero types, you're actually managing a team of misfits basically, a bunch of ex-supervillains going through rehabilitation to try and improve.</p>
<p>I especially liked the amount of options it has for accessibility. Subtitles with sizing and background and the option to add character names to each subtitle, the choice to have quick time events be cinematic (so events just happen) or be interactive, some effects can be disabled, nudity can be removed, there's colour blind modes and more.</p>

<p>What you get is a mixture of two rather different games. An interactive movie-like experience, blended with a choice-based management sim. In between all the animations, you'll be doing the actual work as a dispatching agent, choosing what heroes to send to each situation. Each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses, and you have to match them up to each problem as best you can. It also sprinkles in little mini-events, where you make more choices on how to handle each situation. I failed a few bits here and there, but it is easy enough to understand and thanks to all the chatter from the heroes, it keeps it really engaging. Still, it's quite odd to jump from full animations into a top-down management sim.</p>
<p>Showing off how your decisions stacked up against other players at the end of an episode was a nice touch too.</p>
<p>Going by what I've played so far, it's quite brilliant. Very much enjoying the writing, some quality moments in there really helped the the top-notch voice over making it thoroughly interesting to play. The animation is great too, reminds me a little of Invincible but perhaps actually even a little better. I could have happily just sat back and watched this, but the interactive elements help you feel like a part of it.</p>
<p>Seems like it will be relatively short overall though, with the first episode by itself only taking about an hour.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">We'll see the next episodes land:</p>
<ul>
<li>October 29th - Episodes 3 and 4</li>
<li>November 5th - Episodes 5 and 6</li>
<li>November 12th - Episodes 7 and 8</li>

      <title>Spin to fight and win in Roulette Hero, a rather unique strategic roguelike deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Combining elements of Slay the Spire and Luck be a Landlord, the roguelike deck-builder Roulette Hero is out now and it will likely spin your hours away. <em>Note: a key was sent to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Here you pick a character and face off against various different types of enemies in turn-based battles. However, it's often based on a fair amount of luck and just a little skill. The board is basically a fancy roulette wheel covered in various animals and coins, with each animal having a different effect on the enemy. As you pull the lever, the cost to do so will increase until you need to end your turn where the enemy will attack and reset the cost to pull the lever. It's a proper cleverly designed game, one that really does hook you in like a cat with sharp claws.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6670144661761311020gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6670144661761311020gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Each time you end the turn not only does the enemy attack, but the board evolves too with new animals added to it. As at the start of a run, most of the board is covered in rocks. The deck-building comes in here, as you have a shop to spend some of your coins to upgrade or swap the animals around. When you defeat an enemy, the game progresses onto the next but the board stays with you for you to keep upgrading.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you win a battle, you'll also get to pick a cartridge that acts as a special upgrade for your character and run by giving you various buffs. You get things like a boost to max HP, gaining shields when you get coins, a chance to get an additional spin and all sorts.</p>
<p>The enemies do get steadily more difficult to overcome the longer you go through a run, which is where a bit of skill from the player really comes in. It's about making the most of every spin across every turn, to not blow through all of your coins too quickly. Making use of upgrading animals from the shop, and the fun over-powered combos that can happen. The first spin on a turn is always free though, so even if you run out of coins, it's not instantly the end.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CnTq9nkvj6g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47e8e6473e966d46ce2f665724dd0c49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CnTq9nkvj6g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And in true deck-builder style, as you plan and win or lose you'll unlock more content to add into future runs.</p>
<p>The game works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9. No issues encountered at all. It might even be a new favourite of mine and so I think it's well worth picking up if you like the sound of it. A true genuine delight of a game, an expected gem.</p>
<p>For £8.50 you can't go wrong with it.</p>

      <title>Stress testing and benchmarking tool OCCT gets an essential Linux fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OCCT is a popular tool for stress-testing and benchmarking your system that recently had a Linux release, and now as of the latest update it should work better.</p>
<p>The developers recently released a major new version of the tool (v15) which came with big new features like storage stability testing for HDDs and SSDs, improved Linux support, a UI skins system and many other improvements. It came with a problem for some Linux users though, where it stopped working. With the update OCCT 15.0.4 noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This important update fixes a very tough issue where OCCT, when launched from Steam under Linux, would refuse to start. The compatibility layer of Steam was at fault.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the reports and patience ! We're sorry it took us a few days to fix, it was not an easy one.<br/>
<br/>
Changelog :</p>
<ul>
<li>Main : Fixed : OCCT would refuse to start on Steam+Linux due to a failure in enumerating storage devices.</li>
<li>Ui : Fixed : The waiting dialog had an ugly border around the background</li>
<li>Benchmark : Fixed : Upload would never stop when doing it without a license</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it back in July, they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/stress-testing-app-occt-switches-to-vulkan-by-default-dropping-directx/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">switched over to Vulkan</a> by default too.</p>

      <title>Roman city-builder Nova Roma from the devs of Kingdoms &amp; Castles arrives in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Lion Shield who created the rather great Kingdoms &amp; Castles, their next game Nova Roma has been confirmed for Early Access release on January 22, 2026. It's actually a spiritual successor to Kingdoms &amp; Castles with some similar systems at play.</p>
<p>More about it: As the once-great Roman Empire falls into decadence and decay, players will lead a small band of citizens in search of new lands, hoping to build Nova Roma (New Rome) – a bastion for all that was once good in the Empire. Starting from a humble village, appease the gods with grand temples, sate the citizens' many needs, and build a society that will be the envy of the world for millennia to come.</p>
<p>You'll be dealing with dynamic weather, water manipulation, divine intervention, and the ever-looming threat of barbarians and vengeful Emperors in this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P0Is5zmKugs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70e01b993611d77fb4d660935c01e0ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P0Is5zmKugs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nova Roma will be localized from English into German, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.</p>

      <title>Award-winning gothic horror narrative adventure Scarlet Hollow gets a release date for Episode 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just in time for Valentine's Day next year, Scarlet Hollow will expand with the fifth episode the day before on Friday the 13th but the story isn't over yet. There's still another two episodes to go for it to leave Early Access but they work well as standalone episodes.</p>
<p>Scarlet Hollow has Native Linux support, it's Steam Deck Verified and it has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. It genuinely is one of the nest visual novel styled narrative horror adventures ever. There's a demo available which is the first episode for you to try.</p>
<p>More about it: Enter the fifth episode after last chapter's harrowing end, and cling to sanity throughout the onslaught of unpredictable scenarios rooted in the choices made in previous episodes. Experience more than 870,000 words of branching storytelling from award-winning writer and developer Tony Howard-Arias and compelling new illustrations from award-winning artist Abby Howard, the married duo behind 2023’s critically acclaimed bestseller Slay the Princess.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LwZ9wlVV42U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b93a63ac8e6635e7b5b6031231f9a41.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LwZ9wlVV42U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“This is far from the end, but that doesn’t mean Scarlet Hollow is ‘unfinished’ necessarily,” says Tony Howard-Arias, co-founder of Black Tabby Games. “Each chapter has its own self-contained story, even as each of them slot into a bigger overarching narrative. For us, Scarlet Hollow has always felt like a seven-game series where you get to carry your choices forward into each new installment. And if you don’t believe me, Episode 1 is free. You can always see where it takes you.”</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A heavily branching narrative where your decisions (actually) matter</strong>. The relationships you forge and the decisions you make will dramatically alter your journey.</li>
<li><strong>A complex paranormal mystery</strong>. Investigate haunted houses, strange sightings in the woods, a deteriorating mine, and more as you try and piece together what happened in Scarlet Hollow.</li>
<li><strong>Trait-based dialogue and role-playing.</strong> Scarlet Hollow's dialogue system is driven by role-playing elements that let you choose who you want to be. Are you quiet and observant? Hot and clueless? <strong><em>Can you talk to animals</em></strong>? 21 different character builds change how you interact with the world and how your story unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>A dynamic relationship system that reacts to your every choice and changes how your story unfolds.</strong> People won't just like or dislike you. Become friendly rivals, bitter adversaries, best friends, or mild acquaintances with everyone in town based on how you approach the story.</li>
<li><strong>Original monster designs </strong>inspired by Appalachian myths and cryptids<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No jumpscares.</strong> All of the horror in Scarlet Hollow comes from dread, tension, and a sprinkle of disturbing imagery.</li>
<li><strong>A touch of romance.</strong> Whether you're into goths, dads, moms, paranormal investigators, mysterious recluses, or <strong>actual monsters</strong>, you'll find something waiting for you here. And if you'd rather avoid that entirely, your story won't be any less for it.</li>
<li><strong>Hundreds of meticulously hand-drawn and traditionally inked backgrounds.</strong> Every background in the game is hand drawn and inked by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.</li>
<li><strong>Fully immersive art.</strong> Each major character has dozens—and often hundreds—of hand-drawn sprites that interact with backgrounds and capture a full range of lighting, emotion, environment, and outfit changes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will perform better on AMD GPUs with Mesa 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 26 is due for release early next year, and it appears that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one game that's set to benefit greatly from it.</p>
<p>With any current version of Mesa paired with an AMD GPU in the game, you might see various parts of it get some pretty heavy lag and stuttering. You can see some chatter on it and a video example in a Mesa <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13901" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a>, with the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13901#note_3113558" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video example</a> showing the issue quite clearly.</p>
<p>One of Valve's developers, Samuel Pitoiset, who works on Mesa and other things mentioned they "wrote a new allocator for descriptor sets and it is way faster". The user who opened the original bug report tried the Mesa patch and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13901#note_3150859" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> how "What can I say other than wow.... the stutter is basically gone now". That code has already been <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/37976" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merged</a> in and going by a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13901#note_3156197" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">comment</a> from Pitoiset it will debut with Mesa 26 due in January 2026.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18942626221761299790gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see another performance issue on Linux with AMD GPUs being solved. This might affect other games too if they do similar things but for now Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the main one confirmed to see a boost.</p>

      <title>Grab a short free horror experience with the new release of Days Without Incident</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>First built in 2017 it never saw a release until now, Days Without Incident is a free short horror game that looks worth a go. Playable from start to finish in a single evening, you've got nothing to lose but you might need some spare pants.</p>
<p>More about it — Days Without Incident was first built in 2017, during the years when We Create Stuff were transitioning from experimental modders with the successful Nightmare House: The Original Mod for Half Life 2, to full-fledged developers. Days Without Incident never saw release (until now) but, the ideas and mechanics later inspired psychological storytelling horror, In Sound Mind which released on the 28th of September 2021. They decided to clean it up and release it as a free gift to the indie horror community.</p>

<p>Key Info:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Lost Prototype: </strong>Experience a piece of horror history, built in 2017 which has never been seen before </li>
<li><strong>Noir-Drenched Mystery: </strong>Investigate the abandoned metalworks factory that’s plagued by sickness, whispers, and silence. Piece together the hidden truth, and what’s been left to fester…</li>
<li><strong>The DNA of Indie Horror: </strong>The mechanics, atmosphere and storytelling that you experience in In Sound Mind also connects to the legacy of Nightmare House: The Original Mod, but updated with improved controls and links to lore. </li>
<li><strong>Designed to Linger: </strong>This survival horror is short, sharp and very unsettling </li>

      <title>Inspired by 1930s cartoons, MOUSE: P.I. For Hire set for launch in 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks really great, giving classic Disney vibes but in a black and white first-person shooter and now we have a confirmed release date. It was going to release this year, but it's been moved to March 19th, 2026.</p>
<p>More about it: "MOUSE: P.I. For Hire is an action-packed first-person shooter that draws inspiration from the classic cartoons of the 1930s. Its black and white rubber hose visuals are drawn by hand, frame by frame, delivering a striking vintage aesthetic. Unravel layers of corruption with a thrilling noir-fueled detective story, lively environments to explore, an original big band jazz soundtrack, and a fully-loaded arsenal of cartoon weapons and devastating power-ups."</p>
<p>We also have a brand new trailer you can view below:</p>

For Hire offers a unique mix of explosive FPS action and hand-drawn rubber hose animation. Stepping into the shoes of Private Investigator Jack Pepper - played by the inimitable Troy Baker - will be an experience that players will not forget!”</p>

      <title>Amazon Luna cloud gaming relaunched, with Prime Gaming merged in and a new AI game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon have today relaunched <a href="https://luna.amazon.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon Luna</a>, their cloud gaming service and it also merges in Prime Gaming with the monthly game giveaways too.</p>
<p><a href="http://gaming.amazon.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a> is no longer a standalone separate thing, as going to Prime Gaming is now just a page to claim games on the Amazon Luna website directly. Still the same process as before though. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you still get the standalone game keys each month to redeem across various stores. Clearly though, Amazon are trying desperately to funnel more people into the Luna service with this move.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1618403911761226160gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Along with the refresh, they've also launched GameNight. Their new set of social games where you can use your phone as your controller. This features games like Angry Birds Flock Party, Tetris Effect: Connected Party Edition, The Jackbox Party Pack 9, Ticket to Ride, Ultimate Chicken Horse and an <em>AI</em> powered game named Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>Everything needs AI now! As the Courtroom Chaos page notes: "Snoop Dogg lends his voice, looks, and personality to the generative AI bench to hear your testimony, ask questions, try the case and render the verdict". However, Amazon are clearly betting this AI game will pull people in, as it only gives you a limited amount of cases per day but you can <em>pay</em> for more. How generous of Amazon.</p>
<p>That's on top of all the regular cloud gaming with Alien: Isolation, Dave the Diver, Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout New Vegas, Fortnite, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege X and more playable in the browser (they support Chrome on Linux).</p>
<p>Luna cloud gaming is supported across U.S., UK, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

      <title>Krafton (PUBG, Subnautica, inZOI) becoming an &#34;AI-First&#34; company</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Krafton, the publisher of the likes of: PUBG, Subnautica, inZOI and Dinkum, have just put out a press release talking about a major investment into AI.</p>
<p>Currently, the news post is only in Korean and features a lot of corpo-suit speech but running it through Google translate (it may be a little rough), gives a good idea of what's going on at least.</p>
<p>Their CEO, Kim Chang-han, said they're transforming into an "AI-first" company which involves establishing "an AI First Culture". Beginning today, they're planning to roll out an "AI-centric management system centered on Agentic AI" for "automating tasks while allowing employees to focus on creative activities and complex problem-solving". Chang-han believes this will allow them to "leap forward as a company that fosters employee growth and expands the scope of organizational challenges through AI".</p>
<p>One part of the plan is to invest around "KRW 100 billion" on a GPU cluster that will "support multi-stage tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning, serving as the foundation for accelerating the implementation of Agentic AI" that will help them with "AI workflow automation, strengthen AI R&amp;D, and in-game AI services" and so on.</p>
<p>Another part of it starting in 2026 is that they're going to allocate around "KRW 30 billion annually" to support their employees to directly use AI tools with their work. This includes generally expanding the scope of how AI is used across the company to " apply AI throughout its entire management and decision-making processes".</p>
<p>The original post in Korean can be seen on their <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press post</a>.</p>
<p>Not really a surprise for Krafton given they've been bullish about AI for a while now, while using it directly in inZOI for various things and the newer AI companions for PUBG too. So prepare for a lot more AI generation in games coming from Krafton as a publisher and from developers under their wing.</p>
<p>Just as a reminder too, Krafton own the Last Epoch devs <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/last-epoch-devs-eleventh-hour-games-have-been-acquired-by-krafton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eleventh Hour Games</a> and were the ones that saved <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-lives-again-with-krafton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tango Gameworks</a>. I have to wonder how their teams now feel, along with everyone else working for Krafton as it seems they'll be required to use AI more and more from now.</p>

      <title>PAYDAY 2 is going to live again with a new team and new updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While PAYDAY 3 continues to do rather poorly, PAYDAY 2 is coming back to life to refresh it with some upgrades.</p>
<p>Not really a surprise when you look at PAYDAY 3, which currently has a Mixed overall rating on Steam and since it's a multiplayer game it only sees a peak of a few hundred players each day which has been trending in a downwards spiral recently. While PAYDAY 2 continues to see tens of thousands each day despite being over 10 years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10220112281761217005gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In an announcement on Steam posted on Tuesday, Starbreeze said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello heisters,<br/>
<br/>
<strong>We’re excited to announce that we’re partnering with Sidetrack Games to support the PC-versions of PAYDAY 2 with quality-of-life improvements and general game fixes.</strong></p>
<p>Sidetrack (formerly known as the M.U.G. Team) is a talented team with deep roots in the PAYDAY modding community. Their work on <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/414740/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">RAID: World War II</a> showed that they have the skill and perseverance to deliver quality updates over a long time. <strong>They know the PAYDAY 2 engine inside and out, and they’ve already gotten started.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first update goes live this Thursday, October 23,</strong> and is focused on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience.</p>
<p>Collaborating with Sidetrack Games allows <strong><a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/starbreeze?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Starbreeze</a> to maintain full focus on <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PAYDAY 3</a></strong>, while <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PAYDAY 2</a> continues to deliver value for all players with the dedicated, expert support they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a pretty old Native Linux port, which I'm not personally up to speed if it works well nowadays or not. So you may be better with Proton, it always was a little buggy anyway. Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible with Proton.</p>

      <title>MicroProse reveal Dungeon Holdem a mixture of poker and dungeon crawling that looks ace</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MicroProse just announced they're publishing Dungeon Holdem a fusion of poker, dungeon crawling, and deckbuilding RPG mechanics and it really looks ace.</p>
<p>Yet another game that looks distinctly like it was inspired by Balatro, but I'm certainly not complaining. The setup and gameplay of this will no doubt be sucking away many hours from me. You'll need to master the rules of poker to win, but naturally you can do all sorts of funny things to chain stuff together for some awesome combos to bend the rules. As you go through a run you'll also get to unlock various abilities across two different characters, with hundreds of unique skills to build up your deck.</p>
<p>Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HmbXHQZ8tBI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8cb10846d65cce43cedeb9d53e3f79ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HmbXHQZ8tBI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>MicroProse said: "Blending the tension of a poker table with the thrill of a dungeon crawler, Dungeon Holdem captures MicroProse's legacy of games built on tactics, ingenuity, and risk management".</p>
<p>No release date or even mention of a demo yet so stay tuned. Loving the style of it though.</p>

      <title>Embark Studios confirm rollout of Denuvo Anti-Cheat for THE FINALS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a major midseason update out today, Embark Studios have given an update on their anti-cheat plans as more tools are being added to it. The game <em>should</em> still fully work on Linux / SteamOS platforms (like Steam Deck), as they've said multiple times before they won't be doing anything in THE FINALS to specifically block Linux.</p>
<p>They confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/the-finals-gets-a-huge-upgrade-for-season-8-plus-anti-cheat-changes-confirmed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously</a> that Denuvo Anti-Cheat was in their plans, but the actual rollout of it as an additional tool has now begun which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/523105966512669165" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a> should be finished by the end of next week. They said "Denuvo AntiCheat turned out to be a perfect complement to our existing tools. Rollout will start with this release, and complete by the end of next week", so we assume this will be in addition to Easy Anti-Cheat that it already has. We're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting both on our anti-cheat page</a> to be sure for now.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WnVSxdaT40U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3400c76d4ed2cdb50904942aa803c802.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WnVSxdaT40U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Along with the anti-cheat update, THE FINALS also has a whole new free-for-all Halloween event that sounds pretty fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you hear that? That’s your cue to run!</p>
<p>In<strong> GHOUL RUSH</strong>, everyone starts off as a Survivor in this brand new, limited-time, Free-For-All mode. Get eliminated even once, and you’ll be doomed to spend the rest of the round as a Ghoul, hunting down the remaining unturned Contestants! Each match lasts for three intense rounds, so you'll have time to switch your tactics and seek revenge!</p>
<p>Earn cash as a Survivor by eliminating Ghouls and other survivors, by staying alive for as long as you can, or by making it to the end of the round as the last surviving Contestant! Once you’re a Ghoul, earn cash by eliminating Survivors.</p>
<p>Enter the foggy and frightening ALFA-ACTA P.E.A.C.E. Center for this event and take a fixed loadout with you, depending on your choice of Heavy or Medium Build. Once you’re a Ghoul, you’ll need to either rely on your Sledgehammer or your trusty Dagger and, of course, what’s left of your wits!</p>
<p><strong>Can you survive the Ghoul Rush?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to their next game, ARC Raiders, which releases on October 30th — Embark and their press teams have not replied to multiple emails from GamingOnLinux to confirm if the release will have the anti-cheat enabled for Linux. We go with the thought that just because one game from them works, it does not mean the next will (since anti-cheat is such a problem for Linux gamers). Also, just because previous playtests for ARC Raiders worked, doesn't necessarily mean the release will when everything is online. We've emailed <em>again</em> today to see if they finally want to talk.</p>

      <title>Arrowhead focus on fixing up all the issues with HELLDIVERS 2 getting a big bug-squashing patch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 remains as one of the best co-op action games around, but it has long be plagued with the kind of bugs you don't want to see.</p>
<p>The developers are fully aware of all the technical issues, and they did recently talk about the state of the game in post in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969781911" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">late September</a>. Today, the Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 update landed and along with a whole bunch of general balancing changes to make it a bit more fun, there's a <em>lot</em> of bug fixing and optimization going on. Arrowhead devs said they've "overhauled how we approach patching to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us" which means "more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18294279341761214253gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18294279341761214253gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>New features are still planned but this patch "marks a big step forward: both in the game itself and in how we work to improve it" and more is on the way. All the fixes and optimizations are listed below, but there's a lot <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/538868565209514366" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">more</a> changes:</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux project agrees to allow AI-assisted contributions with a new policy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AI generation, it's everywhere! And now it's going to be formally accepted into Fedora Linux, as per the latest approved change with a new policy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/council-policy-proposal-policy-on-ai-assisted-contributions/165092/242" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> came on the Fedora discussion board from Aoife Moloney that notes "the Fedora Council has approved the latest version of the AI-Assisted Contributions policy formally". The post <a href="https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/542#comment-990415" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">links to</a> what will be the final version of the policy and it seems at least reasonable, with whoever contributing the code being required to be fully transparent on what AI tool has been used for it.</p>
<p>Copied below is the approved policy wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fedora AI-Assisted Contributions Policy<br/>
You MAY use AI assistance for contributing to Fedora, as long as you follow the principles described below.</p>
<p>Accountability: You MUST take the responsibility for your contribution: Contributing to Fedora means vouching for the quality, license compliance, and utility of your submission. All contributions, whether from a human author or assisted by large language models (LLMs) or other generative AI tools, must meet the project’s standards for inclusion. The contributor is always the author and is fully accountable for the entirety of these contributions.</p>
<p>Transparency: You MUST disclose the use of AI tools when the significant part of the contribution is taken from a tool without changes. You SHOULD disclose the other uses of AI tools, where it might be useful. Routine use of assistive tools for correcting grammar and spelling, or for clarifying language, does not require disclosure.</p>
<p>Information about the use of AI tools will help us evaluate their impact, build new best practices and adjust existing processes.</p>
<p>Disclosures are made where authorship is normally indicated. For contributions tracked in git, the recommended method is an Assisted-by: commit message trailer. For other contributions, disclosure may include document preambles, design file metadata, or translation notes.</p>
<p>Examples:<br/>
Assisted-by: generic LLM chatbot<br/>
Assisted-by: ChatGPTv5</p>
<p>Contribution &amp; Community Evaluation: AI tools may be used to assist human reviewers by providing analysis and suggestions. You MUST NOT use AI as the sole or final arbiter in making a substantive or subjective judgment on a contribution, nor may it be used to evaluate a person’s standing within the community (e.g., for funding, leadership roles, or Code of Conduct matters). This does not prohibit the use of automated tooling for objective technical validation, such as CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, or spam filtering. The final accountability for accepting a contribution, even if implemented by an automated system, always rests with the human contributor who authorizes the action.</p>
<p>Large scale initiatives: The policy doesn’t cover the large scale initiatives which may significantly change the ways the project operates or lead to exponential growth in contributions in some parts of the project. Such initiatives need to be discussed separately with the Fedora Council.</p>
<p>Concerns about possible policy violations should be reported via private tickets to Fedora Council.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also follows a recent <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/37233" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> to the Mesa graphics drivers contributor <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/submittingpatches.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">guidelines</a>, with a note about AI as well. Discussions on whether Mesa will actually allow AI contributions seem to still be ongoing though.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>The Jackbox Party Pack 11 has arrived with a whole new set of games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For your next little gathering, The Jackbox Party Pack 11 is available now bringing with it five completely new original games to laugh with your pals. And once again, you can play the pack on nearly everything. With Native Linux support, it also works across various other devices.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The games included in this one are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Legends of Trivia – A co-op twist on classic trivia, where you work together to conquer challenges and defeat devious monsters with the power of knowledge.</li>
<li>Suspectives – A detective-themed social deduction game where players work together to uncover the secret criminal hiding among them.</li>
<li>Doominate – A chaotic twist on joke-writing games where you take turns destroying each other’s wholesome ideas, all in the name of comedy.</li>
<li>Hear Say - Players record their own lines and sound effects for bizarre, unseen video clips using just their phones and the group votes for the funniest and most fitting soundscape.</li>
<li>Cookie Haus - Fulfil cookie design orders for unusual clientele in Jackbox's coziest drawing game yet!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The most recent trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a8IwlJvXhgk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac0eeb997062a908c11c2eda8f68114f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a8IwlJvXhgk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With this being the first pack in some time that actually has properly original games, hopefully the release goes well for them. Especially as the previous pack had what appears to be the worst overall Steam user rating in the series, so it would be good to see them back on top form for party game fans.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Magic &amp; Cards will give poker the roguelike deck-builder treatment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo coming on November 5th, Heroes of Magic &amp; Cards is another interesting spin on deck-builders that blends in poker mechanics for something different. <em>Turn-based card-battling fans will probably enjoy this one!</em></p>
<p>Not directly a poker game, simply taking elements from the classic like we've seen other games do. Take down enemies with powerful cards to enable you to hit them with pairs and straights, along with various combo attacks to unleash various elemental effect along with having special class-based abilities that all together should mix things up nicely.</p>
<p>Have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="k_YhoULB4O0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f72d429179de4f307030e6503c483163.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/k_YhoULB4O0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Poker is intrinsically fun and deeply complex. It's great for deckbuilder games, but it’s underused” Co-Founder of First Day Entertainment, Stephen Gou,  says. We wanted to fill that gap so we made Heroes of Magic &amp; Cards."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Poker Roguelike Power. Build your perfect deck as you traverse the world, ensuring that by the time you fight the next boss, every draw is a guaranteed powerhouse! Crush your opponents with straights and pairs!</li>
<li>Customize Your Plan of Attack! Every run offers a different assortment of enchantments and relics through a series of random encounters. Make the most of what you find, putting together your strategy one shift at a time. Will you focus on healing? Changing your card values to maximize your combos? Will you just aim for raw damage? Every find has its uses!</li>
<li>Choose Your Class! Each class has its own unique abilities to push the flow of combat even further! Powers like Chain Lightning, Hell Fire, and Shield Burst completely change the flow of combat and set you up for devastating finishers on the most powerful bosses!</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today, Tribute Games Inc. and Dotemu have confirmed the beat 'em up MARVEL Cosmic Invasion will officially launch on December 1st. </p>
<p>With the new trailer we're greeted by reveals of Phoenix and Invincible Iron Man that will be included, as the roster of characters for it is now complete. With 15 total playable heroes, you get quite a nice variety here and there's likely plenty for fans of Marvel to appreciate. The new additions join the likes of Captain America, She-HULK, Rocket Racoon, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Phyla-Vell, Venom, Nova, Black Panther, Beta Ray Bill, Cosmic Ghost Rider and Silver Surfer.</p>
<p>Currently, the demo is still available on Steam with an overall Very Positive rating.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="itVLfmX3Ts8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4aa06ada8996778744ed4321a3a68904.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "In MARVEL Cosmic Invasion, the immortal Super Villain Annihilus has launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy, threatening all life as we know it. Fighters, both Earth-born and cosmic, must now join forces in a star-spanning adventure against the deadly Annihilation Wave. Choosing from a unique roster of characters, brawl through the streets of New York City all the way to the depths of the Negative Zone to foil Annihilus’ vow to spread death across the cosmos.</p>
<p>Choose and control your own team of two characters while tagging between them mid-fight with the innovative Cosmic Swap system, capitalizing on distinct superpowers and special attacks to create unique team-ups and dish out devastating damage."</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and will no doubt end up rated Steam Deck Verified eventually.</p>

      <title>RV There Yet? is the latest co-op hit on Steam with plans to get it Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More silly co-op games to play with friends? Yes please. RV There Yet? looks like it could be a fun time and they're working on getting it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? You and your buddies are on your way home from a relaxing vacation but are forced to take an alternate route. Get your RV through the back country and find the exit to Route 65. A co-op adventure about driving your recreational vehicle home.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H7mXFwVNX6Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8f80827754a4d210cfc2640603382fb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H7mXFwVNX6Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems it has been more of a hit than expected too. Originally made for a game jam, they turned it into a Steam release and ended up amassing over 300,000 wishlists. At launch yesterday, it managed to get over 30,000 people playing it at the same time, pretty impressive for another small developer.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3949040/view/541119816328546392" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they noted some things they're currently focusing on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Keybindings</li>
<li>Full Controller Support</li>
<li>Steam Deck Verified </li>
<li>In-game localization</li>
<li>Auto-activation VOIP Mode</li>
<li>Achievements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Could end up being a great one to play with friends alongside the likes of PEAK, R.E.P.O and other more recent online co-op games. And, since I play a big mixture between my Desktop Linux PC and Steam Deck depending on where I am and how I feel, more games that run well on both is a big plus for me and no doubt many others.</p>
<p>Going by the Steam user reviews players are loving it, but it's a little bit unstable. So I'll be taking a proper look after a patch or two.</p>

      <title>Cult of the Lamb becomes a bit more of a farming sim with the new Woolhaven DLC trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few days ago we got a fresh look at the ranching system in the upcoming Cult of the Lamb DLC Woolhaven, and I really can't wait to jump back into it. We're still not being given a date for when it will arrive though, other than sometime early next year.</p>
<p>Cult of the Lamb is truly an <em>excellent</em> game with such a magnificent style to it. Although I did find the combat quite difficult, especially one particular annoying boss that kicked my ass so many times I lost count. But, it's the Cult side of things I think I actually enjoyed the most out of it. Building up your little village, getting everyone to do my bidding and dealing with all the issues that arise. Still, the mixture of culting and combat is great together but it was clearly ripe for expanding.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Woolhaven DLC will give you a whole lot more to do as highlighted in the recent ranching overview trailer and this has made me really excited for it. Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JziX-60OyCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dedcaa90a8921b644543481dd017fdd8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JziX-60OyCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">DLC highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Return the lost souls of Woolhaven to their spiritual home and learn the long-forgotten history of lambkind. Rebuild the fallen town to its former glory and reclaim the mountain to restore the depleted power of Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs. But beware: there is always a price to be paid.</li>
<li>Endure harsh weather, including blizzards and freezing temperatures, that threaten your Cult’s survival. Build new structures to keep your loyal followers warm and protect them from frostbite and famine.</li>
<li>Unlock ranching at your Cult base and breed rare animals that provide wool, warmth, and when times are particularly desperate, precious meat. Tame, ride, and let your followers take care of these majestic creatures.</li>
<li>Venture into a new realm battered by bitter storms, crawling with creatures corrupted with the Rot lurking beneath the snow. Battle through two vast new dungeons, where the echoes of the past refuse to rest.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cult of the Lamb the base game works perfectly on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>

      <title>The Farmer Was Replaced is a satisfying way to learn a little programming with automation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Learning a little programming doesn't need to be boring, and The Farmer Was Replaced makes it quite fun actually with you coding a little farming drone. <em>Note: the publisher sent GamingOnLinux a key.</em></p>
<p>It uses a Python-like language that carefully and slowly guides you through programming blocks of code, to get a drone to do its thing and build up a collection of resources for you. After you get enough resources, you can jump into a tech tree to unlock more of the game to do a little more in-depth programming and farming. In a way, it's also an idle game, because once you've got a good loop going you can sit back and watch the satisfying action of your code move your drone about to do its work.</p>
<p>Now, I'm no stranger to programming, this very site you're reading was coded by me, but it's also held together by hopes and dreams because I am a terrible programmer. So, games like this that helpfully introduce lots of programming elements in a fun way really are great. And, this might actually be one of the best I've played. I still feel like a complete dumdum going through it, but it gives an interesting challenge that tickles the mind a bit in a way that pushes you to want to actually program a little more and see what you can do.</p>
<p>What's really interesting here is the layout of the game. There's no levels to go through, it's all one self-contained ever-expanding plot of land that grows as you plant and harvest to unlock more of it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aP2WHQKJVsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64c4c1aa0c2eb50e53a772b0d683f8c1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aP2WHQKJVsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Something else that's interesting is that you can open multiple windows, to have an array of different code blocks. So you could set up an initial loop to get going, and get some resources, while you work on another better block to replace it later or to do something else entirely. Lots of nice ideas went into this one.</p>
<p>What's also really slick about it, is that the code blocks you create are actually stored directly on your system in .py files, so you can actually edit them outside of the game in your favourite editor too. On Linux with Proton, that would be somewhere like this:</p>
<p><code>steamapps/compatdata/2060160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/TheFarmerWasReplaced/TheFarmerWasReplaced/Saves/Save0/</code></p>
<p>Wonderful idea, great presentation and really easy to get into. But, it won't hold your hand, you still have to figure out all the solutions entirely by yourself. It gives you the tools, and guides you a little on how to use them but the rest is up to you.</p>

      <title>Craft unique cards with stickers in the cute deck-builder My Card Is Better Than Your Card!</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As far as deck-builders go, My Card Is Better Than Your Card! is definitely more on the cute side with you crafting cards from stickers you collect. Currently in Early Access from Utu Studios, it has a genuinely lovely idea for a turn-based card battler.<em> Note: the developer sent GamingOnLinux a key.</em></p>
<p>Here pretty much every card can be completely unique, because there's no standard set of cards. While you do get an initial deck to play with with some basics, everything from then on is entirely down to how you want to play. Cards are built by stickers you find digging in the sand (who is burying all these stickers?) or buy at a shop from coins earned through battles, and each sticker has its own effect. You can load up cards with lots of these stickers to make them quite ridiculous but they all come with a cost attached to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4546119831761130620gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4546119831761130620gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Candy is the cost / mana system here, with each card having a candy cost depending on what stickers they have. You start battles with a small amount of candy, and each turn you can pick to boost your candy amount or draw an extra card. Then it's down to the battles.</p>
<p>This is where it's also quite unique, as the battle system is a bit of a tug-of-war. Instead of a health bar, you have a star meter with a total one of you has to hit. Each player builds up stars during a turn by playing cards, and then whoever has the most at the end of both turns will have their stars added to the meter (minus the amount of stars from your opponent) to progress towards one side. So if you have 10 stars, and your opponent has 6, you get 4 stars added to the meter towards your opponent.</p>
<p>There's also a special fever meter, which over time adds a multiplier to the total stars you have at the end of a round. This is pretty much essential, as otherwise battles might end up going on and on forever since it's a tug of war.</p>
<p>While it may look incredibly inviting from the visuals and setting, it's really quite a challenge. You have to pay such close attention to all the stickers, because you can really stack up some insane combinations with them and end up getting tons and tons of stars every round.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3L02RMI8Pmc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47ef6def45f7c869ad1d49b3b3c1a207.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3L02RMI8Pmc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really loved what I played of it, but they really do need to be careful on the balance of the stickers to make the cards, because even early on in the game it can end up a bit more challenging than it needs to be while it's easing you in. Aside from that, it's a brilliant idea with great presentation.</p>
<p>Really fun to play and create cards and I'm looking forward to seeing it finished. Works perfectly on Linux with Proton 9. Definitely one of the most interesting deck-builders released in the last few years.</p>

      <title>Tingus Goose is one of the weirdest games I&#39;ve ever seen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I really don't have a clue what's going on in Tingus Goose, an upcoming idle / clicker game in the spirit of stuff like Cookie Clicker. It's supremely weird. No way of describing this game is going to make it not incredibly bizzare. But, I am somehow captivated by it, and the demo runs perfectly on Linux with Proton 9.</p>
<p>So what's the deal? Two people fall in love, one gets pregnant and then a goose somehow merges inside with the baby. Then it sprouts and you keep watering this goose to see it continually grow up towards reaching another goose. Oh, and your goose keeps shooting out tiny little baby people that allow you to earn more money, to pour more water on the goose to grow it some more.</p>
<p>Your ever-increasing goose neck also sprouts more goose heads, each with a different helpful bonus. You'll end up bouncing tiny little babies everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14893037781761127211gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14893037781761127211gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Something about it just really hooked me. The design is deliciously insane.</p>
<p>They've also now just announced it's launching on November 20th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2TWvg-dbuUo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9cb73bdf2b401b1a451d4bde3b077f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2TWvg-dbuUo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Plant seeds in people: Pop a goose seed into a patient's torso, add water, and watch a towering goose-tree burst to life in MasterTingus's unmistakably twisted style.</li>
<li>Idle meets Rube Goldberg: Babies rain down branches, ricocheting off "Blossoms" to generate cash while "Specimens" chain wild synergies for exponential growth.</li>
<li>17 unsettling chapters, 150 plus unlockables: Every chapter introduces new modifiers, lore, Blossoms, Specimens, and Relics. All art is hand-illustrated by MasterTingus.</li>
<li>Each run offers a uniquely bizarre experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"This game to me feels like a perpetual soup. I kept adding wild ideas into the broth for over 4 years. Every so often I taste the soup and I add more stuff into it. It's now become an abomination that even I can't control. This game is now bigger than me. Does the soup taste good? Yes." - Master Tingus</p>
<p>"We took an already-addictive idle core and matched it with MasterTingus's unforgettable art," said Brian Zou, founder of Sweaty Chair Studio.</p>
<p>"Tingus Goose combines an absurd premise with deeply rewarding incremental mechanics," added Austin Oblouk, CEO of Playsaurus. "Finding an idle game with this level of creative depth is rare. Fans of the genre are going to love it."</p>

      <title>Steam gets personal with a recommendations calendar to help you find games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have remembered that Steam Labs exists and have a new experiment for us all to try: a personal recommendations calendar for recent and upcoming games.</p>
<p>While Valve already have various lists you can go through, and a discovery queue for suggestions, this new calendar might make things easier for you to plan your upcoming purchases. Based on data collected from people with "similar playtime profiles to you" it then goes over their wishlists to help build a release calendar for you. That, and what games you've put the most time into to help build up some genres and it refreshes daily to bring all the data together.</p>
<p>Valve say that while it shouldn't change a whole lot each day, it will evolve with time as the 8-week look moves on.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty great looking and quite a neat idea:</p>

      <title>THRASHER the mind-melting follow-up to Thumper releases November and Steam Deck optimised</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Previously only available in VR, THRASHER is the mind-melting follow-up to Thumper and it's confirmed to arrive on Steam on November 7th. It will come with full Steam Deck support and optimisations, with the developer noting it should run at a smooth "90fps".</p>
<p>The game has won multiple awards, so it should be interesting to see how it makes the jump from being VR-only to a flat-screen experience. To be clear though, the Steam release supports both VR and normal play. In the press release they noted "It has been reworked to capture the magic of the VR version but shine on traditional platforms. Swoop around the space eel with a thumbstick or your mouse and thrash through the chaos with the help of a new dash ability. The visuals have also been upgraded, taking advantage of the power of PCs" which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Game modes: Main Campaign (27 stages across nine worlds), Play+ mode (new!) and Time Trials (new!).</li>
<li>Steam Deck optimised: 90fps with gamepad and touchpad controls.</li>
<li>2D:  Mouse and gamepad controls.</li>
<li>2D: Improved visuals over the VR version.</li>
<li>PCVR: improved visuals over standalone platforms.</li>
<li>PCVR: controllers AND hand tracking support.</li>
<li>PCVR: new more responsive controls.</li>
<li>Leaderboards and Steam Achievements.</li>
<li>Master a unique comboing mechanic centered around creating circles with your space eel</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I read the press details, looked at the Steam page and watched the trailer and frankly I'm still completely confused by what I'm looking at here. How wild. </p>
<p>It looks like it <em>might</em> even have Native Linux support, although the system requirements only mention SteamOS / Steam Deck. Sometimes developers do this thinking they have to note Linux support to run on Steam Deck but they only have a Windows build to run in Proton. We'll just have to see at release.</p>

      <title>The Outlast Trials new PvP invasion mode is out now with Easy Anti-Cheat added</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Outlast Trials from Red Barrels has a huge new update out now that brings in a PvP invasion mode, and there's also now anti-cheat added into the game.</p>
<p>In the new Invasion Mode players can join your game as either a Reagent or an Imposter, but only a limited number of Imposters can invade any given Trial: while the others wait, they act as the the eyes and ears of their murderous teammates. Each Imposter will get a chance to invade the Trial, as their peers succeed in their sabotage… or die trying.</p>
<p>With the update they're also now using Easy Anti-Cheat, which has been disclosed on the Steam page as of today. Anti-cheat is rather problematic when it comes to Linux / SteamOS + Steam Deck, but in this case they do have it enabled for Linux platforms to be able to play. We were shared this message from a support ticket the developer replied to:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20575998371761062344gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20575998371761062344gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I've personally tested it just to be sure and it worked fine with a game being invaded on Desktop Linux (Proton 9). Nice to see, since it's a Steam Deck Verified game. Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> has now been updated to note this.</p>
<p>You can see the trailer for the new update below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QCCMkEwIsGU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9bd7c0bd06eef4aa4f259259370824b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QCCMkEwIsGU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>In case you also missed it, like I did previously, the developer also has an AI notice on the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="game_page_autocollapse_ctn">
<div class="game_page_autocollapse" style="max-height: none;">
<div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_content_descriptors">
<p>Throughout the development of our game, we may leverage AI-based tools to assist our team in content creation. Please rest assured that what you see in the game reflects the creativity and hard work of our team. Examples may include pictures and/or posters used in some of our environments.</p>

      <title>The incredible UTOPIA MUST FALL has a big performance upgrade and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>UTOPIA MUST FALL is absolutely one of the best arcade-styled base defense games made in modern times, and now it's massively better with a new update.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/utopia-must-fall-is-easily-one-of-the-best-modern-arcade-shoot-em-ups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Previously covered here on GamingOnLinux</a> as I loved it so much, and another recent article on the Beta for this new release that's properly out for everyone now.</p>
<p>The game incorporates elements from retro arcade shooters, tower defense, roguelikes and beyond. Wrapped up in a slick laser-sharp bullet-purgatory arcade frenzy about Earth's last metropolis defending itself against a mysterious alien invasion. Currently rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam, I think more people need to check this one out. And now you can on Steam Deck too, as the new update had a focus on full Steam Deck support on top of all the performance improvements.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WeBkIYaJX30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34197bb6298b419f9158200cd76baac9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WeBkIYaJX30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've said now this update is done the next will focus on gameplay like new weapons, new enemies and some "big surprises" yet to be revealed.</p>

      <title>Valve doing more of a Steam Deck push with their Steam Deck Verified game pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are still pushing their Steam Deck ahead with many developers now adding their own special dedicated Steam Deck Verified page.</p>
<p>These special areas on Steam give an uncluttered page that highlights how well a game can run on Steam Deck, it's a really neat idea to help cut through the noise. Just the game, a trailer and a link to the store page for the Steam Deck and for the game. This gives developers an easy link to advertise that their game is fully supported on the Linux powered Steam Deck.</p>
<p>An example below is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong page</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8649374121761051223gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They've actually been around for a while, as far back as 2023 from what I can tell, as I've seen a few developers (and Valve) announce them for specific games. However, there's currently no normal link to these pages on Steam that I could find. It's mainly up to developers to show them off but you can just use "https://store.steampowered.com/verified/*APPID*" and it will work (but only if they're fully green tick Verified).</p>
<p>It appears that Valve have recently begun emailing more developers (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/datablob.studio/post/3m3p326k5gs2d" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>) if their game is Steam Deck Verified. As a result, I've been seeing a <em>lot</em> of developers suddenly post about their games being Steam Deck Verified across different social media sites.</p>
<p>Great to see more of a push from Valve again. Especially given how ridiculously costly other handhelds are, with the Steam Deck holding up well against the competition (aside from playability of the latest AAA games or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">those with anti-cheat</a>).</p>

      <title>Fight the nazis to rescue your dog in the new free shooter Darkenstein 3D out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by some of the classics like Return to Castle Wolfenstein and DOOM, the free shooter Darkenstein 3D has released and it's a rip-roaring good time. <em>Disclosure: their press team provided GamingOnLinux with a key.</em></p>
<p>No nazi trickery involved here, it's free to grab and keep on Steam. However, the developer did previously announce after teaming up with publisher MicroProse that they're going to be doing some DLC expansions but they promised they will "*not* be bite-sized and we will *not* nickel and dime you". A first smaller expansion will come first, with longer expansions to follow.</p>
<p>Like something out of John Wick only a bit more supernatural, you're on a mission to save your precious dog, snatched away by the evil Gestapo. Armed with nothing but your beard (okay, you do get weapons eventually), as the "Hobo Guy" you'll be firing and strafing like your own life depends on it. With some funny physics interactions letting you smash through things, along with plenty of bloody gore it's quite a highlight to run through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j0DYROVej84"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c59e4f46cd268053a360dc9d20ccd6b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j0DYROVej84" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game seemed to work perfectly with Proton 9 on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu).</p>
<p>If you love oldschool shooters that are a little bit silly, you'll no doubt enjoy this one. The slow-mo special power with your "Homicidal Rant" where you get health bonuses per kill was a nice touch. Some really fun design went into this one overall, with interesting level layouts and it can be quite brutal.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast, Old-School Gameplay - No cover, no aim assist, no handholding. Just movement, aim, and survival. Dodge bullets, strafe through firefights, and master the deadly rhythm of retro combat.</li>
<li>A Story of Desperation (and a Dog) - Rescue your kidnapped companion, Gunther, while unraveling strange mysteries hidden inside enemy strongholds.</li>
<li>13 Handcrafted Levels - Castles, caves, valleys, and desert towns; each packed with secrets, keys, treasures, and escalating danger.</li>
<li>Dynamic Rat Companion - Turn the battlefield into chaos with your vicious rat sidekick. Distract enemies, combo with grenades, and create absolute carnage.</li>
<li>Explosive Physics &amp; Gore - Enemies fly, gib, and ragdoll in spectacular firefights. Props shatter, debris scatters, and every bullet leaves a mark.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Want to avoid AI gen on Steam? This browser userscript might save your day</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With more and more game developers creating AI slop, or just using AI generation for stupid things in their games, we need more ways to avoid them.</p>
<p>The problem is for me, I'm so busy that it's just easy to miss. The AI notice on Steam page is buried is small writing at the bottom of a store page. Steam itself has no filters for it currently either, although the community site <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=AI%20Content%20Disclosed" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> does and the list is a lot bigger than I expected. 12,284 games on Steam have an AI disclosure according to SteamDB at time of writing. I was going to say "that's a crazy number!", but it's not really is it? I'm sure many GamingOnLinux readers fully expected a lot of developers to end up pushing out slop with AI generation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, an <a href="https://github.com/seeeeew/aiwarningforsteam?tab=readme-ov-file" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">open source browser userscript</a> was pointed out to me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mysterioushatch.bsky.social/post/3m3p3wargls24" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> (thanks!) which really makes it impossible to miss. It will work on any operating system with pretty much all major browsers. With that installed, when going to a Steam page that has an AI disclosure, you get this appear before you're able to actually do anything:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5984243841761042312gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I love how simple and most importantly how <em>effective</em> it is. The main thing is that doesn't stop you taking a look, it just makes sure you're fully aware of the AI gen use. Hopefully never again will I completely waste my time playing through a game, writing it up and then suddenly remembering - "Oh yeah, I have to check if they stuck AI generation in it".</p>
<p>I'm sure some readers might find my stance on AI generation a bit harsh perhaps, but when there's tens of thousands of games releasing every year — my time (and yours!) is a premium currency. Why would I want to spend my time with a game full of AI generation, when I could play one that had real actual people craft the work. I can just skip over a game with it for a different game without it. Some of the AI use just seems completely daft as well, one I saw earlier noted how it was used for "Icons + Artists Paintover for 5 icons, out of 100s of artist icons" (Kingdoms Reborn) and in that case I think like…why was it even needed at all?</p>
<p>Using this browser userscript, and remembering to check SteamDB, it's a genuine surprise to see just how many titles have now added an AI disclosure. To my surprise even games like My Summer Car, The Outlast Trials and Siralim Ultimate have the notice.</p>
<p>Hopefully you find it helpful. With tools like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/gaijin-announced-edenspark-an-open-source-ai-assisted-platform-for-making-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent EdenSpark announcement</a>, we're going to see more AI games.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next big KDE Plasma release is here with Plasma 6.5 delivering a number of major new features, as the KDE team begin to show a lot more confidence. So much confidence in fact, the update page notes how they're "on the verge of making it big for the general public".</p>
<p>With this release you can set automatic theme transitions between light and dark based on the time of day, there's a better zoom tool that jumps into where you actually need it, and the KRunner search tool was also improved with a new fuzzy searching feature to help you out. Even the clipboard becomes more useful in this release, letting you pin items to keep referring back to them.</p>
<p>Fans of drawing tablets get some more additions too as you're now able to configure any rotary dials and touch rings in the system settings page. Along with a new warning if there's a custom driver interacting with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21251665521761041201gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21251665521761041201gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Another evolution is the Flatpak Permission page, which has been upgraded into a proper general desktop Application Permissions page. Here you'll be able to configure everything properly across all your apps.</p>
<p>Usability has also been a constant focus with an improved WiFi and Networking page, along with making connection messages clearer and providing the WiFi password along with a QR code when you're sharing to help others connect. The do not disturb mode was improved too, giving you a button to actually see all missed notifications. An addition for gamers too - the Game Controller page was updated with more info.</p>
<p>The list of improvements goes on and on with more accessibility improvements too like the Orca screen reader getting improvements for describing actions and keyboard shortcuts, along with telling you when the Caps Lock changes state. Plasma has also been through an audit to fix up all known cases of screen-flashing that could cause photosensitivity issues.</p>
<p>Thankfully, more work also went into the Discover software app to make it launch faster, and give you more info on what's holding it up along with support for "flatpak+https://" URLS.</p>
<p>So much more! Improved HDR content display, an experimental version of the Wayland picture-in-picture protocol was added, there's performance improvements and lots more.</p>

<p>A few niggles aside, KDE Plasma is incredible as a desktop. It has long been my favourite and my go-to for Linux. Nicely bridging the gap between a mostly Windows-like setup but with lots of customization. I think KDE Plasma is still the absolute best way to get more Windows users to feel at home on Linux.</p>

      <title>Open source racer SuperTuxKart 1.5 out now, development moving onto SuperTuxKart Evolution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SuperTuxKart is like a free and open source alternative to Mario Kart, with a brand new release out now!</p>
<p>This release brings with it three new egg hunt maps, three official new fields for the soccer mode. There's also a bunch of user interface improvements in this release too including a new display settings tab, a search option for karts and arenas, a new blog announcement system included in the interface, better font and UI scaling and lots of little fixes everywhere in the UI along with new themes.</p>
<p>Like a particular track? You can now mark it as a favourite, making them show up first for easier picking. There's also some audio improvements, several adjustments to the graphics settings by default to make it look better along with fixes to some graphical effects and some new effects were added too. There's even a new benchmarking mode included for testing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H1Lo7PlTGBk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0db8335386469a00aef9c34022671bdf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H1Lo7PlTGBk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You'll also find an improved Vulkan renderer, networking improvements, crash bug fixes and so on.</p>
<p>They're also doing a special donation pack, where you can get early access to two new tracks for $5 before they roll out to all players in a later update. Just a way to gather a bit more support for the project.</p>
<p>On top of all that, they announced back in <a href="https://blog.supertuxkart.net/2025/08/announcing-supertuxkart-evolution.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">August</a> that work has started on SuperTuxKart Evolution, the next major change for the free and open source racer.

      <title>Xubuntu website hijacked to serve malware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch, the Xubuntu website was recently hijacked and ended up serving Windows malware, and this isn't the first time the Xubuntu site was hit.</p>
<p>Back in September (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xubuntu/comments/1ndkotb/xubuntu_site_hacked/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>), it seemed the Xubuntu blog was briefly attacked to serve slot machine adverts, going by the comments in the Reddit post. This time though, it was a bit more nefarious with the downloads section (specifically the torrent) serving up some sort of crypto malware (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xubuntu/comments/1oa43gt/xubuntuorg_might_be_compromised/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Confirming the issue on Mastodon in reply to a question about it, Xubuntu contributor Sean Davis <a href="https://floss.social/@bluesabre/115401767635718361" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is. We’re working with Canonical IS to resolve. Since the servers aren’t owned by our team, there’s little we can do. We’ve since taken down the download page and will be expediting our static site development to replace our aging WordPress instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Wordpress being as popular as it is used across so many sites, anyone running it really does need to ensure it's constantly updated with regular security fixes.</p>
<p>The timing of it is interesting, with Windows 10 recently ending support, so likely the attackers were hoping to hit a few people attempting to move from Windows.</p>
<p>Right now, the Xubuntu website is quite broken with many pages leading to errors. Hopefully they'll be able to sort it out soon.</p>

      <title>Gaijin Entertainment announced EdenSpark, an open source &#34;AI-assisted&#34; platform for making games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EdenSpark seemed like a pretty exciting announcement for game developers and the open source community, until you read about the AI generation involved.</p>
<p>Announced today by Gaijin Entertainment they say it's the "first open-source platform that lets independent developers make their games accessible to console users hassle-free and truly own the code of their creations". A fair amount of the focus seems to be consoles but it will also support Windows too. However, since it's all going to be open source, I've no doubts people will quickly begin hacking away at the code to run it on Linux.</p>
<p>This also explains why Dagor Engine that's used in War Thunder, Enlisted and Active Matter <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/war-thunder-game-engine-dagor-engine-from-gaijin-now-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">became open source at the end of 2023</a> since this is powered directly by it. Clearly they had some future plans in mind like this.</p>
<p>They haven't said what license it will use other than being a permissive "FOSS" (Free and open-source software) license and so that developers using it will "retain full ownership of their games" so they can "self-publish independently and take their work anywhere". </p>
<p>All sounds pretty great, but as with everything nowadays, there's AI being advertised as a feature. The press release noted "newcomers can rely on AI-assisted tools to generate art, sound, and gameplay logic, or simply build worlds using plain prompts".<em> It's probably going to be popular with creators of AI slop.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J8JN9lKh5V4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/79610cadc0af7139f73e16da56f3e463.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J8JN9lKh5V4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The official site notes in big letters right on the landing page how it's an "Open Source AI-assisted platform for making games on PC and consoles".</p>
<p>Closed beta testing begins next month, with an open beta in February 2026 and a 1.0 planned for sometime in the Summer of 2026. However, their roadmap notes the project source code is not planned to be released until Fall 2026.</p>

      <title>Coal LLC has annoyingly absorbed my entire attention</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It doesn't look like much with some of the simplest pixel art around but Coal LLC is a like a black hole that freezes your life when you hit play.</p>
<p>A game that released on Steam back in September and made with <a href="https://godotengine.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, it puts a pickaxe in your hands and tells you to go off and mine coal to fill your ever-increasing quota. Each day brings a new mine layout, so you really have to think through all your upgrades. Starting off ridiculously simple with just you dashing about, as you madly try to mine as much as possible and make it back before the timer is up — eventually it expands into some pretty funny explosive chaos.</p>
<p>Especially good when you start getting into the later days in the game, as you spend your hard-earned cash on a mini army of NPC helpers to get mining with you. Thankfully, they don't seem to mind all the explosive weapons I keep using to make quick work of the blocks instead of mining every individual block by hand.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62-_MRFdQh4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd5a799b31980e8cdc91efd379cc138a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62-_MRFdQh4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's multiple game modes in it, with the standard mode based on a short timer as you do a mad-dash through the randomly generated mine. But, there's also a more relaxed mode with half the quota you need to hit (but no bonus cash) and also a peaceful mode if you just want to experience all the weapons and tools it has. That makes my brain happy, since the standard mode really is quite a challenge when you're first getting into it, I managed to fail quite a lot before deciding on a good path through the upgrades.</p>
<p>Inside the mines there's also various chests to mine through to open, with each having a different passive upgrade you can grab to power-up your run through. And, at times, a temporary buff that allows you to 1-hit smash through blocks which is great fun.</p>
<p>Some interesting unlocks available to with different characters, each having their own starting weapon and unique buffs. Along with different types of maps to unlock too. There's a number of hours of entertainment you can have with it.</p>
<p>One of the key points I found at least early on, is to focus on a single piece of equipment to upgrade at least twice, then add some more time to your day, before moving onto building up your little army of helpers. Eventually you understand the loop once you've failed a few times, and your brain keeps screaming at you for another run just to see how far you can get. The sheer panic I feel when that timer starts ticking down on those last few seconds though, it surprisingly gets the blood pumping as you race back to deposit your ores.</p>
<p>It runs perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9 but the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3361510/discussions/0/601905007519895793/#c597412189643582848" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">might</a> be doing a Native Linux build later. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>I picked it up on a whim, as I saw a friend playing it and thought it could be interesting and it is! Being impulsive paid of! Coal LLC is a great example of having a fun little gameplay hook and just going nuts with it. Great stuff.</p>

      <title>Made in the spirit of Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max, adventure game Splittown released recently</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed here on GamingOnLinux from earlier in the month, the classic comedy point and click adventure game Splittown had a full complete release. And it comes with Native Linux support, along with being optimized for the Steam Deck too. Recently Valve put it back through verification and swapped it over to the Native version from Proton.</p>
<p>Whats is it? Splittown resurrects the spirit of 90s point and click classics like Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road, bringing a blend of humour, puzzles, and nostalgic artwork. While it takes inspiration from the classic adventures, it introduces features you might find from classic CRPGs too with "branching narratives" and a "world and story that reacts to player choices" that's supposed to give a fresh spin on the genre.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rMTo4r-_zKA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/53245e411da3cfb4079a6fe1cdc7ec64.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rMTo4r-_zKA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Compared to the Early Access release in January, here's some of what's changed that they listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All new adventures with Otis. </strong>Many of you pointed out that Nimby's best buddy Otis felt underdeveloped during EA. Good news! There is now a whole DLC-sized chunk of content (in a new part of the city) where you get to unravel more of the secrets of Splittown with him!</li>
<li><strong>All-around beefier main story. </strong>With 40 new dialogue branches, 4 new characters and more than 700 frames of new animation, the adventure feels more polished and interactive than ever before.</li>
<li><strong>30+ achievements. </strong>Find easter eggs, hidden gags and cause irreparable damage to the citizens of Splittown all in order to satisfy your digital hoarding instinct.</li>
<li><strong>Item highlight and in-game hints. </strong>This was a tough one, but so many of you asked. Not everyone has the time for endless pixel hunting anymore (adult responsibilities, amirite?) Give the Wimp Phone a call when you are feeling stuck, or toggle on Wimp-Vision™️to highlight interactive items.</li>
<li><strong>Controller and Steam Deck support. </strong>New on-screen glyphs automatically update when switching between a controller and a keyboard. All puzzles have been adjusted to be completeable on a controller as well as the mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>Unlockable making-of content. </strong>Nearly a hundred pieces of early art, in-development screenshots and other curios for you to find. Collect duckies hidden around Splittown to unlock these extras!</li>
<li><strong>More hotkeys, more convenience. </strong>When playing on mouse and keyboard, you can now use WASD and the arrow keys to navigate menus and interactive scenes. Every inch of the UI has been made slicker and more fun to use.</li>
<li><strong>Native Linux, always.</strong> We heard our Linux fans loud and clear: no Proton shenanigans this time around!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Making retro DOS gaming simple - the standalone DOSBox Pure Unleashed is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DOSBox Pure Unleashed is a standalone fork of the classic DOSBox to run DOS games on modern systems, based on the libretro core. Giving you an all-in-one fully featured way to easily play the classics on modern Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>It was originally announced quite a few years ago, but on October 18th the developer announced "DOSBox Pure Unleashed 1.0 Preview 3" which is the "first public release of DOSBox Pure Unleashed based on version 1.0 Preview 3 of the core".</p>
<p>With an impressive and long list of features, this really should make playing classic DOS games near painless on practically any system. Especially with the easy menu interface to load up games from all sorts of file types, the on-screen keyboard, automated controller mapping, save states, major audio support and much more.</p>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="t4q8OMp15KA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1d8bac15b62ec8c6ec619c3eb18146a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/t4q8OMp15KA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really great to see this get a proper up to date release. However, it seems currently there may be some problems with the audio output on certain Linux distributions. Hopefully the issue can be tracked down and promptly fixed. Since it's all open source I imagine it won't take too long.</p>
<p>It's available via the <a href="https://github.com/schellingb/dosbox-pure-unleashed" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or the <a href="https://schelling.itch.io/dosbox-pure" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods app adds new context menus, Stardew Valley FOMOD support, and work towards Bethesda games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm getting more excited about the open source cross-platform Nexus Mods app, especially as we're getting closer to Bethesda games support. Going to be really great when it's more ready since this has Native Linux / SteamOS support, finally a good proper fully featured mod manager for Linux integrated with the biggest modding site around.</p>
<p>The latest update v0.19.4 brings in new context menus (pictured below) to make interacting with mods easier, and there's also support for Stardew Valley FOMOD installers baked into the app now too.</p>
<p>Even more exciting is the load order rework for Cyberpunk REDmods, which helps prepare it for load order in Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4838706811760953412gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4838706811760953412gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Context Menus Are Here:</h4>
<p>We've added the ability to open a <strong>context menu</strong> by right-clicking on items in the <strong>Loadout</strong> and <strong>Library</strong> pages. This streamlines your workflow by providing quick access to common actions like "Remove" or "View Mod Page."</p>
<h4>Stardew Valley FOMOD Installer Support:</h4>
<p>We've added support for running interactive <strong>FOMOD installers</strong> when managing Stardew Valley. This allows you to install more complex mods with configuration options directly within the app.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Bug Fixes and Performance:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue causing Stardew Valley <strong>SMAPI to be installed incorrectly</strong>, which resulted in SMAPI crashing on start. <em>If you were experiencing this problem, please uninstall SMAPI from the app and install it again to fix the corrupted file.</em></li>
<li>Fixed an issue with <strong>Stardew Valley.exe</strong> not being backed up and restored correctly after uninstalling SMAPI.</li>
<li>Fixed a file-time comparison bug that caused <strong>performance slowdowns</strong> when applying a loadout.</li>
<li>Fixed errors that occurred when trying to <strong>unmanage a game</strong> while a loadout was actively applying.</li>
<li>Improved game updates and DLC changes detection without requiring a restart of the app.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Under The Hood:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Our privacy policy and telemetry changed with this release. You can click the question mark in the top bar and go to the about page to read more about our privacy policy and to accept the changes.</li>
<li><strong>Load Order Rework:</strong> We reworked the Load Order backend used for Cyberpunk <strong>REDmods</strong>, in preparation for adding <strong>Bethesda Load Order</strong> support (required for games like Skyrim and Fallout).</li>
<li><strong>Settings Clean-up:</strong> Removed some development and experimental settings from the main Settings page to focus the user experience on stable features.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Atelier Ryza, Atelier Ryza 2 and Atelier Ryza 3 DX release November 13 and all Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From KOEI TECMO, the newer Atelier Ryza DX series is coming to Steam on November 13th and as of today all three of them have been rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>So they'll be nicely playable on other SteamOS / Linux systems too. The only compatibility note that Valve listed is that the three games don't default to external gamepads, so you may need to swap the controller order in the Quick Access menu in SteamOS.</p>
<p>The first game in this series originally released back in 2019, the second in 2021 and the third in 2023. All three have new content added for the DX Steam releases too. Plus improved graphics, an improved UI, new graphics options and more upgrades. KOEI TECMO say the DX releases are the definitive edition of the "Secret" series. The original version of each game is going to be delisted when the DX versions release.</p>
<p>The first in this series is actually the 21st entry in the Atelier franchise and was the first of the Atelier series to feature the same protagonist across multiple titles. The story follows an ordinary girl, Ryza, who discovers alchemy and embarks on a summer adventure with her friends, illustrating her growth through the experiences.</p>

      <title>Kaiju Cleaner Simulator will get you and friends to clean up massive titans together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's another game coming out that will have you clean up the bodies of massive creatures, with Kaiju Cleaner Simulator seeing you and friends team up for it. No battling here, it's all about the aftermath and what comes next.</p>
<p>I'll admit, I got a bit <em>confused</em> when this entered the GamingOnLinux inbox yesterday, because I actually thought it was one I had already covered called <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/youre-on-colossal-cleaning-duty-in-kaiju-cleanup/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kaiju Cleanup that was announced recently</a>. You'll see my problem there right? One is <em>Kaiju Cleanup</em> and this is <em>Kaiju Cleaner Simulator</em> and both only recent reveals. Oh my. Seems two different teams had near enough the exact same idea. This doesn't seem to be some copycat though, as this game seemed to have a Steam page being prepared even before Kaiju Cleanup that just happened to be announced first it seems.</p>
<p>With Kaiju Cleaner Simulator, it's not solo game since up to 4 players can get cleaning together. A bit more chaotic perhaps than the other game. The developers mention this will lean into the more humorous and absurd side of things. In their own words: "Unexpected situations and quirky monster designs bring lighthearted moments to the gritty tasks of cleaning up after kaiju rampages, creating a perfect mix of dark comedy and simulation fun".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below, which is a bit short on actual gameplay though:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YNHivYHib_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d80a9e41476415cf19fd7f6187f71085.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YNHivYHib_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interesting to see their no AI notice at the start, I think we're about to see more developers do such things since there's an increasing amount of AI slop out there. </p>
<p>From the press release: “After watching Kaiju No. 8, we thought maybe being a kaiju cleaner is even tougher than being their exterminator. It’s a job for real tough guys. Our game is for those who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty and turn chaos into fun,” says One More Time. </p>
<p>A Steam playtest is scheduled to begin early next year. With a release planned sometime in Q2 2026.</p>

      <title>Deep colony sim Stardeus adds a huge new narrative-focused update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Because there was always going to be some drama in deep space right? Stardeus is a spaceship colony sim that just expanded in a huge way.</p>
<p>The Story and Drama Update brings with it a huge overhaul and expansion to the narrative systems. They said it includes "new levels of narrative depth, social complexity, and emotional storytelling to the colony simulation experience" which sounds quite fancy. You may find some colonists now might get a bit <em>stabby</em> towards another if they're annoyed enough with them — ouch. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14196197171760708438gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14196197171760708438gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Stardeus is just a overall lot more social now with lots more interactions between colonists like a bit of casual chat or even weddings, there's a lot that can happen in a run now.</p>
<p>What we get is a completely rebuilt story generation system, which is supposed to be more flexible to provide a vast range of dynamic story events. You'll also get to see a new raid management system with it being influenced by colony strength, recent losses, and other in-game factors along with new types of raids to up the challenge.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Update Overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Story Generation System.</li>
<li>New Raid System and Raid Types.</li>
<li>New Colony Drama System and Social Relationships.</li>
<li>Visible Eyes and Unique Faces.</li>
<li>New Story Events.</li>
<li>Ashes, Urns, and Mourning.</li>
<li>Scars and Cause of Death.</li>
<li>Fire and Explosions.</li>
<li>UI Improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1380910/view/508463020330975744" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> is rather long (seriously - that's a lot of additions) and there's a 23 minutes video from the developer that goes over all of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BQpx-vaFHps"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5fb3b1fb4894a92e855fafa4b4d314b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BQpx-vaFHps" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This might end up as one of the deepest strategy games around.</p>
<p>Stardeus has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>The popular physics sandbox game Brick Rigs has added Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice surprise, Brick Rigs is another game that recently added Native Linux support and it's quite a popular choice along with it being highly rated. It has a Very Positive overall Steam user review score from close to 50,000 reviews.</p>
<p>The Linux support arrived in an update on October 17th, with the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552100/view/553504715299619081" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noting</a> they chose to add support to "improve performance and stability by avoiding compatibility layers such as Proton or Wine". Interesting to see, something that we also saw with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-native-linux-version-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/bloober-team-announce-a-native-steam-deck-release-for-cronos-the-new-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, although those were specifically for the Steam Deck whereas this is just general full Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2317127681760703726gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brick Rigs is a physics sandbox game that allows you to build, drive and destroy almost any type of vehicle imaginable. Whether it's a dragster, fire engine, forklift, helicopter, plane, train, ship or even a tank, you can probably build it in Brick Rigs.</p>
<p>You can also upload your creations to the Workshop to share them with the community. And if you don’t feel like building anything, you can just download any of the over 200,000 creations already uploaded by other players.</p>
<p>The multiplayer mode allows you to experience these physics together with your friends. You can organize races, demolition derbies, dog fights or emergency scenarios. The rules are up to you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The update didn't just add Linux support, it also translated the game into 12 new languages. Plus they added AMD FSR support, and a number of other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>The trailer is below, although it has no sound and it's quite dated at this point they don't seem to have any more that's up to date. They don't even list a YouTube anywhere I could find:</p>

      <title>Two Point Museum meets Vampire Survivors in the latest crossover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Museum has done a crossover update with Vampire Survivors, which really made me scratch my head but still fun to see. Oh right, it's nearing Halloween - the update makes just a little bit more sense now. <em>It's a free update for all existing owners of the game.</em></p>
<p>Vampire Survivors brings three stages to Two Point Museum's Digiverse map as new Points of Interest: the Mad Forest, Inlaid Library and Capella Magna. And some of Vampire Survivor's weapons have even made it into the game like Garlic, Spinach and Santa Water, serving as offensive weapons to grant bonuses to museum employees and relics that can put on display. There's 10 new exhibits to collect, along with new decor and a bundle of wallpapers and flooring with a Vampire Survivors theme.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MVfdLuyo9eU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eeefc7982b8b83d3c1b2950eaa74401f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MVfdLuyo9eU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>New trailer for Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown has a rather bald Borg crew member</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-gets-a-first-demo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showed promise from the demo</a> with some rough edges, but the new trailer has me excited about the journey.</p>
<p>But before getting into details…what did they do to Seven of Nine?! Why do they have no hair? Or, do we get to pick an entirely <em>different</em> member of the Borg to join the crew? Quite possible given the nature of the game letting you do all sorts of different paths but I need answers.</p>
<p>Anyway, a new trailer has warped in going over a bunch of "what if" moments and it has definitely renewed my interest in seeing the whole journey through after the demo. It focuses on a specific plot-line in the adventure about gathering data, and the different paths you can take on handling it along with some consequences. I don't want to really spoil anything with details, but a certain Romulan scientist being a crew member was certainly a surprise to see as well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bqYgGynR3iU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/055016df3ad9d49af8803f88f9abf6a0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bqYgGynR3iU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game really does have a great concept, so I'm keen to see what the end result will be once it's finished. The demo at least has a Very Positive overall rating from players on Steam with a lot of the negative reviews pointing out the lack of any voice acting (something that bugged me too).</p>

      <title>Assetto Corsa Rally announced for Early Access in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know there's a few rally fans reading so you might be excited to learn that Assetto Corsa Rally has been announced for Early Access on November 13th.</p>
<p>Coming from publisher 505 Games with <span style="font-size:16px">Supernova Games Studios taking development lead in </span>technical partnership with KUNOS Simulazioni. Coming with a bunch of officially licenses vehicles and tracks, it sounds quite promising.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="U1_7q_gHrTo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e8e0f94c73bf9a3dd5d34c2ba88bf68f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/U1_7q_gHrTo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A bunch of details from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY FOR A TRUE-TO-LIFE SIMULATION</strong></p>
<p>The proprietary physics engine developed by KUNOS Simulazioni has been adapted and refined to realistically simulate the unique dynamics of rally racing, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jumps and uneven surfaces.</li>
<li>Slippery and variable road conditions.</li>
<li>Dynamic weather.</li>
<li>Realistic vehicle behavior across all types of terrain.</li>
</ul>
<p>A key element is the use of <strong>laser scan technology</strong> for every stage in each rally event, enabling <strong>accurate reproduction</strong> of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-world terrain formations.</li>
<li>Road surface irregularities and characteristics.</li>
<li>Details of the surrounding environment like vegetation positioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach – for the first time in the rally sim genre - delivers an unprecedented level of realism, deepening the authenticity of the driving experience.</p>
<p>In parallel, the team at Supernova, leveraging its consolidated experience with Unreal Engine 5, has customized and optimized it to the specific needs of racing games, ensuring high visual fidelity and performance.</p>
<p><strong>CONTENT AND LOCATIONS</strong></p>
<p>At the start of Early Access, Assetto Corsa Rally will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>33km</strong> of fully laserscanned <strong>real life roads</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>4 Special Stages</strong> with <strong>18 variants</strong>, set across gravel roads in <strong>Wales</strong> and tarmac roads in <strong>Alsace</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>10 iconic rally cars</strong>, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>5 game modes, triple screen support</strong>, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete game aims to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over <strong>120 km of faithfully recreated rally stages</strong> using laser scan technology.</li>
<li><strong>10 Special Stages</strong> with over <strong>35 variants</strong> set across <strong>5 international rallies</strong>, with new roads and content added continuously.</li>
<li>A full car roster featuring over <strong>30 vehicles</strong> selected from the most iconic rally cars of the past and present.</li>
<li>New game modes, a <strong>rally school</strong>, a <strong>career mode</strong>, and complete <strong>VR support</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXTREME DETAIL AND IMMERSIVE AUDIO</strong></p>
<p>Each car has been recreated using laser scans and official CAD files, delivering uncompromising accuracy in every component.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced damage system</strong>: combines visual deformations with physical damage that directly impacts vehicle behavior, enhancing realism and challenge.</li>
</ul>
<p>The experience is further elevated by an audio system designed to maximize immersion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentic sound recordings: real-life acceleration, braking, and drifting sounds, captured both inside and outside the cockpit.</li>
<li>Co-driver pacenotes: developed in collaboration with professional co-drivers, featuring their original voices.  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we’ve built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with the support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts.", commented Mauro Notarberardino, Supernova Studio Director, "A special thanks goes to KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series - especially in terms of the driving model - in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can’t wait to share the journey with you."</p>
<p>My main concern is that they've confirmed it will have online multiplayer - so they might pull an EA here and stick in some anti-cheat and break it like we saw with EA SPORTS WRC. I've asked them to clarify any anti-cheat plans.</p>
<p>It will be priced at £24.99 / $29.99 / €29,99 at release. They said this is a "special price" so presumably it will cost more later.</p>

      <title>A famous meme comes to life in This Is Fine: Maximum Cope with a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Memes, you gotta love 'em right? Question Hound from This Is Fine is getting a metroidvania platformer video game with This Is Fine: Maximum Cope. I must admit, this is the first I'm hearing of it, but it actually had a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign back in October last year where around $52,000 in funding was pulled in.</p>
<p>More about it: "Explore the landscapes, beat bosses, unlock abilities, and access new chapters. This is a metroidvania. As you platform your way through each world you’ll encounter enemies, each an embodiment of everyday worries. Through navigation and persistence, you will ultimately face the challenging bosses unique to every area. Defeat them and acquire the abilities needed to progress further (and explore previous areas in more depth)!</p>
<p>Be sure to stop at every burning Rest Point to save, sip coffee, and pretend everything is fine for a brief moment. Collect Coffee Beans as you explore; your currency used to purchase perks and refill your healing coffee cup. Keep your eyes peeled everywhere you go if your heart is set on finding every quirky collectible!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UIsRNqkvDHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a717cc8f591e718cbe42df5e191bfd4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UIsRNqkvDHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a demo available in Steam Next Fest, could be a good laugh. The animation style definitely reminds me of Cuphead.</p>

      <title>Looks like Farlight 84 is now broken on Linux with their latest anti-cheat video calling it out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Farlight 84 is a battle royale hero shooter that now appears to be fully broken on Linux, thanks to updates to their anti-cheat.</p>
<p>The Steam store page still lists it as using Easy Anti-Cheat and it did previously work quite well. However, they've just launched the new "Weaver of Wonders" season and there's reports flowing in about it not working at all.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a few weeks ago on September 25th, they put up a new video going over their anti-cheat work noting they're using "Full Lifecycle Anti-Cheat Protection". Along with that, around 2:17 into the video they begin to talk about the ways people cheat using the likes of emulators and virtual machines. It's here Linux gets a direct mention too, although they don't go into any detail at all on the Linux side of things. But clearly, they saw the ability to play Farlight 84 on Linux as a problem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hdo8vCJU0gw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8007f62bf8a29bf09d70ea57168cf6b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hdo8vCJU0gw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is not the first time Farlight 84 has broken, but it seems like it may be the last time where it stays broken if Linux is a direct target for them like this.</p>
<p>A real shame to see yet another online multiplayer game blocked, because developers see Linux as a platform for cheat developers and just decide to block it as the simple choice. We've seen so many games entirely block Linux now including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/battlefield-6-releases-today-and-it-will-not-be-playable-on-any-linux-steamos-system/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/full-circle-ea-confirm-again-that-skate-will-not-support-linux-steam-deck-or-macos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">skate.</a>, EA Sports FC / Madden and basically any modern EA game. Various games using ACE like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/that-didnt-last-long-blue-protocol-star-resonance-anti-cheat-causing-problems-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/delta-force-devs-say-desktop-linux-support-is-not-part-of-our-agenda-in-the-future/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Delta Force</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/anti-cheat-looks-like-a-no-go-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-for-arena-breakout-infinite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arena Breakout: Infinite</a> and more</p>

      <title>Nightdive release definitive PC update for I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios announced the definitive update for I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream has now landed on PC with Linux support. This brings over a bunch of enhancements done for the console release, making it better for everyone.</p>
<p>More about it: "Based on the post-apocalyptic short story by renowned author Harlan Ellison, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream plunges players deep within the center of the earth, where they play as each of the five survivors who have been trapped in the bowels of the insane AI AM for the past 109 years. Fueled by his intense hatred for the human race, AM has spent the past century torturing and toying with each character as he sees fit, culminating in a final game: an appropriately meta adventure-style quest for each of them, teasing the prospect of freedom if they succeed."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The definitive update adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Added modern menu options</strong>, allowing players to customize their experience as they prefer (screen size adjustments, background image selection, visual filters, aim sensitivity).</li>
<li><strong>Added in-game bonus content</strong>, including a fully localized manual and jukebox with the complete <em>I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream</em> soundtrack.</li>
<li><strong>Improved controller support</strong>, added pre-set shortcuts for smoother and more intuitive gameplay</li>
<li><strong>Added an achievement system</strong> to encourage exploration and extend replayability.</li>
<li><strong>Added cloud saves</strong>, game progress is now stored and linked to the player’s account, allowing the game to continue being played across different devices.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Black Myth: Wukong gets a big performance update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Myth: Wukong might actually now be playable on the Steam Deck, with the latest update out now that focuses on performance. Pretty great to see developer Game Science still working to improve it after release!</p>
<p>What is it? Launched back in August 2024, Black Myth: Wukong is an incredible popular action RPG rooted in Chinese mythology. It has a Very Positive rating on Steam from over 800,000 user reviews. According to <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a>, it is the 13th most popular game of all time on Steam — really impressive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3527039741760634117gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Along with some bug fixes, there's a good few tweaks to the game to improve the performance including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Integrated AMD FSR4. On compatible hardware, it will be available in the in-game Settings after updating the driver and enabling FSR4 in the driver settings.</li>
<li>Improved Compatible Mode. Now, with Compatible Mode enabled, ray tracing, frame generation, and some super-resolution functions will be temporarily disabled to help players avoid game launch failures caused by driver, hardware, or system abnormalities.</li>
<li>Adjusted the default graphics settings for certain graphics cards to match the various graphical changes in the current game version.</li>
<li>Significantly improved the lighting quality when Global Illumination is set to low, making it closer to the effect when Global Illumination is set to high.</li>
<li>Improved CPU and rendering performance in numerous scenarios.</li>
<li>Improved memory usage in numerous scenarios.</li>
<li>Improved the quality of motion blur to mitigate the aliasing issues that occur when the camera pans.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The last update before this was back in April that added in NVIDIA DLSS 4.0 and Intel XeSS 2.0.</p>

<p><strong>New enemy weapons:</strong> Battering rams, trolls can now carry giant pickaxes and blocks for building<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New enemy behaviours:</strong> Enemy behaviour is now classified into different roles (charge, hang back, ambush) and can path around dangerous areas. Engineers can build floors and stairs. Enemies can break through fortifications and raised bridges. They can also dig underground through natural walls. Goblins also bring more kinds of mounts and their demonic leader<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New weapon:</strong> Bolt thrower. This is a siege engine with a fixed location but can be turned freely in any direction. It fires faster than a crossbow and the ammo bin can hold 100 bolts. Siege operator skill matters but unskilled operators can use it more effectively than they use hand-held weapons.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Reworked weapons:</strong> Ballistas and catapults are more effective<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Changes to traps:</strong> Goblins can rescue caged allies. Water and magma traps will not be as effective as before, so you’ll have to try a variety of defensive tools instead of relying just on one, to properly protect your forts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More detail on it will be noted on launch day, but for now you can watch the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5pvlCOF9HfI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b95e2c2272f01412d2ecd22debd00016.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5pvlCOF9HfI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've also teased a little about the future with plans for "more magical content and features, such as warlords and demon-trained sorcerers that could make sieges on your fort even more dangerous and varied". </p>
<p>All sounds great to me. Nice to see it continue to expand with a whole lot more.</p>

      <title>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster is coming to Steam with more upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster originally launched as an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos-remaster-out-now-on-gog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusive to GOG</a>, but that's not going to last with a newer edition announced and a Steam release.</p>
<p>The developer recently revealed that they're doing a new "Croc Legend of the Gobbos Platinum Edition", which they had to tweak due to some PlayStation trophy issue. But, it's also coming with a bunch of other enhancements for everyone along with a Steam release now too.</p>
<p>What's new in this edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new time trial gameplay mode called Time Attack</li>
<li>25+ new additions to the Crocipedia.</li>
<li>The ability to toggle between different Croc Main Theme mixes in the main menu. </li>
<li>A bunch of bug fixes were squashed. Ker-Splat!</li>
<li>A handful of quality-of-life features and improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be a free update if you have it on GOG already.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uxrs4_C3QwM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db84d4d06ffed6af8fedd6766fdae525.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uxrs4_C3QwM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They seem to have messed up on the release dates though. According to the press release it was supposed to launch on Steam on October 13th, with the other platforms today. But the Steam page just notes it's "Coming Soon". So it might be today, it might not. Either way, nice to see it come to Steam too for those that prefer it.</p>

      <title>Open world exploration game Outbound looks super cosy and hit over 1 million Steam wishlists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Outbound looks like a game I need right now, a chilled cosy open-world exploration game about living off-grid and building up your dream minivan.</p>
<p>Seems it's been a popular one too, with it being announced that its hit over 1 million Steam wishlists. And, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> that makes it currently about the 23rd most wishlisted upcoming game on Steam. Nice reminder, since I had missed this one when it was initially announced and now I can't wait to go through it.</p>
<p>More about it: "Outbound is an open-world exploration game set in a utopian near future. Start with an empty camper van and turn it into the home of your dreams - alone or together with your friends. Build and explore at your own pace. Scavenge materials, craft, and build in and on top of your vehicle with modular parts. Advance in technology and efficiently use energy to power your home. Adjust your playstyle to adapt to new landscapes and changing environmental conditions."</p>
<p>Their latest trailer is below, which is for the Alpha testing so keep in mind it's not finished:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s9B9xl_cPA8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63db334493b83ed7a1b1ab168a179c00.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s9B9xl_cPA8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “Hitting one million wishlists is a dream come true,” said Marc Volger, co-founder of Square Glade Games. “Our community has been incredible from day one, and now, with our backers helping us test the game hands-on, we’re one big step closer to creating the cozy road-trip experience everyone’s been waiting for.”</p>
<p>Releasing next year it will be playable solo or in online co-op for up to 4 players.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build Your Dream Van</strong> – Expand, decorate, and personalise your camper to suit your vibe.</li>
<li><strong>Harvest Nature’s Power</strong> – Harness solar, wind, and water energy to fuel your off-grid lifestyle.</li>
<li><strong>Live Sustainably</strong> – Grow your own food, forage, and cook wholesome meals under open skies.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Together</strong> – Set out solo or road-trip with up to four friends in seamless co-op.</li>
<li><strong>Craft and Innovate</strong> – Research, refine, and create the tools to thrive wherever the road takes you.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Surviving Mars: Relaunched arrives November 10 with two expansions planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that Surviving Mars: Relaunched is now set to blast off on November 10th with a discount for owners of the original. Valve have also given it a Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible rating ahead of release. The main issue for the Steam Deck being some text that's too small.</p>
<p>With this re-release you get everything the original had, expansions and all. Plus upgraded visuals, an improved UI, and the all-new Martian Assembly in-game political mechanics, better modding support and various other general improvements to the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cYdb13fqECo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c3b50dd9ce2d268f0380d3b04fa3ad6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cYdb13fqECo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We're also going to see two expansions coming next year - Feeding the Future and Machine Utopia. The first will focus on expanding food and production systems, introducing deeper management options, and meal choices that affect comfort and sanity. The second with Machine Utopia will introduce mechanized labor and massive industrial options to the red planet.</p>
<p>The latest video on the game can be seen below, going over some of the end-game:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZYEqPugZk5s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0bd3a7346edb64b3eb6445f7894ab7f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZYEqPugZk5s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The base price will be $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99 but if you own the original it will be $19.99 / £17.50 / €19.99. They've also announced the pricier Ultimate Edition which comes with an Expansion Pass for the two planned expansions. The Ultimate Edition will be $59.99 / £49.99 / €59.99 or $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99 if you have the original game.</p>
<p>I still love the original but it wasn't without flaws, I'm hopeful this release goes well, at least better than Paradox have been doing with their other games lately. I still feel a little uneasy about re-selling the game with updates, to push even more with expansions again though but it's quite typical of Paradox - they no doubt want the relaunch to be the basis for even more expansions after.</p>

      <title>The Outlast Trials is getting a brutal looking PvP invasion mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Get ready to be terrified all over again, as The Outlast Trials is set to get a major update adding in a spooky and brutal PvP mode. <em>It works great on Linux with Proton and is Steam Deck Verified.</em></p>
<p>Arriving as a free update on October 21st, the game will introduce a special new PvP Invasion Mode. This will allow you to enter the Trials of other players and sabotage them resulting in some pretty brutal looking outcomes for the players caught up in the web of lies. Looks like you'll need a spare pair of pants for this one.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_ukYbwtMdwo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89153c57a6a30ef93063ea5c69853d58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_ukYbwtMdwo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accessed via the Sleep Room Terminals, the new Invasion Mode allows players to join as either a Reagent or an Imposter. Only a limited number of Imposters can invade any given Trial, but while the others wait, they can be the eyes and ears of their murderous teammates. Each Imposter will get a chance to invade the Trial, as their peers succeed in their sabotage…or die trying.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of New PvP Invasion Mode:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Become the Hunter</strong> — Stalk your prey from the shadows, utilizing stealth and subterfuge to sneak up on unsuspecting Reagents before going in for the kill.</li>
<li><strong>Surveil the Trials </strong>— Plan your route and attack strategy by carefully considering surveillance camera footage. Your fellow Imposters</li>
<li><strong>Don a Deadly Disguise</strong> — Dress yourself in the garb and skin of your targets to gain their trust. Then, when the moment’s right…</li>
<li><strong>Stab Them In the Back</strong> — Close-quarters combat is the only rule of engagement. Outwit your opponent with multiple blade strikes or a single, lethal stab attack. One slip up means certain death, ratcheting up the intensity in the high-pressure Trial arenas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There will also be a new time limited event, new challenges and a new in-game store.</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong Patch 4 has a Beta up with a major controller input change</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Cherry certainly are getting these patches out rapidly, they only just launched <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-3-1-0-28891-brings-a-lot-of-fixes-and-dualsense-edge-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patch 3 for Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and now Patch 4 has a Beta.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help for those running the Native Linux version, where controller input has been a bit of a nuisance with multiple issues. The list below is only tentative, as they said the patch is still in progress so more fixes are expected to be added before it goes live for all players.</p>
<p>Here's the current list of changes in Patch 4 Beta (v1.0.28954):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Updated Simplified Chinese translation with a new script for public testing. <strong>This is a basic implementation only,</strong> to be refined and updated based on player feedback.<br/>
- Various localisation fixes implemented across all languages.<br/>
- Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support. This includes rumble features now working for various controllers, and additional controllers being recognised. Some issues may remain. For a full list of supported controllers and features, please visit: <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.14/manual/SupportedDevices.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/<span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6b080406451e05021f124502051b1e1f1812181f0e062b5a455a5f">[email protected]</span>/manual/SupportedDevices.html</a><br/>
- Fixed Styx not giving rosaries when delivering the Queen's Egg.<br/>
- Fixed Druid's Eyes sometimes not equipping correctly when first acquired.<br/>
- Fixed some down attack colliders getting stuck on in rare instances.<br/>
- Fixed several instances of Hornet's plasmified state clearing when not intended (eg Bellway travel).<br/>
- Fixed issues entering the plasmified state when killing a Winged Lifeseed, rather than using the Plasmium Phial.<br/>
- Reduced unintentionally long bind time when using Multibinder with the Shaman crest.<br/>
- Updated Multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots, per community comments.<br/>
- Various smaller tweaks and fixes.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.2.5 released with major bug fix for Intel graphics on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 25.2.5 would normally be just another small point-release bug fix, but in this case it's a little extra special for Intel GPU owners on Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/37498" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">This merge request</a> that was accepted and pulled into Mesa on October 13th from developer Sagar Ghuge actually reverted a previous bit of code, which as turns out was quite problematic for newer Intel GPU owners. There were a fair few bug reports across Age of Wonders 4, Dirt Rally 2.0, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, Assassin's Creed Shadows and so on reporting graphical issues. It took a while to track down, but the issue should now be solved.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the work that went into finding the problem, gaming on Linux with a newer Intel GPU should be a whole lot better. Just look at how bad Age of Wonders 4 was on an Intel Arc B580:</p>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages gets a major performance upgrade for handhelds - now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>id Software just released a major performance update for DOOM: The Dark Ages, making it run a whole lot better on handhelds like the Steam Deck. Thanks to the update it's also now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>This is some really impressive upgrades, and just shows that you can squeeze out playable performance even at the lower end while keeping visuals looking good.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3017860/view/535490230242771018?l=english" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the game will go through auto detection for handhelds, but you can still customize the settings. Plus, settings are now stored per-device too so no messing with other systems you play on.</p>
<p>The update includes general performance improvements specific to handhelds, advanced optimization settings specifically for handhelds, they optimized SFX and VFX specifically for handhelds and there's a new handheld benchmark mode too. From the announcement they noted the expected performance across devices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Performance depends on selected power mode and whether the device is attached to a dedicated power source. Values detailed here assume the device is using the highest power setting in the OS and is not running from battery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck : 720p @ ~30FPS</li>
<li>Z1 Devices : 720p @ ~30FPS (such as ASUS ROG Ally)</li>
<li>Z1E Devices : 1080p @ ~30FPS (such as ASUS ROG Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go)</li>
<li>Z2A Devices : 720p @ ~30FPS (such as XBOX ROG Ally)</li>
<li>Z2E Devices : 1080p @ ~60FPS (such as XBOX ROG Ally X)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13477691421760604943gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On top of that they also said they added QOL input improvements when handhelds are docked to a stand and new controller detection on handhelds for wireless and wired external controllers.</p>
<p>There's also a whole bunch of general fixes and tweaks to the game for all platforms.</p>
<p>I think, realistically, we have the launch of the Xbox ROG Ally handhelds to thank for this sort of update, since Bethesda Softworks is owned by Microsoft they want more games to run smoothly on the Xbox ROG Ally X and especially the lower-end Xbox ROG Ally.</p>

      <title>BALL x PIT is out now and it&#39;s a brick-breaking ball-smashing great time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BALL x PIT from Kenny Sun / Devolver Digital is out now and it's Steam Deck Verified plus it works to perfection on Desktop Linux PCs (Proton 9 tested). <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Taking a healthy dose of inspiration from all the survivor-likes that have appeared since Vampire Survivors, BALL x PIT takes the basic idea of brick-breaking from the likes of Arkanoid and Breakout and turns it into something truly absorbing of your time. Day will turn to night as you play through this one, it really is something else. But it's more than just that, since it throws in its own little version of town-building into the mixture as well. It's like the developer threw some bouncing sticky balls at a wall full of ideas and said yep - I'll take it all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15223496101760548279gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15223496101760548279gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's the story here then? In the brief intro, we're told that the great city has been annihilated by some massive big shiny ball in the sky. What's left is nothing but a deep dark pit. So naturally, you and others decide to venture down into the pit for resources, lost treasures and to fight the rising hordes of monsters.</p>
<p>The basic setup is that you're fighting through a scrolling arena where you're constantly walking up, while the enemy blocks are constantly shuffling down towards you. You're armed though, with a great many balls. These balls can be powered up as you go through a run as you acquire experience orbs from downed enemies to level up, to give you all sorts of fancy effects which can be pretty over the top at times. Magnificent to watch though and just totally zone out with it as your balls tear through all the blocks.</p>
<p>Your balls can be fired manually, or automatically, but either way you're involved — you have to actually aim. You also do need to be constantly on the move in all directions to avoid enemy fire as well. If the enemies get to too close to you or reach the bottom, it's time to say goodbye to your health. If you find it challenging you can slow it down, but you can also speed it up too. <em>It's nice to have options.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1229960651760548786gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1229960651760548786gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just enemies and enemy fire you're running around to dodge for, as you'll also want to catch those balls. If you miss you have to wait until they bounce to the end of the screen and back to you. But, if you catch them, you can throw them again. You can also unlock certain upgrades for your run based on actually catching those special powered balls too, there's quite a lot to think about.</p>
<p>The release trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="18pHUtXzF2w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c5793195add458906516ad3dc50e85a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/18pHUtXzF2w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes it really exciting is seeing all the ball combinations. There's a fusion system which helpfully keeps your rather limited inventory from getting overloaded, where you combine two upgraded balls into one. This is where things start to get a bit wild, because you can make some utterly ludicrous weapons with it. Like one ball that fires a horizontal laser across an entire row when it hits, and also makes them all bleed. Pair that up with a ghost ball that you can fire through a bunch of enemies, that also fires a laser vertically — and it becomes a constant laser death show.</p>
<p>Oh you thought that was it? Wrong. You can also <em>evolve</em> upgraded fused balls into something even <em>more</em> powerful.</p>
<p>There's more still as there's also a number of different characters to unlock to play as. Each of them comes with their own different play-style and starter ball for you to experiment with. This is part of where the grind is though, to unlock more of them by going through each level (which you also have to grind a bit to unlock) to reach certain stages where you can then build some more in your little town to access more characters. All buildings requiring various amounts of different resources you can find during a run, or gather in-between runs but it's a bit <em>slow</em> going on that.</p>
<p>Add to that that each character will individually level up as you play more rounds with them too, there so many features blended into this package to keep you wanting more. It really wants you to play not just one, or two but many more rounds before you finally go to bed.</p>
<p>The result of the mechanics is that it's quite challenging as you progress through it due to the different enemies, their layout and weapons they can fire at you, and the fact that you're constantly moving. Add to that the boss fights as well, which can be ridiculously <em>brutal</em>, especially if your balls aren't the best at fighting that particular boss. This is where I think it fails a bit, because it feels a bit like you're forced into using certain builds. Like the first boss, it can only really be damaged from a hit to the back of it. I had a run where I just could barely touch it at all - it felt like a waste, apart from all the resources I had gathered.</p>
<p>Aside from that one gripe where there's a chance I'm just not quite getting the trick to some of the bosses with the ball bouncing, it's brilliant.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fuse Your Balls: combine over 60 randomised balls to create chaotic, overpowered synergies.</li>
<li>Build New Ballbylon: construct over 70 unique structures to power up, unlock heroes, and expand your empire.</li>
<li>Explore New Realms: battle through deserts, caverns, and forests teeming with bizarre foes and massive bosses.</li>
<li>Recruit Fellow Hunters: team up with treasure-seeking heroes that change the way you play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>BALL x PIT is a truly unique blend of many things that will keep you captive for hours. Easy to get into and an easy recommendation to anyone who loves a fresh spin on a classic with a blend of new ideas.</p>

      <title>Valve add an easy way to see all the bundles a Steam game is in</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of developers like to team up for their games to put them in bundles, so Valve made it easier to see all bundles for each game on Steam.</p>
<p>As long as a game is in 3 or more bundles you'll now see a new link below the last bundle show on a Steam store page. Like the example below of "See all 7 bundles" for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Balatro</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17976059981760538885gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And when you click it, you'll be sent to a whole new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundlelist/2379780/Balatro" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bundle list page</a> to present all the packages that include it. A pretty nice way to see if you can save some monies on various games together, perhaps you might find some more that interest you and end up buying a bundle this way. Steam bundles automatically adjust the price based on what you already have, and this page works the same - it's personal to you.</p>
<p>By default it will sort them by the most popular (by revenue for each bundle). Although you can change it to sort by price, discount, or alphabetical by name.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13605686021760538965gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can also just head direct to a bundle page for any game on Steam if you grab their app ID via: https://store.steampowered.com/bundlelist/*appid*</p>

      <title>Uncle Lee’s Cookbook will bring five episodes of point and click adventuring while you save the universe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Uncle Lee's Cookbook: Five Recipes for Disaster was recently announced that will bring five interesting point and click adventures to Linux / Steam Deck. Relatively Painless Games have teamed up with Dionous Games to bring all of the entries in the Ines &amp; Uncle Lee series into one episodic game. </p>
<p>One of the episodes at least was previously covered on GamingOnLinux back in 2024 with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/save-a-town-from-paranormal-infestation-in-the-point-and-click-adventure-the-founders-of-redacted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The founders of [redacted]</a>. With this brand new bundled edition the developers told me they will be "polishing and revising them, and most importantly by adding voices to the games" and now a demo is available too. They also told me "the game is Linux native and is fully developed on Linux, and this time we also have Steam Deck support with controller input".</p>

      <title>Many developers leave GZDoom due to leader conflicts and fork it into UZDoom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Drama in open source land, as a major conflict has caused many developers to leave GZDoom behind to fork it into <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UZDoom</a>. <em>It seems like going forward most people will end up using UZDoom.</em></p>
<p>What actually happened? In the official <a href="https://dsc.gg/zdoom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a> server that covers ZDoom and related projects, an announcement was put up by a moderator noting "Due to a conflict between GZDoom's lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl, a lot of other developers decided to leave GZDoom and work on a new fork of the engine now known as UZDoom".</p>
<p>They continued to note that "UZDoom is a direct continuation of GZDoom and will inherit all of its features (and add more eventually)" but the point is that it will have "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads'".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14137096721760529660gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Doom Infinite</em></p>
<p>Looking a bit further into it, a <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> on the GZDoom GitHub page titled "Project management" was opened that gave a little more detail noting issues with the lead of GZDoom pushing untested code, using an LLM to write code and hiding "not insignificant changes in commits, which has people worried that you'll randomly rip out features that they rely on". In reply, the project lead simply <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395#issuecomment-3402316482" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> "Feel free to fork the project under a" (yes, that really all they said).</p>
<p>A later <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395#issuecomment-3403606864" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">comment</a> before the bug report was locked points out the specific <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> in GZDoom that was made with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Really a shame when such incredible projects go through issues like this. Hopefully the ZDoom / UZDoom will come out healthier and stronger from this with a more community orientated approach to the code.</p>

      <title>Grab the new demo for Tiny Auto Knights, a pretty chill and fun looking PvP auto battler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Auto Knights is an upcoming release from Mumpitz Games with a demo now available that now has Native Linux support for it. Seems like a nice way to spend a few hours, if auto battling PvP is your thing.</p>
<p>A little more about it for you: "Recruit heroes with unique skills and place them strategically on the field. Merge the same characters to level them up and get access to more powerful skills. Optimize your team and create strong synergies. When the battle starts, your characters will fight automatically and use their skills. Where they are on the battlefield determines the order of attacks and skills. Status effects like armor, poison, or bleeding make the combat even deeper.</p>
<p>Win battles to earn Unlock Tokens! Use these tokens to get new characters and add them to your custom deck. Find unexpected combinations and perfect your strategy. Share your decks with the community and friends ‒ and try out their creations."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j8XpzoXDb1k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a308a767b00f0c6add18df58e3a0f04a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j8XpzoXDb1k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about making it supported directly on Linux the developer noted how "It was running quite okay with Proton before, but I could see performance improvements (more stable FPS and less fan noise) on my very old Laptop (Intel i5-4210U, AMD Radeon R7 M260) running Lubuntu 24.04.3 LTS with the native build".</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Play against teams of other players:</strong> Discover and learn new strategies</li>
<li><strong>No turn timer:</strong> Take as much time as you want</li>
<li><strong>Ranked and Casual mode:</strong> Play competitive or have a relaxing time</li>
<li><strong>Compete in weekly challenges:</strong> Find the strongest build from a curated deck</li>
<li><strong>Find relics:</strong> Get passive bonuses to complement your team</li>
<li><strong>Create custom decks:</strong> Choose from dozens of unique characters</li>
</ul>

      <title>KDE&#39;s 29th anniversary is here and they need your funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE, the free software community that develops the likes of the KDE Plasma desktop, has turned 29 years old and they're doing a fresh fund-raiser. <em>Hard to imagine the Linux space without KDE nowadays isn't it? </em></p>
<p>Just like they did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/kdes-end-of-year-fundraiser-is-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last year</a>, they're doing a years end fundraising effort in the hopes of gathering at least €50,000. Last year the initial goal was €30,000 but they ended up raising around €54,115. Perhaps this year we can beat that? Since launching it has so far raised just €7,209.65 according to the daily updates.</p>
<p>Not sure where I would be in my own Linux journey without KDE and Plasma. No other desktop environment fits me. Plasma isn't perfect, but their attention to the detail and long list of features and customisation really allow me to feel like it's /home.</p>
<p>From the funding page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KDE is on the verge of something big, and the popularity of its free software is on the rise. It’s increasingly being adopted by gamers, artists, professionals, companies, and public institutions. But the costs associated with developing and maintaining that software are also growing.</p>
<p>A core aim of KDE is keeping you in control of your digital life, and we do it by providing high-quality and privacy-conscious free software. But we can only keep doing it by preserving our own financial independence, so that we never become too dependent on any single source of support.</p>
<p>This week is also <a href="https://weee-forum.org/iewd-about/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">International E-Waste Day</a>, and KDE wants a clean planet too! We started the <a href="https://endof10.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">End of 10</a> campaign because big tech corporations continue pushing everyone to chase the new shiny… in the process filling landfills with perfectly functional devices that become terrible sources of pollution when junked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An important ending note there, since Windows 10 support has officially ended. If your PC doesn't support the stricter requirements of Windows 11, Microsoft think you should just buy a new PC. Or, you could install Linux and keep using it for a long time.</p>
<p>Check out the fundraiser on <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the KDE website</a>.</p>
<p>Happy birthday to the KDE community.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Hammerwatch II gets new content and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Hammerwatch II from Crackshell / Team17 just released the first free major update to the rogue-lite action-rpg, along with improving it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What is it? "A rogue-lite action-rpg brimming with randomly generated levels, deep customization, and rich persistent progression. Battle your way through the perilous Dark Citadel, collecting powerful equipment and trinkets that unlock game-changing upgrades and abilities. This unique mix of permanent equipment in the style of action-rpgs along with run defining rewards from its rogue-lite roots results in a compelling experience where you are sure to get something new out of every run, always progressing in some way, with no two runs the same."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights of this update include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Endgame Maps.</li>
<li>Epic Tier Armour Drops.</li>
<li>Improved Steam Deck Support.</li>
<li>French, German, Russian, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese Language Support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Fu6GYfZGfR0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/86650ef6853ea122b5281e4ae41b9a06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Fu6GYfZGfR0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The tweak for the Steam Deck was small, mainly adjusting the resolution but this should now be enough to get the game bumped up from Steam Deck Playable to Steam Deck Verified. The less people have to go diving into settings to get a game to look right, the better the overall experience.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA DLSS support in progress for NVK, the open source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is pretty big and exciting, the open source NVK driver for NVIDIA GPUs is on a path towards getting NVIDIA DLSS support. Announced on their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/froggi.es/post/3m36txfxcb427" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> profile by one of Valve's Linux developers, Autumn Ashton, who has previously done a fair amount of work on the likes of DXVK and VKD3D-Proton (and created D9VK).</p>
<p>Ashton mentioned how it took 3 days but they got DLSS to work on NVK noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After about 3 days of work, I got DLSS to work on NVK (the open source NVIDIA driver in Mesa)!</p>
<p>DLSS is essentially just some launched Cuda kernels, so it was just a matter of implementing the VK_NVX_binary_import and VK_NVX_image_view_handle extensions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With an image noted to be "(Control, 960x540 -&gt; 1920x1080)":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13825309621760519848gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13825309621760519848gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image Credit - Autumn Ashton</em></p>
<p>Further in the Bluesky thread Ashton noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These extensions are used by DXVK and VKD3D-Proton via DXVK-NVAPI to implement DLSS. Although, that alone was not an easy feat because the surface area of Cuda is pretty huge and parsing the cubins is difficult as there's these weirdly packed attributes spread across-multiple sections an ELF where some of the metadata is ordinal-based and some of it is name-based and oh, the ELF is also inside another container of ELFs (elves?).</p>
<p>But once you parse all that out, it's actually not *that* bad.</p>
<p>The surface area is mostly in the parsing of the cubins, the actual dispatch code is tiny! ATM, it only supports DLSS versions that have code compiled for the GPU you are using. If you try and run old DLSS on a new GPU, that won't work currently. PTX-&gt;NIR is much harder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pretty great to see the NVK driver continue to make big improvements. One day perhaps the open source driver might end up being the best way for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux.</p>

      <title>SpaceCraft from Shiro Games has been delayed but a playtest is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SpaceCraft from Shiro Games is easily one of the most exciting looking upcoming games, but we're going to have to wait a bit longer to see it release.</p>
<p>What is it? SpaceCraft is an online space exploration and building game. Explore a vast galaxy of solar systems and planets, mine and craft resources, design and build ships, automate planetary bases and interplanetary logistics, trade and cooperate.</p>
<p>Their original plan for Early Access was to have it out this year, but they've now moved it to a vague Q2 2026. This is due to them wanting to get some proper player feedback on it, which they said is essential to have before a successful Early Access launch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bdd0avB3t-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/875b5d7dc81828ab3e5d50db018f52a2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bdd0avB3t-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the playtest they plan to start sending out invites towards the end of October, with you able to sign up via the Steam page right now. There will be no NDA, so you'll be able to capture footage and talk about it with anyone. They plan to keep on building up the playtest towards Early Access adding in more features as they go.</p>

      <title>Improved Steam Deck support is coming to Satisfactory</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Satisfactory recently had a fresh experimental Beta for testing, which includes improvements to how it works on Valve's Steam Deck. Currently the game has a Steam Deck Playable rating due to issues with the first-time setup and in-game text being small, with this update making progress towards getting it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5837267361760518551gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The EXPERIMENTAL Update v1.1.1.5 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/499459531596630667" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> from October 7th starts by noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello everyone, Today we’re reopening experimental with several changes, but the most important one of them is an optimization we’ve done a refactor of how we handle Spline Collision in-game, so now Conveyor Belts, Pipelines and Hypertubes should only have collision when a player is near them, this should also result in memory optimizations for bigger saves that use a lot of them.</p>
<p>This could potentially have unintended effects in both Singleplayer and Multiplayer/Dedicated Server so we wanted to release this in Experimental first to see if there’s anything we need to address before these changes come to the default version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OPTIMIZATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored Spline Collision
	<ul>
<li>This affects Conveyor Belts, Pipelines and Hypertubes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>BUG FIXES</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed “Let’s see what’s out there” achievement did not work when playing in languages other than English</li>
<li>Fix for a specific crash when loading saves that contain Conveyor Belts built by blueprint auto-connect during 1.1 Experimental when it was not working correctly and have not been resaved since</li>
<li>Fixed null pointer crash when logging discrepancy between picked up items on client and server</li>
</ul>
<strong>STEAM DECK</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed controller support not working with the Server Manager</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Verified support:
	<ul>
<li>First time install now properly supports Steam Deck in-built controls during the first time setup elements (Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime)</li>
<li>Steam Deck built-in controls are now always usable and available even when an External Controller is connected</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is really great to see, so soon once it's in the main public build you'll be able to build on the go hopefully without issues. There's a few games on Steam that do need the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime and give you a UI for it, but they often need the touch screen or emulated mouse / keyboard controls, so nice to see another game make this easier for players on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Inspired by 80s and 90s trash-horror cinema, 3rd person action game HandFoot looks hilarious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HandFoot is an upcoming chaotic 3rd person action game where every gun is also a melee weapon. Inspired by 80s and 90s trash-horror cinema it could be great. The whole setting, style and action in it look completely ridiculous and I really can't wait to try it.</p>
<p>More about it: "HandFoot blends grotesque action, physics-driven combat, and gritty stealth into one chaotic ride.<br/>
Shoot, smash, throw, and improvise with any weapon in your hands. When bullets aren’t enough, slow time and use your surroundings to turn enemies into debris.</p>
<p>But violence isn’t always the answer. Crawl through vents, climb across rooftops, and sneak through the shadows to stalk your targets or avoid detection entirely. Solve light environmental puzzles, uncover clues, and piece together the grim mystery behind the factory’s secrets.</p>
<p>Whether you fight or hide, every move counts — and every mistake leaves a stain."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BL9O-uBf8VY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/959a96d13dcc059c69e68cbc3c97aa70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BL9O-uBf8VY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullet-Time Combat:</strong> Slow down time to unleash cinematic destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Versatility:</strong> Every gun doubles as a melee weapon — shoot, smash, or throw it straight into someone’s skull.</li>
<li><strong>Stealth &amp; Exploration:</strong> Hide, climb, crawl, and sneak through dark industrial zones and twisted environments.</li>
<li><strong>Environmental Puzzles:</strong> Simple but clever challenges that reveal hidden paths and lore.</li>
<li><strong>Grindhouse Aesthetic:</strong> Inspired by 80s–90s trash horror with over-the-top gore, grim humor, and VHS-era attitude.</li>
<li><strong>Physics-Driven Gore:</strong> Dismember enemies, blast apart bodies, and paint the walls with chaos.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steam page notes Linux support as "OS: Linux + Proton", so it appears the developer is doing some sort of testing with playing it in Proton being supported.</p>

      <title>BattleBit Remastered is surprisingly alive - a huge Operation Overhaul update test arrives in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dropping the first bit of proper news on Steam since early 2024 after the release of Battlefield 6 is certainly a choice - BattleBit Remastered is still alive.</p>
<p>If you only followed the game on Steam, you might have thought it was basically dead since there had been no posts since early 2024. I thought so, and a <em>lot</em> of their fans did too. Not everyone visits an official developer website or can keep up with social media.</p>
<p>Now formally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/671860/view/498334899948749334" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam, "Operation Overhaul" is a major update with first testing of it due in November. They've been working on it for the "past year and a half" and it will have "a ton of changes to gameplay, levels, UI, QOL, balancing, graphics, and many other areas". A first teaser video for the update was actually posted to their YouTube channel back in June as well.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://joinbattlebit.com/visual-changes-overhaul/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> buried on their website it notes the game will add the likes of god rays, ambient occlusion, deeper shadows, increased render distance, improved fog and more. Another <a href="https://joinbattlebit.com/new-ambient-lighting/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> talks about the new and improved lighting so it's not so dark.</p>
<p>The brief teaser from June is below if you didn't see it before:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QbggSwxssFU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f343365c22659a65a621c2f544461ae1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QbggSwxssFU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Nice to see it is actually still being worked on. </em></p>
<p>It amazes me every time I see a developer just go silent and work in the background. This actively harms their reputation with it being an Early Access game. Even just posting small progress updates to the Steam page would have been better than the silence we've had for so long. Developers, you have a Steam page with a news section — <strong>use it</strong>.</p>
<p>The time between updates was so long that it was one of the games hit with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-now-warns-on-steam-pages-if-an-early-access-game-hasnt-been-updated-in-a-long-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam changes to put up a warning</a> for games in Early Access that haven't seen anything in a long time.</p>
<p>BattleBit Remastered actually works on Linux / SteamOS + Steam Deck with its Easy Anti-Cheat as noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a>, so it may still be a good solution for those of you wanting large-scale warfare on Linux.</p>

      <title>That didn&#39;t last long - Blue Protocol: Star Resonance anti-cheat causing problems on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance was just updated, as it seems the initial build did <em>not</em> actually have any anti-cheat enabled but now it does.</p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/blue-protocol-star-resonance-is-out-now-and-does-work-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">worked initially</a> apart from a few videos, but an update was released 4 hours ago that currently doesn't have any public announcement from the developer. But, looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/20381043/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> we can see this update actually <em>added</em> in Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). Seems they initially just forgot to even add the anti-cheat. <em>Bit of a woops.</em></p>
<p>On Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) the game now doesn't seem to launch at all with Proton 9, Proton 10 or Proton Experimental. None of them work. However, curiously, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/ge-proton-10-18-brings-fixes-for-wayland-company-of-heroes-2-3-blue-protocol-star-resonance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest GE-Proton 10-20</a> does actually still get the game to launch on Desktop Linux for me. All seems fine for a while and then — crash. The game will just abruptly quit on you. So it's still problematic.</p>
<p>However, it <em>does</em> still run on Steam Deck with SteamOS (tested on my LCD Steam Deck). With Proton 9 it loaded up without issue and so far I've not seen it crash at all like it does repeatedly on Desktop. So it seems <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/blue-protocol-star-resonance-to-be-playable-on-steam-deck-but-probably-not-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our original report</a> with word from the developer is now correct about the compatibility with Desktop Linux not supported at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2786886081760444083gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2786886081760444083gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Blue Protocol: Star Resonance on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>A shame that Linux gamers have to continue to deal with the nuisance that is kernel-level anti-cheat. We can clearly see that Linux will run these games nicely but there's simply no solution in some cases <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/battlefield-6-releases-today-and-it-will-not-be-playable-on-any-linux-steamos-system/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like with Battlefield 6</a>. An ongoing problem that reduces our available multiplayer titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Our anti-cheat page</a> was updated for the change in compatibility.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MicroProse and Terrible Toybox have revealed an October 28th release date for Death by Scrolling which is all about fighting, dying and trying again. More about it: "Between enemy waves, power-ups, and questionable life choices, players will descend into a pixelated spiral of chaos backed by sharp writing, sardonic humor, and an action loop that refuses to let go".</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8GrQcM349mg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd25380fdece451691a831ba07972d1a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8GrQcM349mg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Varied Cast of Characters:</strong> Select from multiple playable characters, each offering distinct abilities and perks to suit your playstyle.</li>
<li><strong>Vertically Scrolling Mayhem:</strong> Constant upward movement means no time to rest—let the fiery bottom of the screen catch you, and it’s game over.</li>
<li><strong>Relentless Pursuit:</strong> The Grim Reaper is always close by—stun, dodge, and outmaneuver, but never kill him!</li>
<li><strong>Loot &amp; Progression:</strong> Collect gold and precious gems to unlock upgrades, power-ups, and abilities from quirky vendors.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus Runs &amp; Side Quests:</strong> Discover extra challenges and side quests at the top of each level for extra rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Monster Mash:</strong> Battle quirky underworld creatures, from hellish pests to demonic bosses, all in a wild vertical sprint.</li>

      <title>LMDE 7 (Linux Mint Debian Edition) released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LMDE 7 (Linux Mint Debian Edition) is out now as the latest from the Mint team based directly on Debian instead of Ubuntu. It's their fallback plan if Ubuntu ever truly goes to shit, making sure Linux Mint could continue on and it's a target for various software they develop to also ensure their stuff works outside Ubuntu.</p>
<p>LMDE 7 is based on Debian 13 Trixie, which originally released back in August and comes with all the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a> from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7893527911760440642gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7893527911760440642gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - LMDE 7</p>
<p>The Linux Mint team didn't really go into any detail on any of their own changes, their release notes gave a one-liner of "Linux Mint 7 comes with updated software and brings refinements and many new features to make your desktop experience more comfortable". Helpful. Mostly, it will be the changes from Debian 13 along with all the updates they made to the Cinnamon desktop for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/linux-mint-22-2-zara-is-officially-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux Mint 22.2</a>.</p>

      <title>Tom Clancy&#39;s Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow gets a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a surprise to see, Ubisoft have revived Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow with a Steam release now available. Now you can actually complete your PC collection of the games available in the Splinter Cell Legacy Collection on Steam as this is the one that was missing (not counting Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Essentials for PSP).</p>
<p>The second game in the series, that was originally released in 2004 and it was pretty much universally praised with high ratings across the board. Nice to see it now able to live on properly again. However, it does require Ubisoft Account / Ubisoft Connect, yes they've stuck that into a 20+ year old game.</p>
<p>At least with Proton 9 tested on Kubuntu Linux, it appears to work just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13648052431760438628gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13648052431760438628gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUSPENSEFUL TECHNOTHRILLER</p>
<p>Play as elite agent Sam Fisher and navigate through high-stakes missions across the globe, from the tense corridors of the American Embassy in East Timor to a high-speed train bound for Nice, France, as you race to thwart a global bio-terror threat.</p>
<p>CUTTING-EDGE STEALTH MECHANICS</p>
<p>Evade, outsmart, and silently neutralize enemies with advanced gadgets and weapons, signature stealth techniques, and strategic takedowns.</p>
<p>REACTIVE ENEMY AI</p>
<p>Be tactical and leverage your environment as you face intelligent foes who react to sound, movement, and light, keeping tension high and every mission unpredictable.</p>
<p>Please note: online features for this game are no longer supported. Multiplayer and co-op modes are no longer functional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also on sale until October 28th with 40% off.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest - October 2025 is now live with a great many demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again, you've got a week to check out a bunch of games having their first or updated demos now in Steam Next Fest - October 2025.</p>
<p>Many demos will only be up for this event, but plenty will keep their demo up longer too. More demos than any one person can handle! The official trailer provided by Valve is below:</p>

<p>I've already been highlighting a number of games with demos so be sure to look at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/demo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our demo tag</a> for previous stuff.

      <title>One of the most promising deck-building roguelikes ever, Moonsigil Atlas gets a big demo upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonsigil Atlas is by far one of the most interesting and promising upcoming games I've played in a while, taking deck-building roguelikes in a fun direction.</p>
<p>Instead of a mana or energy system, you use physical space. Each card you have creates a certain shape to activate and place down, so it's all about making use of the space that's available to piece things together. You can manipulate the shapes of each individual card as you progress and upgrade too, and eventually get some really interesting overpowered combos going thanks to bonuses for overlap and adjacency.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Azqo-cQaaPk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0541d8bfe71ca6e63c865f8fc207f248.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Azqo-cQaaPk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's all about physical space, there's no real right way to play through or build up your deck. It gives you an interesting type of freedom to experiment during a run.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the email sent to GamingOnLinux, here's some of what's included in the big demo upgrade for Steam Next Fest:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Localization - The upcoming Next Fest Demo will be fully playable in Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian (localization is currently work-in-progress and may have minor inaccuracies)</li>
<li>Second Act - A preview of the game's entire second act will be available to all players in the Demo</li>
<li>Forbidden Cards - New rare cards with powerful effects that can be acquired during a run</li>
<li>Artifacts (Items) - Rare and powerful artifacts that grant the player passive abilities that can be acquired during a run</li>
<li>A Ton of New Encounters - Shape Swapping (allows the player to swap the shape between two cards), Card Duplication, and more</li>
<li>Even Better Visuals - We've added a ton of new visual effects, flair, and QOL visual features to the game</li>
<li>Greatly Improved Tutorial - We've rebuilt the tutorial from the ground up to be interactive and spread out over the course of normal gameplay</li>
<li>Additional "Character Mastery" Unlocks - There is more content to be unlocked over time while playing the Demo</li>
<li>Steam Achievements - A selection of Steam achievements from the full game will be available in the demo.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I absolutely adore it. Definitely one you simply have to check out. The demo and full game have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown gets a first demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clearly still a work in progress but a taste of things to come, Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown now has a public demo available. <em>Your crew. Your ship. Your command.</em></p>
<p>What is it? "Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown is a story-driven survival strategy game in which the fate of the iconic starship is in your hands. Take the helm, manage the ship and resources, and make difficult decisions. Will you be able to bring home the ship and its crew?"</p>
<p>The new demo trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Toj1LgFvoUk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b1fc3572ee6d82efb13b29a8f21bfecb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Toj1LgFvoUk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So far in my early testing of it, the game works great in Proton 9 on Linux! However, the developer pretty clearly has a lot of work to do on this one.</p>
<p>The biggest problem for the game is the lack of voice over, there's seemingly none at all. That honestly felt a bit jarring when first going into it, with my brain trying to make up for it by hearing their voices inside my head as I read the subtitles. I think this is going to <em>really</em> work against it. Even if they can't get the original people to do it, some quality voice over would really help bring it to life.</p>
<p>Another surprise is that even though it's a licensed game, the familiar Star Trek music isn't there either. It all sounds a bit hollow and generic. A work in progress of course, so hopefully they'll improve the atmosphere as it goes on. The atmosphere is just severely lacking.</p>
<p>But, thankfully, other than that - it's about how I imagined it would be. A space strategy game blended with elements of a choose your own adventure (and plenty of resource management) with the Star Trek Voyager setting. The planet scanning and exploration side of it actually reminded me just a little of Mass Effect, with perhaps a little XCOM 2 vibes for the ship management but the rest is very much interactive fiction with you making constant choices to progress through it. I think they've done a good job on the interface though, it does feel very Voyager-like.</p>
<p>I do look forward to more of it, as I can certainly appreciate what they're going for here. As an avid Star Trek fan, I can see that there's some serious potential here but they have plenty of work to do on that atmosphere and game feel. Really, the outcome will ultimately rest on exactly what choices you're allowed to make throughout the full game and how wildly it will change things. I'm keen to see.</p>
