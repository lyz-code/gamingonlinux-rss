      <title>Steam Next Fest - June 2024 edition is live with lots and lots of demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Valve has launched Steam Next Fest - June 2024 edition, another big event for you to try plenty of upcoming games and see what sticks for you to add to your wishlist.</p>

      <title>Unpacking and Assault Android Cactus devs announce relaxing musical puzzler Tempopo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tempopo is the next title from Witch Beam, creators of the popular Unpacking and Assault Android Cactus due out sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>Looks like quite a relaxing one, as it seems Witch Beam are sticking to their more casual games following on from Unpacking which was very chilled and quite a departure from the chaos in twin-stick shooter Assault Android Cactus. Here you're dealing with a garden of musical flowers that have been scattered across the sky, and only the magical Tempopo with their unique abilities can rescue them. These creatures are mischievous and uncoordinated by nature, so they'll be relying on your conducting skills to work together to solve the puzzles.</p>
<p>The first trailer, which is a music video masquerading as a trailer, introduces us to "the flow, feel and vibe of Tempopo, where soundscapes act as a heartbeat to synchronise all living elements of the game together while you play". Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XuqjFn9P8No"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30b5a4360fef0a8e1cf351e861efe047.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XuqjFn9P8No" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guide Tempopo through 60 levels, manoeuvring, smashing, blocking, lifting and pushing your way through spatial puzzles across four seasons.</li>
<li>Experience a bright and joyful world that’s permeated with music, where every living element moves in harmony with the musical heartbeat.</li>
<li>Build your own melodic garden with the flowers you rescue throughout the game and enjoy a unique musical performance.</li>
<li>Find your comfort level with an accessible by design approach to input requirements, gameplay modes, and bonus challenge puzzles.</li>
<li>Soundtrack by BAFTA award-winning composer &amp; audio director Jeff van Dyck.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/318840/Tempopo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 hits Early Access on August 14 - I&#39;m going to need a week off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's it, I'm going to need a holiday for this one. Streets of Rogue 2 from Matt Dabrowski and tinyBuild is due to enter Early Access on August 14th.</p>
<p>Here you'll get to experience unprecedented freedom to topple a corrupt president by any means necessary. With a full open-world, you can even just go and chill in the countryside somewhere, or just cause total chaos in various cities. The choice here is yours.</p>
<p>With loads of unusual playable classes including a dirty mob boss, a hardworking farmer, a genius-level hacker, or even a blood-sucking vampire. How about sneaking around as a ninja? Or having the power to conjure up a horde of flesh-eating zombies? It seems to take everything great about the first and just make it a whole lot bigger. Complete with destructible environments and the ability to play in co-op with friends.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer below and you might even spot a little word from a familiar website in it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="giKX3jFF47A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dbc071a339f5eb4df7e24facd934509f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/giKX3jFF47A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You heard me, it really is one of my absolute most wanted games for this year.</p>

      <title>Pinball Spire is a fresh Pinballvania blending multiple genres with classic ball flipping</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pinballvania? That's actually a new one to me, although Pinball Spire is not the first, it sure does look good.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of great looking Pinball games out there, plenty that stick quite closely to being just a jazzed-up version of the game, but not too many actually expand on the basic idea and throw in other genres into the mix like Pinball Spire does.</p>
<p>"Conquer the titular spire as a brave, plucky little pinball called Pip, destined to step into the plunger and explore the inner chambers of a mysterious spire that appeared in their world overnight."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a9ki0eKVk9Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1751726f867cd35de843eec6bfd8e20c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a9ki0eKVk9Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inside the Spire there's a big maze of Pinball games, full of various secrets to unlock and enemies to bump into along with various types of contraptions to interact with. You also have some special abilities, that play a role in getting you through this strange building.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pinballvania, a unique blend of genres, mixing classic video game platforming with arcade pinball games.</li>
<li>Elaborate pinball levels to explore, combining traditional pinball tables with atmospheric dungeons and passageways to explore.</li>
<li>Mana-powered pinball abilities enable unorthodox ways to interact with the environment.</li>
<li>Mystery that actually gets resolved conclusively instead of ending up on a cliffhanger!</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2601940/Pinball_Spire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> which worked great with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>You may want to avoid NVIDIA driver 550 if you&#39;re on a laptop</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you are a laptop user, you may want to avoid driver version 550 because there is a megathread on the NVIDIA forum where users are reporting that this version is making their distributions randomly crash.</p>
<p>Photos from my personal laptop last night after doing some reboots just for fun and testing (Arch Linux 6.9.1-zen + nvidia-dkms 550):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7030580881718014659gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7030580881718014659gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Crash right after decrypting the disk</em></p>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/488447431718014681gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/488447431718014681gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Crash right before trying to load sddm</em></p>
<p>It does not follow a pattern. Sometimes the laptop boots, sometimes it crashes. I would say that in 40% of the times that I've tried to boot it crashed during this week.</p>
<p>The way it happens, you can't say for sure where <code class="inline-code">nvidia</code> module is poking around because sometimes the crash is related to <code class="inline-code">vfs</code> sometimes with <code class="inline-code">rcu_schedule</code>. It happened to me right after decrypting my secondary NVMe, but it also happened right before trying to launch <code class="inline-code">sddm</code> so it is pretty random. Some folks reported it happened during upgrades when <code class="inline-code">udev</code> was triggered, but I didn't have that more catastrophic version of this problem (yet), having to deal with the system running and maybe breaking my initrd or package database.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The available options to mitigate this situation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Revert back to version 545 or 535 with <code class="inline-code">dkms</code></li>
<li>Use the beta version 555. It looks like it is <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/series-550-freezes-laptop/284772/190" rel="noopener" target="_blank">stable enough</a> from the standpoint of this bug.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/series-550-freezes-laptop/284772/181" rel="noopener" target="_blank">following</a> workaround involving disabling <code class="inline-code">udev</code> triggers and setting some kernel command line related to GSP firmware.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

      <title>TUXEDO tease an ARM Snapdragon X Elite Linux notebook is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TUXEDO Computers have teased that they're working on an ARM notebook with a Snapdragon X Elite SoC from Qualcomm. It's not just Microsoft and Apple making an ARM push, Linux users will be able to get in on the fun officially soon too.</p>
<p>The hardware vendor explained in a <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-on-ARM-is-coming.tuxedo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> that they recently presented a prototype of the ARM notebook they're working on at Computex, and they have the specifications of it now finalised. Work is ongoing though, like getting everything ported over and worked on ARM fully.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The specs for their first ARM notebook as teased are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, 12 cores, 20 W TDP (model X1E80100 in the prototype)</li>
<li>14" 16:10 IPS screen at 2560 x 1600</li>
<li>Aluminium body with USB4, HDMI</li>
<li>50Wh battery</li>
<li>32GB LPDDR5X</li>
<li>1x M.2 PCIe Gen 4 SSD slot</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15442724101718013956gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15442724101718013956gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As Qualcomm themselves explained in a <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/blog/2024/05/upstreaming-linux-kernel-support-for-the-snapdragon-x-elite" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> they're working on getting full Linux support all sorted, as they said "It’s been our priority not only to support Linux on our premium-tier SoCs, but to support it pronto". And with the Snapdragon X Elite, they had a patchset ready for the Linux kernel the day after announcement back in October last year.</p>
<p>It should be truly ready hopefully in Linux kernel 6.11.</p>
<p>When it comes to the status of the project at TUXEDO, they said their first prototype is about to be replaced by a second, but they're still in the "alpha" stages. However, they said it's "quite conceivable that an ARM notebook from TUXEDO will be under your Christmas tree in 2024".</p>
<p>Exciting times for hardware!</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All new interface - Our transformational UI redesign is complete! Fully mouseable, fully gamepaddable, and much prettier, but all carefully designed to maintain the essence of what makes Qud Qud. More polish is coming, but everything functional is in.</li>
<li>Support for Steam Cloud saves. Play between PCs or between Steam Deck and PC, at your leisure.</li>
<li>a refresh of the starting town of Joppa, with the same lived-in texture as the rest of the world.</li>

      <title>Gears of War: E-Day announced and it&#39;s coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how much Microsoft's attitude has changed with Xbox Game Studios, they've announced Gears of War: E-Day and it's coming to Steam. I have to admit, of the games Microsoft would announce during their event, I thought titles like this would remain a console exclusive. Happy to be surprised by the game and the Steam release!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Story of E-Day</strong><br/>
Fourteen years before Gears of War, war heroes Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago return home to face a new nightmare: the Locust Horde. These subterranean monsters, grotesque and relentless, erupt from below, laying siege on humanity itself.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>New Foundations</strong><br/>
Built from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5, Gears of War: E-Day delivers unprecedented graphical fidelity.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="12m0bw1W_tk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e1efcb5092ee04d915a422e25ef7e50.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/12m0bw1W_tk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I played through I believe only the first two in the series many years ago, and did very much enjoy them. Given how long it's been, a prequel actually makes sense to bring a whole new audience to it. From the detailed <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, you can expect a similar style to the gameplay of the originals with third-person action as you charge between cover.</p>
<p>“It’s going to feel like a new Gears game, because that’s what it is,” Creative Director Matt Searcy says. “It’s us revisiting the tone and the feeling of what makes Gears great, but we’re tapping into new techniques, new processes, and new technology that’s going to make the gameplay feel better than ever. It’s going to be awesome, a game that feels both truly new, and authentically Gears.” </p>
<p>Thanks <em>again</em> to Valve and their work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, we should be able to experience this on Linux. Given how quickly we've seen Valve get Proton updates out for major releases, I'm excited!</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has a new trailer - still releasing September 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl from Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has a brand new trailer and thankfully no more delays as it's still going to release on September 5th.</p>
<p>"Chornobyl Exclusion Zone has changed dramatically after the second massive explosion in year 2006. Violent mutants, deadly anomalies, warring factions have made the Zone a very tough place to survive. Nevertheless, artifacts of unbelievable value attracted many people called S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, who entered the Zone for their own risk striving to make a fortune out of it or even to find the Truth concealed in the Heart of Chornobyl."</p>
<p>With a huge borderless open-world and a non-linear story, check out the brand new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g6HH5kKLAlw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ffd432d35b5540623f3acd89490b73c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g6HH5kKLAlw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is the part where I confess to you something terrible, that you're going to rinse me in the comments for…I've put all of maybe 20 minutes into the originals. I just…don't get them. Considering how big they were originally, and still are loved by many even now, I guess I'm really missing something here.</p>
<p>With the previous games all having a pretty good <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating, I'm hopeful this next one won't have too many issues. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> has come such a long way that it's easy to get excited about huge games like this just being playable in a click or two on Linux thanks to Valve.</p>
<p>You can pre-purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Age of Mythology: Retold arrives on Steam on September 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Always great to see an RTS classic get revived. Age of Mythology: Retold from publisher Xbox Game Studios will be coming to Steam on September 4th.</p>
<p>From the creators of the award-winning Age of Empires franchise, Age of Mythology: Retold goes beyond history to a mythical age where gods, monsters, and humans collide. As a huge fan of classic RTS games, and someone who actually entirely missed the original (too busy with Age of Empires), I can't wait.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong><u>Call Upon the Gods</u></strong><br/>
Choose your gods from the Greek, Norse, Egyptian, and Atlantean pantheons. Devastate your enemies by summoning powerful lightning storms, earth-shattering quakes, and even the famed Nidhogg dragon. Or call upon nourishing rains and protective Dryads to help your people grow &amp; prosper.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><u>Unleash the Monsters</u></strong><br/>
Unleash Centaurs, Trolls, Mummies, and more. From bejeweled crocodiles who harness the power of the sun to the mighty one-eyed Cyclops, you will command diverse units inspired by the world’s great mythologies.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><u>An Epic Mythological Universe</u></strong><br/>
Embark on multiple campaigns spanning 50-missions that take you across a vast, mythical world: besiege the mighty walls of Troy, battle Giants in the frozen wastes of Midgard, and discover the mysteries of Osiris in the shifting sands of Egypt. Become a hero of myth—or even a god.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><u>Better with Friends</u></strong><br/>
Play with your friends, either head-to-head or against the advanced AI on dozens of randomly generated maps and scenarios for limitless re-playability. *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's available for pre-purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1934680/Age_of_Mythology_Retold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> now. If you own Age of Mythology: Extended Edition on Steam, you also get a discount which is nice to see. They're also doing 7 days Advanced Access for the Premium Edition.</p>
<p>Really nice to see Microsoft doing so many more PC releases, especially on Steam too, making it super-simple to play games like this on Linux thanks to Valve's effort with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages announced for Steam in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know this will excite many of you. DOOM: The Dark Ages has been announced today and it will arrive on Steam in 2025. Get ready for more ripping and tearing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vile forces push a kingdom to the brink. Fangs gnashing, their fury is emboldened by the flames of Hell’s own malevolence. No mortal blade cuts their masses down. No bulwark stays their advance. No army dares match them in the battlefield.</p>
<p>But you will. You are the super weapon primed to destroy evil.</p>
<p>For when Hell is at the gates, the DOOM Slayer answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like I really need to go and play through DOOM Eternal to the finish now. I know, I'm a bit of a late bloomer on the recent DOOM games after only finishing DOOM in the last year. Although, you don't actually have to play the others, since DOOM: The Dark Ages shows off the Slayer's origin and is actually a <em>prequel</em> to the other two modern DOOM games. Oh, and this time you've got some fun toys to play with like the Atlan, a "daunting skyscraper-sized mech capable of toppling Hell’s behemoths with titanic metal fists" and a Mecha Dragon to fly around on too.</p>

<p>Since it will be on Steam, thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> we shouldn't have much trouble playing it, and we know id Software use Vulkan so it's likely it will run really well.</p>
<p>Hell yeah, this looks awesome!</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII arrives in 2025 with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sid Meier's Civilization VII was officially revealed from Firaxis Games and 2K, due to arrive sometime in 2025. Although we don't exactly know much about it just yet.</p>
<p>The official teaser video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pygcgE3a_uY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c7adc504c7ec92083ff16b200977759.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pygcgE3a_uY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the thing that might excite you perhaps: multiple previous games in the series had Native Linux versions, although they were external ports by Aspyr Media. This time around, it appears Linux (and macOS) will be supported once again but it's not entirely clear who is doing the Linux / macOS versions as it wasn't stated.</p>
<p>The press release made it clear <em>multiple</em> times it will be available across "PlayStation®5 (PS5®), PlayStation®4 (PS4®), Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo™ Switch, and PC, Mac and Linux via Steam".</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"For more than 30 years, players from around the world have shared their love and support for Civ," stated Sid Meier, Founder and Director of Creative Development at Firaxis Games. "I'm incredibly excited for Civ fans to see Civilization VII, a game that represents the culmination of three decades of strategy innovation and refinement."</p>
<p>“With more than 70 million copies sold-in and over 1 billion hours played, the Civilization franchise is a crown jewel for 2K," stated David Ismailer, President of 2K Games. “What the team is looking to accomplish with Civilization VII is nothing short of breathtaking, and we're confident that Firaxis Games has another hit on their hands with Civilization VII."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a> that's now live does have both Linux and macOS sections in the system requirements too, but they're noted as "TBD" (to be decided).</p>

      <title>Looks like GPU switching tool optimus-manager isn&#39;t abandoned yet</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we have previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/the-state-of-optimus-manager-explained-by-its-developer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported here</a>, optimus-manager, the GPU manager for laptop setups was going silent because the main developer didn't have the time or resources to keep that project running on <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github</a>. Looks like it's coming back!</p>
<p>After I got notified that a long-standing <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/471#issuecomment-1315628537" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bug</a> I'm participating in related to PCI ID generation missing the Domain ID on Xorg configuration generation was closed as fixed, I've noticed that a bunch of other stale Pull Requests got merged recently too.</p>
<p>Referring back to the main discussion <a href="https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager/issues/543" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thread</a>, "The state of optimus-manager", to my surprise someone nicknamed es20490446e is doing all the hard work to get the software active again and asking people to deliberately tag him on pull requests so he can better handle them because he is not (yet) the owner of the software.</p>
<p>It's nice to have such piece of software back into active state. I've switched back to <a href="https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">envycontrol</a> recently because of optimus-manager being abandoned and crashing a lot on newer kernels but, since this software is more feature rich and also supports some of my VFIO (GPU pass-through) stuff, I would definitively give it a try again when it gets in a better shape again.</p>

      <title>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita&#39;s Rewind announced for 2024</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The original Power Rangers return to fight a robo-reincarnation of the rotten Rita Repulsa in an all-new retro-style beat-'em-up!</p>
<p>Just announced by Digital Eclipse and Hasbro (under a new imprint called "Hasbro Retro Arcade", perhaps suggesting that we'll be seeing more licensed titles in this vein going forward), the game sees new foe Robo-Rita travel back in time to team up with the original Rita Repulsa, in order to bring back plenty of past monsters in an attempt to rewrite history and prevent the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers from ever existing.</p>
<p>As well as side-scrolling brawler action for up to five players (local or online), which is rendered in a 1990s throwback pixel-art style, there are also into-the-screen shooting and driving segments, along with first-person big boss fist fights played from the perspective of the cockpit of the mighty Megazord, all resembling Super Nintendo Entertainment System Mode 7 effects or Sega Super Scaler arcade titles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s7wSPJZPqas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25f002e4436229e7eb8a339280d65f73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s7wSPJZPqas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The reveal-trailer hits all the right retro notes, and shows a little bit of what you can expect, with plenty of recognisable elements for fans of the classic TV-show to spot.</p>
<p>The Power Rangers' new outing has only been announced for Windows, but it should be an ideal fit for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux and the Steam Deck!</p>
<p>From the official description;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In <strong>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</strong>, the team faces off against a robotic reincarnation of the Power Rangers' long-time nemesis. Robo-Rita has conjured a portal to send herself back in time so she can finally vanquish the Power Rangers by forming an alliance with her younger self. Working together, Robo-Rita and Rita Repulsa rewind, rewrite, and remix the past in an attempt to stop the very formation of the Power Rangers, altering the course of history.</em></p>
<p><em>Will the two Ritas and their army of monstrous enemies from across the MMPR timeline finally succeed in destroying the Power Rangers? Or will these teenagers with attitude learn to work together and counter this catastrophic chronological collaboration?</em></p>
<p><em>Players will be able to experience the origins of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers again – for the first time! The past will never be the same…</em></p>
<p><em><u><strong>FEATURES</strong></u></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Classic 90's look and feel with hand-drawn pixel art</em></li>
<li><em>Fan-favorite enemies pulled from different seasons of the hit tv show</em></li>
<li><em>Events and episodes that players remember from the show have been remixed</em></li>
<li><em>Action-packed, 2-D brawler gameplay with arcade-style shooting and driving sequences</em></li>
<li><em>Pilot all of the original Dinozords</em></li>
<li><em>Jump into the cockpit of the legendary Megazord and take down gigantic bosses</em></li>
<li><em>Offline and Online support for up to 5 players</em></li>
<li><em>And lots more!</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind is scheduled for release sometime in 2024, and you can wishlist it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816870/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers_Ritas_Rewind/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal new security issues in their GPU drivers for June 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>So much for preservation, the classic Delta Force games are getting delisted</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A staffer on GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/delisting_all_delta_force_titles_available_in_our_store" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that due to legal reasons, the classic Delta Force series is going to be removed from all storefronts.</p>
<p>Here's what the GOG team said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all, I don’t know what’s wrong with this week, but I have to post another delisting news.<br/>
<br/>
Just now, we’ve received a request that we have to delist all Delta Force titles that are available in our store, due to legal reasons that are beyond our control. Affected titles are:<br/>
<br/>
Delta Force: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force</a><br/>
Delta Force 2: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_2</a><br/>
Delta Force: Land Warrior: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_land_warrior" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_land_warrior</a><br/>
Delta Force: Task Force Dagger: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_task_force_dagger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_task_force_dagger</a><br/>
Delta Force Xtreme: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_xtreme" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_xtreme</a><br/>
Delta Force: Black Hawk Down Platinum Pack: <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_black_hawk_down_platinum_pack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gog.com/game/delta_force_black_hawk_down_platinum_pack</a><br/>
<br/>
The removals will happen today - June 7th, 1 PM UTC.<br/>
<br/>
They will be removed from all storefronts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14262868241717762369gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Delta Force</em></p>
<p>So you have just under an hour from this post until they're gone if you did want to quickly grab them. Delisting means no one can buy them, but they will <em>not</em> vanish from your own library. The notice from GOG does clearly say "all storefronts" so they will presumably vanish from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?franchise=Delta%20Force" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> too.</p>
<p>A shame, this always makes preserving gaming history far more difficult, but that's not to say they won't return at some point in future. </p>
<p>There is a new game coming called Delta Force: Hawk Ops, which will be a free to play shooter. So it will likely have some form of anti-cheat, which means the likelihood of it working on Linux / Steam Deck is pretty slim.</p>

      <title>Fight the devs of Fishards, if you win - it goes open source! Lose and it&#39;s deleted from Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's certainly one way to pull in some eyes isn't it? Fight the developers, get it open source or Fishards will be gone from Steam.</p>
<p>More about it: Combine the intense, skill-shot PVP of Magicka or Battlerite with some wacky 2-legged-fish and you've got yourself Fishards! The unique spell combining mechanic creates a brand new type of PvP​ ​arena​ experience that you have to try with friends!</p>
<p>Posted on the Godot Engine <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/1d85n3z/comment/l73xrqd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, the developers announced a tournament with a twist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We released Fishards a few years ago and sadly it wasn't able to support us developers financially, so we stopped development.</p>
<p>However, instead of letting the game fade into obscurity we have now decided to make the game open source...</p>
<p><strong>IF!</strong></p>
<p>...the Fishards community can beat us in a tournament taking place in a few weeks! (June 29 19:00 CET*)</p>
<p>If we developers win however... <strong>We are deleting Fishards from Steam!!</strong> &gt;:)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>* That's 5PM UTC on June 29th.</em></p>

<p>Will you be taking part? Sounds like a fun little marketing stunt.</p>
<p>You can check it out and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637140/Fishards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">get some practice in on Steam</a>. Join their <a href="https://discord.gg/e2RTjPUGnz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord</a> to sign up.</p>

      <title>Obsidian gave Pillars of Eternity a big patch - Linux and macOS updates being investigated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Obsidian Entertainment have gone back and upgraded the original Pillars of Eternity with a big update, although it's currently only for the Windows version.</p>
<p>In the patch notes they said "This update is currently unavailable for OSX &amp; Linux. We are investigating bringing these platforms up to speed as part of a future patch.". So I'll be keeping an eye out for if / when that happens, shame to see updates delayed though. But for those who can't wait it should work fine in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>They use Unity, which does have both Linux and macOS game export support, so it's likely some kind of middleware is holding up updating those versions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5872943251717756004gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5872943251717756004gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10977266841717756033gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10977266841717756033gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Build up, command and fight with a big walking colony in Trailblazers: Into the March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another one shooting to the top of my wishlist from the Guerilla Collective Showcase is Trailblazers: Into the March, I've not seen a colony-sim strategy game quite like it. Looks like a blending of some ideas from FTL: Faster Than Light, RimWorld and The Wandering Village into something rather unique overall and I need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6529023971717754984gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6529023971717754984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"You are a Trailblazer... the captain of a ‘Landship’—a powerful vessel shaped by undying dedication and boundless dreams. It is your lifeline through 'The March,' a perilous frontier engulfing civilization's remnants. Your mission: blaze a trail in this wilderness and uncover the mystery at its heart.</p>
<p>Trailblazers: Into the March is a roguelite colony-sim that integrates tactical combat with the emotional journey of procedural characters. Before setting off, you will purchase and customize your Landship, recruit crew members with their own backgrounds and skills, trade supplies and materials, and take on contracts. Once you venture into the March, you must manage your crew's daily lives, witness their evolving relationships and stories, and defend your moving home in tactical landship battles as you explore the vast uncharted territories."</p>
<p>Developer Strangers and publisher Joystick Ventures showed off the reveal trailer, and it starts off quite intriguing and then when it gets into the gameplay — just wow.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PXGuzybAmMI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e2cf94f669329eb9eb50adfff67e7ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PXGuzybAmMI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One that should have no problems with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux. I really cannot wait for this. Fantastic idea for a game. Visually looks great too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2671300/Trailblazers_Into_the_March/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Gangster FPS &#39;Fallen Aces&#39; will have you punch a shark in the face</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Punching a shark in the face. Do you expect any less from a game published by New Blood Interactive? Fallen Aces is a FPS crime noir that plays right out of the '90s and looks right out of a comic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7176829341717753230gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7176829341717753230gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A gritty crime noir saga:</strong> spanning three episodes and <strong>dozens</strong> of levels, and featuring fully voiced <strong>hand drawn</strong> comic cutscenes - Fallen Aces tells a <em>real</em> story.</li>
<li><strong>The world is your weapon:</strong> use fists, knives, pipes, bats, trash cans, frying pans, pistols, shotguns, nail guns, spear guns, Tommy guns and more to take back Switchblade City.</li>
<li><strong>Non linear level design:</strong> Choose your path, use <strong>stealth</strong>, go <strong>loud</strong> or <em>try a mixture of both!</em></li>
<li><strong>Hand drawn:</strong> 100% original hand drawn art and animation (No AI) brings the game to life.</li>
<li><strong>Fuggedaboutit!:</strong> Hundreds of lines of <strong>authentic</strong> period era gangster dialogue injects personality into the wide array of people and places in <em>Fallen Aces.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Shown off with a new trailer during Guerilla Collective 2024 Showcase have look:</p>

<p>Announced for Windows, it should work just fine on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> though. It has controller support too, so hopefully it will also work well on Steam Deck. One I very much plan to play, shooting right to the top of my wishlist.</p>

      <title>Pokemon and Stardew Valley blend Ova Magica arrives on July 23rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/with-a-few-days-left-on-the-kickstarter-ova-magica-has-been-an-incredible-success/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter success</a> in early 2021, Ova Magica that blends ideas from Pokemon and Stardew Valley will hit Early Access on July 23rd.</p>
<p>Here you have the usual suspects of features like taking over a farmstead in a quaint little town, plus crafting, fishing and life-sim elements where you make friends and build relationships. But then you also have — the Blobs. Cute and wobbly creatures you hatch from eggs, which you can train up and battle others with.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1299170/announcements/detail/4164219969953720612?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned it's playable with mouse / keyboard or controller and is "Fully playable on the Steam Deck". In the Steam forum when asked about the Linux version for Early Access a developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1299170/eventcomments/4330853789663262665?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_#c4330853789663389242" rel="noopener" target="_blank">replied</a> "We are currently planning for it to include it.".</p>

      <title>GOG will purge your Cloud Saves that hit over 200MB</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/18730340487709-Review-your-Cloud-Saves-to-avoid-loss-of-files?product=gog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> in a new support notice that they're going to impose a hard-limit on your Galaxy Cloud Saves at 200MB, and purge saves from any games that go above it.</p>
<p>This is a <em>per-game</em> limit, so each game on GOG will have 200MB total for Cloud Saves. GOG said any game saves that go over the limit will "be deleted after August 31st, 2024", and so GOG players will need to go and manually check all their save files to ensure no loss of data in the cloud. Of course, those stored locally are fine, it's just a limit on what GOG will store up online for you.</p>
<p>As for why? GOG said: "As the size and number of games increase, so does the demand for Cloud Storage. These limits ensure that all players have access to sufficient and manageable space for their game progress, and that we keep the associated costs under control. By optimizing our storage allocation, we aim to continue providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for everyone."</p>
<p>To be clear though, they won't just nuke the entire thing for each game that hits over 200MB. They said they will "will remove save game files, starting from the oldest and stop when the remaining files fit the allocation limit". So as soon as it gets down to 200MB, they will stop (for each game).</p>
<p>You can check your cloud saves on your <a href="https://www.gog.com/account/cloud-saves/page/1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG Account</a>.</p>
<p>In comparison to Steam, they have no specific hard limit for each game. Some games might have only a few MB, some can go up to multiple GBs. For example in my case Baldur's Gate 3 on Steam is using over 1GB, with nearly 1GB still left for it. While Vampire Survivors is only giving about 4MB, so it's quite dynamic.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer and demo for Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess is an upcoming shoot 'em up inspired by the Strike series of games like Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and Urban Strike and it looks fantastic (and weird).</p>
<p>As a big fan of the classics, putting many hours into the Strike games in the 90s this looks like it was made for me. You don't have to wait long on it either! It's releasing June 21st, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/megacopter-blades-of-the-goddess-releases-in-june-inspired-by-classic-desert-strike/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered previously</a>, and with the release approaching there's not only a demo available on Steam for you to try but there's also a brand shiny new trailer to show it off:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SAWIY_xzhUE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e8050d113f26ec3e611a8c2129f015f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SAWIY_xzhUE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missions: Play a variety of mission types. Seek and destroy missions feature an escalating threat level as you penetrate enemy lines. Rescue missions allow you to save your comrades (choplifter style). Defense missions feature waves of enemies. Boss hunt missions feature a powerful enemy.</li>
<li>Environments: Take the fight to the Reptoids across 4 different biomes and dozens of missions as you look to defeat the Reptoid scum and bring sanity back to the Tri-state area!</li>
<li>Command the Weapons of Mortals: The Megacopter is a machine with huge guns, and an even bigger appetite for blood. Exchange Pizza Tokens at the armory, and unlock more guns, more firepower, and more…well….destruction.</li>
<li>Unlock the Power of AZ-TECH: The Blades of the Goddess demand blood, and blood you will deliver. Through (somewhat willing) Greg sacrifices, you can unlock the powers of the Goddess that lives within Megacopter. Choose the perfect AZ-TECH pairing for your mission loadouts and you’ll be cutting through Reptoids like a knife through butter.</li>
<li>Soundtrack: Original soundtrack by OGRE sound. These amazing retro tracks will get you in the mood to seek and destroy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give it a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228360/Megacopter_Blades_of_the_Goddess/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">try on Steam now</a>. It has Native Linux support!</p>

      <title>Enshrouded gets a major update and Steam Deck optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enshrouded, the big open world survival and crafting game from Keen Games, just had the big Enshrouded: Melodies of the Mire update released. Should be good news for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes a new area called The Blackmire that has new quests, gameplay challenges, new enemies and much more. There's also a big improvement to player progression, with individual multiplayer quests, so you can do them with or without friends while playing online. The game is also about to get a lot more musical too with the introduction of musical instruments, there's a new vanity system to customise your style, permission settings for servers, combat improvements and much more.</p>
<p>The update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CvQNjoc0FkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/295a6257361ccd92ee778d55de13a7d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CvQNjoc0FkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main update highlights video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vhLz6WvusZI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e34cd14f0ad65fed99f1673b6d19e300.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vhLz6WvusZI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it <em>did</em> already work on Steam Deck, the performance in a word - <em>sucked</em>. It was really bad in lots of areas, especially as you explored more and built more, it just wasn't good. Buried right at the bottom of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4176604868930473019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they mentioned "Enshrouded has been further optimized for the Steam Deck." which is great to see. Hopefully we will see more of that to come, but it is in Early Access so it's not finished.</p>
<p>Even if you play on desktop, optimisations for devices like Steam Deck should help improve performance overall.</p>
<p>However, there <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1203620/discussions/2/4336483289192489034/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seems to be an issue</a> on desktop Linux with Mouse+Keyboard input that the developers are now investigating. A workaround posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Enshrouded/comments/1d8wd60/comment/l79j7g0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> might work for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes. Navigate to the game's directory, open your terminal emulator there and run <code class="inline-code">perl -pi -e 's/wine_get_version/frog_get_version/g' ./enshrouded.exe</code> (make sure you have Perl installed).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: the above should be solved in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4182235001955652948?l=english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hotfix</a>.</em></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Honeykrisp is a new conformant Linux Vulkan driver for Apple M1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Apple M1 support on Linux is about to take another leap forwards, with the introduction of the open source Honeykrisp Vulkan driver.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a blog post</a> from developer Alyssa Rosenzweig, this new driver was actually based on the open source NVK (NVIDIA Vulkan) driver from Faith Ekstrand. Showing once again the power of open source, to get a new driver going by re-using code.</p>
<p>From the blog post in Ekstrand's own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All Vulkan drivers in Mesa trace their lineage to the Intel Vulkan driver and started by copying+pasting from it. My hope is that NVK will eventually become the driver that everyone copies and pastes from. To that end, I’m building NVK with all the best practices we’ve developed for Vulkan drivers over the last 7.5 years and trying to keep the code-base clean and well-organized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's exactly what Rosenzweig did, and it only took about a month to get it to the stage where it has reached Vulkan 1.3 conformance as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/vulkan#submission_780" rel="noopener" target="_blank">listed</a> on The Khronos Group website. It's not available for us normies yet, but <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/alyssa/mesa/-/tree/honeykrisp-20240506-2/src/asahi/vulkan?ref_type=heads" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the code</a> is up for developers to look at.</p>
<p>The next stage for the Honeykrisp driver is to hook up everything needed for DXVK and VKD3D-Proton, so then games will work via Wine / Proton on Apple M1 via Honeykrisp on <a href="https://asahilinux.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Asahi Linux</a>.</p>
<p>Awesome to see this!</p>

      <title>NVIDIA release 550.90.07 stable and 555.52.04 Beta drivers for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has release two fresh driver updates for Linux this week. There's a new stable driver, and an update to the Beta series.</p>
<p>The first from yesterday is the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/226938/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.90.07 stable driver</a> with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily disabled the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension on Xwayland to work around a bug that could cause corruption.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause corruption when the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension is used on X.org with PRIME render offloading.</li>
<li>Improved the ability of nvidia-modprobe to detect whether kernel modules are already loaded. This corrects an issue that prevented nvidia-persistenced from setting persistence mode on some systems.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause additional X screens to claim displays that should have been assigned to a prior X screen based on the given X configuration.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when graphics applications requested single-buffered drawables while certain features (such as Vulkan sharpening) are enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to a kernel panic, due to a failure to release a spinlock under some conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition which could lead to crashes when Xid errors occur concurrently on multiple GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With that being a stable driver, everyone should be fine to use it.</p>
<p>And then there's the new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/227247/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">555.52.04 beta driver</a> for today, which follows on from the exciting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-555-42-02-beta-driver-out-bringing-wayland-explicit-sync/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">555.42.02 Beta driver</a> that gave us Wayland explicit sync from May. Here's the latest changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a segmentation fault when running multi-threaded NvFBC applications.</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension on Xwayland to work around a bug that could cause corruption.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause corruption when the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension is used on X.org with PRIME render offloading.</li>

      <title>Steampunk auto-shooter Airships: Lost Flotilla demo expanded - get an exclusive airship</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is steadily building up to be one of my favourites in the auto-shooter bullet-heaven survivor genre. Now there's an expanded demo and I've got a special code for you.</p>
<p>To rewind a moment, what is it? Airships: Lost Flotilla is a steampunk autoshooter where you fight your way through waves of enemies on your way to a safe harbour. Destroy your foes, harvest wreckage and upgrade your ship. There's a crazy variety to the enemies, and some huge boss battles too.</p>
<p>So it's basically Vampire Survivors / Brotato with Airships from developer David Stark who also that the rather excellent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/342560/Airships_Conquer_the_Skies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Airships: Conquer the Skies</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6545818201717596815gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6545818201717596815gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You start off with a basic ship layout, and as you take down enemies and collect the little gems they drop you'll get money to upgrade. This can be adding weapons, general buffs, getting companion ships to help out and loads more. You can load up some pretty amusing combinations and it can get quite challenging.</p>
<p>A brand new expanded demo has arrived bringing with it a brand new map feature with branching paths, making it a whole lot more interesting to play through. This overworld map allows you to pick where you go next with each location having different enemies, different rewards and upgrades and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9170904871717596693gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9170904871717596693gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even better, there's a secret ship you can unlock and I've got the code for you. In the top right of the menu, you'll find a Magic Symbols button. Enter this into it to unlock the Corvette:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2731863451717595896gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The Corvette is hilariously fast and challenging to control and play with. Good fun.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2858150/Airships_Lost_Flotilla/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>From broken parts to broken hearts - mend robots in AI Confidential</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Critical Wit recently revealed AI Confidential, a game where you take on the role of a RoboTechnician employed by AI megacorp where you'll be fixing up all sorts of strange robots as you fix up broken parts to broken hearts.</p>
<p>Given the rise of AI, and robots slowly taking actual jobs, this seems like quite a fitting game for the time. They're made to solve our problems, but it's our job to fix them. A never-ending cycle huh? At least technicians will never be out of a job.</p>
<p>They've released a first trailer which you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LUEqaVVl_9s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a0b3de987285db4d81f63ed295aff07f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LUEqaVVl_9s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>A unique, playful and intuitive emoji-driven dialog system.</li>
<li>An unforgettable cast of purpose-built patients to meet and help.</li>
<li>An array of environments in a solarpunk future to explore.</li>
<li>Classic adventure game inventory puzzles… minus the moon logic.</li>
<li>From hardware repair, to virus removal, assist your patients with invasive aplomb.</li>
<li>Decommission ‘lost causes,’ and return their cores to R&amp;D.</li>
</ul>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Robotic Rehabilitation in Four ‘Simple’ Steps</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <em>The Owner, the Bot, &amp; the Boss</em> (<u>Case Briefing</u>)<br/>
Meet your purpose-built patient to get their perspective. Get marching orders from HQ, and a hot take from the broken bot’s owner.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> <em>Solarpunk Sleuthing</em> (<u>Explore &amp; Investigate</u>)<br/>
Uncover possible causes of malfunctions and misbehavior. Chat with other AI in the area for clues and leads.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> <em>Subjective Solutions</em> (<u>Diagnosis &amp; Treatment</u>)<br/>
Determine a diagnosis, and evaluate a possible treatment... or three. Execute the “best” option, or consider doing something… unsanctioned.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Step 4:</strong> <em>Rocks and Hard Places</em> (<u>Metanarrative Mindfulness</u>)<br/>
What’s best for the patient isn’t always what the customer or your company wants. Your decisions dictate the fates of your patients, relationships... and career.</p>

<p>One of the developers working on it mentioned on <a href="https://g33ks.coffee/@tiesselune/112563387889020114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> how it will have Native Linux support, and is even a first-class citizen when it comes to platform support. Looks to be worth a follow.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2982490/AI_Confidential/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it along on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic has a huge new season coming, and you can replay old seasons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic is by far, one of the best co-op games ever made. Ghost Ship Games are truly showing others how it's done with this upcoming season too. It's rated Steam Deck Playable (and it does work great) and it's pretty much flawless on desktop Linux with Proton. I've played it a lot, and so have plenty of people I know, it's an absolute gem not to be missed out on.</p>
<p>The new update coming with Season 05: Drilling Deeper just got a full preview, and it looks awesome. It includes a new higher difficulty mode, a new Performance Pass to unlock items, new types of missions, a new special event, new enemies like one that cloaks and stalks you, new weapon overclocks, new secondary objectives and more.</p>
<p>Full of new content to play through, take a look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aNCFfpIzZU8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/138af99ddfb99b4ffd46db2de6124d3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aNCFfpIzZU8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Truly showing how they're player-first, they're also adding something else that's exciting with the ability to play through previous seasons. So you'll be able to pick any season you want and activate it to play through it. Other players don't need to be in the same season to join you, and you'll each progress through your own season and gain access to the Performance Pass for that season to play through and unlock various items.</p>
<p>They've also replaced the "Disable Season Content" option with a season simply called Vanilla, which gives you no specific Performance Pass, and a "balanced chance to spawn Events and Warnings from all seasons.". Fantastic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll be able to play through the new season on June 13th.</p>

      <title>Tiny Glade is a gorgeous castle-doodling game that&#39;s real clever to relax with</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Glade from Pounce Light arrives later this year and there's now a demo available. It's worth checking out, if you like games to fully relax with that have no actual goals.</p>
<p>It's really really clever in how it's designed. It's just you and the land, with a whole bunch of tools to scribble all over the screen with various items and watch it all come to life, and eventually build up some big castle. Everything seamlessly connects like fancy Lego and it really is gorgeous.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2-Pmal2UupI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ddff5483acd97ab5c77e9d3a8f042f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2-Pmal2UupI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gridless building chemistry, powered by real-time procedural generation. Draw a path through a building? A door pops up! Widen the path? The door becomes an archway. Raise the building? Columns and beams line up to support it.</li>
<li>The game adorns your builds with detail, making every creation beautiful. It carefully assembles every brick, pebble and plank on-the-fly, adapting to your whim.</li>
<li>Five different glades to build in, each with a unique mood.</li>
<li>A world that feels alive: ivy envelops your buildings, sheep waddle through your paths, sun sets with a dramatic burst of colour and fireflies light up the night.</li>
<li>Every action has an animated undo and redo. There are no wrong answers, and you can always change your mind.</li>
<li>Satisfying sounds and enchanting music. Just what you need to fully relax.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>About the developer: Pounce Light is a tiny Swedish indie studio consisting of two developers, Anastasia Opara and Tomasz Stachowiak. Between the two of them, the founders count over 15 years of industry experience (Embark Studios, Electronic Arts, Creative Assembly). While Tomasz is known in rendering circles, Anastasia has been active in the procedural generation field. With their experiences combined, the company's focus is on creating small, delightful, and visually stunning experiences. Tiny Glade is their debut game, growing out of a passion hobby project.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-6 (and 9-7) brings various upstream changes from Valve&#39;s Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new release of the community-made compatibility layer GE-Proton version 9-6 is here, although nothing too exciting this time as it's pulling in upstream Proton changes from Valve.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what's changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persona 4 Golden video fixes have been re-added.</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git.</li>
<li>upstream proton changes added.</li>
<li>upstream steamclient changes added.</li>
<li>upstream wineopenxr changes added.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changelog can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

<em>Pictured: Persona 4 Golden</em></p>
<p>As a reminder: GE-Proton is a community-built version of Proton, not supported by Valve, that often has fixes Valve can't distribute (sometimes for legal reasons, other times for more QA testing time). You should generally stick with Valve's normal Proton unless you need GE-Proton for specific fixes.</p>

      <title>Vampire Therapist is a unique dark comedy narrative adventure with a great voice cast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Being a Vampire Therapist is not something that's high up on my wishlist of jobs, but it certainly sounds interesting and you can try out the fresh demo now. Created in conjunction with licensed therapists, you'll take on the role of Sam in this intriguing therapy 'em up.</p>
<p>"Vampire Therapist is a narrative adventure in the vein (get it) of What We Do in the Shadows, the horror works of Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and Horrible Histories where you play as a reformed bloodsucker helping other vampires find inner peace.</p>
<p>Take on the role of Sam, a former rootin’, tootin’ Wild West gunslinger who escaped his day-to-day of murder and mayhem and realized, after a hundred years or so, that there’s a whole lot more to unlife than blood, lace, and leather.

      <title>ZOTAC Zone is yet another AMD gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Every hardware vendor seems to want a go at making a handheld, and now its ZOTAC jumping in with the Zone.</p>
<p>Teased during Computex it will come with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U (Zen 4) and AMD Radeon 870M graphics (RDNA 3). It will also come with 2-stage adjustable triggers, hall effect joysticks and triggers, a 1920x1080 7" AMOLED multi-touch 120Hz display, a front-facing camera and even dual trackpads.</p>
<p>Zotac <a href="https://x.com/ZOTAC/status/1797951762500141381" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared</a> some images on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2027732771717503466gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2027732771717503466gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17331566231717503468gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17331566231717503468gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It looks pretty big. And of course, it will come with Windows. So if you want to run it on Linux, you'll need to wait for drivers to be worked on and for the likes of ChimeraOS and Bazzite to get support ready for it.</p>
<p>“Ever since the establishment of the ZOTAC GAMING brand, we have strived to provide an unmatched gaming experience for enthusiasts worldwide,” Said Tony Wong, Chief Executive Officer of ZOTAC. “We have made considerable efforts to raise the bar with our debut handheld, tailor-made with competitive features for all gamers.”</p>
<p>Valve well and truly lit a fire under everyone didn't they with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED? Handheld PCs for gaming are now really becoming a bigger mainstream thing. We also had the silly-named <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/only-three-months-after-the-claw-msi-reveal-the-new-msi-claw-8-ai-gaming-handheld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a> revealed recently too.</p>
<p>The ZOTAC Zone will launch in September priced <a href="https://www.geeknetic.es/Noticia/31877/ZOTAC-nos-ensena-su-GAME-ZONE-en-el-COMPUTEX-lanzamiento-previsto-para-septiembre-por-800-euros.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reportedly</a> around $800. So they're not even remotely trying to compete with the Steam Deck at that price. The price alone may be the biggest issue with it.</p>

      <title>Persist Online is a new MMORPG from the developer of the classic Tibia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After almost 30 years, CipSoft, the veteran multiplayer game developer behind 1997’s Tibia, is back with another MMORPG: Persist Online. It's confirmed that it will support Linux, macOS and Windows - so everyone on PC can get involved in the fun.</p>
<p>There's no current release date yet as they're still building it but they plan various playtests, before an Early Access release and it will be free to play.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sxzgFyMbVg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c10d2c8947d1127ba7675e6447eeb2d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sxzgFyMbVg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The true charm of an MMORPG lies in the diverse interaction possibilities among players and the unpredictable stories that emerge from them. Decades of operating Tibia have continually shown us this," said Benjamin Zuckerer, Lead Product Manager. “It’s why we believe a good multiplayer game can only be created together with the community, and even before the Early Access period, we will regularly organize game tests.”</p>
<p>“Persist Online began as a hobby project and is the brainchild of two long-standing CipSoft employees. We just started developing the game we wanted to play ourselves. The core team now consists of 14 people and has access to all departments and the entire expertise of the company."</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Masses of Players and Zombies:</strong> Join forces with other survivors to keep the zombies at bay and take on mutated bosses in a sprawling open world. In this persistent online world, without instances, hundreds of players can enjoy (and survive) this harsh environment together.</li>
<li><strong>Friends, Foes, and Temporary Allies:</strong> Exercise caution against other players looking for some PvP action, or team up and form guilds to defend strategically important locations, amassing resources quicker. Friendly fire is also engaged, so look out for that, too!</li>
<li><strong>Boomsticks, Frying Pans, and Fishing Nets:</strong> Fend off foes (zombies or other players) with a variety of looted or crafted weapons, which can each be upgraded. Melee the undead with a sturdy frying pan, blast them to smithereens with a powerful shotgun, or put points into the fishing skill on the skill tree and give the fishing net the ability to paralyze enemies.</li>
<li><strong>An Unforgiving Open World:</strong> This world isn’t just big; it’s also big on details. Every building is accessible, and a dynamic day and night cycle can have a genuine impact on gameplay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Roll the dice to attack enemies in Dice &amp; Fold, try the demo now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dice &amp; Fold is another upcoming game from Tinymice Entertainment and Rogue Duck Interactive, who are also involved in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/vertical-building-colony-sim-stellar-settlers-space-base-builder-hits-early-access/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellar Settlers: Space Base Builder</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/neoduel-backpack-monsters-blends-an-inventory-pvp-auto-battler-with-a-monster-fusing-twist/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters</a>.</p>
<p>The developers got in touch to mention Dice &amp; Fold, a turn-based dungeon crawler where your only way of attacking the enemy is by rolling dice. Roll dice to damage enemy cards to FOLD. Inspired by classic Solitaire, in a top-down table and enemies made out of cards, try to beat the dungeon with 20 unique classes. Build your deck, kill monsters.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from Solitaire, Slay the Spire, Vampire Survivors and various classic table-top RPGs. I like the idea of this one, giving off a little <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/dicey-dungeons-reunion-is-a-huge-free-update-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dicey Dungeons</a> vibes too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i7G41z_t8FU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd0902b8f5de986fa78019aec491c436.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i7G41z_t8FU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely worth a look!</p>
<p>The developer also told me via email "All current games and future games we make will also target Linux and be tested on it." which is great to see.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo for Dice &amp; Fold on Steam</a>. It's due out later this year.</p>

      <title>Only three months after the Claw, MSI reveal the new MSI Claw 8 AI+ gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One problem with a few handheld vendors is that they constantly spawn new models, and it seems like MSI are now doing the same with the MSI Claw 8 AI+ gaming handheld.</p>
<p>While most handheld vendors (like Valve with the Steam Deck) go for AMD, MSI with the Claw went for Intel. It didn't go particularly well, with a lot of reviews absolutely slating it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a> pulled no punches and said bluntly "The MSI Claw is an embarrassment".</p>
<p>So what are they doing? Well of course, just three months later they're announcing a whole new model with the MSI Claw 8 AI+ that's powered by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/intel-revealed-more-lunar-lake-processor-details-with-their-new-xe2-graphics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intel's Lunar Lake</a>. Yes, that's <em>really</em> its name. It has AI in the title, because clearly that's how you sell things now, everything <em>needs</em> to somehow mention AI.</p>
<p>From their very short <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Sparks-AI-Frenzy-at-COMPUTEX-2024-Grand-Opening-143713" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MSI proudly introduces the Claw 8 AI+, the world's first gaming handheld powered by Intel® Core™ Ultra processors (codenamed “Lunar Lake”). This revolutionary device boasts an 8-inch FHD display, a Thunderbolt 4-supported USB-C port, enhanced LB/RB button feedback, increased battery capacity, and a lighter charger, making it the most powerful 8-inch gaming handheld on the market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally from their <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Unveils-Next-Gen-AI--Gaming-and-Business---Productivity-Laptops-with-Latest-Processors-at-COMPUTEX-2024-143709" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other</a> press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the next-gen processor's improved energy efficiency, MSI has actively listened to user feedback and upgraded several hardware specifications accordingly, such as adding an additional Thunderbolt 4-supported USB-C port, enhancing the tactile feel of the LB/RB buttons, increasing battery capacity, and replacing the charger with a lighter wall-mounted charger. Claw 8 AI+ is expected to be the most advanced 8-inch gaming handheld in the market. After the official release, a one-month free trial of Xbox Game Pass will be provided, allowing users to enjoy the most popular AAA games of the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't include a price, expected release date or even any pictures of it in the short press note. So not exactly showing too much confidence in it. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-first-look/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a> did snap a few pics of it though:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18179259941717497863gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18179259941717497863gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like most handhelds though, it will still ship with Windows 11. So you'll have to wait until the likes of ChimeraOS and Bazzite get the driver situation sorted if you wanted to test out Linux on it.</p>

      <title>Intel revealed more Lunar Lake processor details with their new Xe2 graphics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel has provided more details on the upcoming Lunar Lake processors, which will come with an impressive sounding bump in graphical power. <em>Set to release sometime in Q3 2024.</em></p>
<p>From what details Intel provided they're claiming "60%" better battery life for these mobile processors in "real-life usages". Impressive if true, but just as exciting is the huge advancement of the graphics side with Xe2 which they claim will bring improved "gaming and graphics performance by 1.5x over the previous generation".</p>
<p>Intel also say you're likely to see "up to 40% lower system-on-chip power compared to the previous generation" as well, which is also mighty impressive there.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's an overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute Tile</strong> – A new compute tile contains the latest-generation Efficient-cores (E-cores) and Performance-cores (P-cores), both of which introduce new microarchitecture enhancements and together bring unprecedented x86 efficiency. Also housed on the compute tile are the new Xe2 graphics processing unit (GPU), neural processing unit (NPU 4) and image processing unit (IPU).
<ul>
<li><strong>Xe2 GPU</strong> – Brings more than 80% more gaming performance and more than five times the AI throughput over the previous generation, delivering more than 60 tera-operations per second (TOPS) New microarchitecture for the display and media engines delivers a best-in-class visual experience.</li>
<li><strong>NPU 4 </strong>– Delivers three times more TOPS over the most recent generation, up to 48 TOPs, to accelerate AI computations with impressively low power.</li>
<li><strong>IPU</strong> – Provides a great camera experience with reduced power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform Controller Tile (PCT) </strong>– The PCT is where security and connectivity are integrated. Security components deliver a robust integrated security solution with built-in security engines designed to establish a solid foundation for system protection. The upgraded connectivity suite integrates Wi-Fi 7.0, Bluetooth 5.4, PCIe Gen5 and PCIe Gen4 ports, and ThunderboltTM 4 ports.</li>
<li><strong>Memory on Package</strong> – Enables fast access to data and reduces latency, decreasing the overall power consumption of the system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The "Memory on Package" is quite a big one there. Basically, they've ditched separate RAM as it will be baked into the package itself directly. So you won't be able to upgrade the RAM, you get what it comes with. Hopefully future designs will make use of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/lpcamm2-upgradeable-ram-for-laptops-sounds-awesome/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the exciting LPCAMM2</a>.</p>

<p>Things are heating up again in the hardware space, with AMD now formally revealing the new Zen 5 Ryzen Processors.</p>

<p>For desktop PCs this will come with the AMD Ryzen 9000 series, along with two new chipsets for socket AM5 that will be AMD X870E and X870 with support for PCIe 5.0, DDR5, USB4, and WIFI7. The new desktop models they revealed are below:</p>

      <title>Kaspersky release a free Virus Removal Tool for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is interesting. Kaspersky have <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/kvrt-for-linux/27662/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released</a> KVRT (Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool), which is free to use to scan your systems for issues.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> an active virus scanner, it <em>doesn't</em> constantly run on your system. Only when you load it and tell it to scan. It also <em>doesn't</em> auto-update, you need to go and download it fresh from their website each time. Still, it's interesting to see such a big name jump into something like this for Linux don't you think? They say it can "detect both malware and adware, as well as legitimate programs that can be used for attacks".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18454173471717414718gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>It may look like a Windows application but that really is on Linux.</em></p>
<p>As they said in their blog post announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern-day cybercriminals aren’t ignoring Linux-based operating systems. Recently, we published a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cve-2024-3094-vulnerability-backdoor/50873/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">series</a> of <a href="https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-1/112354/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posts</a> about <a href="https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-2-social-engineering/112476/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">malicious code</a> in the open source set of utilities XZ Utils, which managed to find its way into several popular Linux builds; wrote about a <a href="https://securelist.com/dinodasrat-linux-implant/112284/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux implant</a> for the DinodasRAT malware — also known as XDealer; and warned about a backdoor in the <a href="https://securelist.com/backdoored-free-download-manager-linux-malware/110465/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trojanized version of Free Download Manager</a>. Despite all this, the myth that Linux is mostly immune to cyberthreats persists: companies rarely devote funds to protecting machines running this operating system. Therefore, we’ve released a dedicated free product that allows you to check Linux computers for modern threats — Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool (KVRT) for Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts on this, and what do you use on your Linux desktop to keep it secure? Maybe it's time to give over some suggestions in the comments on that. </p>

      <title>The SaveTF2 campaign to get Valve to beat the Team Fortress 2 bots has begun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/team-fortress-2-fans-have-launched-a-new-campaign-to-get-valve-to-save-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcing the SaveTF2 campaign recently</a>, today the actual campaign to get Valve to fix up Team Fortress 2 has properly begun.</p>
<p>The petition on their <a href="https://save.tf/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campaign website</a> has now reached over 100,000 signatures, which the organisers say they will forward onto Valve directly to try and get their attention. On top of that, they're asking people today to use the "#SaveTF2" hashtag across social media to highlight the problems. It's already massing a whole lot of <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/SaveTF2?src=hashtag_click&amp;f=live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posts on X</a> (formerly Twitter) about the issues people face trying to play it and has entered X's trending topics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15478980841717410267gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15478980841717410267gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It has been a problem for a few years now, and while Valve has put out various updates, the bots as always fight back. The game appears to be full of not just aimbots, but according to the campaign website the bots also "abuse the in-game text and voice chats to spread the most vile hate speech imaginable, while simultaneously advertising their “bot immunity services” in an attempt to scam the players desperately looking for a solution" and… "They’ve used these same means to dox people’s personal information and broadcast it to the player-base against their will. Bot hosters have even gone so far as to commit actual crimes, such as using AI voice-modifiers to impersonate and slander non-consenting parties, launching persistent DDoS attacks, and have even swatted one of their most ardent critics".</p>
<p>You would think if the problem was that serious, that Valve would have put a bit more developer time on it by now. Although, they are still updating it now and then, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/team-fortress-2-gets-64bit-support-released-plus-vulkan-for-linux-via-dxvk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 64bit update recently</a>.</p>

      <title>Interview with OutOfTheBit on their cinematic platformer Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OutOfTheBit are currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810190/Nanuka_Secret_of_the_Shattering_Moon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon</a>, a cinematic puzzle platformer after previously releasing the positively received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1859580/Full_Void/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Full Void</a>.</p>
<p>Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon looks great! Inspired by the Sicilian landscape, the journey begins on an island that, while initially portrayed as peaceful and picturesque, soon reveals a tale of magical abilities and a looming disaster that players must strive to avert. As the adventure and story progresses, the importance and acceptance of diverse races and beliefs will shine through preciously.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_DYwZOunu_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3d558236216ccc01add917eb195c6a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_DYwZOunu_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I had the chance to catch up with the team to shoot off some questions and here's what they said.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you tell us a little about the inspiration behind Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon?</strong></p>
<p>"We’re all huge fans of the old-school game aesthetic. While Full Void was inspired by games like Flashback and Another World, Nanuka was more of a natural progression in its creation through team brainstorming sessions. That said, we're huge fans of the humor in the Monkey Island games, and Nanuka’s humor has definitely been influenced by those.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tom—one of the artists working on the game along with Leo—is a great fan of cartoons like Tom &amp; Jerry and Looney Tunes. The goofiness of Nanuka has some traits inspired by those classic cartoons, adding a playful element to the game."</p>
<p><strong>Q: So what exactly is a "cinematic puzzle platformer", how would you say it's cinematic and different to other platformers?</strong></p>
<p>"A cinematic puzzle platformer is all about combining the platforming gameplay with a strong narrative and film-like presentation. What makes it cinematic are the custom animations and seamless transitions that create a movie-like experience. The story is intertwined into the scenes and animations, rather than just relying on text or dialogue.</p>
<p>In our games, we focus heavily on custom animations for characters' movements and interactions to bring the story to life. Each transition is designed to keep the player immersed, much like watching a film. This way, players are not just playing a game but experiencing a continuous and engaging story."</p>
<p><strong>Q: What lessons did you learn from your previous release Full Void?</strong></p>
<p>"The biggest lesson we learned from Full Void was the importance of refining our engine to handle the specific needs of a cinematic platformer. We developed a custom file format to store large animations using minimal memory, which was extremely important for achieving the visual quality we wanted without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Another key takeaway came from the experience we gained working together as a team. Developing Full Void helped us build trust and learn how to bring out the best in each other. We now have a great workflow that suits us perfectly, making our development process much smoother, quick and efficient."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Just how difficult is it to get noticed on stores like Steam now as a small team?</strong></p>
<p>"I think it’s difficult for any sized team. Because of the amount of content available, getting noticed on digital stores can be an uphill battle, but we believe that if your game is good it will always find its audience. Wishlisting on stores is incredibly important for all games, but especially indie games. I think Social Media presence and PR also help with getting more eyes on what you’ve created. TikTok seems to be a great tool for getting indie games in the eyes of players, but that in itself is its own art form."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How was your experience releasing on GOG compared with Steam?</strong></p>
<p>"Both platforms are extremely mature and have made releasing on their stores quite an easy task. Steam, with its massive user base and well-established ecosystem, provides significant visibility and community engagement opportunities. Their tools for developers, such as Steamworks, are robust and user-friendly, making it straightforward to manage releases, updates, and community interactions.</p>
<p>GOG, on the other hand, is known for its curated approach and strong focus on DRM-free games, which appeals to a niche but important audience. The process of releasing on GOG feels more personal, with their team providing direct support and feedback throughout the submission process. This can be especially beneficial for indie developers seeking a more tailored experience."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Any thoughts on the repeating mass layoffs in the AAA industry?</strong></p>
<p>"It's a very complex issue. It's been quite disheartening to witness the numerous layoffs and the closure of beloved studios like Tango Gameworks and PlayStation London Studio, among many others. In our opinion, one major factor is that the development costs for AAA games have become so high that it's increasingly difficult for publishers and console vendors to recoup their investments. Additionally, the current generation of consoles has probably not sold as well as hoped. On the upside, there's a resurgence in PC gaming, and the Steam Deck and similar devices are expanding rapidly, benefiting indie games as well. Nintendo is also rumoured to be working on the Switch 2. So, who knows? Things might turn around in the next few years."</p>
<p><strong>Q: With Valve's compatibility tool Proton, how do you feel about continuing Linux support?</strong></p>
<p>"Fair question! Proton is truly amazing and every single Windows-only game we tried so far has worked great on Linux thanks to Proton! Ali, our lead developer, is a big Linux fan and his development setup consists of a PC running Kubuntu. Our games work well with Proton but we prefer making a native port for Linux, that way our games run well on older hardware and are kinder on the battery."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Any thoughts on the Steam Deck? Are you fans?</strong></p>
<p>"The Steam Deck is a fantastic piece of hardware, and it’s been great to see a new kind of handheld come to the market, and bring a different experience comparative to the Switch. We’re fans of gaming, so any piece of hardware or digital storefront that enables gaming to be experienced by more people is never a bad thing. We are looking forward to seeing the evolution of the Steam Deck in future iterations, as well as the Switch 2, and the capabilities of both devices."</p>

      <title>Free planet-colonising strategy game Planet S added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free game Monday! Check out Planet S, a real-time strategy game where your goal is to colonize multiple planets in a solar system to advance your civilization. Originally released back in October 2023, the developer has continued expanding it and they added Native Linux support at the end of May, 2024.</p>
<p>The Linux version came with a big expansion to the game to add in Steam Workshop support! The game may be simple in the presentation, but clearly the gameplay has sucked plenty of people in with a Very Positive rating. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CPhl8S5YTok"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f55f9dd336feef3a5585de48a3f6a93b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CPhl8S5YTok" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Procedural planets</strong> - The world consists of up to 16 procedurally generated planets which you can colonize. A planets type affects things like the appearance, the farm productivity and the kind of resources you can find on it. Every player starts the game with a spaceship and enough materials to colonize their first planet. Uncolonized planets can be claimed by building a spaceport on it. Once you claimed a planet, you can integrate it into your economy!</li>
<li><strong>Build your civilization</strong> - To advance your faction and unlock new buildings you need to attract residents and provide them the goods they require. By gaining more and more residents, you will unlock new production chains which will increase in complexity. At some point, your first planet won't be able to supply you with the resources you need, so you need to expand to other planets.</li>
<li><strong>Choose your path</strong> - While you start your population with workers, you need to make a decision when you advance to the second tier. You can upgrade your residents to the science or military civilization type. You can adjust the direction in an adjacent city center. Your decision will determine your path for the game and set a focus on either a more peacefully or a violent way of playing and winning the game. It may be rational to carefully consider your decision and adapt to the situation you are in.<br/>
Residents of a civilization type generate either science or military research points, which you can invest into research. The two research trees unlock bonuses and unique buildings for the corresponding civilization type. Through that, the game experience will rely heavily on the path you select.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be played solo or even online with up to three friends.</p>

      <title>ASUS reveal the ROG Ally X with more RAM, more storage, larger battery</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ASUS have given their handheld an upgrade with the ROG Ally X now getting a full announcement, along with specifications and a price. <em>Hopefully they actually fixed the SD Card issue this time…</em></p>
<p>While they're still bundling it with Windows 11, I doubt it will be long before the likes of ChimeraOS, Bazzite and others get updates to allow you to easily run Linux on it.</p>
<p>The updated ROG Ally X now ships with a larger 1TB M.2 full 2280 for storage, faster 7500Mhz LPDDR5X RAM bumped up to 24GB, an 80 Wh battery, an additional USB-C port, overhauled internals for better cooling and a revised case design for better ergonomics (it's much more <em>round</em>). They also re-positioned the thumbsticks and gave it new thumbsticks that should last longer, there's a new macro button on the back, a redesigned d-pad and lots of small improvements elsewhere.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21031497591717325490gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21031497591717325490gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Priced at $799 it will be available in July. See more on their <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-x-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">store page</a>.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting, that ASUS have been catching some fire lately for their terrible user support experience, which the excellent Gamers Nexus went over across two videos titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pMrssIrKcY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ASUS Scammed Us</a> and the follow-up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3DwhTc7Z4o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ASUS Says We're "Confused"</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux user share on Steam breaks 2% thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A moment I've no doubt many Linux fans have been waiting to see. The Linux user share on Steam has smashed through the 2% barrier.</p>
<p>Not actually for the first time though, it did initially rise up above 2% in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2013/03/steams-february-stats-are-out-linux-rises-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2013</a>, shortly after the original Steam for Linux release when it left Beta. Part of the reason it had higher numbers at the start, was that Valve added a special Tux item into Team Fortress 2 only on Linux but it <em>quickly</em> dropped in the following months.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the latest info though from the May 2024 survey, Linux has now hit 2.32%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.21% -0.55%</li>
<li>Linux 2.32% +0.42%</li>
<li>macOS 1.47% +0.12%</li>
</ul>
<p>If I have my historical data correct, we haven't seen Linux be over 2% since 2013. Take into account the explosive growth of Steam as a platform and that's quite a lot of people now. Mostly thanks to Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9217214841717320179gol1.png"/></p>
<p>See it over time on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker page</a>.</p>
<p>The Linux distribution breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 45.34% +3.01%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.90% -0.34%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.05% +0.04%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS 64 bit 4.76% -1.37%</li>

      <title>Selaco is now in Early Access - one of the best shooters I&#39;ve played in forever</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is finally here, Selaco from Altered Orbit Studios has now entered Early Access so you can see what absolute insanity they've been able to do with the GZDoom code.</p>
<p>Not a GZDoom "mod" though, this is a proper game. It's also easily one of the absolute best shooters I've played in a long time. I don't say that lightly either. In a time where we have big developers focusing ever-more on photo-realism, Selaco pulls it back to focus a lot more on the gameplay. That said, it still looks damn good though and it absolutely kicks-ass.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nUbF8Ytadx0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f9d495c1130ff6c161a0637adada5e7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nUbF8Ytadx0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's in Early Access and not technically finished, I'm <em>not</em> giving it a full review (yet), more of just general thoughts. Although, the game <em>is</em> as big as some full releases, bigger even. The game right now now has 31 action-packed maps, which the developers say they "consider the entirety of the Base Campaign and covers the majority of the game". The point is, they wanted the Early Access release to be as big as possible and worth the price. Well, it certainly is. They're planning a second chapter before launch, and a third chapter as a free update <em>after</em> launch. So lots to look forward to.</p>
<p>Once you finish what's there, that's not the end, since it's also launching with Steam Workshop support right away. There's also various gameplay modifiers to play through it differently including a much more punishing hardcore mode, with more modifiers planned to be added in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13115295081717079165gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13115295081717079165gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Inspired by F.E.A.R, Half-Life, QUAKE and DOOM it's very clear in the gameplay. From the smart AI that will constantly surprise you and actually react to you, to the level layouts with the coloured key hunting to open doors. Personally, I just can't get over how satisfying it is filling up a room with all the purple goo that oozes out of enemies when you annihilate them with the various 11 weapons you're given. Sliding into enemies to send them flying into a wall, and then filling them with hot lead — it's bloody glorious.</p>
<p>The gunplay as well, gosh, it really hits the spot. The weapons feel like they have some real power to them, and as a more tactical shooter they've clearly put a lot of thought and polish into the actual action, which is consistently completely over the top in every section. You do get brief moments to breathe, but most of the time it's on-rails action where you're dancing around levels filling them up with bodies.</p>
<p>The level of world interactions on show here are constantly impressive too. From simple things like picking up objects and smashing them, turning lights on and off, to turning computers on and just emptying a trash bin because why not, the level of detail is downright silly. Smash through glass windows, flip things over for cover from bullets and turn them to face enemies. Or how about throwing and shooting a fire extinguisher for some smoke cover. There's just so much of everything! It's useful though, and sometimes essential to throw stuff around, so almost everything has meaning.</p>
<p>One of my favourites: opening a pizza box, and eating each <em>individual</em> slice of pizza for some needed HP.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8226233201717072536gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8226233201717072536gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Turns out, you <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1796159506415513691" rel="noopener" target="_blank">might not</a> get as lucky as me on the pizza.</em></p>
<p>Also, please don't tell the janitor, but I flushed a bottle of bleach down a toilet which caused it to overflow with bubbles and eventually completely explode. That was genuinely hilarious. I didn't expect it to actually do anything, especially not flush the bottle down but this was stupidly brilliant, a proper laugh out loud moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10718978651717074353gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10718978651717074353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I wonder how many of these little silly but awesome touches I've missed during my play-through. I might have to go back and play with every little thing just a bit more to see what I can find.</p>
<p>As you play through and progress the enemies will of course get new tricks to combat you. This is done through Invasion Tiers. Now and then it will pop up noting the Tier level has been bumped up where enemies will suddenly have grenades, smoke grenades, deployable shields, personal mobile shields...and more that I won't directly spoil for you. </p>
<p>For those of you who like following the lore, there's plenty of that to uncover. There's no cut-scenes or anything to actually get in the way of the action though. As you progress, and if you actually slow down enough to take a look around, there's a lot of datapads to find that will sprinkle in plenty of paragraphs of what's been going on. Emails between people talking about the world, their issues and strange happenings. A good few fun secrets to find too.</p>
<p>Of course, what's a shooter (and a retro-styled one) without a little platforming? Yes, Selaco has that too. It's probably the only part of the game I didn't overly enjoy, mainly because I don't like 3D platforming really at all in any game that I can remember (especially terrible in the newer DOOM). Although here, thankfully, it's not too annoying. These sections actually add to the experience overall, with you hunting down buttons to activate things. Shout out to the yellow-paint markers, Selaco has a little of that too, but sparingly and they kind-of joke about it in the emails you read.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5981024461717079100gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5981024461717079100gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The list of what Selaco offers you just keeps on growing. There's all the action, the puzzling, and then you even get various safe rooms too which you can use to customize and upgrade weapons, buy ammo and more to come. Although, you don't get to use it properly right away, as you need to find some upgrades for the safe room to then be able to upgrade your weapons. There's a lot of options there too for each individual weapon from fire rate to magazine size, ammo to smash through cracks in walls and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6620505341717079876gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6620505341717079876gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10500449371717155370gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10500449371717155370gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's just so much to talk about when it comes to Selaco, that I really have no idea where to end this. As I went through it the game was just surprise after surprise. The levels themselves are so incredibly detailed and well thought-out, the set-pieces are fantastic to see in action when you having different types of enemies dropping into the map in various ways from blowing doors open, to cutting through the roof to drop down on you and more.</p>
<p>That is one of the interesting things about Selaco, not everything is just a run and gun fight. It is a tactical game. So there will be sections where you need to hunker down a bit, find some cover and potentially a position a friendly turret to help you out. </p>
<p>Main advice here overall: F6 quick-save is your friend, so use it often. Even on the Lieutenant difficulty, which they say is "Medium", lots of it was quite a challenge and I died — a lot. There's three higher main difficulty options after that (and two below) and even one more special difficulty after that's supposed to be quite impossible. So if you love a challenge, you'll get it. Or not, the easier difficulties are just fine for people who aren't quite so good at FPS games.</p>
<p>Considering all the door key and door code hunting you'll be doing, I was a bit worried I might get a bit lost as I do in other similarly-styled shooters. Thankfully, Selaco has a map you can bring up any time. Gameplay continues with the map up though, which means you can walk around with the map up and it shows the direction you're facing as you turn around making it actually pretty easy to find your way around overall. At least I thought so. Downside? Enemies can sneak up on you, so don't keep it up. It also nicely marks the doors, stairs and more for you. It's a pretty good map system overall actually. All that said, I did still manage to get entirely lost a couple of times, as some level layouts are a bit labyrinthine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/993596381717099501gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/993596381717099501gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The good thing about some backtracking though? Finding all those darn secrets. They've sprinkled quite a few across each level, and some of them are genuinely difficult to find, a good few I found entirely by accident by trying different things out in the levels and just trying to access areas I didn't think I could get to. But there's always a way…</p>
<p>I've mentioned how it's a tactical shooter right? So, you can sneak up on people. And I've also mentioned all the object interactions you can do too. When I realised you could pick up a knife from a kitchen, you can bet I carried around that damn thing until I found another enemy to use it on, who just so happened to have their back turned. Great success. I wasn't expecting it to really work, but it was worth the nuisance of carrying it around to test out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11732815711717159249gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11732815711717159249gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Want to know how truly crazy this GZDoom-powered game is? It even has a working train system, for you travel between safe houses across the levels, so you can easily go back and secret-hunt. This isn't some fancy loading screen either, it's a working train that you ride on and watch as you go through the area. Absolute madness. </p>
<p>I haven't even talked about the enemy variety yet. There's I believe 14 unique enemies in the game from your standard foot soldiers, to flying enemies and explosive scary spider-bots that make me jump every time I'm not expecting those damn things. <em>Death to all spider bots. </em>They all work together too, they will attempt to surround you and come up behind you, and some even buff up others to become even more of a nuisance. The AI here is actually really good, much better than various other FPS I've played.</p>
<p>The commentary you get from the soldiers is great too, giving out orders or panicking a little when you start taking them out one by one. I'm hoping (and I imagine they will) keep upgrading the AI to make it even smarter, because they have such an incredible foundation here.</p>
<p>You even get mini-games! There's a space shooter arcade machine! But, by far the best thing in the game? Their Cookie Clicker knock-off called Burger Flipper. The question is, how long before Burger Flipper becomes its own real standalone sci-fi clicker game? Asking the important questions here of course. Clearly…I spent far too long on it and I can feel you judging me already.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4492198031717162505gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4492198031717162505gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For research purposes of course, for work, I needed to see how far I could push Burger Flipper. <em>Sure did make me hungry.</em></p>
<p>Some nice customisation of the UI is available too. If you prefer to have it as if you're actually in the special suit, you can keep the visor UI on, but you can turn it off so it entirely fills your screen without the borders. You can go further, and also remove most of the UI too. You can also adjust HUD screen-shake, change the display scale to be bigger or smaller (nice touch), move the HUD closer to the middle of the screen and so on. They seem to have thought of almost everything putting a lot of other developers to shame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18021003901717080720gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18021003901717080720gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15790946661717080721gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15790946661717080721gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>First shot default, second shot HUD Visor Opacity set to zero.</em></p>
<p>Whoever did the music and atmospheric sounds as well deserves a chef's kiss. It really helps get the blood flowing and fits in beautifully with the setting and design of the game. And in other sections, it helps keep the tension, especially when things often get dark, it can be a little on the spooky side. Especially so when enemies appear you're not expecting, it made me jump a good few times. Some elements of the soundtrack even sound a bit Blade Runner. Wonderful.</p>
<p>Performance for me hasn't been an issue either. On my admittedly pretty powerful Kubuntu 24.04 system with an AMD Ryzen 5800X and AMD Radeon 6800XT at 1440p with mostly maximum settings, along with turning on the <em>extra</em> settings of Permanent Destruction and Flashlight Shadows, it's been almost always above 100FPS apart from some loading-blips. Somehow they also squeezed all of it into a 1.1GB package, madness.</p>
<p>The current plan is to leave Early Access in 2026. However, they have big ideas to keep expanding the game, and no doubt there will be a lot of player feedback, and due to the modding support they will likely make lots of tweaks and upgrades there so it may take longer. The point they're making is they're in no rush, and it's quite feature and content-filled already.</p>
<p>If you're after a retro-inspired shooter that seems to just have a bit of everything, right now Selaco is your best bet, it feels like a game from another time. Selaco has a lot of the charm I feel has been lost by all the modern-generation shooters and is a ridiculously easy recommendation. Selaco is so much fun to blast through! Perhaps my top release of 2024.</p>
<p>Selaco has Native Linux support and is playable on Steam Deck but no rating from Valve yet.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy Selaco on Steam</a> priced at $24.99 / €24.50 / £20.99. There's also a 10% discount for two weeks.</p>

      <title>HoMM-like sci-fi strategy game Silence of the Siren has a new demo and release date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by classics like Heroes of Might and Magic, developers Oxymoron Games (Project Hospital) have revealed their sci-fi strategy game Silence of the Siren has a fresh upgraded demo and release date. It will have full Native Linux support, which the demo already has ready for you to test.</p>
<p>The new plan is to release into Early Access on September 30th. The developer told me the updated demo has "a new map with a bit of story-driven gameplay, a new orbital layer and the usual dose of base building, exploration and tactical battles".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10330283831717151608gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10330283831717151608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<p>Silence of the Siren is a turn-based strategy game in which you will be thrown into a chaotic universe where several space-faring civilizations are fighting over control of a distant star system and trying to discover its dark history. Explore different planets, gather resources to expand your bases, raise an army and defeat your opponents!</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a rich sci-fi world and discover secrets of a lost civilization.</li>
<li>Collect powerful artifacts, secure important resources, upgrade your bases, hire different units and build useful structures on the world map.</li>
<li>Level-up your commanders and crush your opponents in exciting turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Take control over several different species and factions.</li>
<li>Old-school strategy game with modern controls and intuitive UI.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The developer sent over a key, so I'll be taking a proper look for the release.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UDbUioVa84Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/961cce74eb908d1ed67bdb3158cb8f74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UDbUioVa84Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it has Native Linux support and looks good on desktop PCs, it's not quite ready for Steam Deck just yet. The developer mentioned it's already playable but they plan to improve things like different text sizes. The Steam Deck improvements may not be ready for Early Access but it will get there eventually.</p>

      <title>Gourdlets is a chilled sandbox game about building towns for cute vegetable folks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo available now and a release window revealed for sometime this Summer, Gourdlets looks like a really sweet and chilled game to try out with Linux support. It's another game built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a> too!</p>
<p>So what actually is it? An easygoing sandbox game about building towns for "cute vegetable folks". There's no objective here, you just build up a town and see what all the little veggie people get up to. It's all about "just good vibes" the developer said. There's a huge amount of customization on offer from outside to inside buildings, to arrange furniture exactly how you want. The Gourdlets will then make themselves at home and go fishing, read, go camping, farming and whatever else.</p>
<p>They're not quite ready to reveal the full release date yet, but it's getting close now. Thanks to the demo being up for the Cozy &amp; Family Friendly Steam event, along with the upcoming Steam Next Fest, you can now dive in too and the new demo has a lot of fresh content included. The developer mentioned they will probably expand the demo again for Next Fest.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mBYfv-hcxZU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5dc6e6e66f3930e724b46ffd718ed5f0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mBYfv-hcxZU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has controller support too, so perhaps another sweet one to take on the go on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2013730/Gourdlets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Cozy gardening slice-of-life sim The Garden Path arrives July 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 will have couch co-op, cross-play and cross-progression</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know there's quite a lot of Path of Exile fans here, especially as it works so well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux PCs and Steam Deck. Sounds like Path of Exile 2 is going to be a whole lot better too.</p>
<p>Announced during the Playstation State of Play Showcase, there's a whole lot of goodies coming to the next-generation free to play action RPG from Grinding Gear Games. Some of the big announcements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Couch Co-op Mode</strong> - Players no longer need multiple devices to play the game with their friends. A new feature, couch co-op, is available on all supported platforms and requires two controllers to play. Players can play collaboratively on a single account, or log in with two separate Path of Exile accounts on the same PC or console.</p>
<p><strong>Redefined Controller Experience</strong> - Path of Exile 2 has a ground up redesign of its user experience for controllers. Dual Stick controls, a new binding system allowing you to fully customize your control scheme with 24 bind slots and a redesign of inventory management make the game much easier to pick up and play. In addition, each skill has received specific attention from a new dedicated console team to make sure that it plays well on a controller.</p>
<p><strong>Easier to Play</strong> - Path of Exile is a game with a reputation for complexity, but Path of Exile 2 makes it much easier for new players to explore and understand the deep mechanics of the game. As well as simplifying many mechanics, in-game skill tutorial videos explain how skills work and how to use them in combat, a new help system added to item hovers allows players to find out exactly how stats work at the push of a button, and a new system to allow players to see the exact effects that any choice would have on their characters makes understanding the game much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-play, Cross-progression, Simultaneous Launches</strong> - Path of Exile 2 is introducing full cross-play and cross-progression on all supported platforms. Play with your friends on other platforms, or move from console to PC without losing any progress. The launch as well as all updates in the future will be shipping simultaneously with PC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering how well the first game works in Proton, I am hopeful this will too.</p>

<em>Pictured - Black Desert</em></p>
<p>Currently the post on GitHub has no replies, so I imagine most people missed the Release Candidate as well. So now you've got a weekend of testing ahead of you.</p>
<p>How to test?</p>
<p>Look for Proton 9.0 in your Steam Library, go into the Properties -&gt; Betas and select release-candidate from the drop-down box.</p>

      <title>God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn coming to Steam, requires PlayStation Network Account</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Both God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn are coming to Steam finally, but they will annoyingly require a PlayStation Network Account despite being single-player games.</p>
<p>This means players in various regions where the PSN is not supported will <em>not</em> be able to purchase and play either of them, just like the issue with Helldivers 2 and Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT.</p>
<p>Sony <em>haven't</em> said specifically if either of them will have that fancy new PlayStation Overlay like Tsushima has, as their Steam pages only mention the PSN account requirement, which <em>may</em> be good news for Steam Deck / Linux players since the new PlayStation Overlay is not supported in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> yet. For comparison, the Tsushima store page <em>does</em> clearly note it uses the PlayStation Overlay.</p>
<p>Valve didn't reply to my previous email asking about Proton and the PlayStation Overlay, so we'll just have to wait and see if Sony add it to these games and if Proton will ever support it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a></strong> arrives on September 19th.</p>
<p>Ragnarök will come with NVIDIA RTX Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) 3.7, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 3.1 and Intel XeSS (Xe Super Sampling) 1.2. It will also support NVIDIA Reflex, proper ultra-wide resolutions, various controls customization, unlocked framerates and it will also include the God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla DLC in the purchase for no extra cost.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20449078581717142282gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20449078581717142282gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Until Dawn</a></strong> has no specific release date yet but it will be this year.</p>
<p>This one should be interesting, as the developers say it's actually being re-built in Unreal Engine 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until Dawn has been rebuilt with the latest tools and techniques. New and improved animations build on the success of the original character performances. Characters, environments and VFX have been upgraded – all for a truly enhanced cinematic horror experience.</p>
<p>We use a broader cinematic tonal colour palette and new perspectives to make the story more nuanced and emotional. We’ve been brave enough to shine a light into the dark, unseen corners of Blackwood Mountain and added a third-person camera, which means you can now look behind the curtain of the original game, exploring enhanced and new locations with new interactions and collectables.</p>
<p>Incorporating a third-person camera and adding contextual character movement animations, the game now allows the player to really feel the experience of that fateful night.</p>
<p>Until Dawn’s sound has undergone a massive overhaul too, featuring a new score from legendary horror composer Mark Korven.</p>
<p>We’ve endeavoured to keep the fantastic narrative integratory of the original, but we have seized the opportunity to expand upon unexplored emotional parts of the story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12968345071717142502gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12968345071717142502gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Both of their trailers are age-gated on YouTube, so no including them here.</p>

      <title>Rack and Slay answers the question of &#34;what if a dungeon crawler was like billiards&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Answering the question you didn't think to ask, Rack and Slay has shown up to show you what happens when you combine a dungeon crawler with something resembling billiards and pool. It's as odd as it sounds but it works. <u>Note</u>: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Rack and Slay is all about the fun of creating ridiculous builds. Here you control a billiard ball, and you have to knock all the other balls into the holes (or traps and spikes). Each level is randomly generated full of monster balls, traps, collectibles, power-ups and more. It's another small, bite-sized coffee break game that's cheap and easy to get into, while providing hours upon hours of game time for whenever you feel like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yq5msXmcTe4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85271d3f788165d8e2e76dc1aa287f3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yq5msXmcTe4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly a pretty unique idea. Here your ball can be hurt by traps, or by potting yourself into a hole, and your health is taken down for every remaining monster ball after you've used up your total allowed shots per level, so you have to sink as many of those balls into the holes as you can. No timers though, it's all very relaxed for you to line up that perfect shot.</p>
<p>There's a lot of different enemy balls including sticky balls that decrease your power if you touch them directly, balls that shoot themselves towards you after every turn, balls that shoot other balls at you, some will blind you so you can't tell where you'll end up, others just explode on you and the list goes on. It's all about figuring out how to deal with them all.</p>
<p>After each level you get to upgrade from over 100 items, some with huge game-changing effects that can stack up to create something truly ridiculous. The game will start off simple and slow, which is why some players may bounce off it, but if you stick with it Rack and Slay soon gets pretty nuts as you build up. Items can include: not setting off traps, shooting out extra balls when you take a shot, a longer movement prediction line, gold that spawns after each hit, increased item pickup range, throw out a bunch of bombs around you and the list goes on and on. There's a seriously big variety to what you can load up onto your ball and since they stack, it just gets insane.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20088645391717085025gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20088645391717085025gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The interface really reminds me of Slay the Spire, and just like it, the game explains everything quite nicely. You can hover over everything for details, so you're never really in the dark about what everything does. Still, you have to discover as you go and there's numerous little surprises.</p>
<p>As you play and level up, you unlock more items for the shop too, but because it's such a casual game, there's a button simply to unlock everything if you prefer to have nothing gated by progression, but some of the later items are more complex.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7788849181717085905gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7788849181717085905gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>111 game-changing items, with 50+ of them unlockable through playing any mode you like (and yes, in good Slice &amp; Dice tradition there is an "unlock all" option).</li>
<li>20 difficulty levels to unlock in packs (no need to go 1-by-1 if you're that good).</li>
<li>The full 10-level Crawl Mode for your good old ~30-minute roguelike runs.</li>
<li>The shorter Delve Mode with half the levels, but double the item drafts.</li>
<li>The one-level Raid Mode with random items for a quick burst of mayhem.</li>
<li>Daily Mode featuring a unique set of game-changing run modifiers every day.</li>
<li>Wild Mode for random (and sometimes extra crazy) sets of modifiers.</li>
<li>A set of Challenge Runs featuring pre-defined gameplay variants that will often drastically change the way you play the game.</li>
<li>A full Item Compendium to track your unlocks and collect badges for the highest difficulty you beat using each item.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does basically everything it sets out to do, it doesn't need anything more than it already has, it's a great example of a small and complete game that can hook you right in. It is quickly becoming one of my most played coffee-break games on Steam and I think you'll enjoy it. Gets an easy thumbs-up from me for the fun idea, along with the nice and relaxing but engaging (and at times quite challenging) gameplay.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2311990/Rack_and_Slay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating currently.</p>

<p>CONSCRIPT from Jordan Mochi/ Catchweight Studio and publisher Team17 is a promising looking first world war survival-horror that was crowdfunded back in 2020. Now the developer has cancelled the planned Linux and macOS versions.</p>
<p>"CONSCRIPT is an upcoming survival horror game inspired by classics of the genre - set in 1916 during the Great War. CONSCRIPT will blend all the punishing mechanics of older horror games into a cohesive, tense, and unique experience. In CONSCRIPT, you play as a French soldier searching for his missing-in-action brother during the Battle of Verdun. Will you be able to search twisted trenches, navigate overrun forts, and cross no-mans-land to find him, and ensure a home goes unbroken?"</p>
<p>Since getting a press email about a new demo arriving, and remembering following this along during the Kickstarter, I shot off a message to their PR team a few days ago, and today they got back in touch and the developer has now also published a post directly on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/562623591/conscript-ww1-survival-horror/posts/4112739" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> where they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Linux and Mac Notice</strong></p>
<p>Linux and Mac versions were part of the original Kickstarter campaign, and unfortunately I have to announce that these two platforms will no longer be natively supported. Back during the Kickstarter campaign in 2020 I naively promised things that I had never done before and so I did not realize how much work they were for so little trade off. For me to support these versions, I would likely lose money because the user base is just not there (both of these platforms account for roughly 0.6% of all my Steam wishlists).</p>
<p>Massive apologies for this cancellation, although I hope the announcement of the game on all these other platforms at least softens the blow a little bit.</p>
<p>If you were an original Kickstarter backer who was expecting a Mac or Linux version, feel free to reach out to me via Kickstarter DM and I can organize a refund for you out of pocket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wording is a bit odd there with the developer saying it will be "out of pocket". Well, people gave <em>their</em> money to the project for something it's <em>not</em> doing now. So it's only natural to return it. Kickstarter though is very much a gamble on if you like the idea enough.</p>
<p>Sad to see for backers of the project, much like what we saw with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nightdive-studios-confirm-linux-and-macos-ports-of-system-shock-are-cancelled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nightdive Studios remaked of System Shock</a> doing the same. We also saw the developer of Blazerush <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/racing-game-blazerush-ends-support-for-linux-macos-and-steamvr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently announce</a> their ending of Linux and macOS support too. Once again, for macOS it's a <em>bigger</em> loss, since they get nothing, but at least for Linux players (and Steam Deck) it should <em>hopefully</em> be playable with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Framework Laptop 13 gets Intel Core Ultra with a 120 Hz display, and cheaper AMD models</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework, the popular maker of customizable, modular and upgradable laptops has announced a big upgrade for the Framework Laptop 13 across both Intel and AMD models.</p>
<p>The newest version of Framework Laptop 13 comes with the latest Intel Core Ultra Series 1 processors, an optional 13.5" 2880x1920 120 Hz display on both Intel and AMD systems, a new webcam with 9.2MP image sensor, and configurations designed for businesses and professionals with a 3-year warranty.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are open now with shipping starting in August for all 14 countries they're currently in, and they're launching in Sweden, Finland, and Denmark this June.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2671558901717069128gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On top of that the AMD Ryzen 7040 Series Framework Laptop 13 has seen a permanent price reduction, and it also has the new 2.8k display and webcam along with the high-capacity 61Wh battery.</p>
<p>Nice to see Linux repeatedly get mentioned too, as they said: "Our focus this year is on refining the end-to-end experience for both current and new customers, making this the ideal laptop for Linux in addition to Windows, and enabling businesses to enter the world of repairable, customizable computing".</p>
<p>Speaking about the newer display they also said "Even better, that resolution allows for a streamlined experience in Linux through 2:1 display scaling." and for those of you who don't want a Windows logo on your keyboard they additionally said "We have one last bit of good news for Linux users too: you can now configure an English International keyboard with a “super” key instead of the logo from an OS you aren’t using.".</p>
<p>Of course, since it's Framework and their laptops are modular, you <em>don't</em> need to buy an entire new laptop. All the new parts will be up on the Framework Marketplace for you to pick up and slot into your existing Framework unit.</p>
<p>All the details in <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/introducing-the-new-framework-laptop-13-with-intel-core-ultra-series-1-processors" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the blog post</a>.</p>
<p><em>One day I will get my hands on the DIY edition to build it myself, that's the dream anyway.</em></p>

      <title>Super-chilled management game Minami Lane adds full controller support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minami Lane from Doot / Blibloop released with Native Linux support back in February, and the developer just released a major update adding in controller support.</p>
<p>"Minami Lane is a small, wholesome management game set on a Japanese-inspired street. Create and manage your own street, make sure everyone is happy, and watch the villagers live their lives! Enjoy 2 to 4 hours of playtime, cute tanukis and lots of cats!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="770ODbo1lBY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ec94a99648d0cfd5e6e166830205e01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/770ODbo1lBY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2678990/view/4146204937626486851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they said</a>: "Minami Lane can now be played comfortably with a gamepad or on any handheld platform Like Steam Deck or ROG Ally. Xbox, Playstation and Steam Deck controllers will all show native input prompts, and other ones will use Xbox prompts. The "verified" tag for Steam Deck should come very soon!"</p>
<p>The update also comes with 6 new languages, various visual improvements, lots of quality of life updates and lots of bug fixes too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<ul>

      <title>Athena Crisis looks a lot like Advance Wars and now its code is open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Entering Early Access on Steam back in March, Athena Crisis clearly takes inspiration from the classic Advance Wars and now the code has been made open source.</p>
<p>Like various other open source releases only the code is open under the MIT license but other parts are not like the single-player campaign, artwork, music and so on so you still need a copy of the game to work with it. In the <a href="https://cpojer.net/posts/athena-crisis-open-source" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> about it being opened up they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Athena Crisis is an example of how to build a high-quality video game using only JavaScript, React, and CSS. By open-sourcing Athena Crisis, we are following through on our commitment to open source our core technology and help push the Web forward as a game development platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also funding around $10,000 of community improvements to it, as they hope to pull in more people.</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command 40+ infantry, ground, naval and air units in turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Explore seven environments with unique playstyles.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a single player campaign with funny &amp; memorable characters.</li>
<li>Compete online in ranked or casual battles with up to 7 players at once.</li>

      <title>Over 30,000 people are clicking a picture of a Banana on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Never a dull day on Steam, with there now being a game where all you do is just click a picture of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Banana</a>. Yes, that's it and over 30,000 people are playing it right now.</p>
<p>30,687 at time of writing to be exact, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Although, <em>playing</em> is perhaps <em>not</em> the right word for this. Loading, clicking a Banana once or twice and then leaving it minimized is probably much more accurate. It's an idle clicker game, one that you're not really supposed to do anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18726797691717065669gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So what's the point and why are people doing this? Well, you can thank the Steam Marketplace for that. Inspired by another clicker game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784840/Egg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Egg</a>, that has the same idea. The developer even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2923300/discussions/0/4362374548293264672/#c4362374970372870797" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> it's just a worse made version of it on the Steam forum:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18356340021717065797gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's a free to play game, but it does drop Banana Steam Items every so often and everyone then dumps them onto the Steam Marketplace hoping to make some extra cash, which you can then use to buy Steam games. I had it loaded for only a few minutes and got a fancy looking Dogenana which is worth about £0.13 at time of writing and according to Steam 6,863 were actually sold in the last 24 hours. People are going Bananas over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20452190041717065874gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of these Bananas are worth a lot like the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/2923300/Crypticnana" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crypticnana</a> currently at a lowest listed price of £199.18, and only 25 of them actually exist as items.</p>
<p>It has a Native Linux version, although that didn't actually work for me, but it did work on Proton 9. I'm not suggesting you go play it, because it's ridiculous, but thought it was somewhat amusing to highlight and perhaps you might find it as stupid as I do.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 fans have launched a new campaign to get Valve to save it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve fans sure are passionate and they're once again trying to get Valve's attention to sort out various problems in Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>For a long time now, Team Fortress 2 (TF2) has had a problem with bots. From cheating to blasting music, spamming hate-speech over voice comms, spamming chats, advertising their bot services, kicking real players and just generally being a massive nuisance. </p>
<p>So now there's a whole new campaign that has been launched to get Valve to do something more. The website, <a href="https://save.tf/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SaveTF2</a>, explains the situation and asks people to sign their petition that currently has 14,974 people that have given their backing to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8632761671717064428gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8632761671717064428gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve are aware of the problem, and back in May 2022 they <a href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they <em>have</em> made several improvements since, but naturally the bot makers fight back and so the game is continually left in a rather messy state. Only recently though, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/team-fortress-2-gets-64bit-support-released-plus-vulkan-for-linux-via-dxvk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did launch the 64bit TF2 upgrade</a>, so Valve clearly haven't abandoned the game at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's likely quite a complicated problem to solve, otherwise Valve would have no doubt fixed it by now. But, perhaps with another push from players like this, Valve might put some more developer eyes back on to give it another go.</p>
<p>So what are the campaign organisers asking apart from signing their petition?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 3rd, we’re all going to collectively group together to take a stand against Valve’s inaction in dealing with the bots. We’re going to showcase the absolute magnitude of this issue to the online masses. </p>
<p>Screenshots, videos, and personal stories surrounding the bots in action, all accompanied by the tag #FixTF2. Alongside this is our petition, which will serve to represent the sheer enormity of how many players Valve’s inaction has negatively affected. We plan on forwarding each and every signature to them at a later date. We hope to gain the attention of as many mainstream gaming news outlets as possible, further shining a spotlight on the issue at hand. TF2 is not dying, it is being intentionally killed.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Garry Newman of Facepunch comments on the Nintendo takedown of Garry&#39;s Mod content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/garrys-mod-forced-to-remove-nintendo-content-after-takedowns/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was pretty big news</a> that Nintendo issued takedowns to Facepunch for Garry's Mod content, and now Garry Newman of Facepunch (developer of Garry's Mod and Rust) has written up a blog post with some comments on it.</p>
<p>A lot of people thought it <em>wasn't</em> a legitimate takedown from Nintendo, with rather a lot of post on Steam and social media debating if it was real or not as the requests for this (and other takedowns before elsewhere) have not technically been <em>direct</em> from Nintendo. The emails often come from "Aaron Peters" via "mm-nintendo.com" and so naturally, people speculated and came up with conspiracy theories about copyright trolls and fake DMCA notices.</p>
<p>But Newman previously <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1783501547361411494" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X to be clear that it had been verified it <em>was</em> from Nintendo. And now in a <a href="https://garry.net/posts/aaron-peters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> Newman has explained a little more noting how they've been getting "a ton of dms, voicemails, emails and actual physical hand written letters about this" because fans won't let it go.</p>
<p>The MM in the domain mentioned above stands for Mark Monitor, a company that "Provides strategic domain management solutions that help protect the revenue and reputation of the world’s leading brands". Looking over them, they're a <em>fancy</em> business-focused domain registrar designed for <em>bigger</em> businesses. And that mm-nintendo domain is noted as having "Nintendo of America Inc." very clearly as the owner.</p>
<p>As for this Aaron Peters who is noted on a lot of takedown noticed? Newman thinks they don't even exist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This guy doesn't exist. Well, he might, but I don't think he does.</p>
<p>If you look at the history of takedowns, you will notice they started as real Nintendo employees. Then they all switched to Aaron. I would guess that this is because the internet is full of crazies.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that you invent a name to be the target of that stuff. Let the internet shout at an empty chair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newman noted, <em>again</em>, they've had it confirmed it's a <em>legitimate</em> Nintendo takedown. The ending of the blog was also quite interesting copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't really understand the anger people have shown about this stuff. It doesn't seem logical to me. Maybe I grew up in a different time where IP, trademarks and copyright laws were obvious no brainers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because of streaming and Steam this generation grew up without real piracy. Maybe they don't understand all that because they can post music and videos in their memes on tiktok and no-one gets pissed.<br/>
<br/>
The attitude shouldn't be anger and outrage that it is being stopped; it should be surprise and delight that you got away with it for so long.<br/>
<br/>
Companies letting you use their IP like this isn't the default. When a company lets you get away with using their IP in UGC in another game they're a cool company. When they don't, they're a normal company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sums it up quite well really.</p>
<p>You would think we would have learned by now that you can't just take well-known characters, entire designs from companies, and not expect to get slapped by them at some point. All that effort would be better spent on something original.</p>

      <title>The supervillains won, so fight back in superhero strategy game Capes - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Spitfire Interactive, former members of Defiant Development who made Hand of Fate, comes the superhero strategy game Capes. <u>Note</u>: a key was provided before release.</p>
<p>Story: Twenty years ago, the supervillains won. Since then, they’ve created a dystopian city where developing superpowers is a crime and no one has dared oppose them. Until now! Assemble a diverse team of heroes while fighting to take back their city, now controlled by evil despots! Play across the dark and gritty campaign and patrol assignments, push the story forward and reveal the truth behind the horrific Enhancement program of The Company that is pulling the strings behind the scenes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z-VDKNTUIa4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f02c624a4b0241d75e63bdbb46cd50e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z-VDKNTUIa4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by XCOM, here you get a cinematic and rather action-packed turn-based strategy game, that mixes in team management with a little comic book flair. So if you love superheroes and anything resembling XCOM, you're going to feel really at home with this one. Capes is all about rising from the ashes, as you build up a ragtag group of new Capes (their word for heroes) to hopefully take back the city, taking down The Company. And hopefully find out what they've been doing to all the captured heroes.</p>
<p>Capes is a pretty <em>intense</em> and brutal strategy game and not one to beat around the bush with the setting either. Even from the intro section you're greeted with supervillains and their goons gunning down civilians right in front of you — and of course you get the blame for it.</p>
<p>It's not as open as XCOM in how you play as it's a linear game, since it's firmly based on playing through the acts of the story, and certainly not on the level of graphical quality of Marvel's Midnight Suns (another superhero strategy game) with it being from a small team, but there's a huge amount of charm to it thanks to the strategy involved with each individual character. The combat is just a whole lot of fun but it does take a little learning, and a bit of trial and error, due to how unique each character you recruit is.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8381240701716923452gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8381240701716923452gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not only can you move and attack in any order, as long as you have the points, but each character has multiple unique abilities. Some can teleport, create crystals to block line of sight or stop people in their tracks, use telekinesis to launch objects at enemies and telepathy to mess with minds and more.</p>
<p>The beauty in it though is how the abilities of the individual characters work together with the special link system, where multiple heroes link together if they're close enough to do a slightly more special attack. There's a good number of those team ups too and they really are powerful, but needing to keep your people close enough together can also be a big issue and your downfall on some missions. Adding to that, each character <em>also</em> has a unique <em>ultimate</em> ability that you have to charge up during a mission, with each charging up a different way based on their main abilities.</p>
<p>Another element to the battles are the need to disarm enemies, as various thugs that carry weapons can have it knocked right out of their hand either through the specific disarm ability if you're close, or by using some special hero abilities that disarm enemies in addition to taking down their HP. Needed often too, since weapons will cause more problems for you from enabling enemies to have range (terrible for low-HP heroes) and sometimes extra attacks on you.</p>
<p>There's another layer to the game with your base of operations, that sees your team hidden in the old spot where the original strongest heroes would meet up. Although it's looking a little worse for wear. Here you can upgrade your heroes and there's a good few different ability upgrades for each of them, along with unlocking entirely new abilities. Although, even with plenty of upgrades, they never really feel over-powered against enemies. You're still going to need to think tactically during every single mission making good use of all their abilities together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206920631716927060gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206920631716927060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like me, you'll probably end up with some favourites for their abilities, as well as their link team-up abilities, and you'll end up hardly using some others. The best bit though? There's no random hit chance. No 99% miss. No lurking behind cover either it's all about the movement, positioning and using the abilities together.</p>
<p>There's an interesting challenge system to this as well. Each character has an <em>individual</em> set of challenges, doing each one will unlock more SP points, which you can then use to upgrade their abilities some more. It ranges from simply using abilities to more interesting challenges like hitting a certain amount of enemies in one go, knocking enemies off ledges and so on.</p>
<p>A useful feature is that you can also re-play missions, enabling you to "simulate" them to ensure you complete all the available optional bonus objectives. Some of them are pretty difficult too and nicely varied so they don't feel like a boring chore to get through, so you might end up going back a fair bit because you actually <em>want</em> to. And because it never gets old seeing all the special abilities smashing through multiple enemies. Completing them all fully allows you more time to level all your heroes up, to proceed further into the story if you need to. Or just practice time to mess with the various abilities if you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/554498811716987087gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/554498811716987087gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some missions will be straight-up fights, some (like pictured above) make you sneak around stealthily, some have you protect a specific character and so on. There really is enough variety there that it does keep you nicely on your toes. And you don't have to sit waiting either, as you can fast-forward the enemy AI turns to get control of your team again a bit quicker, which I do wish some other strategy games had — nice touch.</p>
<p>Those damn challenges though, some feel impossible without first levelling up your heroes, which I feel is part of the point but I was determined in some cases and ended up replaying through a few missions many times to do them. There's so many fun ways to do the missions once you get more heroes and upgrade them.</p>
<p>Lots of nice little details to it too, like the main cut-scenes having their speech bubble tail moving around with character's mouths as they're talking. All the little comic-book animations during conversations and through the UI really help bring it to life.</p>
<p>Issues: one real nuisance quirk I did have on Kubuntu Linux 24.04 (KDE Plasma), was having to switch between borderless and windowed mode to get it to actually fill the screen properly. First launch had the bottom cut, after that it kept going into a small window. Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> entirely solved that issue forcing it into a 1440p full-screen window. Apart from that, it worked beautifully (no other Linux issues noticed, that is).</p>
<p>Another issue, much like other similar games, is sometimes the camera angles during attacks get a bit weird. Not too often, but you probably will see a good few times that something is covering up the screen during an attack.</p>
<p>Performance all maxed out at 1440p on my Ryzen 5800X and Radeon 6800XT desktop has been great, constantly above 100FPS. No complaints there.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Be Mighty: Play as heroic protectors of the innocent, each with unique skills and powers. Master your hero and unleash devastating ultimate abilities!</li>
<li>Assemble Your Team: Select the right team for the right mission. Combat isn’t based on random numbers, so choose wisely to win the day!</li>
<li>Level Up: Complete challenging missions and side-quests to improve your heroes with new abilities and powerful upgrades!</li>
<li>Defeat Evil: Face down vile villains and criminal corporate henchmen. Do you have what it takes to free your city from the clutches of villainy!?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Capes has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>If you love strategy games with a dark but fun story to follow, this is pretty much an essential purchase. The depth of the characters, along with all their abilities together is a <em>lot</em> of fun to smash through all the villains. Fun style too, although some of the characters look just a <em>bit</em> plastic, almost toy like in some cases, but it doesn't distract from the overall experience which is thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>A firm recommendation to go and buy. Only a villain would pass up on playing Capes.</p>
<p>You can buy Capes on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/capes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081080/Capes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally some good news from an Electronic Arts published title, as developer Hazelight just upgraded It Takes Two to get it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Third-party additional launchers are a plague on Steam games, they get in the way and repeatedly break with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.

      <title>Quest Master is basically Zelda-maker and it&#39;s now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving classic Zelda vibes meets Mario Maker styled creation, Quest Master gives you plenty of tools to make dungeons, for you to go alone or in local co-op.</p>
<p>After releasing a demo that proved to be pretty popular, players ended up making over 250 dungeons for people to play through. With it now in Early Access the demo is still live, but the tools available in it are restricted. Seems fair.</p>
<p>Forge the story of Lanze, Javelynn and Shiv — the hero, heroine, and furry sidekick — by creating hand-crafted dungeons in a vibrant pixel art setting reminiscent of ‘90s top-down adventure classics. Fashion story-rich adventures or skill-testing obstacle courses for up to three adventurers at once, then share creations online with the Quest Master community complete with filtering options and ratings.</p>

<p>Not only will you be making dungeons like you always wanted, and playing through the creations from everyone else, there's also a Castle Town to explore full of mini-games and side-activities.</p>
<p>They've got a pretty exciting sounding roadmap to keep expanding it during Early Access including more themes, more enemies, more items, expansions to Castle Town, a full proper single-player campaign, expanded lore and possibly even online multiplayer which they're only tentatively saying for now.</p>
<p>“The reception of Quest Master's demo has been incredible. 260 dungeons have been created since the demo launched 3 weeks ago. Now that the Early Access launch has landed, we’re diving deep into new features for 1.0,” said Julian Creutz, Lead Developer of Quest Master. “This is just the beginning for our fans, new and returning. We’re crafting an experience that we believe will inspire dungeon designers for years to come.”</p>
<p>You can check it out in Early Access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094070/Quest_Master/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support. Currently it has no Steam Deck rating.</p>

      <title>Historical 4x strategy game Old World - Behind the Throne DLC brings plenty new</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World is a quality historical 4x strategy game that you should not pass up, especially if you love you Civilization styled games and this latest DLC adds in plenty of new content. The game has only continued to get better and better since it jumped from the Epic Store to Steam back in May, 2022. <em>It's probably one of the best in the genre.</em></p>
<p>Old World - Behind the Throne is the 5th main DLC for the game with this focusing on character interactions and court politics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19304364571716985578gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19304364571716985578gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>350+ new events centering around court politics, intrigue, and personal ambition. The world behind the throne is a complex web of deceit, personal goals, and opportunities.</li>
<li>New historical characters
<ul>
<li>Alcibiades, Athenian statesman, and notorious political double-crosser.</li>
<li>Enlil-nadin-shumi, usurper of the throne of Babylon.</li>
<li>Harpagus, Kingmaker of Akkad.</li>
<li>Bardaisan, scientist, scholar, and philosopher of Assyria.</li>
<li>Mago the Author, Carthaginian writer on agriculture.</li>
<li>Avicenna, famed philosopher from Persia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New projects and improvements
<ul>
<li>Estates, expensive new, improvements with a wide variety of benefits.</li>
<li>Opulence, a new project made possible by Estates. Use your wealth to generate additional victory points.</li>
<li>Slums, which balance faster population growth with risk of rebellion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Gameplay mechanics
<ul>
<li><strong>Rising Stars</strong> - Powerful non-leader characters who present dangers and opportunities as they accumulate experience, triggering a wide range of events with both negative and positive effects. If they become too much of a nuisance, there’s always ways of “dealing” with them.</li>
<li><strong>Stress &amp; Revelry</strong> - Stymied ambitions, jealous lovers, raging barbarians, and much more can all take their toll on a ruler. Will your ruler indulge in hedonistic pursuits to escape the stress?</li>
<li><strong>The Grand Vizier</strong> - Take the minutiae of managing your cities off your plate, handing control to Viziers who will manage based on their personalities. Wise Viziers will focus on culture, courageous ones will recruit military units faster, while disciplined ones create specialists and special projects faster. Be warned, though – power corrupts, and a trusted Vizier might turn their gaze towards your throne.</li>
<li><strong>New Political Eras</strong> - Civil wars, grand reforms, and periods of corruption and decadence will bring forth new challenges for your empire as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Old World has Native Linux support, and last I checked it ran really well on Linux. To go with the new DLC release the base game and previous DLC are all on sale.</p>
<p>Created by Mohawk Games based in Baltimore, Maryland (USA) the studio is led by Leyla Johnson and Soren Johnson, the lead designer of Sid Meier's Civilization IV and co-lead designer of Sid Meier's Civilization III. Mohawk Games previously released Offworld Trading Company.</p>

      <title>Puppygames bring massive-scale asynchronous PvP battle simulator Battledroid to Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Puppygames are launching a new game with Battledroid, a massively multiplayer online asynchronous PvP battle simulator that has a rather big scale to it.</p>
<p>For those who don't immediately recognise the name, Puppygames made the likes of: Revenge of the Titans, Titan Attacks!, Droid Assault, Ultratron and Basingstoke. Revenge of the Titans is a bit of a classic! One from the second Humble Indie Bundle which had the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131020134018/https://www.puppygames.net/blog/?p=914" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code released</a>.</p>
<p>Using their own "state-of-the art custom voxel graphics engine" they call VOXOID, they wrote it from scatch in Java and OpenGL to allow them to "create spectacular battles" which they say supports "massive super-detailed landscapes, thousands of battling droids, and millions of particles to create explosive effects". Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8AWQFimTZOA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fc9c40f7f7c46e9bb1bacaeedd385e82.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8AWQFimTZOA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The trailer does a pretty poor job of showing off what the overall gameplay will be like but imagine an auto-battler on a massive scale as you will battle for territory across 250,000 tiles set across a persistent open world map of the real Earth, using actual terrain and environmental data.</p>
<p>You set up all your units (in defence, or attack), tweak their parameters a little, and then launch your attack - and sit back to watch them blow each other to bits. Winner keeps or takes the territory. There's a lot more explained and shown via gifs and screenshots on the Kickstarter.</p>
<p>They've been building the game on and off now for around 14 years from the initial designs back in 2010, to having a Beta available on Steam now (for backers). They're hoping to raise at least £27,600 from the new Kickstarter, so they can get working on it full time to push it over the finishing line.</p>
<p>Features at release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free to play!</li>
<li>Massive battles with up to 1000 units on each side.</li>
<li>Asynchronous online multiplayer - you can play even if your friends are offline.</li>
<li>Voxels! Voxels! Voxels! State-of-the art custom voxel graphics engine, with destructible scenery.</li>
<li>Editable environment and weather system with realistic fog, mist and volumetric lighting.</li>
<li>Tiny download, quick startup, and free to jump in and start blowing stuff up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Battledroid will have Native Linux support just like their previous games.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/puppygames/battledroid/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Kickstarter</a> and follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247710/Battledroid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Bella Wants Blood is a bite-sized &#34;roguelike terror defense&#34; game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After releasing the roguelike tower defense Core Defense in 2020, and then the rogue-lite survival base builder Landnama in 2023 developer Sonderland is back with something weird with Bella Wants Blood. <u>Note</u>: developer provided an early review key.</p>
<p>They're calling it an "absurd bite-sized roguelike terror defense game", which in a few ways builds on the ideas from Core Defense but puts it into a darker setting and gives you a Slay the Spire style path system to progress through.</p>
<p>"Trapping you in their world, the god-like Bella demands you play their game to feed them blood. Lay down gutters and destructive terrors to obliterate Bella’s friends and their grotesque minions. Just don’t let them reach the end of your maze or Bella will get upset. And if Bella gets upset, Bella might just keep you there forever."</p>

<p>Bella Wants Blood has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3007660/Bella_Wants_Blood/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. There's no current release date mentioned other than sometime "soon".</p>
<p>Who are Sonderland? Three dads and close friends from Germany, France and Canada with different backgrounds and perspectives on gaming, united by the desire to make beautiful, minimalist games they love to play.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta adds Bluetooth device battery info for Steam Deck, various desktop PC updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another round of Steam Client Beta updates are here with Steam Deck and Desktop PC seeing lots of improvements and bug fixes, and it's especially nice for people using Bluetooth on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>These are just for the Steam Deck from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4177730135016134612?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Show battery information for connected Bluetooth devices under Settings-&gt;Bluetooth and in the Quick Access menu.</li>
<li>Added a per-device toggle to Settings-&gt;Bluetooth that controls whether a device is allowed to wake Steam Deck from sleep.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the UI to show stale data for Bluetooth devices.</li>

      <title>Zelda 64: Recompiled, the Majora&#39;s Mask PC port v1.1 brings various upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zelda 64: Recompiled was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/zelda-majoras-mask-gets-a-pc-port-with-a-new-open-source-tool-for-nintendo-64-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty interesting news recently</a>, a PC port of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask using the new <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">N64: Recompiled</a> tool and now a fresh update is out to improve it further.</p>
<p>It was already impressive, and now even more so. It's only going to keep getting better thanks to it being open source. Linux players especially might want this one, due to a SDL crash fix. As a reminder, you do need a copy of the game to work with Zelda 64: Recompiled, since it does not provide that for you (obviously).</p>
<p>Version 1.1.0 brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an analog "free" camera in the style of later entries in the series. Moving the right stick will allow you to freely rotate the camera, and pressing the Target button or going through an entrance will switch back to the normal camera.</li>
<li>Improved motion blur effect at high framerates by using a high precision internal framebuffer (won't be enabled on machines with less than 1GB of VRAM).</li>
<li>Implemented N64 noise dither (affects the motion blur scenes).</li>
<li>Extended Dawn of the X Day screen to account for faster load times to match console timings.</li>
<li>Added a configurable scaled deadzone option to the menu. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/257" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#257</a>)</li>
<li>Added the option to remap the menu button on controllers. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/181" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#181</a>)</li>
<li>Added an automatic save backup system to reduce chance of losing data if saving gets interrupted. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/260" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#260</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a Linux crash on startup by forcing SDL2 video driver selection to X11. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/197" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#197</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed the Skull Kid "curse" effect in very wide aspect ratios. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/259" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#259</a>)</li>
<li>Added a main volume slider. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#267</a>)</li>
</ul>

      <title>VoxeLibre (formerly MineClone2) v0.87 released moving away from Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VoxeLibre (formerly MineClone2), a free and open source sandbox game, has a brand new release available as they begin more movement to end the Minecraft clone wars. Well, as much as they can anyway, because it still looks and acts like Minecraft and is one of the best free alternatives.</p>
<p>Not only is this the first release with a new name, but it also has plenty of new mechanics and some new mobs included too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13774213861716915765gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13774213861716915765gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rewrite of the Potions and Effects system. This includes new effects, new potions and brewing recipes being added.</li>
<li>Rewritten Nether Portals making them work better, and now they connect up properly.</li>
<li>Improvements to the mob spawning system.</li>
<li>New mobs:
<ul>
<li>Rover is a new mob, replacing the enderman.</li>
<li>Stalker is another new mob, replacing the creeper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eating is now delayed instead of instant and has a first-person animation.</li>
<li>Multiple new blocks.</li>
<li>Capes are included in the character customisation.</li>
<li>Cherry blossom particles.</li>
<li>Leather armour can now be coloured (and washed).</li>
<li>Sign text editing.</li>
<li>+ much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds like a pretty exciting release for the project! Have many of you been playing it, what are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Terraria: The Board Game live on Kickstarter - goal met almost instantly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terraria the smash-hit indie game is being turned into a tabletop experience with Terraria: The Board Game. It's crowdfunding on Kickstarter, and obviously it was going to do well.</p>
<p>Their goal was met almost instantly! At time of writing the main goal is £19,850 and they have £223,697 pledged. So yeah, clearly a lot of people are wanting in on this one and who could blame them? It looks great! Official too of course, made by Paper Fort Games in collaboration with Re-Logic!</p>
<p>With this adaption it will be playable for 1-4 people (solo play is an option) with world exploration, co-op play, dice-based combat, deck-building and little miniatures for bosses you can paint too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OrX4wCKiVmA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e28e9b334e26b58c644f02a6b03406a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OrX4wCKiVmA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly not cheap though at £62 to get it (not including shipping), but this is a special game adaption, it's quite different to just going into a local store and picking up a copy of Monopoly. You're paying to support the creators as much as you are getting a board game for you to play.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paperfortgames/terraria-the-board-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full project on Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be jumping in for this one as well?</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>MangoHud performance monitor v0.7.2 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud, the performance monitor you can put on top of games on Linux has a brand new release available with new features and fixes. This is the tech that powers the performance overlay on Steam Deck!</p>
<p>So with this you can get a readout of GPU and CPU use, RAM and VRAM use, FPS, frame timings and so much more. It's incredibly useful for tracking game performance across various settings, one of those now-essential tools.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883821101716895919gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883821101716895919gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - MangoHud 0.7.2 (top right) on Dying Light 2</em></p>
<p>The main changes in version 0.7.2 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">time</code> now has a label (you can remove this label with <code class="inline-code">time_no_label</code>)</li>
<li>Wayland keybinds have been added</li>
<li>rewritten exec function to have a persistent shell. Should reduce frametime spikes when using exec</li>
<li>exec is now right aligned to conform with every other item</li>
<li>meson options <code class="inline-code">with_x11</code> and <code class="inline-code">with_wayland</code> actually have a purpose now</li>
<li>added Pop!_OS and SteamOS to build script</li>
<li>added a mutex for config to prevent some crashes when accessing config at the same time as reloading</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">winesync</code> and <code class="inline-code">refresh_rate</code> have been changed to small font</li>
<li>added more stats to log summary</li>
<li>stop using <code class="inline-code">intel_gpu_top</code>, as it was causing too many issues. We can still get GPU load but the rest we'll have to wait for to be exposed in sysfs</li>
</ul>
<p>The fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>frametime color wasn't being correctly inherited, the user was not able to change it's color</li>
<li>fixed a crash when pressing Shift_R + F9</li>
<li>config options now correctly override preset options</li>
<li>fixed RPM and % being incorrectly assigned for GPU fan speeds</li>
<li>graphs had incorrect padding at start of graphs</li>
<li>fixed a crash when reloading the config while logging</li>
<li>check that cpu input gives a non-zero value</li>
<li>fixed minecraft-launcher crashing</li>
<li>graphs had incorrect padding leading to a smaller graph</li>
<li>fixed a build issue where some meson options would exclude opengl files incorrectly</li>
<li>fixed presets not working with <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_CONFIG</code> env</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">time_no_label</code> removes the label before <code class="inline-code">time</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">network</code> shows the throughput in kb/s for all interfaces or a specified list of interfaces e.g <code class="inline-code">network=eth0,wlo1</code></li>
</ul>

      <title>Co-op tower defense beat &#39;em up ChronoDojo adds various Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChronoDojo blends together two genres that I didn't think would work. Putting together tower defense and a beat 'em up sounds a bit odd, but I've seen a lot stranger. It reminded me of the classic Awesomenauts a bit, only co-op tower defense rather than a MOBA.</p>
<p>While it has no current official Steam Deck rating from Valve, the developers are clearly fans of the Linux-powered handheld. Writing in a post on Steam they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1428300/announcements/detail/4164219336136067403" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We so love playing and developing games for and from our couch! So naturally, we had to pick up a Steam Deck for ourselves and play ChronoDojo all over again!</p>
<p>While we're happy to say that it feels right at home on the deck, along the way we noticed many little tweaks, minor issues and opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>So! We bashed out this latest build and are happy to share it with everyone out there looking for a great game for their Steam Deck!</p>

<p>More about it: "Play solo or party with friends in this cute, cooperative combination of tower defense and beat 'em up action! Travel through time, leap through levels, quickly construct trusty towers, and battle against wave after wave of zany enemies!"</p>

      <title>Physics-based roguelite bullet-hell Cosmo Rider improves Steam Deck controls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cosmo Rider is a physics based roguelite bullet-hell-and-heaven horde-survivor action game. Upgrade your spaceship and traverse procedurally generated galaxies in this space survivors game. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating from Valve yet.</p>
<p>Recently it had a major upgrade to bring in randomized weapon attributes, and a new reinforcements system to help you out which sounds pretty fun. That was on top of a graphics upgrade back in April. They also recently added in key rebinds, along with better detection for Steam Deck controls, an updated tutorial, improved UI navigation and more.</p>
<p>Most recent trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vv1njbYLg4k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c015db3c6a8830a138aa41c10cabca53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vv1njbYLg4k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looks like a whole lot of fun if you like space shooters, along with survivor-like gameplay too.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.1.0 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear fans of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and fheroes2 project supporters! The team is excited to present to you the release of <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>version 1.1.0</strong></a> - the second major release of the fheroes2 engine! This release features a significant update that we are thrilled to share with you.</p>
<p>After more than a year of work, the team has completed the first version of the in-game <strong>Editor</strong>. The Editor is available on all platforms and is <strong>integrated into the game</strong>. You can access it by clicking on the canvas with a globe in the bottom-right corner of the Main Menu. The Editor works only with the full version of the game - <em>"Price of Loyalty"</em>. It is not supported in the demo or <em>"The Succession Wars"</em> versions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7416667021716892163gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The team redesigned the whole editor from the ground up to ensure that it is user-friendly and provides a smooth experience for map makers. A key feature we've added, which was missing in the original Editor, is the <strong>display of object passability</strong>. Now you can see the whole map and how the heroes will navigate around objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2836204501716892219gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The Editor uses a new map format - <em>.fh2m</em> . This license-free format is different from the original game's map format. It is very scalable, and we plan to expand it in future releases, offering map makers options to fine-tune many objects, add custom events, set unique loss and win conditions, and more. This also means that you can freely share your creations with others, and in the future, we are going to supply the engine with new maps.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the current version of the Editor <strong>lacks a few features</strong>. This was a deliberate decision to balance the release timeline and deliver well-tested and polished code rather than providing everything in a semi-finished state. <strong>Quality</strong> has always been our main priority. We will cover the missing features in the next release.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team enhanced AI on the Adventure Map, redesigned multiple UI dialogs and also updated several translations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6174342051716892258gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6174342051716892258gol1.png"/></a>~<br/>
<em>"Event" object new dialog.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17035579451716892308gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17035579451716892308gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Random hero dialog.</em></p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your valuable and continuous support of the project, and we hope you will enjoy the game.</p>

      <title>No leaving a Steam account in a will after you die according to Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doing the rounds right now is a post from Valve's Steam support (thanks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ars</a>), when a user asked about what would happen to their Steam account when they died and it's not great news for anyone hoping to pass on your Steam account.</p>
<p>This comes from a post on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resetera</a>, where the user asked if a Steam account could be transferred via a will. The Steam support staff member replied to note very clearly Steam accounts are plain and simply "non-transferable".</p>
<p>It's not exactly something new, or surprising, given that Steam's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Subscriber Agreement</a> clearly notes "You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve.". </p>
<p>Still, nothing actually technically stops you just writing down your details for someone and leaving it in a safe space, it's not like Valve actually go and confirm your identity. You also have the newer Family Sharing system, so someone could quickly go in and share it to your personal account and get <em>most</em> of the games.</p>
<p>It's also another reminder that on Steam, you <em>don't</em> own any games on it at all. Once again, as per the Subscriber Agreement, "Content and Services are licensed, not sold" and your "license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services". </p>
<p>This will be the same across <em>nearly all</em> web stores that offer digital products you "buy", they're not yours. Epic Games Store is exactly the same as per their <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/eula" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EULA</a> which notes "All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale". Ubisoft are exactly the same in <a href="https://legal.ubi.com/StoreTermsofSale/en-GB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their terms</a> as well noting "we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensed, non-commercial and personal license". Think GOG are any better? They're not, as per GOG's <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/16034990432541-GOG-User-Agreement-effective-from-17-February-2024?product=gog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">agreement</a> "Your GOG account and GOG content are personal to you and cannot be shared with, sold, gifted or transferred to anyone else." and they make it clear multiple times you get a license again, not ownership of anything sold.</p>
<p>If you go through most other places, they all use similar language and we're not talking just game stores here but anywhere you digitally purchase movies, TV series and so on. You get the idea. You might be buying the item, but you have no ownernship at all.</p>
<p>Really, the only time this will change is when physical media properly dies off and people cause enough of a fuss that governments and legal bodies around the world put in new laws around digital ownership, which is not likely for a long time.</p>
<p>So, you probably should go and clear that backlog of games you've built up.</p>

      <title>2 Ship 2 Harkinian, another unofficial PC port of Zelda: Majora&#39;s Mask is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we only recently had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/zelda-majoras-mask-gets-a-pc-port-with-a-new-open-source-tool-for-nintendo-64-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zelda 64: Recompiled release</a>, we've now also got another PC port of Zelda: Majora's Mask thanks to the Harbour Masters team with 2 Ship 2 Harkinian.</p>
<p>This one is from the same team that made <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/ship-of-harkinian-a-pc-port-of-ocarina-of-time-has-a-feature-filled-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ship of Harkinian</a>, a PC port of Ocarina of Time, and so they've expanded their work to Majora's Mask. You do need a ROM file, so you'll need to actually have your own copy of the game to be able to play it. So much like the previous two links above, hopefully Nintendo won't come along and nuke it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9746723931716827021gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9746723931716827021gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With this first release the main highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for higher frame rates<br/>
Similar to SoH, 2Ship allows you to up the framerate to as high as you want using Matrix Interpolation! The game logic still runs at 20 FPS, so this is all purely visual and won’t change any authentic game behavior.</li>
<li>Frame buffer effects - We hacked our way around needing to solve this in SoH, but with 2Ship we have a working frame buffer implementation that allows us to accurately recreate these effects like Motion Blur or capturing images for the PictoBox. You can read our blog post about this <a href="https://hmdev.blog/posts/frame-buffer-effects" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Free look - More camera freedom by allowing you to control your third person camera with the right analog stick.</li>
<li>Save related enhancements - Added the ability to auto save at timed intervals, back-ported "pause saving" from OoT, and preventing Owl Saves from being self-destructed when you load in.</li>
<li>Binary Save Import - While on file select screen, drag and drop save files from Recomp or Emulators to import your save into 2Ship. (Works with all of the save formats we were able to get our hands on, if you have something that doesn't work please create an issue on GitHub!)</li>
<li>DPad Items - Equip any item or mask to any DPad slot!</li>
<li>HUD Editor - Allow you to move and scale all elements of the hud. Includes presets for 4:3 (original) and widescreen HUDs.</li>
<li>Support for both N64 1.0 USA and GameCube USA roms!</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Rogue Prince of Persia arrives on Steam, devs will &#34;constantly&#34; improve it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is now in Early Access on Steam, and the good news is that it should already work well on Steam Deck but the developer plans to keep improving it. So that's good news for desktop Linux players too. Since it uses Proton, as long as it performs well on Steam Deck, it should be no problem for a bigger desktop Linux PC.</p>
<p>It was entirely developed by Evil Empire, who previously maintained the very popular and rather brilliant Dead Cells, and you can definitely see they've learned some valuable lessons from their time working on it. Nice to see a developer who knows their stuff working on such a classic game series, one I started all the way back on the Amiga.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LoYIyvwI__E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9143698811e2083e72c6c07705335f31.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LoYIyvwI__E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking in a post on Steam the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2717880/discussions/0/4335356530803068912/#c4335356530803077171" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> "We will be constantly working on optimisation for the Steam Deck throughout Early Access too :)" and that they're waiting for Valve to verify it right now.</p>
<p>Early Access should last for around a year, and they have a lot of plans to expand it with double the current content planned for the 1.0 release. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now we have a fun solid nugget of a game - we're very confident that the acrobatic platforming and the combat moveset is a blast to play with and is a great base to build off during Early Access (and the music ain't half bad too, thanks ASADI! ;D).</p>
<p>We're well aware that we need to add more meta progression, upgrades, enemies, weapons, difficulty settings, other features and of course biomes, bosses and story acts, before the game can be considered complete.</p>
<p>But this is what Early Access is for, and our philosophy is that this is the best environment for us to build all of that in and to arrive at v1.0 with the best game possible, by working alongside a player community and in a fluid 'experimental' way.</p>
