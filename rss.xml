      <title>Huge fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx latest massive update is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta since mid-December, the latest big content update to the fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx is out now bringing some sweeping changes. Still in Early Access but it's getting closer to the big 1.0 release.</p>
<p>More about it: Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder where you start off as an insignificant colony and build, scheme, and fight your way towards a metropolis and empire. The mechanics are complex and true to life, where small events can spiral into the collapse of kingdoms. Easy to learn, but impossible to master. It's set in a low-fantasy world with graphics aimed at stimulating your imagination.</p>
<p>The latest release, v65 "the way of water", features a big overhaul to the water system. This includes sweet and salty water that have different uses and a new water pumping system. Overall it sounds like there's a lot you can do with water in the game now like making canals, certain buildings use sweet water to function better and the water system just seems to have more depth to it now. Plus there's 4 new music tracks, an improve day/night cycle, new lock and unlock mechanics, new icons everywhere, lots of modding improvements, a new quarter-speed option was added, there's new damage and armour types, lots of UI reworks and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1162750/view/3905247944461887535" target="_blank">the list just goes on and on</a> as you'll see some of in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EKCzZpcLSvg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/adaa7637a7861353d6afe557c70bc82f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EKCzZpcLSvg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>My early time with the game showed that it had incredible potential, and I've seen that some players have put in 100s of hours into it. It has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating for both Overall and Recent reviews on Steam, so clearly the developer has been knocking it out of the park with the regular massive updates. Seriously, the review numbers are impressive with only 93 negative versus 3,122 positive.</p>
<p>I just continue to be impressed at the sheer scope of it, the game is huge and has so much to do in it so I'm not surprised to see such huge game time from some players. If you've skipped over it or not heard of it before, time to put it on your radar for sure.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/songs_of_syx?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://songsofsyx.itch.io/songs-of-syx" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162750/Songs_of_Syx/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SMITE 2 announced with Steam Deck support from Titan Forge and Hi-Rez Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the latest Unreal Engine 5, Titan Forge Games and Hi-Rez Studios recently revealed their third-person action MOBA, SMITE 2 that will be coming with Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>If you've not played before think perhaps more like Dota 2 but third-person and plays a bit more like an ARPG with the gameplay match progress of a MOBA. Which is where you take down towers and push through the map to take territory from the opposing team. SMITE 2 is a complete sequel built from the ground-up in Unreal Engine 5 to bring "everything players love about <em>SMITE</em> and wraps it in state of the art visuals, animations and gameplay".</p>
<p>They said to expect "a refined user interface, updated audio, clearer spell effects and fresh physics-based abilities for Gods such as Ymir, everything in the game has been improved" and that the "move to a new backend technology also brings state of the art cross-play, a ranked rework that contains new tiers and structures, alongside improved matchmaking".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o1PHxmPq5o4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0873efb61a76fb0f33cc783a1ceed637.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o1PHxmPq5o4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.smite2.com/faqs/" target="_blank">official FAQ</a> under the supported platforms they note "SMITE 2 is a next-gen native title, in development for PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and SteamDeck.". The note of Steam Deck support was also included in their official press release too.</p>
<p>Since they're testing on Steam Deck, no doubt it will work just fine on desktop Linux too with Proton.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2437170/SMITE_2/" target="_blank">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS now appears to work on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this quite a surprise. THE FINALS is one of the most popular new online FPS games that uses Easy Anti-Cheat from Epic Online Services, and as of a recent update — it works on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>So far, I haven't seen anything official from the developer to confirm it was actually enabled intentionally, and I purposefully held off on this initially but it's been a few days and it's continued working. I tend to err on the side of caution, since we've seen other games with EAC previously work without knowing why and then break again shortly after. Hopefully THE FINALS will continue working, since it's so popular with it regularly seeing over 90,000 people (peak count) playing on Steam each day.</p>
<p>It can be a little <em>unstable</em> though, with some reporting Voice Chat and a few graphics options can cause crashes. However, now it actually works, testing can be done and so Valve can fix up issues in Proton, and developers on the various Linux graphics drivers as they get reported.</p>
<p>Some shots taken on Kubuntu 23.10, click pics to enlarge them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311690711705329445gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10311690711705329445gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4287879931705329448gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4287879931705329448gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9417234591705329447gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9417234591705329447gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21457644431705329448gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21457644431705329448gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you make sure you set it to use Proton Experimental in the game properties on Steam, you should be good to go for now. There's lots of reports filling up on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2073850?device=any" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> now too from people playing it across Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With my own testing on Kubuntu 23.10 with an AMD Radeon 6800 XT on Mesa 23.3.3 on Epic settings pictured above with FSR set to Quality it has been running really smoothly overall.</p>
<p>Today I reached out to Embark Studios for a statement, so hopefully their team will be able to let us all know what's happening with it officially.</p>
<p>THE FINALS can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073850/THE_FINALS/" target="_blank">found on Steam</a> free to play.</p>

      <title>Lutris game manager v0.5.15 brings lots of overall improvements for game installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lutris is a game manager and helpful game installer for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux that brings together your game library from Steam, Humble Bundle, GOG, EA, Emulators and more. The latest release has improvements across the whole app to make it smoother.</p>
<p>The v0.5.15 release is not all about big headline features, but improvement the way most things inside it work. For instance, having it download components it needs while the app is open instead of displaying a basic "updating runtime" box makes the app starting and initial experience feel a whole lot cleaner and nicer overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17098571651705326236gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17098571651705326236gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all the main new stuff:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Download runtime components from the main window, the "updating runtime" dialog appearing before Lutris opens has been removed.</li>
<li>Add the ability to open a location in your file browser from file picker widgets.</li>
<li>Add the ability to select, remove, or stop multiple games in the Lutris window.</li>
<li>Redesigned 'Uninstall Game' dialog now completely removes games by default.</li>
<li>Show an animation when a game is launched.</li>
<li>Add the ability to disable Wine auto-updates at the expense of losing support.</li>
<li>Add playtime editing in the game preferences.</li>
<li>Move game files, runners to the trash instead of deleting them they are uninstalled.</li>
<li>Add "Updates" tab in Preferences control and check for updates and correct missing media in the 'Games' view.</li>
<li>Add "Storage" tab in Preferences to control game and installer cache location.</li>
<li>Expand "System" tab in Preferences with more system information but less brown.</li>
<li>Add "Run Task Manager" command for Wine games.</li>
<li>Add two new, smaller banner sizes for itch.io games.</li>
<li>Sync Steam playtimes with the Lutris library.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug and crash fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix the export / import feature.</li>
<li>Fix some crashes happening when using Wayland and a high DPI gaming mouse.</li>
<li>Fix crash when opening the system preferences tab for a game.</li>
<li>Reduced the locales list to a predefined one (let us know if you need yours added).</li>
<li>Fix Lutris not expanding "~" in paths.</li>
<li>Ignore Wine virtual desktop setting when using Wine-GE/Proton to avoid crash.</li>
<li>Ignore MangoHUD setting when launching Steam to avoid crash.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Noxious Weeds takes Vampire Survivors and adds in angry veggies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love horde-slaying reverse bullet-hell survival games like Vampire Survivors? Noxious Weeds is another that's now available in Early Access and it comes with Native Linux support. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent a key to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">GOL Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HRrKqeqImo0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fe090bba7cf070601d766a18757ddcd3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HRrKqeqImo0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Basically, this is VS with very angry plants as enemies along with a day and night cycle, and during the day you get to rescue cute little veggies to help out. Nice and inviting, colourful and has a sweet farming setting. That's about as good a description as I can offer. <span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">Currently though, there's not really a huge amount different to VS and other survivor-like games. </span></p>
<p>It has the fun factor but is that enough when there's just <em>oh-so-many</em> similar games? Tough to answer fully. Right now, it feels like it needs more time in the oven to really add in more of a <em>unique</em> pull of which there <em>isn't</em> really enough of one.</p>
<p>During Early Access they said clearly they plan to add in more "Characters, Tools, Harvest items, and Game modes" — so hopefully they manage to add in a proper unique pull for it.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resist waves of enemies through nights and days.</li>
<li>20 minutes play sessions.</li>
<li>A variety of upgradeable Tools to wipe out the swarm once and for all. Your belt can carry a maximum of 6; your choices will change the outcome.</li>
<li>Rescue and team up with the cutest companions. Some will heal you, while others will fight at your side.</li>
<li>Collect the perfect crop combination to achieve game-breaking builds.</li>
<li>Accessibility. Tweak monsters' health, speed, and damage to better suit your play style.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2429310/Noxious_Weeds/" target="_blank">Noxious Weeds on Steam</a>. There's also a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398640/Noxious_Weeds_Prologue/" target="_blank">Noxious Weeds: Prologue</a> to try.</p>

      <title>GodotOS is a fun showcase of Godot Engine with a fake operating system interface</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No GodotOS is not another Linux distribution or desktop environment, it's an open source fake operating system interface made in Godot Engine, designed to push the limits of UI design in Godot. It's also just really cool.</p>
<p>From the project page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to GodotOS, an operating system interface created entirely in Godot! Browse folders, edit text files, view images, play games, and more in one cohesive polished interface that can even be used on the web!</p>
<p>GodotOS is more of a toy than a serious project. It's meant to push the limits on UI design in Godot while creating a desktop that is minimalist, distraction-free, and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Aside from that, GodotOS is also meant to be a hub for small games and experiences that can easily be bundled in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21393223381705324068gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21393223381705324068gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you have a small game / experience you want to add into it, they're also accepting contributions. I love crazy experimental stuff like this, especially when it's open source (AGPL-3.0 license), because it allows people to learn from it and UI design is something that can be tricky to get right in any game engine — so perhaps game devs from all over might want to take a look at this.</p>
<p><em>I just thought it was really cool and thought you might think so too.</em></p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://popcar2.itch.io/godotos" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/popcar2/GodotOS" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Heck, it is even has a trailer:</p>

      <title>Old World - Wonders &amp; Dynasties is a content-filled DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World is easily one of the best 4X games to be released in recent years, that is still quite largely overlooked compared to others in the genre and it only keeps getting better. A big new content DLC Wonders &amp; Dynasties has just been released.</p>
<p>The Old World - Wonders &amp; Dynasties brings with it over 100 new dynasty-related events and 21 character traits to augment the 30 new dynasty leaders. Each leader comes with unique starting modifiers and is supported by a cast of 120 new historical characters that can be recruited during the course of a session. Overall it sounds like a pretty essential addition to an already fantastic game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3QIGe_ia6H0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4c6650b1a323d8b6f3ff798cada225a9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3QIGe_ia6H0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A big patch was also released along with the DLC to include extra map randomisation options, UI and AI improvements, they added heir name selection popup on birth of an heir and a whole lot of bug fixes and other general game improvements to keep it running smoothly.</p>
<p>On Steam, Old World has a Very Positive user rating with Native Linux support and a Steam Deck Playable rating.</p>
<p>You can buy Old World and the DLC via:</p>

      <title>AYANEO Next Lite with a customized SteamOS-like HoloISO fully revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AYANEO has now revealed the specifications and pricing for the Linux powered AYANEO Next Lite, which will be using the SteamOS-like HoloISO, although customized by AYANEO for the handheld.</p>
<p>Initially AYANEO announced it as using SteamOS, and later <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-handheld-announced-with-steamos-linux/" target="_blank">clarified to GamingOnLinux</a> that it was actually HoloISO customized. I did ask <em>what</em> they've tweaked but they simply said "we've made some changes to adapt the NEXT LITE hardware and drivers, and I'm very sorry I can't tell you exactly at this time". So it's not a plain HoloISO install of course, they have done their own tweaks for their hardware.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-installed HoloISO Linux .</li>
<li>7" 800P IPS True Color Screen.</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen™ 5 4500U / AMD Ryzen™ 7 4800U.</li>
<li>16GB LPDDR4x 4266Mhz RAM.</li>
<li>Colour options: Pastel Blue / Bright White / Jet Black.</li>
<li>"NEXT Grip" Ergonomic Grip.</li>
<li>Hall Sensing Big Joysticks + Hall Triggers.</li>
<li>Custom Dual-copper Pipe Cooling System.</li>
<li>X-axis Linear Motor + Six-axis Gyroscope.</li>
<li>47Wh High-capacity Battery.</li>
<li>Two USB 3.2 type C + One USB 3.2 type C (data only) + headphones jack.</li>
<li>Weight: 720g.</li>
<li>WiFi 6 / Bluetooth 5.2.</li>
</ul>
<p>No date is actually being announced for release just yet, AYANEO simply told me "It will be officially available at the AYANEO online store in the near future" and that they "will offer exclusive early bird pricing for the first 100 customers, who can get the AMD 4500U version with 16G RAM and 512G stroage [<em>sic</em>] for just $299 with free shipping". For now, you can simply subscribe to their newsletter on the <a href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-NEXT-LITE.html" target="_blank">official page</a> to get notified when it becomes available.</p>
<p>Main pricing will be $299 for the Ryzen 5 4500U with a 128GB SSD, $349 with a 512GB SSD and $399 for the model with an AMD Rzen 7 4800U. You'll be able to upgrade the storage as they say it supported up to 8TB with M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 models.</p>

      <title>Last Epoch to get &#39;Item Factions&#39;, a unique item trading system for the ARPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Epoch is closing in on a full release and it's going to be a big one for ARPG fans, especially if you weren't fussed by the latest Diablo. Now they've revealed what they call Item Factions, a unique system to allow item trading between players.</p>
<p>"Balancing a trade system is one of the most difficult challenges in a loot-based game, because it significantly impacts the item hunt for all players,” said Judd Cobler, Founder and CEO of Eleventh Hour Games, and game director on Last Epoch. “Players are often split over an economy that can add value to their items and builds, and the thrill of the hunt that leads to uncovering unique items. But with crucial feedback from our community, we’ve implemented a solution we believe satisfies both sides of the debate, and is a truly unique take on the action RPG trade debate."</p>
<p>The idea of Item Factions is to give players a <em>choice</em> in how they play, and it ties directly into the lore of Last Epoch too with a fair amount of depth to the feature. You get to pick between joining one of two:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Merchants Guild</strong> - grants the ability to trade items with other players through the Bazaar, and player-to-player.</li>
<li><strong>Circle of Fortune</strong> - grants boosts to items you find yourself through Prophecies, and passive bonuses.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you get the best of both worlds available to players. Seems you won't be permanently locked into your choice either, but staying in one to rank up has various benefits.</p>
<p>Have a look at their explainer video below:</p>

<p>Full <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/trade-item-factions/61722" target="_blank">update on it here</a>.</p>
<p>Last Epoch leaves Early Access on February 21st, 2024. It has Native Linux support and is currently rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck, although it does work. Running it through Proton seems to be the best way to play though, as their Native Linux version has various graphical issues reported.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING gets patched to fix up anti-cheat on Steam Deck SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While no doubt many of you are waiting on more news about the upcoming ELDEN RING expansion, this is not it. Instead, a small update has rolled out to improve ELDEN RING on Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>The one liner in the update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1245620/view/6002801934196500690" target="_blank">notes</a>: "Easy Anti-Cheat update to support the Steam OS update". They say version 1.10.1 is required now for any online play, so make sure you're up to date. They also confirmed they will "continue to provide improvement updates in the future so you can enjoy ELDEN RING more comfortably".</p>
<p>At least we know From Software continue to see the Steam Deck as an important platform. Not surprising though, they've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/armored-core-vi-will-be-fully-supported-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">previously</a> mentioned how happy they were seeing ELDEN RING run on Steam Deck and made sure Armored Core 6 worked as well. </p>

      <title>Challenging platformer VVVVVV gets a big upgrade and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VVVVVV is an indie classic from Terry Cavanagh that just got a nice juicy upgrade with version 2.4 now officially released that brings with it a Steam Deck Verified status.</p>
<p>Not only is VVVVVV now Steam Deck Verified but the update includes translations into 21 languages, improved custom level support, lots of bug fixes, an upgrade to the SDL version used, it's swapped over from SDL_mixer to FAudio for audio, performance improvements as it's moved from being mostly CPU-based to being mostly GPU-based (via SDL's 'render' subsystem) and much <a href="https://vsix.dev/wiki/Version_2.4" target="_blank">much more</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5210128731704980410gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5210128731704980410gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of this is thanks to the source code release on <a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/VVVVVV" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, although it's not open source, and instead uses a custom license but that hasn't stopped people contributing to improve it.</p>
<p>More about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Help! Everyone has been teleported away randomly! As the heroic Captain Viridian, it's up to you to find your friends, bring them back to safety, and save the universe!</p>
<p>VVVVVV is a platform game all about exploring one simple mechanical idea - what if you reversed gravity instead of jumping?</p>
<p>The game is designed not to artificially gate your progress. In VVVVVV there are no locks, no power-ups, no switches, nothing to stop you progressing except the challenges themselves.</p>

      <title>Multiple shoot &#39;em ups from Taito like G-Darius HD got fixed up for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taito and M2 have been bringing some updated shoot 'em up classics to Steam with lots of enhancements, and players seem to love them. Now titles like G-Darius HD should work great on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In release order they are the Darius Cozmic Collection Arcade (2021), G-Darius HD (2022) and Ray’z Arcade Chronology (2023) and technically each one is actually a bundle of multiple games. So that's a whole lot of shoot 'em up action you can grab. The developers noted that some SteamOS updates caused problems, so they updated all of them to get them working smoothly again!</p>
<p>You can see the trailer for G-Darius HD below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Darius is one of the pioneers of arcade side-scrolling shoot 'em up games, first released in 1986 in a custom, 3 screen cabinet featuring in-seat bass speakers to deliver the impact of the game direct to the player! The aquatically themed, giant robotic fish bosses and Zuntata-composed soundscapes captured the hearts and minds of arcade goes everywhere, and now Darius Cozmic Collection Arcade brings 4 of those titles (total 7 versions) from the Darius arcade series, each with added features, some exclusive to Steam!</p>

<p>Taito's Darius series began with the titular arcade game, Darius, in 1986 and comprises numerous side-scrolling shooting games released in arcades, many of which were later ported to game consoles.<br/>
G-Darius is the 4th arcade game in the Darius series of horizontally-scrolling shooting games, which sees the Silver Hawks battling against huge, space-faring warships who resemble various aquatic life-forms.<br/>
G-Darius HD features 5 versions of G-Darius: arcade-perfect ports of G-Darius and G-Darius Ver.2 and an HD version of each, along with the console port of G-Darius, coupled with an Steam-exclusive widescreen bonus mode!</p>

      <title>Team Fortress: Source 2 fan project gets a DMCA from Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Team Fortress: Source 2 project is now officially dead in the water after getting hit with a DMCA from Valve, although the creators were already stopping development.</p>
<p>For a quick bit of context — Team Fortress: Source 2 was a complete remake being done in <a href="https://sbox.facepunch.com/about/" target="_blank">s&amp;box</a>, which is a game creation toolkit from Facepunch, it's supposed to be a next-generation Garry's Mod. While it may be based on Source 2, it's quite different, and naturally under a specific license for Facepunch to use. That doesn't mean anyone can just use Valve's game assets inside s&amp;box.</p>
<p>You can see the DMCA on <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-10-valve.md" target="_blank">GitHub</a> which notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The original copyrighted work is Valve's game Team Fortress ("TF2") <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/</a>. The TF2 assets have been ported to Source 2 without permission and are being redistributed by Amper Software in a game mode for Facepunch's S@box. Facepunch has not licensed any Valve assets for S@box. The unauthorized porting and redistributing of Valve's assets without a license violates Valve's IP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some reason they kept calling it S@box, but it's s&amp;box. Quite a few thought it might be someone pretending to be working for Valve to be malicious, like apparently has happened with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/stalker-game-engine-openxray-gets-taken-down-on-github/" target="_blank">take-down of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay recently</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on X (formerly Twitter), the Team Fortress: Source 2 <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortressS2/status/1745157814295617767" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we were discussing the project's future internally recently, we already came to the conclusion to stop the development of the project due to the current state of the code being unusable anymore with s&amp;box's recent major engine changes, and that we overall moved on from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in a follow-up, mentioning this is basically the final nail in the coffin. So regardless, they were stopping anyway and it would be broken.</p>
<p>This has caused quite the commotion on social media, with many (even a few bigger industry names I've seen), calling out Valve about taking it down forcefully in such a way. Many arguing this is "not the Valve of old", and that Valve are "going after modders" and plenty more. But, there's a difference between modding an existing game, and remaking them entirely in a different game engine. I've said this before when it comes to Nintendo, Rockstar and *insert big name*, if you use someone else's IP, they will eventually come knocking and take it down. And in this case, it was a remake of a game that is still online and still technically (debatable I know) supported and making Valve money.</p>
<p>Even Garry Newman of Facepunch has now <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1745317860363108527" target="_blank">commented</a> on the situation to make it clear too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think while it's maybe out of character for Valve to take down fan projects like this, it's hardly surprising when you have their entire game uploaded. I somehow don't think the "old Valve" would have let anyone port Half-Life to another engine and host it all publicly either.</p>
<p>S&amp;box doesn't have a license to use Valve's content, only the engine. It's not a mod, it's not gmod. We didn't want to commit a chunk of profit so early in development when we don't even know what the final product will look like.</p>
<p>Amper did a really great job porting and making this all work. Sadly it was going to all be broken next week with the Scene System update, so at least this saves them the job of updating to be compatible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Additionally, Valve also asked the creator of a recent Portal Nintendo 64 port to take it down (not a DMCA), as it used proprietary Nintendo tech.</em> </p>

      <title>Toaplan Arcade Shoot &#39;Em Up Collection Vol. 3 announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more classics are getting a new life on PC with the Toaplan Arcade Shoot 'Em Up Collection Vol. 3 announced for release on February 1st along with Linux and Steam Deck support just like the previous collections.</p>
<p>Games included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiger-Heli: This is where it all started. Tiger-Heli, Toaplan's pioneering bomb-based vertical shooter set the stage for an entire genre back in 1985!</li>
<li>Vimana: Uncover the magic of Indian mythology, unique power-ups, and an enchanting soundtrack in this electrifying space showdown!</li>
<li>FixEight: Toaplan's thrilling vertical run-and-gun game features eight peerless warriors with cutting-edge weapons!</li>
<li>Batsugun: The epic conclusion of Toaplan's legendary shooter series. Play the original or Batsugun Special. Choose your favorite character and spaceship in this thrilling sci-fi adventure!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828064891704972060gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2828064891704972060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As usual, the updated releases come with a whole bunch of improvements thanks to the emulation involved. Some of the enhancements are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Quick Save using F1-F10, Reload with Shift+ F1-F10.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.</li>
<li>Instrument panels with extra gameplay information and artwork.</li>
<li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.</li>
<li>Capture sharable replays to immortalize your interstellar victories (or funny moments).</li>
<li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.</li>
<li>Pixel perfect or full-screen scaling in windowed or full-screen mode.</li>
<li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Steam Achievements.</li>
<li>Hone your skills in the ultra customizable practice mode!</li>
</ul>
<p>My testing of the previous two collections was great, as they really did work exceptionally well on both Steam Deck and my Linux gaming desktop - so I expect more of the same goodness from this latest collection since they're clearly using the same software base for them all. It's just good to see more classic games get modernised like this, enabling them to be played easily.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy the games from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?developers=bitwave-games-toaplan" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/franchise/toaplan/list/116815" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AYANEO NEXT LITE handheld announced with SteamOS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 11/01/24 10:18 AM UTC</strong> - AYANEO replied to my email to give a tiny bit more info on their Linux OS use:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SteamOS pre-installed on NEXT LITE is adapted and optimized by AYANEO based on HoloISO. Users also can install Windows system by themselves after purchasing NEXT LITE, and download Windows driver from AYANEO official website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HoloISO is <em>not</em> actually SteamOS, but very close. So this is <em>not</em> in any way a partnership being done with Valve. HoloISO for those not aware can be found on <a href="https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <em>anyone</em> can use it. I've asked if they can share what changes they've made.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Finally we're seeing another handheld vendor jump in with Linux. The AYANEO NEXT LITE was announced today and much like the Steam Deck, they plan to ship it with SteamOS! AYANEO are one of the top brands when it comes to PC handhelds, so it's really interesting to see them be one of the first to jump in like this. If Linux is a success for them, no doubt they will do more and other vendors will follow along.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting some next-gen power-house though, this is a "value-for-money option" but with various great sounding features like Hall Effect Joysticks, a 7-inch 800p display, a 47Wh battery, X-axis linear motors "and other features".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, this forward-looking flagship handheld, AYANEO NEXT, returns in full force with the rejuvenated AYANEO NEXT LITE. Building upon the foundation of top-tier flagship design and texture, AYANEO NEXT LITE comes pre-installed with the SteamOS gaming system for the first time. AYANEO NEXT LITE integrates outstanding cost-effectiveness, lowering the entry barrier while further popularizing numerous flagship features, offering an upgraded experience to more players, and allowing them to enjoy the endless fun and convenience of gaming handhelds.</p>

<p>AYANEO say "subscriptions" will open 9:30 PM EST on January 11th EST / 2:30 AM January 12th UTC. They haven't revealed specifications or the pricing yet, so we assume that will be revealed then. The announcement post also showed off two different colour variations with a white shell and orange shoulder buttons like above, plus a black shell with grey shoulder buttons.</p>
<p>Currently it's not clear how they're using SteamOS. As Valve have not announced any kind of partnership, and there's no official public SteamOS 3 release yet. We know Valve wanted to get SteamOS on other devices, and all those discussions would have of course been behind closed doors until an announcement. So maybe Valve will say something soon. I've reached out to both Valve and AYANEO for an answer anyway.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they were previously working on their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ayaneo-confirm-their-linux-based-ayaneo-os-arrives-this-year/" target="_blank">Linux-based AYANEO OS</a> that was due in 2023, but perhaps that was shelved in favour of SteamOS directly to prevent fragmentation.</p>
<p>What do we think, AMD still like most others or Intel this time like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/msi-officially-announced-the-claw-a1m-handheld-with-intel/" target="_blank">the MSI Claw</a>?</p>

      <title>League of Legends likely unplayable on Linux / Steam Deck soon due to Vanguard anti-cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A day we expected to come but now Riot Games have formally announced that their Vanguard kernel-level anti-cheat is coming to League of Legends, and so it will make it unplayable on Linux. This is the same tech they use in VALORANT, which is also unplayable on Linux due to it.</p>
<p>This news was confirmed in their recent developer video below at about 12:43, mentioning it will happen in either late February or early March:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9U_jEzKf0_0?rel=0&amp;start=763"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b41ba871fa4517d31a8352ef0d60374.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9U_jEzKf0_0?rel=0&amp;start=763" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking on Reddit, one of their team <a href="https://sh.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kggm0yu/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "We'll get some more info about Linux for you all soon, it's not something i know the answer to off the top of my head and I want to make sure I talk with the team and get you the right info.", and in a previous comment they <a href="https://sh.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kggda9u/" target="_blank">mentioned</a> Vanguard won't be used in the macOS version.</p>
<p>However, a different Riot staff member seemed to make it clear Linux support won't be happening in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/18za7o7/comment/kgh17uo/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">reply</a> to a user asking about playing it in Wine: "No unfortunately not. From a security point of view supporting WINE would be like having a bank vault at the top of Nakatomi Tower then installing a doggy door in it.".</p>
<p>Considering that to play it on Linux you need to run the Windows version through Wine, there's no way they're going to roll out Vanguard into the Windows client and just let Linux get off without it. So I fully expect it to become unplayable in the next couple of months.</p>
<p>Seems like it's time for League of Legends players on Linux to finally swap over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank">Valve's Dota 2</a>, which has full Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Usurper turns Chess into a deck-building roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love strategy games, board games, deck-builders and roguelikes you may want to keep a little eye on Usurper, an upcoming game from Rogue Brain Studios that releases later this year. Currently aiming for a "Q2" release.</p>
<p>Offering the classic with a modern twist you start off with only a King, and then work your way up to a full army by purchasing pieces from your deck. Sounds like an interesting spin! The developer mentions it will have a full single-player mode against the AI, along with local and online multiplayer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="doh3p7Zrnbg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/341e76f7c87741e8cd152f9d9fe148df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/doh3p7Zrnbg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At release it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347280/Usurper/" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Palworld is Pokémon with guns, farming, survival and building - I&#39;m quite excited</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After growing up playing Pokémon, I will jump at the chance to try pretty much anything that involves some form of monster collection. It's just my jam and Palworld looks and sounds kind of hilarious that I need to play it. </p>
<p>It's basically taking the initial idea of Pokémon and expanding it with guns, farming, survival, building and apparently quite a lot more. It's actually sprinkling in game mechanics from all sorts of popular games. Even if a bit janky, which I expect since it will be in Early Access on January 19th, it's quite likely to be the <em>next big thing</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tOatviGVCTs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/48b0c8f8d85e7f228b22ede407d07163.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tOatviGVCTs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong><u>Survival</u></strong></li>
<li>In a harsh environment where food is scarce and vicious poachers roam, danger waits around every corner. To survive, you must tread carefully and make difficult choices...even if that means eating your own Pals when the time comes.</li>
<li><strong><u>Mounts &amp; Exploration</u></strong></li>
<li>Pals can be mounted to traverse the land, sea and sky—allowing you to traverse all kinds of environment as you explore the world.</li>
<li><strong><u>Building Structures</u></strong></li>
<li>Want to build a pyramid? Put an army of Pals on the job. Don't worry; there are no labor laws for Pals.</li>
<li><strong><u>Production</u></strong></li>
<li>Make use of Pals and their skills to make fire, generate electricity, or mine ore so that you can live a life of comfort.</li>
<li><strong><u>Farming</u></strong></li>
<li>Some Pals are good at planting seeds, while others are skilled at watering or harvesting crops. Work together with your Pals to create an idyllic farmstead.</li>
<li><strong><u>Factories &amp; Automation</u></strong></li>
<li>Letting Pals do the work is the key to automation. Build a factory, place a Pal in it, and they'll keep working as long as they're fed—until they're dead, that is.</li>
<li><strong><u>Dungeon Exploration</u></strong></li>
<li>With Pals on your side you can tackle even the most dangerous areas. When the time comes, you might have to sacrifice one to save your skin. They'll protect your life—even if it costs their own.</li>
<li><strong><u>Breeding &amp; Genetics</u></strong></li>
<li>Breed a Pal and it will inherit the characteristics of its parents. Combine rare pals to create the strongest Pal of them all!</li>
<li><strong><u>Poaching &amp; Crime</u></strong></li>
<li>Endangered Pals live in wildlife sanctuaries. Sneak in and capture rare Pals to get rich quick! It's not a crime if you don't get caught, after all.</li>
<li><strong><u>Multiplayer</u></strong></li>
<li>Multiplayer is supported, so invite a friend and go on an adventure together! And of course you can battle your friends and trade Pals, too.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be testing this one out on Steam Deck and my Kubuntu Linux desktop with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> for sure, so expect a report on how it runs some time shortly after release. The game is made with Unreal Engine 5, so it will be real interesting to see how the Steam Deck handles it, although graphically it doesn't look too demanding but graphics and style are of course only one part of the performance puzzle. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fantastic news for Like a Dragon fans as the latest in the series Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth has been checked over and confirmed Steam Deck Verified by Valve ahead of the release.</p>
<p>It will arrive on January 25th, and the previews coming in from elsewhere have been pretty glowing, so it's good to see another major upcoming release that will work great on Steam Deck (and so Linux desktop too!). Valve gave it the Verified rating with the current Proton 8.0-4.</p>

      <title>Valve announces new rules for games with AI Content on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now confirmed their rules for game developers using AI generated content on Steam, and while they're not banning AI they are going to ensure it's clearly stated for players. Like it or not, "AI" use is only going to increase in the games industry and so Valve had to do something and what they've announced sounds reasonable enough.</p>
<p>When developers fill out a survey for Valve to get their game on Steam, it now includes AI disclosures developers have to fill out and they separate it into two categories:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Generated: Any kind of content (art/code/sound/etc) created with the help of AI tools during development. Under the Steam Distribution Agreement, you promise Valve that your game will not include illegal or infringing content, and that your game will be consistent with your marketing materials. In our pre-release review, we will evaluate the output of AI generated content in your game the same way we evaluate all non-AI content - including a check that your game meets those promises.</li>
<li>Live-Generated: Any kind of content created with the help of AI tools while the game is running. In addition to following the same rules as Pre-Generated AI content, this comes with an additional requirement: in the Content Survey, you'll need to tell us what kind of guardrails you're putting on your AI to ensure it's not generating illegal content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve said they will also "include much of your disclosure on the Steam store page for your game, so customers can also understand how the game uses AI". So with that, if you plan to avoid AI games, at least Valve will give you a clear way to spot them.</p>
<p>On top of that Valve said they're implementing a new system to allow players to "report illegal content inside games that contain Live-Generated AI content", which you'll do via the Steam Overlay.</p>
<p>Together these rules and features allow Valve to be "much more open to releasing games using AI technology on Steam" but Valve said clearly that Adult Only Sexual Content created with Live-Generated AI is not currently allowed on Steam. That one feels like an obvious one to not allow, for reasons I'm sure I don't need to go into.</p>
<p>What do you think to Valve's stance on this?</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game engine OpenXRay gets taken down on GitHub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 11/01/2024, 11:55 AM UTC</strong>: The GitHub repository has been restored now. Hopefully this won't happen in future, considering as noted below, GSC Game World actually gave it their blessing to be used. And thanks to the take-down, <em>even mor</em>e people now know about it. From the reversal <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-10-xray-16-reversal.md" target="_blank">notice</a>, GitHub stated clearly after a review it was a fraudulent take-down.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>OpenXRay is an improved cross-platform version of the X-Ray Engine, which is the original game engine used in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series by GSC Game World. However, it seems a bad actor got it taken down from GitHub.</p>
<p>Currently the <a href="https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> notes "Repository unavailable due to DMCA takedown" and the DMCA can be <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/01/2024-01-08-xray-16.md" target="_blank">read here</a>, which is claimed to be from "Anti-Piracy Protection" on behalf of GSC Game World. </p>
<p>However, on X (formerly Twitter), the official GSC Game World <a href="https://twitter.com/GSC_GW/status/1744528469013237813" target="_blank">account noted</a> it wasn't their doing, and that "Open X-Ray is totally allowed to be used as a modbase" and that they're dealing with "a wave of false claims caused by our position recently":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15061962711704823083gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15061962711704823083gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So with that in mind, hopefully GitHub will reinstate it and prevent this from happening again from the same people trying to cause issues for them. It's also nice to see, at least according to who is posting on their social account, that they have no problems with people using OpenXRay considering it's based on leaked code.</p>
<p>The code has been out so long now, and used by so many for such old games, it would have been pretty strange to only now go after it. Especially since it requires data files from the original games to run, so people still need to buy the games to use OpenXRay.</p>

      <title>MSI officially announced the Claw A1M handheld with Intel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well there it is! MSI Claw A1M is the official name of the next big vendor to jump into the handheld gaming space to take on the likes of the Steam Deck, ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. Unlike the Steam Deck which runs SteamOS Linux, once again we have a vendor going with Windows 11.</p>
<p>From the press release: "In our commitment to enhancing the gaming experience for our users, we aim to address market pain points and dedicate efforts to the handheld space,” said Eric Kuo, the Executive Vice President&amp; NB BU GM of MSI. “We have fine-tuned specific designs tailored exclusively for gamers, debuting our very first handheld, Claw, which redefines the standards in the handheld market."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8964253901704808019gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8964253901704808019gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>MSI say it offers MSI Cooler Boost Hyperflow technology, featuring dual fans and heat pipes that efficiently dissipate heat, and that the intraflow thermal design optimizes airflow to cool internal components "ensuring top gaming performance". They're also bringing their "MSI Center M UI" to it giving quick-access to various features and settings like a game launcher. So once again, it's another UI being slapped on top of Windows.</p>
<p>The official specs sheet is below:</p>

<p>I'm always happy to see more competition for the Steam Deck, but it remains to be seen just how it will perform. And it will come in multiple different configurations with different storage. In terms of performance, from what I've seen from YouTube videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxoxXbc0Ros" target="_blank">Dave2D</a> it's quite limited as they weren't allowed to do much yet on benchmarking but it's somewhat comparable to the ROG Ally. Again though, it seems another case of it needing to draw more power for better performance.</p>
<p>The MSI Claw releases sometime in the first half of 2024.</p>

      <title>Cross-distribution support improvements coming for Canonical&#39;s Snap packages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, 2024 should be interesting for Linux packaging! While many distributions use different packaging formats like deb, rpm and others there's also Flatpak for cross-distro support. But we also have Canonical's Snap - which is going to get <em>improved</em> cross-distro support.</p>
<p>Writing on Mastodon, developer Zygmunt Krynicki <a href="https://mastodon.social/@zygoon@fosstodon.org/111703074889722934" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "I will be returning as a snap developer later this month. My main focus will be cross-distribution support. Unlike in the past this will be my full time job. I'm very excited for what is ahead for snaps.". It's interesting to see Canonical paying developers to work on this (and it's a good thing too)!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2274750401704805502gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2274750401704805502gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - <a href="https://snapcraft.io/store" target="_blank">The Snap Store</a></em></p>
<p>Packaging is always a real sore spot for Linux, and it leads to a fair amount of confusion. Just like with how many Linux distributions there are there's upsides and downsides to it though of course. You don't get innovation and improvements by always sticking to one single thing, and the power of open source is people can often just work on whatever they want.</p>
<p>Still, it would be nice no matter what distribution of Linux you pick, if we can just tell people to "go here" to get whatever app it is they're after rather than having to do a support-dance to find out their specific distribution and version to see what's available to find out how they can grab something.</p>

      <title>OpenAI say it would be &#39;impossible&#39; to train AI without pinching copyrighted works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I really fear for the internet and what it will become in even just another year, with the rise of AI writing and AI art being used in place of real people. And now OpenAI openly state they need to use copyrighted works for training material.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, the New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft over copyright infringement and just recently OpenAI sent a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/126981/pdf/" target="_blank">submission</a> to the UK House of Lords Communications and Digital Select Committee where OpenAI said pretty clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because copyright today covers virtually every sort of human expression– including blog posts, photographs, forum posts, scraps of software code, and government documents–it would be impossible to train today’s leading AI models without using copyrighted materials. Limiting training data to public domain books and drawings created more than a century ago might yield an interesting experiment, but would not provide AI systems that meet the needs of today’s citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth noting OpenAI put up their own news post "<a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-journalism" target="_blank">OpenAI and journalism</a>" on January 8th.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Why am I writing about this here? Well, the reasoning is pretty simple. AI writing is (on top of other things) increasing the race to the bottom of content for clicks. Search engines have quickly become a mess to find what you actually want, and it's only going to continue getting <em>far worse</em> thanks to all these SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) bait content farms, with more popping up all the time, and we've already seen some bigger websites trial AI writing. The internet is a <em>mess</em>.</p>
<p>As time goes on, and as more people use AI to pinch content and write entire articles, we're going to hand off profitable writing to a select few big names only who can weather the storm and handle it. A lot of smaller scale websites are just going to die off. Any time you search for something, it will be those big names sprinkled in between the vast AI website farms all with very similar robotic plain writing styles.</p>
<p>Many (most?) websites make content for search engines, <em>not</em> for people. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization" target="_blank">The Verge</a> recently did a rather fascinating piece on this showing how websites are designed around Google, and it really is something worth scrolling through and reading.</p>
<p>One thing you can count on: my perfectly <em>imperfect</em> writing full of <em>terrible</em> grammar continuing without the use of AI. At least it's <em>natural</em> right? I write as I speak, for better or worse. By humans, for humans — a tagline I plan to stick with until AI truly takes over and I have to go find a job flipping burgers or something. But then again, there will be robots for that too. <em>I think I need to learn how to fish…</em></p>

      <title>Unity cutting 25% of staff (about 1,800 people) as part of restructuring</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch. We're only just into week 2 of 2024 and Unity Software are cutting away a huge amount of their staff, as things aren't looking great for the Unity game engine.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/unity-software-cutting-25-staff-company-reset-continuation-2024-01-08/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> who picked up the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1810806/000181080624000006/unity-20240108.htm" target="_blank">filing</a>, Unity announced "it plans to reduce approximately 1,800 employee roles, or approximately 25% of its current workforce, as it restructures and refocuses on its core business, and to position itself for long-term and profitable growth".</p>
<p>According to the interim CEO Jim Whitehurst: "We are reducing the number of things we are doing in order to focus on our core business and drive our long-term success and profitability".</p>
<p>Plenty of this is still from the ongoing fallout of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">absolute mess</a> that was runtime fee, that caused <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-is-leaving-effective-immediately/" target="_blank">John Riccitiello to leave as CEO</a>. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Unity is used by some of the most popular games around and according to SteamDB over 40,000 games on Steam use Unity. This includes hits like Vampire Survivors, Lethal Company, Hollow Knight, Valheim, Rust, Cities: Skylines, RimWorld and the list just goes on and on to name only a semi-recent popular few that you likely know of.</p>
<p>Hopefully Unity will stabilise soon, because I can't imagine what the atmosphere is like to work there right now, imagine having all this like a black cloud over your head? With a probability of more to come as the restructuring continues. Game developers need things to calm down too, since many thousands rely on it for upcoming and existing games still being supported.</p>

      <title>Celebrate Economic Strategy with the Steam Capitalism and Economy Fest</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Economy simulation and city management may not be the first thing most people think of when they think about video games. But it is one of the most longstanding genres in gaming, going all the way back to the 1980's. And if you've been looking to get into the genre or just check something new out, now's a great time with an entire sale highlighting some of the most noteworthy modern simulation games.</p>
<p>From the beloved Cities: Skylines to obscure stuff like Recettear: An Item Shop's Tale, there's a little something for everyone in this sale. As my expertise in game genres is more blowing stuff up than planning economies; I'll instead be going through a sampler platter and determining the best games in the sale based on reviews, how interesting it looks to me, and how good a deal it is.</p>
<p>It should be noted these aren't games that optimally fit into the Steam Deck's normal control format, but we'll list Deck support anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/" target="_blank">Cities Skylines</a> ($<s>29.99</s> $8.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable / Native Linux Support</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285310/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_Deluxe/" target="_blank">RollerCoaster Tycoon: Deluxe</a> ($<s>5.99</s> $2.99) <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable / ProtonDB Gold</p>

<p>Like I've said, my economy simulator knowledge isn't great. So I welcome any additional game suggestions in the comments I might have missed that you love. You can check out the sale <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/capitalism_economy" target="_blank">here </a>and keep in mind that it runs until January 15 at 10 AM PST / 6PM UTC.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal Half-Life 2 RTX, plus GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/amd-announces-radeon-rx-7600-xt-ryzen-8000g-series-and-new-ryzen-5000-series-cpus/" target="_blank">AMD did today for CES 2024</a>, much of NVIDIA's event was also all about AI but there's a few bits in there for normal consumers like the announcement of Half-Life 2 RTX, plus GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs.</p>
<p>Half-Life 2 RTX is using RTX Remix, just like Portal with RTX and Portal: Prelude RTX, and it's community-made by "four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, now working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios" who are "rebuilding materials with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) properties, adding extra geometric detail via Valve’s Hammer editor, and leveraging NVIDIA technologies including full ray tracing, DLSS 3, Reflex, and RTX IO to deliver a fantastic experience for GeForce RTX gamers".</p>
<p>First look video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aM_gzfAMdNs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e56751632013bf42dd4b7a5800a3a35.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aM_gzfAMdNs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>NVIDIA have announced that RTX Remix will hit Open Beta on January 22nd.</p>
<p>As for the new GPUs coming they are they GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER and GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER which NVIDIA say "supercharge the latest games and form the core of AI-powered PCs":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A 4K Monster: The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER</strong><br/>
The GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER powers fully ray-traced games in 4K resolution. At 1.4x faster than the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti without DLSS Frame Generation, the RTX 4080 SUPER delivers blistering performance with traditional rasterization. With 836 AI TOPS, DLSS Frame Generation delivers an extra performance boost, making the RTX 4080 SUPER twice as fast as the RTX 3080 Ti. The RTX 4080 SUPER features more cores and faster memory for a performance edge. It will be available starting Jan. 31 from $999.</p>
<p><strong>Precision Gaming: The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER</strong><br/>
The RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is the ideal GPU for maxing out games at super-high frame rates at 1440p, and up to 4K. Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti, it has more cores, an increased frame buffer to 16GB, and a 256-bit memory bus, providing a significant memory bandwidth increase to 672 GB/sec. It is 1.6x faster than a RTX 3070 Ti and 2.5x with DLSS 3. The GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER will be available starting Jan. 24 at $799.</p>
<p><strong>Perfectly Balanced: The GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER</strong><br/>
The RTX 4070 SUPER arrives with 20% more cores than the RTX 4070, making it faster than an RTX 3090 at a fraction of the power. With DLSS 3, its lead stretches to 1.5x faster. It will be available starting Jan. 17 at $599.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something else they did a demo of during the event was NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/ace" target="_blank">ACE</a>), a "suite of technologies that help developers bring digital avatars to life with generative AI", and showed off a scene of two characters giving entirely dynamic chat (although pretty robotic sounding). No doubt over the next few years we're going to see a lot more AI like this implemented into games to have randomly generated conversations with voice over and lip syncing all together.</p>
<p>See all on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com" target="_blank">NVIDIA.com</a>. </p>

      <title>AMD announces Radeon RX 7600 XT, Ryzen 8000G series and new Ryzen 5000 series CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amongst a whole lot of technobabble about AI AI and more AI, AMD today announced the Radeon RX 7600 XT, Ryzen 8000G series and new Ryzen 5000 series CPUs. For any normal consumer, their event was a hard boring watch with business people patting each-other on the back about AI advancements but here's the gist of what was actually revealed today.</p>
<p>Firstly of all they announced the Radeon RX 7600 XT GPU with 16GB GDDR6 for 1080p gaming, starting at $329 releasing January 24th. Nothing really special here, it's a slight bump over the RX 7600 with more RAM, slightly boosted clock speeds and a higher typical board power at 190 W.</p>
<p>Now onto the processors, starting with the new AMD Ryzen 8000G Series desktop processors for the AM5 platform, which bring forth AMD's new dedicated AI neural processing unit (NPU) to desktop PC processors, built on top of Zen 4. All of the 8000G Series processors include a Radeon 700M series graphics too.</p>
<p>Here's the models available starting January 31st for SI partners and for OEMs in "Q2 2024":</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt v2.9.1 released for easy compatibility tool installs on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtonUp-Qt is an essential tool to help you install and manage GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda, Wine-GE and more for Steam, Heroic and Lutris for Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>But why would you need it? Well, sometimes Valve's official Proton doesn't work well with a game, so you need GE-Proton. If you want to easily play third-party upgraded game engines for some classic Steam games like OpenMW for Morrowind or OpenXcom for X-COM and so on (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">see my previous article</a>) you can use Luxtorpeda and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/releases/tag/v2.9.1" target="_blank">Version 2.9.1</a> was just released and here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a Shortcut Editor for Steam.</li>
<li>Dxvk-Async: Use <a href="https://gitlab.com/Ph42oN/dxvk-gplasync/" target="_blank">Ph42oN</a>'s releases instead of <a href="https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async/" target="_blank">Sporif</a>'s.</li>
<li>NorthstarProton: Use the <a href="https://github.com/R2NorthstarTools/NorthstarProton" target="_blank">R2NorthstarTools</a> repo instead of the <a href="https://github.com/cyrv6737" target="_blank">cyrv6737</a> repo.</li>
<li>Wine-GE: Match extract folder name (see PR <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/pull/296" target="_blank">#296</a> for details).</li>
<li>Allow configuring GitHub/GitLab access tokens in the ProtonUp-Qt configuration file (see <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/issues/161#issuecomment-1358200080" target="_blank">#161 (comment)</a>).</li>
<li>Various i18n, UI and UX enhancements. </li>
</ul>

      <title>JSAUX revealed an upgraded transparent RGB Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you've got a Steam Deck, an ROG Ally, a Lenovo Legion Go or whatever else is going from the likes of AYANEO and GPD you may want to look into the new upgraded transparent RGB Docking Station from JSAUX.</p>
<p>Much like the previous version you can get two different models with varying connections. Not only have they given it a transparent casing, which looks really slick, but they've upgraded the internals as well to offer ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), QFT (Quick Frame Transport) and HDR (High Dynamic Range). So it's quite a big spec boost to an already great little dock.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10179862111704719879gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10179862111704719879gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The models HB1201S ($99.99) and HB0801S ($69.99) are available for pre-sale, with expected shipping in mid-to-late January.</p>
<p>I actually have the original non-transparent one they sent over, and it is quite a nice little device with a lot of connections on it (the 12-in-1 version) that really does open up a lot of options when docking the Steam Deck regularly so I can happily suggest taking a look at the new upgraded transparent edition. My only gripe with it is the pull-out slot to actually put your handheld in feels just a little flimsy because of the thin plastic. Other than that - great.</p>

      <title>Okay boomers, you get a shooter category on Steam now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have finally done it, they've actually gone and made Boomer Shooter an official category on Steam. Since there's quite a lot of them now, and more releasing every day, it makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>From sound designer Andrew Hulshult on X (formerly Twitter) who <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewHulshult/status/1743039322406691283" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term "boomer shooter" was a lovingly cheeky term we saw used once when developing Dusk as a description for Doom. So we ran with it because it was funny. It would go on to be associated with a entire genre of shooters. Today it's a category on steam. I love this reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10029001931704716681gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10029001931704716681gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - the Boomer Shooter category, the top rotating banner.</em></p>
<p>From Dusk to ULTRAKILL, there's according to Steam 107 games in this category, with only 24 having Native Linux support but no doubt most if not all will work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>. Looks like a few I missed too so I can't wait to dive in and get discovering a potential new favourite.</p>
<p>Go check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/tags/en/Boomer%20Shooter/" target="_blank">Boomer Shooter category</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam hits new user record for 2024 and a record for games released last year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yesterday, January 7th, Steam hit a new all-time record for concurrent users online showing that nothing can stop Valve's growth here thanks to the popularity of video games.</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps even the Steam Deck has been helping push up the overall Steam user numbers. Wouldn't be a surprise there, considering that it does enable you to play more games wherever you are. I know I've been playing more since the Steam Deck released - have you?</p>
<p>The new record is 33,675,229 according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, with the previous record of 33,598,520 hit back in March 2023. At the time of the new record 10,653,243 people were actually in-game.</p>
<p>Additionally, Steam had another record-breaking year in 2023 with 14,528 games being released versus 12,558 in 2022 and 11,388 in 2021 and 9,746 in 2020 and…you get the idea. Number goes up. <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> again tracking those numbers making it easy to see at a glance with 2019 being the odd one out there but the overall trend is that every year more and more games are being released on Steam since anyone with $100 can put something on Steam.</p>
<p>I used to think it was an issue, because there's an increasing number of (for lack of a better word) — <em>junk</em>. However, the low barrier to entry, and lack of direct curation by Valve, allows some truly unique stuff to appear and at times do <em>really</em> well. Valve having a more hands-off approach is probably better in the long run, as long as there's good tools for users to discover games they might be interested in, which Valve are gradually improving over time.</p>
<p><em>In case you missed it: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" target="_blank">Steam Deck also hit over 13,000 playable games</a> recently too!</em></p>
<p>How do you feel about so many games releasing each year?</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.7 is out now and it&#39;s one of the largest releases ever</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds announced the release of the Linux kernel 6.7 on Sunday, 7th January 2024 and as it turns out it's one of the largest releases ever.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=widprp4XoHUcsDe7e16YZjLYJWra-dK0hE1MnfPMf6C3Q@mail.gmail.com/" target="_blank">release announcement</a> Torvalds said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we had a little bit more going on last week compared to the holiday week before that, but certainly not enough to make me think we'd want to delay this any further.</p>
<p>End result: 6.7 is (in number of commits: over 17k non-merge commits, with 1k+ merges) one of the largest kernel releases we've ever had, but the extra rc8 week was purely due to timing with the holidays, not about any difficulties with the larger release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going over all the notes here's just some of what's included that seem interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial <a href="https://bcachefs.org" target="_blank">Bcachefs</a> filesystem support.</li>
<li>Btrfs filesystem gains temporary filesystem fsid (temp_fsid) for use on systems like the Steam Deck, for "root partition A/B testing, or can be used for VM root images".</li>
<li>NVIDIA GPU System Processor (GSP) firmware support for the Nouveau open source driver.</li>
<li>Intel Meteor Lake graphics support is now enabled by default.</li>
<li>Enable seamless boot in more cases for AMD GPUs.</li>
<li>Plenty of work for bringing up Intel Lunar Lake support.</li>
<li>More work on FUTEX2 which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/linux-kernel-516-is-out-now-bringing-the-futex2-work-to-help-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">originally created to help Linux gaming</a>.</li>
<li>Plenty of Rust improvements along with an update to the <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com" target="_blank">Rust for Linux website</a>.</li>
<li>Razer Wolverine V2 added to the xpad gamepad driver.</li>
<li>Various improvements to Logitech's wireless support for many devices.</li>
<li>A fix for a kernel crash when connecting Nintendo Joycons (reported on Steam Deck).</li>
</ul>
<p>The full complete kernel 6.7 <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.7" target="_blank">changelog is here</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.5.13 Preview improves WiFi, brings LED brightness controls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed from yesterday Friday, January 5th is that Valve released another Preview update of SteamOS for Steam Deck with a couple more useful changes.</p>
<p>Code named "Here Be Dragons" here's all the changes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3860212413467404192" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.13 Preview</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a slider to control the brightness of the Status LED (Charger LED). This setting can be found under Settings -&gt; Display.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where wifi would fail to connect in certain conditions</li>
<li>Fixed HDR on some external DisplayPort displays being slightly desaturated</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seen a few people note they had WiFi issues recently so hopefully the fix in this, along with the additional WiFi crash-fix from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steamos-3-5-12-preview-and-new-steam-deck-beta-and-steam-desktop-beta-released/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.12 Preview</a> will improve things overall.</p>
<p>How to access SteamOS Preview: go into Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel and select Preview from the drop-down box and then it will need you to restart.</p>
<p>Are you waiting on anything specific being fixed right now that isn't in the latest SteamOS 3.5 Preview versions? Or is there a feature you're desperate for Valve to add into SteamOS still? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>What do you get with it? Over 40 brand new puzzles making use of new game mechanics not seen in the original Portal 2 with:</p>
<ul>

<p>Looks like it could be a good one! I never pass up a chance to play more Portal, hoping one day Valve give us Portal 3, but big mods like this will do <em>for now</em>.</p>

      <title>Ray-Tracing performance uplift coming to the AMD RADV Linux graphics driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source AMD RADV Vulkan driver is set to get some nice looking performance improvements for Ray-Tracing, which should release along with Mesa 24.0.</p>
<p>As mentioned in a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/26105" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> titled "Convert 1D ray launches to 2D" that has been accepted into Mesa developer Friedrich Vock mentioned "Because we use unaligned dispatches, 1D launches only use 8 threads per<br/>
wave. Converting to 2D and fixing up launch IDs in the prolog significantly increases occupancy." that gave a "~30% uplift in Ghostwire Tokyo".</p>
<p>Impressive and then you look into the comments and others are noting more performance improvements in other games too with Adriano Martins <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/26105#note_2162486" target="_blank">mentioning</a> these on an AMD RX 6700 XT:</p>

<p>The MR was open since November 2023, with it being accepted and merged January 5th, 2024.</p>
<p>So it should be available in Mesa 24.0 which is due to release January 31st, 2024. Although that depends how the Release Candidates go with the first RC for Mesa 24.0 due January 10th, 2024.</p>

      <title>As of January 2024 - 75 of the Top 100 most played Steam games work on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an up to date look at the current state of the most played games on Steam, and how many of they run on Steam Deck and Linux as a whole. <em>In case you missed it: the Steam Deck recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" target="_blank">crossed over 13,000 games rated at least Playable</a>.</em></p>
<p>Checking via the Steam Deck Verified rating (either Verified or Playable), and then the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating across Platinum - Gold - Silver - Bronze or Broken / Linux Native Support for desktop Linux.</p>
<p>While the top 100 changes fairly often, it's an interesting way to look at overall compatibility. From top to bottom based on peak player count, here's how things stack up with this snapshot of Steam's most played taken on January 5th - 2024, 18:45 UTC.</p>
<p>Overall we're seeing <strong>75/100</strong> at least rated Playable on Steam Deck and <strong>78/100</strong> work on desktop Linux with a Gold rating on ProtonDB or higher (or the game has official Native Linux support). Of those, 26 advertise they have Native Linux support. Things are looking pretty good overall for the popular games!</p>

<p>So there you have it, that's the current state for the start of 2024. I purposefully kept in a few odd ones like Wallpaper Engine, and Rocket League even though you can no longer get it on Steam, since this is just taking the Top 100 as it is at the time for Steam overall.</p>
<p>At least 12 of the Unsupported games are due to anti-cheat issues, although some like SMITE do need a re-check from Valve. Anti-Cheat continues to be a major source of annoyance for Steam Deck / Linux gamers overall.</p>
<p>Are there any ratings for the games listed above you feel Valve need to change? If so, why? Let me know all your thoughts in the comments on the current state of things.</p>

      <title>Supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM finally hits Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You'll be forgiven for forgetting about the supernatural horror adventure ASYLUM, a game that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter way back in February of 2013 but it's really actually getting close to release now.</p>
<p>Refresher: "From the creators of cult sleeper hit Scratches and the haunting Serena, comes a chilling journey into the darkest depths of your mind. ASYLUM is an ambitious and intricate horror adventure casting you into the hallucinatory setting of the Hanwell Mental Institute, a silent witness to unimaginable atrocities that transpired between its endless corridors."</p>
<p>Developer Senscape put up a fresh <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/agustincordes/asylum-kickstart-the-horror/posts/3997237" target="_blank">announcement</a> on January 1st, 2024 mentioning the Beta milestone, with people outside their development team being able to play it through to the end for the first time. Sounds like it will give around 12 - 15 hours play time, and they have full controller support implemented along with "Steam Deck compatibility coming up".</p>
<p>As for their next steps? Going through all the feedback. Developer Agustín Cordes mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have more work to do. This first round of fresh feedback we received has been invaluable, but so far it presents a crucial milestone: the biggest worry for me has been the game might be too intricate, obtuse, or difficult to digest. Yet what I’m hearing is that, while further tweaks are required, ASYLUM is fun to play, the story is engaging, and keeps your interest until the end. Good exploration is hard to pull off: there’s a fine balance between giving the audience plenty of freedom and things to investigate while retaining a sense of direction and goals, to ensure the experience does not become frustrating. And it feels like we’re on the right track when one of the primary compliments I hear is that the Hanwell Mental Institute is a joy to explore. This is an accomplishment on a personal level, as the ability to explore at leisure has been the #1 thing I enjoy in games since I played King’s Quest for the first time many, many, many years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a little older now but I did a preview of the demo some time ago:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g0aEiFpDc9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/998748ff028d53774120453607ecf558.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g0aEiFpDc9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can follow ASYLUM on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/asylum?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230210/ASYLUM/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> if you're interested.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck officially hits over 13,000 games Playable and Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not too long after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-12000-games-playable-and-verified/" target="_blank">hitting 12,000 games</a>, the Steam Deck now officially has over 13,000 games rated either Verified or Playable. There must be a little something for every type of gamer now right? <em>My backlog is terrifying.</em></p>
<p>At time of writing the current numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified: 4,355</li>
<li>Playable: 8,751</li>
<li>Unsupported: 3,720</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out the full list on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Their list includes titles that have been hidden on Steam, but they still count and are still tested, as anyone who owns them can still download and play. There's various reasons games get hidden like music licenses expiring, developers going bust and so on.</p>
<p>Remember though: if a game <em>hasn't</em> been through Deck Verified to get a rating, you <em>can</em> still download and play it. Valve don't block you from trying, Deck Verified is simply what Valve have tested officially.</p>
<p>For Unsupported games though, that can be for a whole different bag of reasons. From pesky anti-cheat to features that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> just doesn't yet work well with or support at all, as the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux systems is a constant work in progress.</p>
<p>What games are you waiting and hoping will move from Unsupported to Verified one day? Just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" target="_blank">don't expect Fortnite to work any time</a> soon.</p>

      <title>Proton 8.0-5 has a Release Candidate ready for testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Early last month Valve put up a Release Candidate for the next version of Proton, which it seems went completely under the radar. Due to this they've not had much feedback for Proton 8.0-5 so time to get testing.</p>
<p>Posted in a pinned topic on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7318" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, we have no idea when it might actually release properly but you can get testing by finding Proton 8 in your Steam Library, going into the Properties, Betas and select the 8.0-5 Release Candidate from the drop-down box.</p>

      <title>MSI teasing a handheld gaming PC like the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Begun, the handheld wars have. It seems like every company now wants a piece of the pie doesn't it? Even MSI appear to be jumping into the fold now with an announcement due at CES 2024.</p>
<p>We don't exactly have much to go on right now, other than the teaser they posted up on their <a href="http://www.instagram.com/p/C1rM-oos8JQ/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page and on <a href="https://twitter.com/msigaming/status/1742856060581331345" target="_blank">X</a> noting "A whole new breed of MSI dragon is coming.⁠ Get a grip and stay tuned.⁠"</p>
<p>Here's some quick stills from their teaser video:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15055753111704389528gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15055753111704389528gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8726892731704389528gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8726892731704389528gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3615467281704389527gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3615467281704389527gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No doubt it will be another handheld running Windows though instead of Linux, but it's not like that has stopped people! Linux support for the ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, plus various units from GPD and AYANEO have been improving pretty quickly with <a href="https://chimeraos.org" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> being one of the best options.</p>
<p>It's always good to have options! Naturally I'll be sticking to the Steam Deck OLED since it's the most supported available with Linux out of the box.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: as a small addition, it seems this may be Intel powered given the <a href="https://twitter.com/IntelGaming/status/1742984222821024148" target="_blank">reply</a> on social media site X from the official Intel Gaming account with three thinking emoji. Obviously not a lot to go on, but why else would they reply like that?</p>

      <title>Mobile Suit Baba combines Baba Is You puzzling with Into the Breach strategy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indie developer Hempuli Oy has released a follow-up to their incredible puzzle game Baba Is You, this time taking the idea of Into the Breach from Subset Games and putting a new spin on it with Baba Is You word rules. The developer doesn't shy away from the inspiration and clearly states it too.</p>
<p>Here you get the small tiled arenas where you have to complete objectives, but you also have the various word blocks like "Hill Is Stop" that you can push around to change the rules of the level to complete the objectives. A fun idea and it does work quite well!</p>
<p>More: "A mysterious force is out to steal all the Fruit! Help Baba &amp; friends foil their plans by maneuvering gigantic mech suits around. Features tactical puzzling action, heart-wrenching storytelling and extra challenges over a total of 43 missions."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cIaCjtWsaQI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b2c59c7685f5ce782ec3771289477a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cIaCjtWsaQI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you love a blending of puzzles with turn-based strategy, this is one you'll probably enjoy. This isn't the only spin-off from Baba Is You as there's also <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-is-you-xtreme" target="_blank">Baba Is You XTREME</a> and <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/baba-files-taxes" target="_blank">Baba Files Taxes</a> but this is so far the best of the bunch.</p>
<p>Available for <a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/mobile-suit-baba" target="_blank">$4 on itch.io</a>. There's no Linux version like with Baba Is You but my testing showed it working great with the latest Wine 9.0 RC 3.</p>

      <title>Bodycam horror shooter Chasmal Fear looks like a riot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MystiveDev emailed in about Chasmal Fear, an upcoming horror shooter you play as if you're viewing it from a bodycam set in an underwater facility.</p>
<p>More about it: "Chasmal Fear is a first-person tactical shooter survival horror game that puts players in a mysteriously empty sci-fi underwater facility where something has gone terribly wrong. Ammo is scarce. The odds are stacked against you. Choose wisely between fighting or sneaking past the monstrosities which once killed might mutate into something even worse. Unlock hidden areas and solve puzzles to uncover the truth of what happened in this top-secret facility. Every decision will impact your gameplay experience, some swarming relentless monsters against you while others offering the chance to employ stealth and cunning to survive."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Bq3RG8mcLZ8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccd363ba52e8274f6cb8553755c11e34.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Bq3RG8mcLZ8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When queried about Steam Deck and Linux support the developer mentioned: "Currently, the game is built for Windows, but we're aiming to make it playable both on Mac and Linux before full release."</p>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>LIMITED RESOURCES - Limited player ammo and scarce ammo boxes will encourage players to think strategically and be cautious while traversing the abandoned steel hallways.</li>
<li>IMMERSIVE BODYCAM - Artistic direction that utilizes the perspective of a bodycam footage. Set in the near future, players are also equipped with an AR Interface to help you through the dark hallways of the Magnus Facility.</li>
<li>MONSTER MUTATION SYSTEM - Some monsters will randomly start to mutate when killed into a stronger form. Do not be surprised when you encounter more dangerous foes in an area you thought you cleaned out. Make sure to end them before the mutation starts.</li>
<li>CHOICES AFFECT YOUR PLAYTHROUGH - Your choices will affect your gameplay experience. Choosing to open one way will close other paths to your next goal. Depending on your choice, you can dive guns blazing or sneak stealthily above a swarm of enemies; hide in the shadows or use your environment to squash the monstrosities.</li>
<li>FULLY RANDOMIZED EVENTS - Randomized events occurring throughout the game that provide replayability from varying sounds, crumbling ceilings, floors and unexpected scares.</li>
<li>ULTRA-REALISTIC ENVIRONMENTS - Ultra-realistic, sci-fi underwater station built underneath the waves and inside a massive ocean cliff. Its hallways seem abandoned. It is up to you to find your way out and survive the things that lurk within.</li>
<li>CO-OP POSSIBILITY - Bring a friend to Chasmal Fear and survive this nightmare together. The difficulty changes procedurally based on whether you play singleplayer or multiplayer co-op.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks pretty great so one to keep an eye on!</p>

      <title>dotAGE now Steam Deck Verified and sold over 30K copies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing that the indie dream for some is alive and well, the merciless survival roguelite turn-based city builder dotAGE has managed to sell over 30,000 copies in three months. It's also now Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>The solo developer of the game, Michele Pirovano, announced the sales milestone on <a href="https://twitter.com/dotagegame/status/1741048989334814907" target="_blank">X</a> (formerly Twitter) noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the end of the year in sight, I am very happy to announce that dotAGE has now sold more than 30k copies on Steam! This is an indie dream made real! Not even in my wildest dreams I would have thought of reaching such a milestone!! Thank you so much for all your support!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering that last year we saw over 14,000 games released (the most ever in one year for Steam), it goes to show that a good game can sell well even with insane competition from developers of all sizes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042007891704378750gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042007891704378750gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The other good news is that as of January 3rd, the game has been Steam Deck Verified by Valve! dotAGE has Native Linux support too and there's even a demo.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/638510/dotAGE/" target="_blank">dotAGE on Steam</a>. The developer previously sent over a copy, and I fully recommend grabbing a copy — it's great and easily one of my highlights of 2023.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint planning an upgraded EDGE ISO with kernel 6.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people wanting to install Linux Mint on newer devices, the Linux Mint team have announced a plan to update their EDGE ISOs with a later Linux kernel in the latest <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4619" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post goes over recent funding, of which December 2023 was a high-point and the most they've seen donated to the project all year at $24,146 USD but still just below last year's level.</p>
<p>Giving an update on the status of the upcoming Linux Mint 21.3 release, the Beta phase sounds like it's going well with 50 bug reports being sent in and 35 of them already closed. Linux Mint Debian Edition 6 will also be getting all the improvements from the main Linux Mint 21.3 release.</p>
<p>For the 21.3 EDGE ISO, which they provide for people who have issues booting systems with their main downloads, they will be releasing a 21.3 EDGE ISO with Linux kernel 6.5 as they said "During BETA testing we identified compatibility issues between Linux Mint and new hardware devices (recent AMD graphics but also wireless chipsets and SSD controllers used in Acer laptops). These are solved by upgrading the kernel series from 5.15 to 6.5.".</p>
<p>Since they go by what kernels Ubuntu officially provide, since Mint is based on Ubuntu, they're stuck with whatever the latest Ubuntu provides since Mint don't package up their own kernels.</p>

<p>What have you been playing recently on either Steam Deck or desktop Linux?</p>
<p>I am currently going through the original Alan Wake (I have zero idea what's going on…), and after that I plan to finally do a proper Fallout 4 play-through. I decided to actually start going through some of my own library to play through games collecting dust and the Steam Deck is just magic for that.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 hits initial funding goal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team are currently running a <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/plasma6member/" target="_blank">funding campaign</a> to help bring in more monies to support Plasma desktop development, and thankfully well ahead of the Plasma 6 release they've managed to hit the initial goal.</p>
<p>With the first two goals of getting 550 paying members hit, they've managed to pull in a good amount of funding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to your generosity, we now have the funds to take on the launch of Plasma 6 and all the challenges that come with it, as well as count on enough funds to commission artwork and designs from professional artists, ensuring new and beautiful wallpapers, websites, logos, and icons for Plasma 6's first year of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they're hoping to add another 100 members as their stretch-goal on their funding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our second stretch goal aims to add 100 more members and give us the means to fund the upkeep of all the infrastructure and resources for developers and external communications. This covers a wide range of things, from paying the rent for the servers used for development and internal communication among community members, to designing and maintaining public websites, forums, communication with the media, creating merchandise, promotion at non-FLOSS events, and more. Our deadline for this second stretch goal is the launch date of Plasma 6 on February 28, 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18395821891704289040gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18395821891704289040gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A reminder on the rest of the Plasma 6 roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>

      <title>Linux hits nearly 4% desktop user share on Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to Statcounter, which should be taken with a pinch of salt of course like any sampling, the Linux share on the desktop hit nearly 4% in December 2023. Last month was a record too and a clear trend over time, as going back a couple of years, it was rarely coming close to 2% but now it's repeatedly nearing 4% so it's quite a good sign overall.</p>
<p>The latest from Statcounter shows for all of 2023 below:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - 2.91%</li>
<li>February - 2.94%</li>
<li>March - 2.85%</li>
<li>April - 2.83%</li>
<li>May - 2.7%</li>
<li>June - 3.07%</li>
<li>July - 3.12%</li>
<li>August - 3.18%</li>
<li>September - 3.02%</li>
<li>October - 2.92%</li>
<li>November - 3.22%</li>
<li><strong>December - 3.82%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at December it shows Windows rising too, with macOS dropping down. If we actually take ChromeOS directly into the Linux numbers for December 2023 the overall number would actually be 6.24% (ChromeOS is Linux after all).</p>
<p>Here's how just Linux looks over time on Statcounter since early 2009 until now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/996456521704281563gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/996456521704281563gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Seems like a pretty clear trend over time don't you think? Nice to see this happening elsewhere, just like we've seen over years <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/linux-use-on-steam-ends-2023-with-a-multi-year-high-thanks-steam-deck/" target="_blank">with the Steam Survey</a>.</p>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall remake Daggerfall Unity 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another really impressive project that just got a big final release is The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall game engine remake Daggerfall Unity which has hit the 1.0 meaning it's now complete!</p>
<p>With it you get the classic Daggerfall experience plus many enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform without emulation (Windows/Linux/Mac).</li>
<li>Retro graphics are boosted by modern engine and lighting.</li>
<li>High resolution widescreen with classic style.</li>
<li>Optionally play in retro mode 320×200 or 640×400 with VGA palettes.</li>
<li>Optionally overhaul the graphics and gameplay with mods.</li>
<li>Huge draw distances even without mods.</li>
<li>Smooth first-person controls.</li>
<li>Quality of life enhancements.</li>
<li>Extensive mod support with an active creator community.</li>
<li>Translation support via community mods.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does require a copy of the original DOS Daggerfall to run as that provides all necessary game assets such as textures, 3D models, and sound effects. Thankfully it's a free game nowadays, so you can just pinch it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of good mods available for it too like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/5" target="_blank">DREAM</a> that remasters all the game assets including sound, music, videos &amp; all graphics found in the game making it just that little bit more modern:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6404153901704280256gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6404153901704280256gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Note: while the code is open source it does still require the proprietary Unity game engine.</em></p>

      <title>Linux use on Steam ends 2023 with a multi-year high (thanks Steam Deck)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out now for December 2023, and it shows that Linux and Steam Deck overall finished 2023 on a very positive note.</p>
<p>Something I continue showing over time on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, we can see that December 2023 is the highest it's been in multiple years. Only <em>just</em> beating the previous high of July 2023 by 0.01%! This is all largely thanks to Valve's Steam Deck that ships with SteamOS Linux, and Proton that continues to help tens of thousands of games be playable on Linux systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9032671351704217237gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9032671351704217237gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the December 2023 overall operating system results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.40% -0.16%</li>
<li>Linux 1.97% +0.06%</li>
<li>OSX 1.63% +0.10%</li>
</ul>
<p>And just on the Linux side the most popular Linux distributions for gaming on Steam are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit (Steam Deck) 40.53% -2.46%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.85% +0.04%</li>

<p>It's worth noting that the Steam Deck has been a top seller over the last few weeks too. For the week starting Tuesday, November 14th it went back to 1st place globally on Steam (in supported regions obviously) and remained number 1 until Tuesday, December 19th where it dropped to 2nd place and has remained 2nd the following week up until today. So clearly Valve are still shifting plenty of units.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the most played Steam Deck games of 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released the annual Best of lists, and so we can see what the most played games are across the whole of 2023 for the Steam Deck so here's what's up.</p>
<p>Measured by Daily Active Players across Platinum: 1st - 12th, Gold: 13th - 24th and  Silver: 25th - 50th these are the most popular games on Steam Deck overall for 2023. However, Valve said they're only including games in the list that have a Deck Verified status of Verified or Playable. Additionally, each list is also randomly sorted, unlike their usual monthly shout-outs which are from highest to lowest.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.0.11 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear <strong>fheroes2</strong> project supporters and Heroes of Might and Magic II fans!</p>
<p>The team is pleased to present the new version of the fheroes2 engine - <strong><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.0.11" target="_blank">1.0.11</a></strong> after a month of hard work. As in any other release, we made many changes and are happy to share the news with you.</p>
<p>The "<em><strong>Battle Only</strong></em>" mode has undergone a substantial revamp, boasting an improved user interface and a newfound capability to <strong>save the state of selections</strong> within the dialog. These enhancements promise a more immersive and user-friendly experience for players engaging in battle-centric gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754215341703710487gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754215341703710487gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Continuing our commitment to refining the gaming experience, the <em><strong>AI</strong></em> has received a notable upgrade. The AI makes better decisions during battles while defending its troops.</p>
<p>The work on the <em><strong>Editor</strong></em> continues. The team added <strong>a base file format</strong> for future maps, which will incorporate a greater number of features compared to the original map format.<br/>
Additionally, the Editor has been expanded with <strong>Castle and Town placement logic</strong>, along with the inclusion of <strong>Ocean objects</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4430979271703710487gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4430979271703710487gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The majority of the work focused on modifying the code for the Editor and preparing the game to support the upcoming map format.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8104803321703710486gol573.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8104803321703710486gol573.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>In this release, the team also polished multiple places in the <em><strong>UI</strong></em>, such as difficulty selection in campaigns, Tree of Knowledge quick info dialog, making AI heroes' animations depend on their speed, and many more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8458767291703710485gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8458767291703710485gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall, <strong>more than 30 issues</strong> have been fixed in this release, and many translations have been updated.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your invaluable support, and we hope you will enjoy this release!<br/>

      <title>Festive Co-Op Games</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p style="text-align:left">Hopefully, like me, you’ll have booked in a bit of premium gaming time around the festive period. And coincidentally, Valve’s Winter Steam Sale kicked off just a couple of days before Christmas. Since so many of us and our friends are off, this marks the perfect time of year to dip your toe into the wonderful world of co-operative games. I have two friends I game with pretty regularly, and as a result, I was surprised to see that my game collection boasts a pretty staggering number of “best played with friends” titles. So I thought I’d share the love, albeit with apologies that the vast bulk of these titles are both Steam-only and non-native.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The only thing I’m going to exclude from this little round up is MMOs. While they often have compelling co-op elements, I’m just not comfortable recommending any of those, given how long I’ve been out of the MMO scene.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I’m also going to focus on “Online Co-Op”, although some of these titles also support split-screen local and Steam Remote Play Together options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><big><strong>Well Known Titles</strong></big></h4>
<p style="text-align:left">Let’s start with some of the better known options. There are honestly too many big names to list, so lets put aside some of the more obvious ones like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/" target="_blank">Terraria</a>, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344520/Diablo_IV/" target="_blank">Diablo</a> series, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/" target="_blank">Payday 2</a>/<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a> and so on, and focus on the quirkier options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Overcooked 2</em></strong> (<s>Proton</s> Native!)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Pure chaos in even just two player mode, this game supports up to four players at once, as you battle to fulfil food orders by chopping ingredients, steaming, frying and boiling, then plating up and serving, then cleaning, all across increasing inventive, often-changing levels. It sounds simple, it starts simple, but over time, the complexity ramps up resulting in an odd combination of pure frustration and chaotic fun. Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/728880/Overcooked_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Spelunky 2</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">The original Spelunky is ten years old now and featured local co-op, but when developer Mossmouth released its sequel in 2020, it had online co-op baked in. Up to four players in a rich, procedurally-generated set of challenging biomes. The opportunity for absolute chaos through emergent gameplay makes this one a co-op gem. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418530/Spelunky_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/spelunky" target="_blank">original is also on GOG</a>, but the follow up never made it.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Hammerwatch 2</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">While the original Hammerwatch is still playable and sports a native version, the follow up is a considerable step up in graphics, albeit Windows-only. The combat in this sequel feels much more satisfying and polished, and the game world hints at a much greater depth too. I've not played long yet, but I'm looking forward to more. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538970/Hammerwatch_II/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, although the original game is available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/hammerwatch" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Remnant: From the Ashes</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A unique FPS, Remnant combines weak-spot shooting with a souls-like dodge-roll mechanic tied to a stamina-gauge and a diverse set of RPG upgrades. Runs are randomised and you could complete the game without unlocking/finding all the weapons on offer, nor the various magical upgrades you can apply to each. Remnant is on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/617290/Remnant_From_the_Ashes/" target="_blank">Steam</a> only. If you enjoy this one, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/Remnant_II/" target="_blank">its sequel</a> is only a few months old.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10037898301703625657gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10037898301703625657gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Warhammer 40000: Darktide</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Developer Fatshark never did get EAC to work reliably in its earlier title, Vermintude 2, so I didn’t have high hopes for Darktide. However, not only is it perfectly playable (including hosting/joining multiplayer), I’m enjoying this far more than I did the fantasy setting of the earlier Vermintude games. Fight for the Emperor as one of four extremely customisable characters classes in multiple L4D2-like mission-based scenarios. If you can look past the obnoxious monetisation model, this is worth a look. It really does a great job of delivering the Warhammer 40K atmosphere with excellent voice acting and brilliantly realised environments. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Gunfire Reborn</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I won’t go into too much detail except to note that this is amongst the greatest co-op roguelite shooters ever made. If you enjoy an FPS and you haven’t played this yet, then you owe it to yourself to give this one a shot. Only on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1217060/Gunfire_Reborn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the two DLC expansion character packs are well worth picking up if you enjoyed the base game.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A little rough around the edges, but this gem really captures the vibe from the Aliens movie and shoves it right in your face. With an innovative upgrade system for 7 unique classes, you'll need to find two friends (or the somewhat lacklustre bots) to take down aliens and androids across 12 sprawling missions. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549970/Aliens_Fireteam_Elite/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><strong>Less Well Known</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Inkbound</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">This incredible roguelite from the creators of Monster Train is my current obsession. Despite being turn-based, all players spend their round in real-time which ensures a snappy pace. There are some fantastic synergies to exploit by playing different characters together - group the enemies with the Weaver's "Stitch" skill, pound the grouped enemies with an AoE "Leaping Strike" from the Magma Miner, then pulse an arena-wide "Seismic Slam" taunt as the Obelisk and tank all the resulting counter-attacks on your shields, thereby protecting your allies. Huge meta progression, a subtle (and ignorable if you wish) plot providing world building, and more challenges and missions than you can shake a stick at, this one is highly recommended. Get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062810/Inkbound/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14790961491703635735gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14790961491703635735gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17104611901703635734gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17104611901703635734gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Ember Knights</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A room based roguelite for up to 4 players, you can specialise in any of six unique weapons as you fight and dodge roll your way to the perfect build, choosing from 17 secondary skills and 85 relics as you and your friends progress. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135230/Ember_Knights/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Helldivers</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Do you like accidentally killing your friends? Do you enjoy a brutal challenge of near-never ending enemies? Do you like the stress of tapping button combos to radio-in airstrikes, turrets or mech support? If so, go play Helldivers immediately. There’s a reason this game has a button that simply throws your character on the ground. Keeping track of turret or mech fire while trying to disarm a nuke or prime an energy generator is shockingly difficult. But great fun with up to 4 players. Lots of DLC on this one, but the Digital Deluxe edition packages the game and all DLC for around the price of a pint of lager. Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/394510/HELLDIVERS_Dive_Harder_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Ravenswatch</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Challenging, satisfying, beautiful. Three words to sum up Passtech’s co-op follow up to Curse of the Dead Gods. Still in development, the first two missions/bosses are complete and will give you around an hour’s play per attempt. The roguelite upgrades in this one will make or break your build across a variety of deeply varied characters as you and up to three friends race against the clock to level up before the boss showdown. Highly recommended, available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2071280/Ravenswatch/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9155036071703626336gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9155036071703626336gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Stolen Realm</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">What’s this? A real-time turn-based RPG looter with accessible-yet-deep character customisation across 9 skill trees. Real-time, but turn-based? Yep it’s turn-based, but up to 6 players all take their turns in real-time, creating either wonderful harmonies, or friend-losing chaos, before ending their segment and letting the enemies take their go. An event system will also drop permanent relics and the developers have recently launched a roguelike-version of the gameplay loop for those players not willing to sink tens of hours into the world-based campaign. Find this gem on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1330000/Stolen_Realm/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Spellmasons</em></strong> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">A recent addition to my library, I haven’t delved into this much yet, but basically take Noita’s wand-building and throw it into a turn-based top-down map that sees you constructing clever chained take downs of multiple enemies as you move from map to map, collecting new abilities along the way. This one supports up 8 players which must be absolute chaos. Spellmasons is on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1618380/Spellmasons/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Blackout Protocol</strong></em> (Proton)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">With hints of Alien Swarm, Blackout Protocol gives you and up to two more friends the opportunity to choose from a variety of weapons, skills and grenades as you take on its top-down, wonderfully lit, pseudo-3D missions. Early builds were ridiculously challenging, but recent updates have made the game somewhat more accessible. It’s got some nice grindy meta-progression to help out longer-term too. You can grab this one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111870/Blackout_Protocol/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Necesse</em></strong> (Native)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Not one I’ve played a lot of, but from my time in this surprisingly deep world, it’s a curious cross of Terraria-style base-building and Core Keeper dungeon-diving, with a top-down perspective. You can play with up to 4 players as you build a village around your base while hunting for crafting supplies underground. The UI is a little rough around the edges, but it gets regular updates and appears to have something of a cult following, with well over 10 thousand steam reviews, mostly positive. Grab it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1169040/Necesse/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong><em>Vagante</em></strong> (Native)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Take Spelunky, zoom it out a little, add in RPG-mechanics, focus on combat and hey presto! Vagante has so many Spelunky mechanics, you’ll be right at home switching between them. Cooking chickens for health, spikes that one-shot your character, falling blocks, it’s uncanny. In 50 hours, I’ve never beaten the game, but like Spelunky, it rarely tips over from maddeningly-addictive to actual frustration. Terrible UI, but worth the learning curve as the mechanics are rock solid. Get it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/323220/Vagante/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"></p>
<h4 style="text-align:left"><strong>All the rest</strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:left">There are just so many. It feels like online-coop has experienced a real surge in the past few years, possibly powered by Steam’s networking stack, as you can see from how few on this list actually make it to GOG. Here’s a few more games for you to take a look at, if the list above didn’t sate your appetite.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I can recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/258970/Gauntlet_Slayer_Edition/" target="_blank">Gauntlet</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank">Outriders</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/512900/Streets_of_Rogue/" target="_blank">Streets of Rogue</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">Don’t Starve Together</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Dying Light</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1201540/HELLCARD/" target="_blank">Hellcard</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/274190/Broforce/" target="_blank">Broforce</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1968730/Bounty_of_One/" target="_blank">Bounty of One</a>, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/35700/Trine_Enchanted_Edition/" target="_blank">Trine</a> series, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/211820/Starbound/" target="_blank">Starbound</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649240/Returnal/" target="_blank">Returnal</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/204360/Castle_Crashers/" target="_blank">Castle Crashers</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/465200/Fury_Unleashed/" target="_blank">Fury Unleashed</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/Alien_Swarm_Reactive_Drop/" target="_blank">Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2221490/Tom_Clancys_The_Division_2/" target="_blank">The Division 2</a> and pretty much all the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/" target="_blank">Borderlands</a> games.</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Steam’s Winter Sale is on until January 4th, so if you fancy anything on this list, check it out before then, as most of these have pretty substantial discounts until then. Happy co-op gaming!</p>

      <title>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from GamingOnLinux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's coming up on Christmas now, and so GamingOnLinux will be going into it's usual <em>mostly</em> hibernating state to take a little break to recharge. Apart from any sudden big stories that appear, or just plain boredom from me (or guest contributions), you can expect news to be rather quiet over the next week.</p>
<p>A <strong>big</strong> thank you to all supporters, commenters and readers for an absolute knock-out of a year that smashed through pretty much every record I think we've ever had for everything. It continues to be a real pleasure to run GamingOnLinux and follow how Linux gaming continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Just a reminder that if you wish to support me and GamingOnLinux the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" target="_blank">links are available here any time</a> which includes the affiliate store links to buy games while also supporting GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p>GamingOnLinux will return to properly normal operations around January 3rd, 2024.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and have a wonderful and safe New Year celebration!</p>

      <title>Godot 4.3 dev 1 brings major rendering changes - plus W4 Games on console support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team working on Godot Engine have released the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-3-dev-1/" target="_blank">first snapshot of Godot 4.3</a> which brings with it some big rendering changes that sound quite exciting overall.</p>
<p>According to the post they've done a "Major refactoring of the rendering system (GH-83452), which paves the way to several big improvements coming soon", one of which <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/collaboration-with-google-forge-2023/" target="_blank">linked</a> in the post is a collaboration with Google and The Forge to further improve Vulkan.</p>
<p>There's also now a new Direct3D 12 rendering driver, multiple controllers can now contribute to input actions, node groups can now be configured project-wide, freed objects are now treated differently from null in comparison operators, loading of scenes with corrupted or missing dependencies will no longer be aborted and an infamous bug causing areas to lose signal connections when pausing/unpausing the game has been fixed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Meanwhile W4 Games, the company started up by some of the core Godot team, has <a href="https://w4games.com/2023/12/11/w4-games-announces-pricing-model-for-console-ports/" target="_blank">announced</a> their pricing for console port support for Godot. It's good to see a proper option out there now, as console support for Godot was something of a sore point for developers. The pricing may be a bitter pill to swallow for solo developers considering it's $800 just for a single console up to $2,000 for the big three together (and that's <em>every</em> year too), pricier still if you're a bigger team or if you have a publisher.</p>
<p>They did catch a fair bit of flak for it across social media that I saw, with multiple developers believing such console port support should have come from the Godot Foundation, <em>not</em> a separate company set up specifically to turn a profit like W4 Games (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/w4-games-raises-15m-to-help-push-godot-engine/" target="_blank">who have investors now</a>). These developers mentioned the conflict of interest between the Godot Foundation and W4 Games, considering some people work for both. Various sources of developers not happy with it: <a href="https://twitter.com/pawel_developer/status/1734791483541028954" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/epyoncf/status/1734570315097821377" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ScottTRichmond/status/1736777179088961913" target="_blank">#3</a> and so on.</p>
<p>For comparison on the pricing (specifically for console support):</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity: minimum $2,040 per-person per-year, plus the Runtime Fee or or 2.5% of your game’s monthly gross revenue when you hit $1,000,000 (USD) gross revenue on a trailing 12 month basis <em>and</em> 1,000,000 lifetime initial engagements.</li>
<li>Game Maker is $800 a year.</li>
<li>Unreal Engine is free until you hit the 5% revenue share (lifetime gross revenue from that product exceeds $1 million USD).</li>
<li>Defold is completely free.</li>
</ul>
<p>Worth noting as well of course Godot is open source and no one is forced to use W4 Games, and any other company could make cheaper console ports too.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>Steam Winter Sale 2023 is live, along with The Steam Awards voting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It is that time again! Valve launched the Steam Winter Sale 2023 and The Steam Awards are also open for voting for your favourite titles now too.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1342857031703184031gol1.jpg"/></p>

<p>Looking over the Steam Awards, I'm genuinely surprised to see that the "Most Innovative Gameplay Award" category…has Starfield in the runnings.

      <title>The Talos Principle 2 gets Steam Deck Verified, plus a big Beta update is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new puzzle game to add to your collection? Good news for you, as The Talos Principle 2 has now been bumped up to Steam Deck Verified status after testing from Valve.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best games of 2023. Much bigger and even more interesting than the first game, with plenty of new puzzle mechanics thrown in giving you a thought-provoking, character-driven interactive story with multiple endings. Initially Valve only gave it a Steam Deck Playable status, but multiple patches later and a re-test and now Valve have given it full seal of Verified approval. Works great on desktop Linux too with Proton 8!</p>
<p>The developers announced the status in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/835960/view/3890611245666460224" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, along with giving details on an opt-in Beta that brings with it numerous enhancements like a benchmark mode, water ripples, extra lore content and various visual fixes, gameplay improvements, bug fixes, improvements to their shader system (including a progress bar for shaders precaching) and much more.</p>

      <title>Check out this great overview of NVK, the open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Faith Ekstrand has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-holiday-update.html" target="_blank">given a holiday update</a> on the state of NVK, the unofficial open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver and how it's coming along that's worth a read as it's all quite exciting.</p>
<p>The progress on it has been quite ridiculous! At the end of 2022 they had a bare-bones Vulkan 1.0 implementation that only ran a few demos. Now a year later, not only does it have support for around 80 Vulkan extensions and major features but it also support nearly everything needed by DXVK and Zink.</p>
<p>How's performance? Ekstrand mentioned now there's "proper power management and performance improvements in NVK" they can hit around 40-60% of NVIDIA's proprietary driver in "several games". Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1736234565428302200" target="_blank">put up a post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) recently noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decided to try it.. Hat in Time 1080p, Very High, VSync OFF. NVK is vulkan-nouveau-git gddf2ca4, on kernel 6.7.0-rc5-1-mainline. Blob is 545.29.06. 3995WX+RTX3090. Proton Experimental.<br/>
<br/>
NVK: 210FPS<br/>
Blob: 165FPS<br/>
<br/>
Cpu-bound, but still :-)</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17454386951703169722gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17454386951703169722gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
NVIDIA proprietary driver<br/>
<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19543556121703169720gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19543556121703169720gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
NVK open source driver</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's to come in 2024 for the NVK driver? Get it bumped up to Vulkan 1.3 support and eventually pass conformance which should happen in the first part of the year. This involves a rewrite of the pipeline code and implementing the VK_EXT_shader_object extension, which should bring the driver out of Beta so that distributions can ship NVK by default. Sounds like everything it needs will be ready in Linux kernel 6.7 and potentially in the Fedora 40 release.</p>
<p>After that getting everything hooked up to support VKD3D-Proton, more focus on performance. As Ekstrand said "If 2023 was about making games playable, 2024 will be about making games fast.".</p>
<p>And of course more GPU support too as work continues on Maxwell GPUs. Full <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-holiday-update.html" target="_blank">article here</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.0 Beta 2 is available for testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Getting exciting now! We're closing in on the final release of KDE Plasma 6.0 with a <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/beta2/" target="_blank">second Beta</a> now available for testing to ensure it's ready for your Linux desktops and eventually Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Coming nearly a month after the first Beta, the KDE team have been powering through lots of bug reports to get it ready for release but naturally since it's still in Beta it's not quite ready yet but they could use some more testers to jump in and report across a wide variety of hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5571517121703168574gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5571517121703168574gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"As with versions <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/alpha/" target="_blank">Alpha</a> and the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/megarelease/6/beta1/" target="_blank">first Beta</a>, this is a preview intended for developers and testers. The software in this second beta release is reaching stability fast, but it is still not 100% safe to use in a production environment. We still recommend you continue using stable versions of Plasma, Frameworks and apps for your everyday work. But if you do use this, watch out for bugs and <a href="https://bugs.kde.org" target="_blank">report them</a> promptly, so we can solve them." — KDE Plasma Team.</p>
<p>A reminder on the rest of the roadmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you been testing Plasma 6? What are your thoughts on it so far?</p>

      <title>Fedora Asahi Remix 39 brings Linux to Apple Silicon Macs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have one of those fancy Apple Silicon Macs? Want to pop Linux on it? Check out Fedora Asahi Remix 39, the newly released <a href="https://asahilinux.org/" target="_blank">Asahi Linux</a> flagship distribution.</p>
<p>What is Asahi? Asahi Linux is a project and community with the goal of porting Linux to Apple Silicon Macs. Their team announced <a href="https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/fedora-asahi-remix/" target="_blank">back in August</a> their intent to have Fedora as the base for it and now that has been made generally available in a new <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/introducing-fedora-asahi-remix-39/" target="_blank">announcement</a> from Fedora.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17127877131703166770gol1.png"/></p>
<p>From what they said it supports all MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, Mac Studio and iMac systems with M1 and M2 chips.</p>
<p>Interestingly though, even though Fedora are generally all about GNOME, the Asahi remix by default is KDE Plasma but there is a GNOME version also available. With full Wayland support, non-conformant OpenGL 3.3 support (as well as the world's first and only certified conformant OpenGL ES 3.1 implementation for Apple Silicon), high-quality audio and what should be a pretty great overall experience.</p>
<p>Really good to see Apple Silicon support for Linux continue to improve - stellar work from everyone involved.</p>

      <title>You can finally hide your naughty games on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a Steam Beta update to bring in some tweaks to the shopping cart, and finally allowing you to properly set certain games as private so no one can snoop on your gaming habits.</p>
<p>For the shopping cart there's these new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Inline gifting - just in time for the holidays, you can now purchase gifts for multiple friends (and yourself) without having to make multiple purchases. Plus gift messaging has been simplified to speed up the checkout process.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">One cart across all devices - items in your shopping cart will now follow you across all devices where you're signed in to Steam. Note that during the beta, the cart will only be accessible within the beta client.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Private purchasing - keeping your games private starts before you even make a purchase, so the new cart lets you mark a game as private before you check out.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The private feature isn't just for when purchasing though. You can also, once updated, set individual games as private so they will disappear for everyone else. That includes hiding your ownership, in-game status, playtime, and activity in that game. At last, you can <em>finally</em> enjoy all your <em>naughty</em> games in total peace.</p>
<p>All you have to do is right click -&gt; manage -&gt; mark as private in your Steam Library. Either in the games list, or on the bigger box-art pictures in the main part of your library.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10509489581703109828gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10509489581703109828gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can do the same on Steam Deck if you're in the beta. Just go into the properties -&gt; manage -&gt; mark as private on any game in your library anywhere:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4317617651703110102gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4317617651703110102gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 might be my most anticipated title for 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I spent a ridiculous amount of time running around the small levels in Streets of Rogue, it was absolutely brilliant chaos and Streets of Rogue 2 going open-world is looking mighty fine in this first developer video.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Streets of Rogue 2 gives you an open-world where practically anything is possible. You'll be able to play solo or with a few friends online to "embark on a wild adventure to take down a corrupt president – any way you want". In the video developer Matt Dabrowski goes over all the inspiration like AAA games from Rockstar, Bethseda and Ubisoft to survival crafting games like Minecraft and Valheim with a sprinkle of the freedom from Dwarf Fortress and Cataclysm Dark Days wrapped up in an interface that's welcoming and accessible so anyone can pick up. It's also more than 10,000 times bigger than a level from the first game with a fully destructible environment.</p>
<p>Developer Dabrowski notes in the video it's clearly still a work in progress, with their chat going over various bits of the game and plenty of footage we've not seen until now.</p>
<p>Check out their video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Mc0r7QddldI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e9c533189b199497b49554eee1e40b0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Mc0r7QddldI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I absolutely love everything explained in the video, especially as another busy person, jumping into other open-world games is often too time-consuming and Streets of Rogue 2 looks like it will be fun and chaos from the moment you jump in. Exactly what I want to see and I've no doubt this will end up being one of 2024's most popular games — and one I'm certainly hyped to try.</p>
<p>As far as I know it's going to have Native Linux support like the first game.</p>

      <title>Vulkan API update brings Video Extensions for Accelerated H.264 and H.265 Encode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group have announced the release of the Vulkan 1.3.274 API, which brings with it the finalized extensions for encoding and decoding of video streams using a variety of video coding standards.</p>
<p>It was back in April 2021 that the provisional extensions were released as "Vulkan Video", and later in December 2022 with Vulkan 1.3.238 they finalized the decode extensions for H.264 and H.265. Now with Vulkan 1.3.274 the counterpart extensions to enable encoding H.264 and H.265 are available.</p>
<p>"Leveraging the Vulkan framework, they provide a standardized, seamless, low-overhead, and highly controllable way to produce H.264 and H.265 video via hardware accelerators, with applications ranging from real-time, low-latency streaming to offline server-scale transcoding."</p>
<p>Details about the Vulkan Video API extensions at the below links::</p>

</ul>
<p>NVIDIA already have <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Beta driver 535.43.22</a> out with expanded support, while work on AMD / Intel continues.</p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-encode" target="_blank">full blog post here</a>. The ongoing status of Vulkan Video can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/2284" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Nice to see the modern Vulkan API continue to evolve for the needs of modern developers across all industries. Hopefully this will improve video across the Linux desktop and gaming too.</p>

      <title>Enter the mind of a game dev on the brink in The Prisoning: Fletcher&#39;s Quest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Elden Pixels who previously made Alwa's Awakening and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/06/alwas-legacy-is-an-incredibly-charming-retro-action-adventure-out-now/" target="_blank">Alwa's Legacy</a>, and who are also working on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/a-void-hope-looks-like-a-fun-atmospheric-adventure-with-a-synthwave-soundtrack/" target="_blank">A Void Hope</a> also just announced The Prisoning: Fletcher's Quest.

      <title>4x space strategy game New Stars hits Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you a fan of titles like Stellaris and other space strategy games? You may want to take a look at New Stars, which just entered Early Access with Linux support.</p>
<p>"New Stars is a 4X strategy game, on a galactic scale. Explore new worlds, build mega-structures, and found prosperous interstellar colonies. Go head-to-head with alien empires and build the greatest empire to survive the test of time, or be the last remaining in the galaxy to succeed."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1TPh2GLhDgQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e74471b11a2cec659ecd593e850159c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1TPh2GLhDgQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When asked on Steam about differences to the likes of Stellaris the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2231270/discussions/0/6689578676484932301/#c3833171785700971082" target="_blank">gave a little explainer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Relatively fast-paced - Each games last a few hours on average.<br/>
2) Straightforward mechanics - (Should be) Easy to learn with a new tutorial system.<br/>
3) Graphics - galaxy has improved since screenshots, with optimization for low-end devices.<br/>
4) UI - unique with elements inspired from a wide range of games.<br/>
<br/>
There are similarities to Stellaris, such as the fleet management and fleets in general, however the gameplay, mechanics, and pacing is a lot different. Civilization and Stellaris were originally the main inspirations for the game, but New Stars is it's own game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explaining more in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2231270/view/3871469509823929285" target="_blank">release post</a> it seems the length of Stellaris games was quite the sticking point for this developer noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason I made this game is because Stellaris games took me 100 hours on average, and every time I wanted to start a game, it was a major life decision - do I sacrifice 1-2 weeks just to finish this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really sounds like a game designed for me, and anyone else who loves the idea but doesn't have endless hours to dedicate to just one game. Nice to see more like this.</p>

      <title>Dark fantasy city-builder Against the Storm 1.0 out and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Against the Storm is a city-builder with a sprinkle of rogue-lite, in a dark fantasy setting and now only has it recently left Early Access to hit 1.0 but it's also now Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>"You are the Viceroy – a leader charged by the Scorched Queen to reclaim the wilderness and discover lost riches for the Smoldering City, civilization's last bastion against the Blightstorm that destroyed the old world. Unlike most survival city builders where your focus is on a single city, in Against the Storm you must build a vast, prosperous network of settlements populated by diverse fantasy races, each with their own specializations and needs."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MtA1BAeeOAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb40ad651ab01566c1da8ae040fb9396.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MtA1BAeeOAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Steam Deck support, the developer did make numerous changes to make it properly fit and look good including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Steam Deck version can now read gamepad input and display controller glyphs.</li>
<li>Changed UI elements so the game is more readable in 16:10 resolutions, with maximum supported UI size enabled.</li>
<li>The Steam Deck version of the game now automatically launches with the maximum supported UI size.</li>
<li>Increased the font size in numerous UI panels to help with readability on the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Adjusted multiple elements on the HUD to reduce instances of overlapping UI when playing with maximum supported UI size and 16:10 resolution (perks, species panel, resources, embarkation panel, etc.).</li>
<li>The virtual keyboard is now automatically invoked when selecting a text box on the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Added the “Input Auto Focus” setting to the in-game Options. It’s enabled by default and it allows you to start typing values immediately on the PC keyboard and opens a virtual keyboard on Steam Deck. If you don’t like the virtual keyboard appearing automatically when opening panels with text fields (e.g. in the Trading Post panel), you can disable this option.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in the Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/3895114845299634789" target="_blank">announcement</a>, they made it clear it's not designed and doesn't look like a console-styled game with only basic controller support but they said they will keep looking to make it work better. Clearly it was enough to play well though being Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>For desktop Linux players, it has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1336490" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and should work just fine with Proton 8.</p>
<p>The publisher, Hooded Horse, previously offered me a key so hopefully I will be able to take a look sometime soon.</p>

      <title>Vibrant fantasy retro magical FPS &#39;Wizordum&#39; is a joy to blast through</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wizordum is a new retro FPS that puts you in the role of a Mage on a quest to track down the source of Chaos. If you adored early first-person shooters, you're going to really enjoy this one. Note: key provided by Stride PR.</p>
<p>My time with it has been spent on Kubuntu using Proton 8, and it has worked great without any issues. It looks awesome, and runs perfectly with my AMD GPU (6800 XT) on Mesa 23.2.1. Valve have also now rated it Steam Deck Playable, as it has a few minor controls issues (only partial controller support).</p>
<p>It's in Early Access, so what I've played is but a slice of things to come but even so it's thoroughly impressive. It has a full episode included, with an additional two episodes to come. Once you've blasted through it though, the level editor with online sharing thanks to mod.io (which is all built-in) gives you access to extra content. The level editor also works perfectly on Linux as far as I can tell after messing around building some test levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jcMhyxqLMOY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8943f8a2b66d324a17fb35190564e4a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jcMhyxqLMOY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's an absolute joy to blast through this one. I adore the vibrant visuals and the chunky pixels in it! Blending the 3D environments with the 2D sprites looks fab. Simply a must-play (or a must-watch until it's finished) for any fans of classic shooters with a magical edge to them. It's like a glorious blending of really early shooters and dungeon crawlers but feels and looks modern enough that anyone can enjoy it. The levels are nice and spacious filled with enemies to crush, secrets to find, barrels to smash apart and traps to avoid.</p>
<p>A surprising game that's initially rather simple, but the more you play and go through it, the more it opens up and really shines in the later levels with design and it will take you some time to get through.</p>
<p>The level editor is ridiculously easy to use too! Since it's using mod.io for the integration and sharing you can <a href="https://mod.io/g/wizordum" target="_blank">view it online</a> and while there's not much for it yet, given the clear high quality of the game mixed with how easy it is to make and test levels so smoothly, I've no doubt it will fill up soon.</p>
<p>Really thoroughly looking forward to seeing the additional coming episodes for this.</p>
<p>Main Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A vast arsenal of magic weapons &amp; items.</li>
<li>Search for secret places filled with treasures.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and avoid traps.</li>
<li>Embark on a single-player campaign to find the source of Chaos, traveling from the Town of Grimbrook through swamps over the snowy mountains and beyond.</li>
<li>Collect bonus items and beat the hardest difficulty levels to climb to the top of the leaderboards.</li>
<li>Beat challenges at each level.</li>
<li>Compete online for the best time.</li>
<li>Create and share custom levels, all from inside the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1715590/Wizordum/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wizordum" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

<p>Tails of Iron is an epic RPG adventure with punishingly brutal combat and a very bold style, and the developers just surprise-dropped a whole new free expansion to the end-game.</p>
<p>"Set after the climactic events of the base campaign (straight after the credits), ‘Bright Fir Forest’, a new free end-game expansion, sees our noble Rat King Redgi invited by the Squirrels to celebrate the Festival of Leaf Fall… However, a new foul and revenge-seeking adversary stands to ruin the celebrations."</p>
<p>With the expansion there's 13 new quests, adds 3 new challengers to the arena mode and add in more character customization with new weapons and armour, includes eight cosmetic upgrades for the Crimson Keep, and more. Seems like quite a nice addition to the game!</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting is the latest DLC available for the popular bullet-heaven horde survival game thingy from poncle and it's a lot of fun. Giving a cross-over of Among Us in Vampire Survivors was certainly an odd choice though, as two very opposite games but it works.</p>
<p>The DLC adds in a new Among Us inspired map, complete with various Crewmates you can rescue that will give you various bonuses during your run (that you can also upgrade) and you also get to deal with map events that require you to run across the map to press a button which adds another level of panic to Vampire Survivors. The design as a whole is pretty fun!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8169318331702989418gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8169318331702989418gol1.jpeg"/></a>Picture taken on my Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>I still think it's a bit naughty all the enemies can just phase-through the walls, and we're left to walk around them. At least once you grab the map it's easier to get around.</p>
<p>Main DLC content:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>9 playable characters.</li>
<li>15 new weapons (of which 7 evolutions).</li>
<li>A new large stage.</li>
<li>A new Adventure.</li>
<li>6 brand new music tracks.</li>
<li>20 in-game-only achievements (not Steam Acheivements).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At only £1.99 (and 20% off until December 25th), it's an easy pick if you're a Vampire Survivors fan itching for more content to blast your way though.</p>

      <title>Songs of Conquest now Steam Deck Verified with full gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new turn-based strategy game with an infusion of RPG mechanics that looks beautiful? Play on Steam Deck or with a gamepad mostly? Check out the latest update to Songs of Conquest!</p>
<p>Thanks to the most recent update which developer Lavapotion worked with Bitwave Games on, the game has been expanded and overhauled to work fully on Steam Deck with full gamepad support. As they said it has "a complete overhaul of controls and menus, ensuring native integration with Steam Deck and gamepad controls" and that "A major part of this includes adding a large-font UI, guaranteeing no awesome dialogue or tooltip goes unnoticed".</p>
<p>On top of that there's new tooltips just for the Steam Deck, to go along with the new control scheme making it a natural fit for Steam Deck and gamepad players.</p>

      <title>Check out your 2023 Year In Review on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With 2023 coming to a close Valve have refreshed their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/yearinreview" target="_blank">Steam Year In Review page</a>, so you can dive in and see everything you did and how it stacks up against others.</p>
<p>It's a rather fancy page that will list how many games you played, how many achievements you unlocked, your most played games, what platforms you played on, the types of games you mostly played and so much more nerdy details that you all love to go over right?</p>
<p>Valve even put up a clearly big-budget trailer for the event too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2f_0fx2hAO4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4fb1571bcda5a995ab6b6a65dfbfa704.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2f_0fx2hAO4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can also share your page directly with others, so feel free to drop a link to your own in the comments if that's your sort of thing.</p>
<p>What were your most played games in 2023? Mine very much expectedly were War Thunder and Baldur's Gate 3, although Bloons TD 6 certainly crept up the list for me this year. With a whole lot of my time spent on Steam Deck across various other games like Halls of Torment, Brotato and Dave the Diver.</p>

      <title>Steam Workshop gets even better with shareable Workshop Collections</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are really doing some good stuff with the updates to the Steam Workshop. On top of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/valve-upgrades-the-steam-workshop-plus-various-steam-deck-improvements-in-new-beta/" target="_blank">new features added recently</a>, they've also now put in Workshop Collections you can switch between and share around.</p>

So you can create, save and load different subscription lists using this new collections feature - giving you the ability to make preset mods lists and swap between them. On top of that, you can also share them for others to use (you have to save them first before you can share them).</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 37: Dashing Through the Snow</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-36-entertainment-for-x-windows/" target="_blank">Part 36: Entertainment for X Windows</a></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>By the end of 2002 things were starting to look bleak when it came to commercial Linux gaming. Both Loki Software and even the smaller porting house Tribsoft had closed their doors for good, while new firms such as Linux Game Publishing born out of the turmoil were struggling to find their feet. Some relief was on the horizon thanks to the work of independent contractors such as Ryan "icculus" Gordon, but he was far from alone in finding creative ways to bring more games to Linux.</p>
<p>A common refrain has always been that if developers would just provide access to their source code, then the Linux community would be happy to step in and do the heavy lifting for them. This has not always proven to be the case in actual fact, but when Slingshot Game Technology decided to call our bluff and released the source code to their snowboarding simulation <em>Soul Ride</em> under the GNU General Public License in 2003, the Linux community did indeed rise to the challenge.</p>
<p>They even provided a professional looking Loki Setup installer for owners of the <em>Soul Ride</em> CD-ROM to download by use of the soulride-1.1a-x86.run install script. This will grab the data right off the disc as well as providing the option of installing a number of Virtual Resorts which were provided for free on the <em>Soul Ride</em> website. That being said, you must ensure your user account has write permissions to the install directory, as otherwise you will be unable to save your player settings.</p>
<p>Not doing so will also cause other weirdness such as not being able to change mountains as well as the game not ceasing to play the CD audio on exit. Besides this I also encountered a graphical error where my shadow would be drawn multiple times in a grid underneath my character; that is, unless the weather was set to be snowing or whiteout conditions. This proved to not be much of a compromise, as obscuring the distance in snow also gives a much needed framerate boost.</p>
<p>The controls also came with a learning curve. <em>Soul Ride</em> was intended to be experienced with Slingshot Game Technology's own proprietary Catapult snowboard game controller, but as next to no one has that, I had to settle for using either the mouse or keyboard. You do not steer so much as shift your weight on the snowboard, with the forward and backward axis not even coming into play unless you are airborne. A full breakdown of the controls can be found on the <em>Soul Ride</em> Support FAQ.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18312333501702928053gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18312333501702928053gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16830749341702928054gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16830749341702928054gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Outside of the Catapult controller, the main selling point of <em>Soul Ride</em> was its recreation of real mountains made possible by the use of satelite topography data. The CD-ROM features simulations of two American ski areas, Mammoth Mountain in California as well as Tuckerman Ravine found on Mount Washington in New Hampshire. The Virtual Resort addons provide recreations of both Stratton and Jay Peak in Vermont, as well as the Breckenridge resort in Colorado.</p>
<p>You can either play through the included trail scenarios or Heli-Drop yourself anywhere on the slopes. <em>Soul Ride</em> also has one more trick up its sleeve, allowing you to record your runs and various stunts on a simulated VCR. This feeds into the final novel mechanic of allowing you to rewind up to three times during a descent, giving you some leeway if you wipe out. I found these to often rewind further than I would like, but they do help stop the game from being too unforgiving.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Soul Ride</em> does show its age in the lack of ragdoll physics, with you often looking as stiff as the snowboard you ride on when getting into trouble; the way you just fall over looking dejected if you run out of momentum is comical. You can also still gain point bonuses while you are wiping out, which does seem to be rubbing in your failure a touch. This is all accompanied by a licensed soundtrack sporting a number of bands provided by Bloodshot Records, Mint Records, and Ringing Ear Records.</p>
<p>Linux Game Publishing would later craft their own packaged Linux release of <em>Soul Ride</em> in 2005, which based on the free demo functioned much the same as the source port outside of a few improvements such as saving player data in your home directory and supporting a few more launch parameters. It still showed the same graphical error with the player's shadow, and just like with the source port, does not allow me to force either the display settings or the weather conditions at launch.</p>
<p>Outside of comparing scores between player profiles there is no competitive aspect to <em>Soul Ride</em>, which is a shame as being able to play hot seat against another player and potentially wipe each other out could have been a lot of fun. Of course with it being released under the GPL nothing is stopping someone from adding these features, and the game built and ran fine for me from source even on my modern Linux computer. By now I am getting to know my way around a compiler.</p>

      <title>Brocula is a life sim with a dark side - grow crops, go fishing, grow a cult as a Vampire</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm all for playing more life-sims but they're all just a bit too cute aren't they? Brocula looks like it's going to be the opposite, with you being a Vampire.</p>
<p>All the usual suspects are here like tending to your crops, building up your farm, selling your wares for a profit and going fishing. But there's a dark side to it. You'll also be managing a cult, restoring a church to gather people for the all important blood you crave. There's also an ever-changing forest to explore with strange creatures and treasures to find.</p>
<p>You can see some brief footage in the demo trailer below:</p>

<p>A much longer look the developer posted up a few days ago:</p>

<p>It's set for release on February 1st, 2024 but there's a demo available on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364740/Brocula/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>. The demo has a Linux version too, built with Unity. Looks like the developer is going for full Steam Deck support with it mentioned in the Steam page system requirements.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a good few years in Early Access, The Universim from Crytivo is finally set to hit the big 1.0 with some fun new features. This was announced along with a new trailer (below) that the 1.0 release will happen on January 22nd, 2024.</p>
<p>"The Universim 1.0 isn't just a game; it's a living, breathing universe at your fingertips.

This update brings end-game content to life with more technology to unlock in the research tree, new planets to explore (or exploit for resources), and so much more!" — Crytivo</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o3r2rB3eH2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/824f661c38c5a06384fb080e243586f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o3r2rB3eH2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's coming with the 1.0 release:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I've been playing it on and off for years, always intrigued by the setting and every time it sucked me in with quite a few hours so it's going to be fantastic to see it finally finished after waiting so long. The Universim was originally funded on Kickstarter too all the way back in 2014!</p>

      <title>HDR support for KDE Plasma 6 seems to be shaping up nicely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's far from finished, and still needs some manual effort to get properly working, HDR support for KDE Plasma 6 has made great progress. While HDR is already available in SteamOS on Steam Deck, getting it hooked up on traditional Linux desktops is still in-progress.</p>
<p>Developer Xaver Hugl wrote up a <a href="https://zamundaaa.github.io/wayland/2023/12/18/update-on-hdr-and-colormanagement-in-plasma.html" target="_blank">fresh blog post</a> going over the current status for those interested. You're now able to enable HDR in Plasma settings that gives you new options, and it even includes a "SDR Color Intensity" slider inspired by the colour slider on Steam Deck that was introduced in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steamos-355-rolls-out-to-all-steam-deck-owners-plus-new-steam-client-update/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5</a>. The blog post goes over their work, along with all the Gamescope additions done by Joshua Ashton from Valve, to get it into a state where it's reasonably simple to actually get HDR working for games and other media now.</p>
<p>Plasma 6 Beta already has the work in KWin, and after a few additional steps noted in the blog post (like using Gamescope) you can "play most HDR capable games in the Wayland session" as long as you use Proton 8 or newer, with Hugl noting games they've tested working fine include Ori and the Will of the Wisps, Cyberpunk 2077, God of War, Doom Eternal, Jedi: Fallen Order and Quake II RTX. Spider-Man: Remastered and Spider-Man: Miles Morales also work, but don't look particularly good with HDR, which might not actually be a Linux problem specifically.</p>
<p>Ending the blog post to round it up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously there is still a lot to do. Color management is limited to either sRGB or full-blown rec.2020, you shouldn’t have to install stuff from Github yourself, and certainly shouldn’t have to mess around with the command line to play games and watch videos in HDR, HDR screenshots and HDR screen recording aren’t a thing yet, and many other small and big things need implementing or fixing. There’s a lot of work needed to make these things just work™ as they should outside of special cases like the gamescope embedded session.</p>
<p>Things are moving fast though, and I’m pretty happy with the progress we made so far.</p>

      <title>ScummVM expands support for Macromedia Director</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ScummVM is an awesome project bringing new life to absolutely loads of classic games through the power of open source, and now they're expanding support for Macromedia Director games too.</p>
<p>Currently it can open Director titles from 1995 and earlier, but titles released after 1995 use Director versions that aren't yet supported. The team mentioned there's about 1,595 of these games that ScummVM can detect from the original up to Director 11. With the 2.8.0 release adding in preliminary support for Director 5.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding support for a new Director version is a tricky process. First we need to check for any changes to the movie file format, then add in any new engine and Lingo features, and finally start working through issues in a bunch of candidate games. Because of the difficulty of keeping track of facts vs. assumptions, we only enable features for an engine version once they have been confirmed with testing. This is why D6 and higher games will not open at all, even if the code we have would somewhat work.</p>
<p>Support for the D2, D3 and D4 versions of Director has steadily improved. We are building up a suite of unit tests, both for Lingo and for the various drawing modes in the renderer. Most of the remaining bugs are related to undefined or incidental behavior: consider how two types in Lingo are compared, or the precise order that events are processed in, or how functions respond when you pass them nonsense data? All of these things are relied upon by thousands of Director products! And ScummVM must support all of them as closely as possible.</p>
<cite>ScummVM Team</cite></blockquote>
<p>Planned to happen in the upcoming ScummVM 2.8.0 release they have these newly supported titles available for testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice: An Interactive Museum</li>
<li>Ape Odyssey</li>
<li>Classical Cats</li>
<li>Gadget: Invention, Travel and Adventure</li>
<li>The Cute Machine</li>
<li>The Dark Eye</li>
<li>Wrath of the Gods</li>
</ul>
<p>You do need to have a copy of the original games though.</p>
