      <title>Fan-made PC port of Star Fox 64 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team behind PC ports of other Nintendo games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/ship-of-harkinian-a-pc-port-of-ocarina-of-time-has-a-feature-filled-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/2-ship-2-harkinian-another-unofficial-pc-port-of-zelda-majoras-mask-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a>, a new PC port has arrived for Star Fox 64.</p>
<p>Just like their previous releases, Starship (their name for the project) does not include any copyrighted assets. You are required to provide the data files from a copy of the game you own.</p>
<p>Currently the only available build is for Windows, which you can try running through Wine / Proton. The developer said in the announcement in their Discord: "The Linux and Mac versions are very close but we ran into some snags and didn't want to delay the release for it. If any Linux/MacOS developers want to help the ports across the finish line, it's available to be built from source (see our GitHub Starship repository)."</p>
<p>Hopefully it won't be too long before the Native Linux build is up to make it easier to run.</p>
<p>Star Fox designer Takaya Imamura <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1871337679176237461" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (Twitter) to say "I don't think Nintendo would tolerate this, but I'm personally very happy about it." (translated from Japanese).</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/HarbourMasters/Starship" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive v0.8 brings more graphics improvements and new game mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is an open source evolution sim built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's getting more impressive with every new release and there's another update out now for you to try out.</p>
<p>Version 0.8.0 brings with it some more graphics improvements to make all the little organisms look more impressive with new textures, new 3D models plus new and improved icons.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to this release like the introduction of a Organelle Suggestion System that suggests what organelles to add to your organism in order to guide you towards optimizing its evolution. You can ignore it if you wish, but sounds like a useful feature for you to keep jumping to the top of the food chain. The devs also added in sulfur chunks, an underwater vent eruption event that creates extra hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide in the patch, nitrogen is now dynamic and there's two new multicellular loading screen artworks.</p>
<p>Check out their release highlights trailer:</p>

<p>Thrive has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. See more about the update in the <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-45-suggestion-of-an-update/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>.

<li>Fixed not all patches showing up in the editor report patch selector dropdown</li>

      <title>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from GamingOnLinux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello there! It's coming up on Christmas now, and so GamingOnLinux will be starting to go into it's usual mostly hibernating state to take a little break.</p>
<p>As per usual I'll be taking some holiday time and <em>slightly</em> longer than usual over the next 2 weeks. So unless there's some sudden big stories that appear, or just plain <em>boredom</em> from me (sometimes I really just can't help myself) or from guest contributions, you can expect news to be rather <em>quiet</em> over the 2 weeks. A time to recharge, see family and play some video games on Linux (you should see my backlog…).</p>
<p>I'll take this moment to thank all readers and supporters for another <em>incredible</em> year. We've been through some really interesting news through 2024, and it really does look like 2025 is going to be even <em>bigger</em>.</p>

      <title>For fans of Advance Wars there&#39;s a new demo up for Warside and new release window</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something for the weekend: you can now try out a brand new demo of Warside, a game very much inspired by the classic Advance Wars and it does look good. Playing it a little bit close to their inspiration though.</p>
<p>From developer LAVABIRD and publisher First Break Labs, the game is preparing to launch sometime in Q2 / Spring 2025.</p>
<p>The new demo has a five-mission mini-campaign featuring new air units playable for the first time, including jets, bombers, and helicopters. Plus there's new not seen before battle powers like an EMP Blast which disables vehicles in an area, an Orbital Strike to rain energy beams from the sky and Rage that forces enemy units to attack each other. Sounds like a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Along with a new demo there's also a new trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intuitive turn-based gameplay with a familiar feel for fans of the classics.</li>
<li>12 playable Commanders, each with unique passive skills and Battle Powers.</li>

<p>With the feature code freeze continuing, the Wine team had put up a third Release Candidate for the upcoming stable main release of Wine 10.0 coming in early 2025.

<p>At some point after the release of Wine 10.0 we'll see Valve and their partners at Codeweavers update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and we'll then see a Proton 10.0 release as well. We don't know exactly when that will happen though, for the Wine 9 to Proton 9 release, it took about a month and a half to arrive.</p>

      <title>Firaxis reveal Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII system requirements for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games and 2K are releasing Sid Meier's Civilization VII on February 11, 2025 and now we know what power you're going to need to run it on Linux Desktop systems. It will have a supported Native Linux version, as covered here on GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-arrives-in-2025-with-a-teaser/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously</a>.</p>
<p>Older games in the series had Aspyr Media responsible for the Linux and macOS versions, but it looks like this is an internal build this time as Aspyr have not been mentioned anywhere. Nice to see a day-1 supported release of such a major game — not something you see too often now with the rise of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> running games so well.</p>
<p>Here's the specifications needed for Civilization VII on Linux</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MINIMUM:</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 22.04<br/>
<strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5-4690 / AMD Ryzen 3 1200<br/>
<strong>Memory:</strong> 8 GB RAM<br/>
<strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA GTX 1060 / AMD RX 580<br/>
<strong>Storage:</strong> 25 GB available space<br/>
<br/>
<strong>RECCOMENDED:</strong><br/>
<br/>
<strong>OS:</strong> Ubuntu 24.04<br/>
<strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600X<br/>
<strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br/>
<strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA RTX 2070 / AMD RX 6700<br/>
<strong>Storage:</strong> 25 GB available space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those actually seem like some pretty reasonable minimum requirements, and compared with a lot of bigger well-known games, not much storage space being taken up by it either.</p>
<p>A week ago they also revealed the opening cinematic:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gV0waX2uPLg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4903808a75ffb7a99e7924311596e46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gV0waX2uPLg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Will you be picking up Civilization VII? I know I'll be diving in.</p>
<p>The main release is February 11th, but they're also doing Advanced Access on February 6th for people who buy the more expensive game editions.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer DXVK v2.5.2 brings fixes for Alpha Protocol, The Sims 2, Borderlands 2 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another bug fixes release is out for DXVK (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.5.2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">v2.5.2</a>), the project that translates Direct3D 8, 9, 10 and 11 to Vulkan. It's a big part of what makes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> able to run Windows games on Steam Deck / Linux so nicely.</p>
<p>However, it's not <em>just</em> for Linux, quite a few people slot it into their games on Windows as well, as it can make a bunch of older games run smoother.</p>
<p>On the Windows side there's this note in the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Windows, if <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_fullscreen_exclusive</code> is supported, DXVK will now always try to <strong>disable</strong> exclusive fullscreen in an attempt to work around common alt-tab issues, as well as issues with numerous games that mix D3D9 with GDI user interfaces. Whether this is honored is up to the graphics driver. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4465" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4465</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4485" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4485</a>)</p>
<p>Previously, this was only done for D3D9 applications that explicitly enabled support for GDI dialog boxes in fullscreen mode. The <code class="inline-code">d3d9.enableDialogMode</code> configuration option to control that behaviour was removed accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This change may affect input latency and/or performance, depending on the exact implementation of Vulkan swap chains in the graphics driver. It does <strong>not</strong> affect Linux systems in any way since the concept of exclusive fullscreen, and thus any problems associated with it, do not exist there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And everything else:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an implementation of D3D9 shader validation interfaces. This is needed for <strong>The Void</strong> and used in several other D3D9 games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4398" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4398</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed behaviour when D3D9 applications use incorrect texture types as seen in <strong>Alpha Protocol</strong>. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4513" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4513</a>)</li>
<li>If <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_maintenance5</code> is supported, DXVK will now use <code class="inline-code">VK_FORMAT_A8_UNORM</code> to implement the corresponding D3D11 format. This fixes warnings in various games, as well as rendering issues in <strong>TopSpin 2K25</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4514" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4514</a>).</li>
<li>Optimized behaviour of disabled clip planes for D3D9 games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4508" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4508</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <code class="inline-code">DXVK_CONFIG</code> environment variable was not applied correctly under specific circumstances.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues causing Wine test failures for D3D8 and D3D9. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4479" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4479</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Borderlands 2:</strong> Fixed missing lava in certain places. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4482" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4482</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Codename Panzers: Phase One / Two</strong>: Work around an issue with the main menu not rendering on regular Wine builds. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4495" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4495</a>)</li>
<li><strong>The Sims 2</strong>: Extended existing app profiles to various mod tools. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4518" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4518</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/4520" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4520</a>)</li>

<em>Pictured - Alpha Protocol</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you <em>don't</em> actually need to do anything. Valve's official Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the <em>wild</em> side, you <em>can</em> upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Comic issue 7 is finally, officially available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What a nice early holiday surprise. The official Team Fortress 2 comic has finally officially returned. Now you've got something to read over the weekend. In an official <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=235677" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> titled "A Smissmas Miracle" on the Team Fortress 2 website, Valve developers posted this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you know the construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was one hundred and ninety nine years late? Literally everyone alive when construction started was dead by the time it finished. So unless you're having this read to you from the bad side of a Ouija board, you made it out the other end of issue seven's historically-speaking-pretty-short seven year delay alive. Which isn't too bad.</p>
<p>And, honestly, we can think of another, much more popular project we're involved with that you're STILL waiting on: The Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, which began construction in 1886 and still isn't done, and which the Spanish government hired us to write a delay-themed blog post about after seeing an early draft of the blog post you're reading right now</p>
<p>Speaking of you reading things, we are very, very relieved to present <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/tf07_thedayshavewornaway/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Team Fortress Comics issue 7</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Nice to see Valve finally did it. </em></p>
<p>The Smissmas event is also ongoing in Team Fortress 2 has been live since December 11th that included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All players who play TF2 during the event will receive a Stuffed Stocking as a gift! Stockings contain goodies for good little Mercenaries.</li>
<li>Featuring 6 new community maps: Overcast, Fortezza, Penguin Peak, Patagonia, Cutter, and Maul</li>
<li>Added the Winter 2024 Cosmetic Case
	<ul>
<li>Contains 23 new community-contributed items</li>
<li>The Festivizer can be found as a bonus drop when opening the case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 3 new community-contributed taunts to the Mann Co. Store
	<ul>
<li>Taunt: Fore-Head Slice</li>
<li>Taunt: Peace!</li>
<li>Taunt: Curtain Call</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added 18 new community-created Unusual effects
	<ul>
<li>9 new effects for Unusual hats</li>
<li>9 new effects for Unusual taunts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All cosmetic and taunt cases will grant Smissmas 2024 Unusual effects instead of their normal Unusual effects during the event. This does not include crates.</li>
<li>Mann Co. Store winter sale!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cult classic RPG &#39;OFF&#39; is getting an expanded Steam release in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I had honestly never heard of because I live under a rock. A cult classic RPG named OFF is getting a Steam release next year. It was originally released in 2008 from Belgian developer Mortis Ghost, who has now teamed up with Fangamer for the updated version.</p>
<p>Why is this one important? Well, despite never having a proper store page anywhere as it was distributed across various direct-downloads, it managed to amass quite a following. It's had millions of downloads and was even cited multiple times by UNDERTALE's own Toby Fox as an inspiration for his designs.</p>
<p>The press email notes "This definitive version features an all-new battle system, balancing improvements, as well as new areas and hidden bosses from the game’s creator, Mortis Ghost. The surreal indie RPG, originally released in French, has now also received an OFFicial English translation."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Fydkw5-xGKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc8dfcd264acee9e373de3c9aff9c2a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Fydkw5-xGKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take control of the Batter as he seeks to purify an uncanny and hopeless world haunted by specters, guided by a cryptic, grinning cat called The Judge.</p>
<p>As they move the Batter through increasingly confused zones—a farm that extracts metal from the inside of cattle, an amusement park full of people too frightened to enjoy themselves, a sugar factory with ominous smokestacks—players must reckon with The Batter’s mission themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fangamer aren't just publishing though, they're directly involved in the development too. As co-founder Ryan Alyea said in the press email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fangamer has published physical editions of indie games for a while now, but OFF is the first time we’ve moved into the development side for Steam and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Lots of us here love the game; for a long time the English fan translation was actually distributed on a forum post on <a href="https://u26296841.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.nGLunG4LVL0Tj1EHduMYhbQSs1E7JPkjEdqjBab8Nqk-3DtL_9_M7561dTk8oPSP7-2FkK3w4hSHrn1BMbSU-2F-2FKpCHpwgmXY0SDTxQGZXQjvOzHrcVZDk-2BzyR625fNlwUnzHvTV0yy0oGJNoFf-2BpjS-2F8533TJr312Ce2cBxKEDc0rZxYlhQB3H0wyEJtnEpJqvlTpsazuL0YxePlW6KbXFEmDUFIt5s7unYboq21peWsgyI3ku-2FwMQ7a3ssdqNViP4YDAHrFtViAvlz5e-2FP9siRnLfyDzZaUaEcGvSsd5hLbV4lQNa53bdcxlnGialu9t6Tdf-2FmxBrVKo1r8lp-2FxTHsFX6TOz1qqWfIB9Przwfll2dPZOWWl98ewDDk4N5w9kOQoTFfPSrSTtLXqR5LWNUkCAwDzn2SGnM0RD-2Bn9nrY-2BySZhivGQhUt6UU78WxsoEuXkCEPo3mH-2BiqW08tht9BH15FqPb-2BEm9yE8A4Ynjx3ok2DImgewayhEggcRP0N9OysLe3vrf-2BLiBBJFakWalcmpXRvTJruo-3D" target="_blank">Starmen.Net</a>, the EarthBound fansite started by many of us in 1998.</p>
<p>Moving a game that began as a freeware RPG Maker 2003 title to modern platforms wasn’t easy, but it felt like a perfect project for us.</p>
<p>​It’s a great game, and it’s very rewarding to be able to help build something that’s exciting for old fans and accessible to players who might not have found OFF otherwise.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is getting a price increase in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, the popular bullet heaven / survivor-like spin-off from Funday Games and Ghost Ship Publishing continues to be very popular and so the price is set to go up soon.</p>
<p>The developer said in announcement that on January 2nd, 2025 that the price will rise to $12.99 / €12.99 / £11.99 which to me still seems perfectly reasonable for it. They're doing it as they've "added a lot of content to Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor since we released it, and to reflect the added value we’ll increase the price a bit".</p>
<p>As soon as the Steam Winter Sale ends it goes up, so if you were on the fence you might want to jump over with the current 30% discount on it.</p>
<p>Check out the recent trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AqujRQcBDm0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0dfc9ca515724ea151562f475e2202a3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AqujRQcBDm0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The most recent player reviews on Steam give it an Overwhelmingly Positive rating, with a Very Positive rating overall. It's Steam Deck Verified and Platinum on ProtonDB so you're good to go across Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>

      <title>The Rogue Prince of Persia will not get Ubisoft Connect and no price rise in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of good news for gamers interested in picking up The Rogue Prince of Persia from developers Evil Empire and publisher Ubisoft, as they've given an update on some future plans. The game is currently rated Steam Deck Verified and Gold on ProtonDB.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/652556020635141599" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam posted December 19th the developer clarified that "There will in fact be no Ubisoft Connect at all for the game on Steam.". It was previously planned as an optional feature but now they're not doing it. On top of that a planned price rise for January is also off the table, but the price may still go up in future.</p>
<p>Back in November the developers at Evil Empire gave the game quite a big upgrade too, check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yEOalMmItLA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c94c12ad0e8d4ea7f83abe751223506.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yEOalMmItLA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A roadmap for the first part of 2025 has also been put up:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11956437281734705380gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11956437281734705380gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The game is 25% off during the Steam Winter Sale 24. It has a Very Positive rating on Steam so clearly players have been enjoying this one from some of the team previously responsible for Dead Cells.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's that time! Yes, again, and the last one before the holiday season. Each week Prime Gaming, part of what you get with a subscription to Amazon Prime, add and remove various games you can claim to keep.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Valve will join Lenovo at CES 2025 for the future of gaming handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the stage has been set for more SteamOS Linux devices to join the Steam Deck, as Valve will be partnering up with Lenovo at CES 2025. The news comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/19/24325072/lenovo-legion-go-ces-event-valve-microsoft" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, who got a press email invitation to the event, which I haven't seen.</p>
<p>As The Verge's Sean Hollister notes the email they received from Lenovo mentioned "The future of gaming handhelds is coming to CES '25".</p>
<p>Quite likely it will be the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/the-upcoming-lenovo-legion-go-s-may-come-with-a-steamos-linux-version/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming leaked Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, which follows on from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valves-new-branding-guidelines-hint-at-steam-decks-steamos-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve updating their brand guidelines</a> for SteamOS to include third-party hardware vendors. According to Hollister the email noted Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais will be there as Valve's "Chief Design Architect" for the event. Although, Jason Ronald, Microsoft VP of Xbox Gaming Devices and Ecosystem is also attending the event. We've seen from the leaks that Lenovo might have multiple handhelds likely to launch, so it makes sense if other devices will have Windows.</p>

      <title>Sony buy up KADOKAWA shares to become largest shareholder of the FromSoftware parent company</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There it is, the deal has been announced. Sony and KADOKAWA have "signed a strategic capital and business alliance agreement" that will make Sony the largest shareholder. It's not done just yet though, as the deal is set to go through on January 7, 2025.</p>
<p>Sony will acquire 12,054,100 new KADOKAWA shares for "approximately 50 billion yen", this will bump up Sony to have about 10% total shares in KADOKAWA and make them the largest holder overall. This is a <em>big</em> deal for video games, Anime and Manga since Kadokawa control FromSoftware (ELDEN RING, ARMORED CORE), Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa, DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO), ACQUIRE Corp. (OCTOPATH TRAVELER) and Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker) in addition to all their Anime and Manga publishing.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Comment from Takeshi Natsuno, Chief Executive Officer, KADOKAWA CORPORATION</p>
<p>"We are very pleased to conclude this capital and business alliance agreement with Sony. This alliance is expected to not only further strengthen our IP creation capabilities, but also increase our IP media mix options with Sony's support for global expansion, allowing us to deliver our IP to more users around the world. We are confident that this will greatly contribute to maximizing the value of our IP and increasing our corporate value in the mid- to long-term. We intend to do our utmost to ensure that our collaborative efforts with Sony produce great results in the global market."</p>
<p>Comment from Hiroki Totoki, President, COO and CFO, Sony Group Corporation</p>
<p>"Through this capital and business alliance, we will become the largest shareholder of KADOKAWA, which consistently creates a wide variety of IP, including publications and books, such as light novels and comics, as well as games and anime. By combining KADOKAWA's extensive IP and IP creation ecosystem with the strengths of Sony, which has promoted the global expansion of a wide range of entertainment, including anime and games, we plan to work closely together to realize KADOKAWA's 'Global Media Mix' strategy, aimed at maximizing the value of its IP, and Sony's long-term vision, 'Creative Entertainment Vision.'"</p>

      <title>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl gets a massive patch with an AI overhaul and lots of A-Life fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl from GSC Game World has a huge patch out now, that attempts to fix up a lot of the disappointments and bugs with their A-Life system and other AI issues. I mentioned in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-works-on-linux-desktop-with-proton-but-poorly-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original review</a> that it had a lot of bugs, and the AI system was not particularly great. It certainly sounds like this patch will fix up a lot of my and everyone else's complaints about it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the A-Life biggest fixes and improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue with spawning NPCs behind the player's back.</li>
<li>Players can now encounter roaming NPCs across the Zone more often.</li>
<li>Greatly extended the distance at which A-Life NPCs are visible to the player.</li>
<li>Fixed the aggressive optimization issue that prevented A-Life NPCs to exist in Offline (out of player's visualization range).
	<ul>
<li>In Offline mode, A-Life will continue to advance towards their goals over time.</li>
<li>Players may now have opportunities to encounter A-Life NPCs they've previously met by following in the same direction as the NPCs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved A-Life NPCs navigation in Offline using GameGraph (global AI navigation map):
	<ul>
<li>Fixed multiple issues where NPCs would fail to follow or find a path to their designated goals.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with NPC being stuck in Online-Offline transition state,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhanced A-Life NPCs' motivation to expand territory and actively attack enemies and mutants.</li>
<li>Fixed issues that could result in fewer A-life NPCs encountered than intended.</li>
<li>Further contextual actions improvement to ensure seamless transitions between Offline and Online states for NPCs engaged in these actions.</li>
<li>The groups exploring the Zone are now more diverse regarding possible factions and group sizes.</li>
<li>Fixed issue that while roaming over the Zone, Human NPCs didn't satisfy their communication needs and talks. </li>
</ul>

<em>Pictured - Stalker 2 on Linux</em></p>
<p>Above is just the A-Life system changes. There's absolutely loads of other bug fixes and improvements across the whole game.

Lots of fixes to various visual bugs too which is great to see.</p>
<p>Think I'll have to dive back in again soon and see how much it has improved. <em>Once the 110GB patch download has finished that is…</em></p>

      <title>New Linux kernel patch submitted to improve Lenovo Legion series support including Lenovo Legion Go </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like we may see some improvements to the Lenovo Legion series of hardware like the Lenovo Legion Go handheld when running on Linux, thanks to a new Linux kernel patch that's been sent in.</p>
<p>From the developer Derek J. Clark <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/12/17/1611" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the patch</a> mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adds support for the Lenovo Legion series of laptop hardware to use WMI interfaces that control various power settings. There are multiple WMI interfaces that work in concert to provide getting and setting values as well as validation of input. Currently only the "GameZone", "Other Method", and "LENOVO_CAPABILITY_DATA_01" interfaces are implemented, but I attempted to structure the driver so that adding the "Custom Mode", "Lighting", and the other CAPABILITY_DATA interfaces would be trivial if desired in a later patch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clark mentioned how they tested it directly on a Lenovo Legion Go. It's actually supposed to be a replacement for a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20241118100503.14228-1-jonmail@163.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">previous patch</a> and was inspired by the Linux <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240930000046.51388-1-luke@ljones.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">asus-armoury driver</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18347934551734606115gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Nice to see continued direct improvements in the upstream Linux kernel for handhelds like this. Especially interesting as it seems we may get a SteamOS Linux version of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/the-upcoming-lenovo-legion-go-s-may-come-with-a-steamos-linux-version/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Replay for 2024 is live to show off all those hours you played</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have put up Steam Replay, their end of year little look over your Steam account, so you can show off how many hours you put into games across various platforms. Yes, Valve changed the name of this again. It was Steam Replay, then Steam Year In Review and now back to Steam Replay again.</p>
<p>It's no surprise to see that War Thunder and Helldivers 2 are joint top for me <em>each</em> taking 19% of my total playtime. It's also no surprise for me that Dome Keeper takes 9% of my own time on Steam Deck, I got a bit hooked on that one for a while.</p>
<p>Example of one of the charts you'll see:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8134888341734564626gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And for people who have a Steam Deck it will show your most played on it too:</p>

      <title>Tactical Breach Wizards has a Beta with improvements for Gamepad and Steam Deck verification</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Highly rated by players, Tactical Breach Wizards from Suspicious Developments is about to get even better for Gamepad and Steam Deck players with a Beta available for testing.</p>
<p>What is it? Tactical Breach Wizards is a turn-based tactics game in which you lead a team of renegade wizards in kevlar, as they unravel a modern conspiracy plot and/or find the most stylish way to punch a Traffic Warlock through a 4th story window. This is from the same developer of Heat Signature and Gunpoint.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FXMSBXnJlWM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/331451e157d0e0d5a09735e02be496ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FXMSBXnJlWM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for the new Beta, the developer said in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1043810/announcements/detail/544469629578249294" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "If you have a Steam Deck, or if you just play on gamepad, we'd love to have you try the update we're preparing for next week! It's already been approved for Steam Deck Verified status by Valve, but we also wanna get you guys to try it out before we call it done."</p>
<p>Valve have bumped it up to Deck Verified based on their own testing, but nice to see a developer not entirely relying on that and actually getting some public feedback too. What the Beta includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Improved targeting controls on gamepad</strong></p>
For abilities that target enemies directly, like most of your standard attacks, you can now cycle through the possible targets with the shoulder buttons on gamepad, rather than needing to use the cursor.<br/>
<p><strong>Redesigned ability buttons and team panels for text clarity</strong></p>
We now have an optional Large UI mode, enabled by default on Steam Deck. It changes how we show you the name of the ability you're selecting, and what it costs to use, so that this info can be in nice big clear text. You can still switch back to the old UI, even on Steam Deck.<br/>
<p><strong>Bigger text</strong></p>
All text that was near or below the minimum guidelines for Steam Deck is now significantly bigger in Large UI mode. We also tightened up the team portraits area and objectives panel so that these don't sprawl out and take up too much of the screen at the larger text size.<br/>
<p><strong>D-pad menu navigation</strong></p>
<p>In every context where it makes sense, you can use the d-pad to navigate menus nicely now.</p>

      <title>In management sim COPA CITY you run events for Football teams and the developer plans Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Football game where you're not on the pitch or managing the Football teams directly? Interesting. This management sim could be quite different.</p>
<p>Here the teams have you run all their events across the world.  From coordinating efficient public transport and managing the stadium to overseeing security operations and organizing vibrant fan zones, every decision you make shapes the ultimate match day atmosphere.</p>
<p>Check out a recent quick trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B8PKb8r3OWI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21aaf9820f161ddc9511ffaf413a0601.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B8PKb8r3OWI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comprehensive stadium preparation system</strong>: Evolved from basic customization to a 5-level progression system with clear milestones and permanent achievements.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced city visualization</strong>: Improved representation of fan activities, club colors, and district control through dynamic visual changes.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced city buildings system</strong>: Transformed from basic food vendors or small hotels into influential buildings that level up based on surrounding infrastructure and provide strategic bonuses to nearby facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Replayability elements</strong>: Added randomized city layouts, variable fan arrivals, and dynamic quest systems for increased replay value</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the developer: "Our goal has always been to capture the electrifying energy that engulfs a city before a major football event." said [Anna Szamowska], [CMO] at Triple Espresso. "This new trailer not only reflects the immense progress we've made but also showcases the depth and excitement players can expect when they step into the shoes of a host."</p>
<p>The developer recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2210520/view/547847229364240471" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in a Steam post that Steam Deck support is "on our priority list". They additionally mentioned how they "already have a build with solid performance, but it still needs some fine-tuning" which is good they're doing it early on!</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Comet Force a quirky space arena shooter action roguelite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Was that enough genres in the title? Maybe I should have added more. Anyway, Comet Force looks fun and quirky and there's a demo out now you can try. It's probably one of the weirdest but also most interesting top-down space shooters I've seen for a while, thanks to the blend of features it offers.</p>
<p>Here it's not just you. You're also flying around recruiting other units to join your space troop. You then lead them all in fast-paced battles as they directly fight beside you. It's a bit of a bullet-hell with all sorts of enemy types and boss battles. On top of that there's various buildings you need to construct along the outside of the arena, to give you various extras and upgrades that keep on going. You're also managing resources, research and more.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods new cross-platform app v0.7.1 released finally supporting upgrades - better modding for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a big one! The new and still in development cross-platform Nexus Mods app that has Linux support just released version 0.7.1 and you no longer have to remove <em>everything</em> to update.</p>
<p>What this means is that it's safe for a lot more people to jump in and start testing it, although game support is still limited to Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077, Stardew Valley and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord for now. This release additionally expands the Linux support so Protontricks running via Flatpak is now supported.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3680424591734463972gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3680424591734463972gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus Mods App, Credit: Nexus Team</em></p>
<p>Some other bigger changes from this release include a facelift for the Load Order styling for Cyberpunk 2077 REDmods, the mod Collections feature also has a much improved flow and they say it's "up to 25x faster than Vortex at installing collections (depending on your internet speed and hardware)".</p>
<p>Even though the app now supports updates, they still say you need to remove any Collections this time "as they may not install properly", which hopefully won't be a problem from this release onwards.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Bug fixes in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue counting the mods a user has installed when sending analytics.</li>
<li>Added a placeholder to the Games view when no games have been detected.</li>
<li>When enabling the Xbox Game Pass support option in settings, the app now correctly prompts a restart.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the first row of the Library/Installed Mods would sometimes be misaligned with the table headers (this was part of an Avalonia update).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current known issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Stardew Valley (Native Linux version) is not detected when installed via Heroic Launcher on Linux. The Windows version of the game can be used instead until this issue is fixed.</li>
<li>When installing Collections that include bundled mods, it is not possible to fully download the collection due to a counting error. A fix for this is planned for the next release.</li>
<li>Bundled mods included with collections do not appear in the UI but are still applied to your game.</li>
<li>The success rating for collections is not showing the correct value.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The Library and Collections (WIP) pages are not filtered by game.</li>
<li>The "Switch View" option does not persist in the Library/Installed Mods view.</li>
<li>The "Load Order" heading toggle does not persist in the Load Order view.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download it for Linux (including Steam Deck) via the AppImage on the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.7.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release page</a>.</p>

      <title>Fedora Asahi Remix 41 brings AAA gaming to Apple Silicon with Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora Asahi Remix 41 is out now bringing the most polished version of Linux for Apple Silicon Macs, along with support for AAA gaming. <em>It's developed in collaboration between the Fedora Project and Asahi Linux.</em></p>
<p>As announced on the <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-asahi-remix-41-is-now-available/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fedora blog</a> it's built upon Fedora 41 with the KDE Plasma 6.2 desktop environment as their flagship (best supported), but GNOME 47 is also an option for those that want it. The exciting thing about this release is the much improved gaming experience!</p>
<p>Developer Alyssa Rosenzweig from the Asahi team blogged about the <em>big</em> gaming improvements that I covered here on GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/gaming-on-linux-with-apple-silicon-now-becoming-a-very-real-thing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in October</a>, and this release brings it all together along with the new and improved conformant Vulkan 1.4 driver. Writing about the graphics driver upgrade developer Rosenzweig <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vulkan-14-sur-asahi-linux.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Releasing a conformant driver reflects our commitment to graphics standards and software freedom. Asahi Linux is also compatible with OpenGL 4.6, OpenGL ES 3.2, and OpenCL 3.0, all conformant to the relevant specifications. For that matter, ours are the only conformant drivers on Apple hardware for any graphics standard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the likes of <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FEX</a> and various other projects, you <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-asahi-remix/x86-support/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">can run</a> Steam games directly.</p>
<p>Installing it on an Apple Silicon Mac is <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-asahi-remix/installation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">surprisingly easy</a> too, you just need access to a terminal and then run a simple command and it will walk you through it.</p>

<p>Wonderful to see such insanely impressive progress for running Linux on modern Apple Silicon hardware.</p>

      <title>The Steam Deck Stars Bundle on Steam has some top Deck Verified games for cheap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's your chance to get four absolutely brilliant games that are all Steam Deck Verified, have Native Linux support and at a discount too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This is thanks to a few developers on Steam teaming up for the Steam Deck Stars Bundle which gives you access to these great games:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li><strong>Dome Keeper - </strong>Defend against waves of alien attackers in this innovative roguelike survival miner. Dig for resources and choose from powerful upgrade paths. Is there enough time to mine a little deeper and get back to defend before the monsters attack your dome?</li>

      <title>Crescent County is an open-world &#34;witch-tech&#34; delivery life-sim where you travel around on a motorised broom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Witch-tech? That's a new one. Crescent County has a really fun idea and some lovely visuals too. It's a delivery life-sim where you move to a witch-tech island and explore its painterly open world on the back of your scrappy, souped-up motorbroom.</p>
<p>It's quite a unique blending of genres here this mixes together deliveries, exploration, customization, racing and bits of a slice-of-life game with a relationships system. Have a look at the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TryA1gjg1iY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/704368e30e7d451b78b4d7817087d8d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TryA1gjg1iY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“I’ve had Crescent County, and this world, living in my head since 2017. I need to make it. If I don’t make it I will start peeling off wallpaper with my teeth.” says Anna Hollinrake, founder and Creative Director. “We’re obsessed with building crunchy motorbroom gameplay with moreish home decoration and broom upgrade systems, whilst sticking a big vulnerable heart in the middle of it. We call it cozy-with-bite: making this beautiful, wholesome world people want to live in, and still have a tonne of fun, with challenge you can opt in to. Plus we want romance in there, but like, the messy kind.”</p>
<p>On the worldbuilding in Crescent County, Anna comments “I think genre mashups are where all the interesting stuff is. It’s sci fi and fantasy remixed to make souped-up motorbike brooms, and bathed in vibey lofi and alt-rock, playing out of your chunky 00s flip phone. It’s roller derby, scrappy, do-it-yourself zine subculture. It’s Ghibli but with considerably more crop tops and chokers. Getting to have The Beths soundtrack our announcement trailer was an absolute dream.”</p>
<p>The developer recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2202650/view/591757425095213765" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> the demo to include a "first steam deck native build" (a Native Linux version) which is fun to see. Seems they will only be supporting the Steam Deck directly and not Desktop Linux but it should run the same. If not, there's always <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Tempest Rising looks awesome and this RTS is launching in April 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I quite enjoyed the first initial demo of Tempest Rising, a classic RTS like Westwood used to make (Red Alert, Command &amp; Conquer) only a lot shinier and now it has a release date along with a new trailer. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to play this on Linux when it launches on April 24th, 2025.</p>
<p>Tempest Rising transports you to a battle-scarred 1997 in an alternate timeline where the Cuban Missile Crisis went nuclear. In the fallout from the war, a strange, red, electrical vine known as Tempest spread across the planet and changed the course of history, awakening an ancient race lying dormant known as the Veti, as teased in today’s new trailer.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic RTS base-building </strong>with fast, fluid, hard-hitting combat and tons of customization.</li>
<li><strong>Command two asymmetrical factions</strong>, each featuring unique harvesting models, resource systems, and distinct rosters of units for drastically different play styles.</li>
<li><strong>Two epic single-player campaigns </strong>with between-mission cutscenes to drive the story.</li>
<li><strong>Skirmish, custom games, and ranked multiplayer matchmaking</strong> with Glicko-2 rating.</li>
</ul>

      <title>A Game About Digging A Hole has you dig the stupidest biggest hole possible to find potential secrets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Game About Digging A Hole sounds like it might actually be somewhat amusing. As the name suggests, it's all about digging down deep where you might find some secrets.</p>
<p>This is why I love smaller developers. They come up with the simplest, stupidest and somehow the most interesting looking games. I'm not saying this looks incredible or anything, but the idea of it actually sounds like it might be great for some casual fun.</p>
<p>Created by developer Cyberwave, the idea for A Game About Digging a Hole was conceived during an early stage of Solarpunk’s development when the artists were testing voxel-based islands and the basics for terraforming and digging. Although too complex for such a small team, the core mechanics were already functional. As a big fan of the game Motherload, one artist had the idea of combining digging mechanics with randomly spawning ores and shovel upgrade options. This led to the quick development of a 3D digging mini-game, built on a proven concept without requiring lengthy prototypes or testing phases. Developed during the artist's vacation and saving development time by using licensed assets, A Game About Digging A Hole was developed in just 14 days.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P-Ys4PRZxsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c397b11f8932023861734122cb0968a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P-Ys4PRZxsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Game About Digging A Hole</em> challenges you to dig a hole in your newly purchased house. On your way down, collect resources to sell and upgrade equipment to dig deeper and take garden excavation to a new level! But beware! With every spadeful you take, you start to uncover a mysterious secret, and the deeper you dig, the closer you get to the truth. But take your time, as there is no rush and no rules. Just you, your spade and a great underground adventure! </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a nice bit of cheap casual fun to me. Releasing sometime in 2025 for £3.99 / €4.99 / $4.99.</p>

      <title>Drill-ship survival game Volcanoids adds big mech spiders and tanks that drill up through the ground to say hi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I still think Volcanoids has one of the absolutely coolest ideas for a survival game, with your base being a big moving drill that burrows through the earth and it just keeps on getting better. Volcanoids has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>While they're currently working away on a whole new island for a future update, they're still adding in some really exciting stuff here. The Machine Hunt update brings with it a new system where enemy robots after a while will get a bit "fed up with your bs" and go into a Hunt Mode where special military-grade enemies will appear to ruin your day. This includes a jumping scary spider mech, and a tank the drills up through the ground to join the party along with various new enemy structures.</p>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>

      <title>Wilderness survival roguelike Wayward adds creature territories, deities, item stacking and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wayward is an Early Access wilderness survival roguelike that's highly rated by players, and it just had a massive update launch with "Runekeeper". It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>If you've not played it before — it's a proper traditional roguelike. With random generation, optional permadeath and turn-based gameplay. It's a challenging one with a focus on simulation, exploration, and discovery. There are no classes and no levels. Progression of your character depends on individual skill and stat gains by your interactions with items or objects in the world. You are free to play and explore the game in any fashion you wish.</p>
<p>With the latest update out now it adds in some great sounding stuff like a simple creature territory system, item stacking, deities that can award you with tokens, wheelbarrows for additional storage help, armour stands, a new action bar that gets filled with context menu action history as you play, redesigned merchant trading and much more. All sounds great!</p>
<p>To go along with the update there's also a brand new trailer:</p>

<p>The full changelog of additions and improvements is a big one!</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h2>New</h2>
<ul>
<li>Creatures now have simplistic "territories" — creatures near your spawn point are now easier than creatures far away, and creatures will stay in their original areas more often.</li>
<br/>
<li>You have attracted the attention of multiple unknown forces — deities. As you survive and make decisions, these deities will award you with tokens in their likeness. Invoke them, and in turn, receive their blessing.</li>
<br/>
<li>You can now "stack" and "unstack" like items. Item stacks display as if they are the first item in the stack (respecting your sort), with a quantity of how many total items are in the stack. You can press "ctrl" to temporarily expand the stack your mouse is over.</li>
<br/>

      <title>Stoneshard major upgrade brings an upgradable fast-travel caravan system, cooking, new locations and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stoneshard is a very challenging open-world RPG currently in Early Access and the latest major release is a really big one. Stoneshard has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>The developers said it's "the largest update in the game's history" and it certainly reads like it. It adds in a brand new Caravan system, giving you fast travel of large distances. This is upgradable too, and you can get special Caravan followers as well.</p>

<p>On top of that they overhauled the dungeons system from scratch to give a lot more variety, some come with special conditions to give new challenges and there's a whole lot of new locations in the game to explore too. This is a seriously feature-packed release.</p>
<p>The update is so big it's not compatible with saves from the previous version, which they've made available via Steam Beta branches so you can still continue on if you wish.</p>
<p>Nice to see this one get such a great expansion, as it has been quite some time since the last major update to it and they've been clearly busy.</p>

      <title>Horror scavenging game KLETKA is like Lethal Company but an elevator wants to eat you</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for a new horror co-op adventure? KLETKA just entered Early Access on Steam with Native Linux support and it's quite an unnerving experience to explore it. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>Similar in basic style and idea to Lethal Company where you and a bunch of friends (or randoms) will explore a strange complex to gather loot. Here each player is a <em>dangerous</em> convicted criminal sent to Kletka. These apparent crimes are random and each give you a boost, like throwing faeces at a party that gives you a speed boost or the successful resurrection of someone when you joined a cult that gives you +1 lives.</p>
<p>Your sentence? Explore the depths of a massive structure across various floors to find loot, while keeping a hungry elevator stocked full with fuel and flesh. Fail to feed the elevator enough? You become dinner.</p>
<p>The problem is — the floors you explore are quite dangerous. Filled with traps, anomalies and all sorts to separate your head from your body. There will be plenty of deaths ahead. Not just that but Kletka itself, the elevator, has a mind of its own. Sometimes it might be unable to stop, or just refuse to stop where you wanted it to. Even fixing it can be dangerous for your health.</p>
<p>With a thick atmosphere and PS1-era visuals it's actually pretty darn good. And Steam players seem to be enjoying it too with a Very Positive rating. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="79a5Q_ak2Uc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8ff8d007be377ccdd3e59d9e2e97e974.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/79a5Q_ak2Uc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Compared with the original demo the developer says it's been massively expanded to include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Heart of the Gigastructure mode: 120 floors divided into two biomes. The boss is waiting for you at the end.</li>
<li>Endless Mode.</li>
<li>Factory biome.</li>
<li>10+ new unique floors.</li>
<li>5+ new enemies and entities.</li>
<li>5+ new random events.</li>
<li>2 new Floor Curses.</li>
<li>New objects of the environment and ways to interact with them.</li>
<li>New items of equipment.</li>
<li>New cosmetics.</li>
<li>7 new achievements.</li>
<li>Leaderboards.</li>
<li>Steam Workshop.</li>
<li>Network code fixes and optimization of GPU and CPU load.</li>
<li>Correction of floor generation.</li>
<li>Fixing minor bugs that spoil the atmosphere.</li>
<li>Many new <s>bugs</s> anomalies have been added.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's in Early Access expect there to be bugs. I've seen the game completely crash to the Steam Library on me, as expected from an unfinished game.</p>

      <title>Little Rocket Lab is probably the cutest production-line automation sim ever</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No More Robots and Teenage Astronauts recently revealed Little Rocket Lab, a cozy take on the production-line automation genre and it looks lovely.</p>
<p>More: " You play as Morgan, an aspiring engineer who is shooting for the stars. Somehow she plans to build an entire rocket ship on the outskirts of her hometown, starting with small contraptions, and working her way to humongous, sprawling, automated machines."</p>
<p>Little Rocket Lab is basically Factorio, but cozy, with a little Stardew Valley thrown in with a little village, NPCs that may help (or annoy you), friendships to sort out, puzzles to solve and more.  It really does look super sweet, check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Chilly survival game BLACKFROST: The Long Dark 2 announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While they're finishing up work on the final bits of The Long Dark, Hinterland recently revealed the next game with BLACKFROST: The Long Dark 2. A full sequel, building upon what they've learned through the 10 years of developing the first game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">An exciting addition to the sequel is that it will have online co-op support. From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BLACKFROST builds on a decade of construction, experimentation, and community-informed development of an experience we love dearly. It expands beyond the ego-centrism of THE LONG DARK and asks you, not how far you will go to survive, but how far will you go to survive <em>for others</em>?<br/>
<br/>
The “others” could be other players in co-op, but also other survivors in the world. NPC communities hiding out from the dangers of the aurora, the radioactive “black frost”, and a whole host of new threats they experience in the city of Harmont and the vast wilderness surrounding it. What new scenarios, gameplay mechanics, and stories could such a setting inspire?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4wlttElgLg4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99a8dded83211f1d638bf53b6e70cfc9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4wlttElgLg4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Expect a lot more new than just co-op. New hazards, a "Will to Live system" to add a psychological element to it and much more. The new setting sounds interesting too. Still very cold, but there's also cities and towns rather than just running around the complete wilderness.</p>
<p>Supported platforms aren't clear yet, so we don't know if it will have Native Linux support like the first, or if you'll need to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux. It won't launch until 2026, so we've got a while to wait on it anyway and it will again be going into Early Access like they did with the first game.</p>

      <title>Palworld: Feybreak major update launches December 23</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair have announced the big free update for Palworld named Feybreak is set for launch on December 23, as they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/palworld-dev-details-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continue battling Nintendo</a>. If you missed it they're also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/were-getting-a-palworld-x-terraria-crossover-major-palworld-update-in-december/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doing a Terraria crossover</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a major gameplay mechanic was changed recently with how you summon your Pals. In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> in November they made it so instead of throwing a Pal Sphere at a specific point to summon one, they're now always summoned next to the player. This was <em>probably</em> a change made in relation to the Nintendo lawsuit.</p>
<p>For the major Feybreak update the developers simply announced: "The new mysterious island is the largest and harshest in Palworld's history. The island is about six times the size of Sakurajima, which was added in the last major update! A powerful faction leader and many vicious new species of Pals lurk here."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.3 will have much better fractional scaling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team continuing building up the next version of the popular KDE Plasma desktop environment, with Plasma 6.3.0 getting some great additions.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2024/12/14/this-week-in-plasma-better-fractional-scaling/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from developer Nate Graham some of what's coming includes KWin's zoom effect switching to a "pixel-perfect representation and overlays a grid on top of the screen" which should be useful for artists and designers. On top of that you will be able to switch to a setting that has Plasma "prefer screen color accuracy at the expense of some system performance, should that be your preference", another one good for artists.</p>
<p>Perhaps more exciting for general desktop use is the big improvements to fractional scaling. As noted by Graham " it makes an effort to always snap things to the screen's pixel grid, greatly reducing blurriness and visual gaps everywhere", and they noted how they've been using 175% scale factor for a week and it all looks "fantastic".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12964518551734343083gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A visual change coming in 6.3 is that Plasma panels now appear on screen only after their contents have been fully loaded, which should prevent some weird looking pop-in.</p>
<p>KDE Plasma 6.3 is due for release in February, 2025. At some point between the 6th and the 11th depending on how many issues they find.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12358439231734341404gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some fun additions this release include:</p>

      <title>Xfce 4.20 desktop released with experimental Wayland support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After two years of work the Xfce team have release Xfce 4.20 which amongst many other things, now has very experimental Wayland support.</p>
<p>With it still being experimental they only recommend Wayland for "advanced users" but "almost all Xfce components are able to run on Wayland windowing, while still keeping support for X11 windowing". For now they suggest using Labwc and Wayfire, since Xfce doesn't have a compositor that supports Wayland yet but plans are underway they said to get Wayland support in their own Xfwm4.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1555975191734340660gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Various other new features and improvements including improvements to the file manager Thunar like an option to use client side decorations, performance improvements, crash / freeze fixes, Ipv6 remote URLs are now supported and more. The Xfce panel can now have the border width configurable, icon size management has overall improvements, there is now the possibility to show the desktop when hovering the mouse on the "show desktop" panel icon and various other improvements.</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_14.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Do you use Xfce? If so, why do you use it and not others like KDE and GNOME?</p>

<p>Once it's out we'll eventually see Valve and their partners at Codeweavers update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and we'll then see a Proton 10.0 release as well. We don't know when that will happen though, for the Wine 9 to Proton 9 release, it took about a month and a half to arrive.</p>

      <title>The upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S may come with a SteamOS Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The leaked but unannounced Lenovo Legion Go S seems like it will come in two different versions, and one of them may even be with SteamOS Linux like Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As reported first by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320477/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-gaming-pc-rumors" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, who spotted a <a href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1867499994090963132" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X from @evleaks, it shows the device in both black and white. Interestingly though, the black version has a Steam logo sitting next to one of the buttons, which the white version doesn't have.</p>
<p>It's really not much to go on but with Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valves-new-branding-guidelines-hint-at-steam-decks-steamos-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent updates to their branding guidelines</a>, and how we know Valve have planned to release SteamOS 3 to other hardware vendors, it's slowly all coming together now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11677001551734269634gol1.png"/><br/>

<p>This could end up being the first third-party to use SteamOS on a handheld. At least, this seems to be the first vendor that's had a leak that points towards it. CES 2025 is right around the corner, where we might expect to see announcements like it, so next year could start off with a bit of a bang for Linux gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>We may finally see a return of the original Steam Machine idea from Valve, just in handheld form. Or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/valve-may-be-working-on-a-new-kind-of-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">perhaps something more</a> as well.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VKD3D-Proton v2.14 is now available bringing various improvements to the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan layer that's used by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> for running Windows games on Linux.</p>
<p>This is used directly by Proton so you don't need to do anything yourself for it on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux. Proton Experimental usually pulls in changes from it quite regularly, as does GE-Proton.</p>
<p>For new features there's a DXGI frame statistics implementation, a new global frame rate limiter, support for planar video formats like NV12, improved support for DLSS3 frame generation via dxvk-nvapi and a number of performance improvements included.</p>
<p>A bunch of game-specific improvements too for the likes of World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XVI, Dragon Age: Veilguard, Helldivers 2, Star Wars: Outlaws, The First Descendant, Skull &amp; Bones, Hunt: Showdown, Red Dead Redemption and others.</p>

<em>Pictured - The First Descendant</em></p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement DXGI frame statistics (exposed by DXVK DXGI).</li>
<li>Implement a global frame rate limiter (see <code class="inline-code">VKD3D_FRAME_RATE</code> or <code class="inline-code">DXVK_FRAME_RATE</code>).<br/>
	Also improves behavior of presentation with swap interval &gt; 1 since we use frame limiter instead<br/>
	of duplicated presents now. Also allows support for full-screen frame rate targets in DXGI which normally would imply a mode change.</li>
<li>Implement support for planar video formats such as NV12.</li>
<li>Implement D24 depth bias correctly now on AMD when <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_depth_bias_control</code> is supported.</li>
<li>Expose a new command interop interface that allows e.g. dxvk-nvapi to implement DLSS3 frame generation.</li>
<li>Use VK_KHR_compute_shader_derivatives when available.</li>
<li>Use VK_EXT_device_generated_commands when available. Expose execute indirect tier 1.1.</li>
<li>Implement GPU upload heap from latest AgilitySDKs. Allows explicit control over ReBAR instead of heuristic based hacks in games that use the new API.</li>
<li>Implement ID3DDestructionNotifier. Fixes some particular games that expect this to be supported.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reduce some VRAM bloat on RDNA2 and 3 GPUs when <code class="inline-code">VK_MESA_image_alignment_control</code> is exposed.</li>
<li>Improve CPU overhead for games that query swapchain format support over and over.</li>
<li>Remove old heuristic that preferred 2 frames of latency depending on BufferCount used.<br/>
	The default on DXGI is 3, and using 2 caused some performance issues in various games with GPU starvation,<br/>
	especially on Deck. <code class="inline-code">VKD3D_SWAPCHAIN_LATENCY_FRAMES</code> is still available as an override to force a tighter default.</li>
<li>Rewrite queue submission logic to deal better with difficult submission patterns such as FSR3 3.1 Frame Generation.<br/>
	On implementations with only one graphics queue, vkd3d-proton will now attempt to do basic software scheduling of GPU work.<br/>
	This may regress GPU performance in some other cases and <code class="inline-code">VKD3D_CONFIG=no_staggered_submit</code> is a way to disable this code path.<br/>
	One particularly big improvement is FF XVI on RADV with FSR 3 frame-gen, with almost doubled performance in some cases.<br/>
	We are still awaiting a proper kernel-level fix for this problem to be fully resolved.</li>
<li>Rewrite queue submission logic to use fewer "dummy" wait/signal submissions.<br/>
	Works around pathological CPU overhead in amdgpu taking 20ms+ to submit work in some cases.</li>
<li>Rewrite queue submission logic for sparse updates to be more efficient.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes and workarounds</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rework various multi-sampling queries to be more spec correct.</li>
<li>Workaround bugged MSAA behavior in World of Warcraft.</li>
<li>Workaround buggy/questionable use of ID3D12PipelineLibrary in FF XVI.</li>
<li>Always use native 16-bit integers for min16int. Fixes some real-world bugs where shaders expect min16int is always implemented as 16-bit.</li>
<li>Workaround game bug leading to GPU hang in Dragon Age: Veilguard on RADV.</li>
<li>Always emit proper floating-point environment modes in DXBC shaders. Fixes glitched eyes in Dragon Age: Veilguard on NV.</li>
<li>Fix potential use-after-free bug for some sparse resource update cases.</li>
<li>Correctly validate when application attempts to allocate a too large descriptor heap.<br/>
	Fixes Stalker 2 entering into undefined behavior.</li>
<li>A lot of misc fixes in dxil-spirv as usual.</li>
<li>Workaround broken amdgpu zerovram behavior on 6.10+ kernels. Fixes random extreme glitchiness in Helldivers 2 on AMD.</li>
<li>Workaround NV issue which lead to GPU hang when loading a save file in Star Wars: Outlaws.</li>
<li>Fix copying between BC &lt;-&gt; RGBA images in some cases.</li>
<li>Add workaround for a game bug in The First Descendant which lead to broken cubemap reflections in some cases.</li>
<li>Workaround Skull &amp; Bones crashing on startup on NV GPUs by disabling Reflex support.</li>
<li>Workaround Hunt: Showdown missing precise qualifiers on vertex shaders, leading to glitched rendering.</li>
<li>Workaround poor CPU performance in Red Dead Redemption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc / Debug</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add support for instruction_qa_checks. For deep debug, allows us to be notified when NaNs and Infs are generated in shaders.<br/>
	For internal QA use.</li>
<li>Add fine-grained control of QA behavior on a per-shader basis. For narrowing down issues.</li>
<li>Remove a bunch of old and obsolete workarounds for NV drivers. New cutoff is 535 series.</li>
<li>Bump exposed SDKVersion to 614 to match latest stable AgilitySDK.</li>
<li>Add an optional code path to support DXBC via the official dxilconv library.<br/>
	This code is not enabled in release builds,<br/>
	and is currently only intended as a path to take advantage of QA instrumentation for DXBC shaders.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Turok: Origins announced and it&#39;s now a third-person shooter with co-op</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turok: Origins was announced by Saber Interactive and this time it's a third-person shooter, with an optional co-op element where three people can team up to take on the dinosaurs and some new alien threat. The originals were first-person so the new third-person angle will likely split fans.</p>
<p>You'll have to watch the trailer direct on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ELi_UslrA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, as they put an age-gate on it which annoyingly prevents it from being playable in an embed. Here's some screenshots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14182704101734096943gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14182704101734096943gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19512998941734096945gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19512998941734096945gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17983620461734096946gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17983620461734096946gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8720505671734096947gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8720505671734096947gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Turok was one of the first console shooters I ever played," said Matthew Karch, CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive. "When we looked at game franchises that we felt deserved to be brought back, Turok was at the top of our list. At Saber, we love taking classic IP and combining it with fresh gameplay. We are excited to finally announce the game, but we’ll be even happier when we deliver this old-school experience with modern-day execution.”</p>
<p>“Turok is an iconic game franchise that has fascinated players for decades. As we embark on its revival, we’re proud to honor its rich heritage while reimagining it for a new era,” said Bill Kispert, SVP &amp; GM, Games &amp; Digital Platforms at Universal Products &amp; Experiences. “Rooted in comic book origins, this absorbing, adrenaline-charged series is truly one that deserves a comeback, and we're dedicated to delivering an exciting experience chock full of story, action, combat and creatures that both longtime fans and newcomers will appreciate.”  </p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fight Against Enemies</strong>: Battle alone or as a team against a variety of dinosaurs, creatures, and bosses that take to the ground, sky, swamps, and caves to push players’ skills to the limit. Engage in intense combat, where players must use everything at their disposal to ensure success, including melee attacks, special abilities, and fine-tuned weapons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unleash Your Arsenal:</strong> Unlock and upgrade your advanced weaponry to dominate your battles and neutralize your enemies. Plasma rifles, ray guns, snipers, bows, shotguns, and more are all at your disposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlock DNA Powers:</strong> Extract DNA from fallen foes and the environment to unlock game-changing powers that evolve your suit in real-time. Each DNA power not only enhances your look but also offers upgradeable skills and abilities to give you an edge in combat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Experience an Epic Story Across the Lost Lands:</strong> Throughout Turok’s missions, players will journey across breathtaking yet deadly worlds on various planets. From ancient temples and wasteland canyons to dense jungles, each location holds pieces of an unforgettable story that is packed with twists and turns. </p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully it's a proper complete game, and not some more attempts at live-service but we'll have to wait and see. Since it has online co-op too, it's not clear if they'll end up putting some anti-cheat in that ends up blocking <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux / Steam Deck, so keep an eye on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-21 released for Linux / Steam Deck bringing more game fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 9-21 has been released as the community-maintained version of the Proton compatibility layer for running Windows games on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck. Confused on the Proton versions?

<li>Backported wine bug fix patch 56653 for GetLogicalProcessorInformation, fixes edge case crash on some systems for a few games, notably baldurs gate 3 and divinity original sin 2 (thanks <a href="https://github.com/mx-moth" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mx-moth</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protonfixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add fix for dirt 3 outside of steam (thanks polluxau)</li>
<li>Remove no longer needed Disgaea 4 fix (thanks UsernamesAreNotMyThing)</li>
<li>Added fix for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Shredders Revenge (thanks FranjeGueje)</li>

      <title>Slay the Spire 2 gets a first trailer - coming to Early Access in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slay the Spire 2 is coming to Early Access in 2025 and we have the first official trailer to get you ready for more deck-building. We don't know exactly when it will arrive but we do know it will have Native Linux support built with Godot.</p>
<p>From what they've shown the production value has gone up quite a bit since the first game, with some nice new character models and animations going on. Still very much Slay the Spire just looking a fair bit more impressive - and that's exactly what I want to see.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ttVtllHkb4E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07e63a931de3f8e5cb89a4905bcb9881.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ttVtllHkb4E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been 1000 years since the Spire last opened its doors… and since we first announced that Slay the Spire 2 was in development! At long last, the gameplay reveal for the sequel to the original, iconic roguelike deckbuilder is here, as revealed earlier today at The Game Awards.<br/>
<br/>
Step into the newly evolved Spire, a twisted labyrinth teeming with strange and deadly foes. With a new and returning cast of characters, adapt to an arsenal of brand new cards, relics, and potions, each offering game-changing possibilities—or dangerous consequences.<br/>
<br/>
What new strategies and challenges await…?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With tons of hours in the first game, I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel. Hopefully it will have full controller support so that we can play it wherever we like from Desktop to Steam Deck. Although, it's such a simple game in terms of controls it should work fine on Deck regardless.</p>

      <title>The Illuminate have returned in a massive Helldivers 2 update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Helldivers 2 just dropped a colossal update that sees the return of the Illuminate faction, a bunch of powerful aliens that like to destroy colonies and take over the minds of your fellow humans.</p>
<p>And with it, a whole lot of extra content is available to play through with a bunch of new toys for your Helldivers to go with it like a Fast Recon Vehicle "FRV" for you and your squad to plough-through the hordes of human citizens turned into zombies. You're going to need it too, with the new setting for all the battles. No more big open spaces, instead you'll be fighting through busy cities. </p>
<p>Check out the rather great action-packed trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Zk0XkX0U_m0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fcc0f2d5b23243437670475021383539.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Zk0XkX0U_m0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some nice overall additions to the game on top of all the new content. Like being able to actually reconnect to your last match if you had a game crash, finally. On top of loads of fixes for various other bugs, the developers have clearly been incredible busy on this update and it shows.</p>
<p>I also let off a little cackling laugh when I read the known issues list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Top Priority:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players are unable to emote when flying through the air</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The developers clearly know what we want.</em></p>
<p>I've been playing a bunch of it this morning and wow — the update is awesome. Still works just fine on Desktop Linux tested with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Proton 9.0-4 release</a>.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN co-op spin-off announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN was announced by FromSoftware and Bandai Namco Entertainment for 2025. It's a co-op spin-off and it sounds pretty exciting. No clear release date yet since it has only just been announced but it's coming to Steam and PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>Co-op is not actually required, but it's firmly built around it being a co-op game. As the announcement mentioned: "Teaming up in squads of three – or daring to go solo – they must outlast a three day-and-night cycle, making split decisions about combat and exploration across changing maps to become strong enough to take down terrifying bosses at the end of each day".</p>
<p>It's the same game world as the first ELDEN RING but it's "set in a universe parallel to the events of ELDEN RING". Presumably so they can eventually do an ELDEN RING 2 and not have to worry about anything that goes on here at all. You'll get to pick from eight unique characters, each with their own unique abilities and powerful Ultimates.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>

<p>Hopefully like the first game any anti-cheat will be enabled properly so we can play it on Linux / Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.

      <title>Core Keeper developer announced KYORA that looks suspiciously like Terraria where &#34;every pixel is yours to shape&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terraria 2? Well, they can't call it that of course, but it sure looks like it. Coming from developer Pugstorm and published by Chucklefish, KYORA looks quite delightful.</p>
<p>Pugstorm did <em>fantastic</em> work with Core Keeper so they're no strangers to exploration and crafting games, and some devs from Chucklefish worked on Terraria <em>and</em> created Starbound so it's all coming together here.</p>
<p>More: "Cross into a realm of ruins, where every pixel is a tool to create something new. Mine precious resources, craft physics-altering wands, take on powerful bosses, and build your base by terraforming the world around you. "</p>
<p>Check out the very short teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8ARR4JIIEgk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f71541fe5dc79efe47ea096c5a070685.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8ARR4JIIEgk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Journey into the unexpected, in a procedurally-generated open world. Carve into the earth or sculpt toward the sky in search of magical materials. Craft matter-manipulating wands, upgrade your gear, and take on the powerful bosses in control of each biome: the Heralds.</li>
<li>Let loose your sandbox creativity with pixel-by-pixel terraforming. Build bridges to new areas, sculpt and customise your dream base with terrapixel materials, or even use your terraforming powers mid-battle to construct platforms and cover.</li>
<li>The world of KYORA is filled with secrets. The further you venture, the more dangers await. To survive KYORA’S forest-cloaked ruins and cross its blistering desert sands, you’ll need to use each biome’s resources to your advantage. Gather materials, forge powerful weapons and armour, plant seeds and cook up recipes to help you traverse the wilds...</li>
<li>It’s dangerous to go alone! Bring your buddies with you to combine skills, creating fun synergies between wand abilities, in up to 8-player online co-op gameplay.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I've seen it will again have Native Linux support. It also has controller support so it should be good to go on Steam Deck too!</p>

      <title>The Witcher IV revealed with Ciri as the protagonist</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a 6 minute cinematic trailer, CD PROJEKT RED have lifted the lid on The Witcher IV which will feature Ciri as the protagonist.</p>
<p>Powered by a "customized" Unreal Engine 5, the press email noted the new cinematic trailer "is pre-rendered in a custom build of Unreal Engine 5 on an unannounced NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPU". Additionally they said it's "Powered by the same tech that The Witcher IV is built on, using assets and models from the game itself, it aims to provide players with a cinematic look at the kind of experience the game is aspiring to provide. The trailer was created through a close collaboration between CD PROJEKT RED and Platige Image, who are no strangers to The Witcher universe, having been responsible for intro cinematics in the previous installments of the series".</p>
<p>So keep in mind the actual game will probably still look quite a bit different. This is really just to start the hype machine and get players invested in the waiting game for it. At least we get our first look at the game world as Ciri takes on a Witcher contract in a remote village terrorized for generations by a monster demanding ritual sacrifice</p>
<p>Have a looksie below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="54dabgZJ5YA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/404d4639fa9520343f240e60236d7788.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/54dabgZJ5YA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We're kicking off a brand-new Witcher saga, this time with Ciri as the heart of the story!” said Sebastian Kalemba, Game Director. “It feels so good to finally be able to say those words — for the longest time we knew that we wanted Ciri to be the protagonist of The Witcher IV; it just felt natural to us and we believe that Ciri deserves it. In this game we want to explore what it means to truly become a witcher by following Ciri on her Path. This trailer is a taste of both that, and just how dark and grounded the world of The Witcher can be.”</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part II Remastered comes to PC on April 3, 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Naughty Dog announced that finally The Last of Us Part II Remastered will be getting a PC release! It arrives on April 3, 2025. Now this one I am seriously excited to finally play. My patience is paying off! I truly loved playing through the first game, so I'm going to be getting this for sure.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog are partnering up with Nixxes Software and Iron Galaxy Studios for this one. Naughty Dog said it will be "newly optimized and enhanced for PC" but they're not giving details on PC-specific features yet which they will do closer to the launch date.</p>
<p>Check out the PC announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AsOJ1JJJ4Zc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4e5cc528aacc95b17db2085eb9d4bd1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AsOJ1JJJ4Zc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We’re all thrilled to bring The Last of Us Part II to the PC audience, including all the great new features we added in the Remastered version for PS5,” The Last of Us Part II Remastered Game Director Matthew Gallant said. “We hope players enjoy the captivating story, rich combat mechanics, extensive behind-the-scenes commentary, and test their skills in the roguelike mode No Return. We’re working hard to ensure that the game feels great on this new platform, and has the high performance and robust features that PC players expect.”</p>
<p>Hopefully it won't have any troubles being played on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. The Steam Deck might be a bit dicey though, let's hope they work on some optimisations for it there too. </p>
<p>Since it's a Sony game it will again require you have a PlayStation Network Account.</p>

      <title>New Arc Line is a promising new RPG about the conflict between Magic and Engineering</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have very fond memories of a seriously janky RPG called Arcanum from way back in the year 2000, and the release of New Arc Line <em>could</em> end up being the spiritual successor I've been wanting all these years. <em>Note: key provided by the publisher.</em></p>
<p>Now in Early Access from Dreamate and Fulqrum Publishing it's <em>directly</em> inspired by the classic Arcanum through many of the features and the setting. New Arc Line is set in a world on the verge of a massive change, following sorcery being outpaced by technological progress where the two sides are set to violently collide.</p>
<p>The good news, is that as far as I can tell, the initial Early Access release works really quite nicely on Desktop Linux with the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> latest stable Proton 9.0-4</a> (and worked fine with Proton 9.0-3 before it).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AXy0JpZVPeg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7afea49ebcdeaf43434b99de6ce7dfed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AXy0JpZVPeg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In terms of performance on Desktop Linux, no real problems there. Sticking with the High preset overall, the game manages to remain at least around 60FPS at 2560x1440 with my Ryzen 5800x / Radeon 6800 XT.</p>
<p>This definitely ticks a lot of the right boxes for me. A party-based RPG that has an interesting setting, backed up by some pretty good visuals. The graphics are a bit of a <em>mixed</em> bag though. Some parts are quite detailed, others quite lacking. I like it, a lot, especially with all the different interactions you can have with the world. And the way it just sort-of throws you into the thick of it is interesting, as you're then trying to piece together what the heck is going on, before it throws you back in time before the intro began so you can then see what you apparently did.</p>
<p><em>But there's also a lot of issues with it.</em></p>
<p>With it being in Early Access there's a rather large amount of really rough edges. Some quick initial issues I spotted include: the intro video text going too fast to read (and I'm a fast reader), some object interactions need tweaking for where you can actually click on them, various dodgy camera angles when chatting to other characters, some of the English text really needs serious proof-reading, various smaller bugs throughout and so on.</p>
<p>It's not just the quality of the English text but the writing <em>overall</em>, it's just odd, they're going to need a big pass over all of it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Become the Hero or Villain you want to be</strong></p>
<p>Create your own character as a human or elf, and choose your gender, background, and appearance. Keep in mind that inhabitants of this world might have their own prejudices and will treat you differently depending on your choices.</p>
<p><strong>Gather your Party</strong></p>
<p>You won’t be alone on these shores. Meet &amp; recruit a diverse cast of characters, learn their stories, face their demons together and help them grow, or use them for your own gain and discard them as fits your schemes. Who knows, maybe you will even find your true love!</p>
<p><strong>Master Technology or Magic</strong></p>
<p>Will you master the secrets of Magic to incinerate enemies as a Hellfire occultist, curse them with mystical Voodoo abilities, or assist your allies as a Celestial sage? Or will you rather cast aside the obsolete ways and become a Steampunk mechanic, Dieselpunk engineer or Teslapunk scientist, and turn your character into a walking steam-powered fortress?</p>
<p><strong>Fight for Your Right</strong></p>
<p>Command your party in turn-based tactical battles. Fight head-on and brute-force your way through encounters, or observe and analyse each situation and come up with cunning strategies to conquer even seemingly overwhelming odds. There’s a plethora of skills, spells, crafting recipes and consumables at your disposal to turn the tide of battle in your favour.</p>
<p><strong>Manifest Your Destiny</strong></p>
<p>Make a name for yourself, influence countless lives for better or worse, and watch the consequences of your choices unfold. You may start as only a poor immigrant, but soon your exploits will fill the front pages of newspapers, and the events you set in motion will change the fate of the New World forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Early Access release currently only has about a quarter of the main story, which they say is around a third of the overall planned content. So you've got about 10-12 hours worth of exploring here.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing this one progress as they've got a great foundation here to build a wonderful RPG. They just need to sort all the quirks and bugs on it, and improve the text. Needs a fair bit more time in the oven overall, although it does already have a Very Positive rating on Steam. I can understand what people see in it but it's clearly not ready.</p>
<p>Once finished though, this could be a nice palate cleanser if you've completed Baldur's Gate 3, or you're just in the mood for a party-based RPG with an interesting world.</p>

      <title>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered v1.4 brings various controller fixes plus improvements to AMD FSR and Intel XeSS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just in time for my new playthrough, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered was updated to version 1.4 today bringing with it plenty of improvements and it should work better for Steam Deck / gamepad controller players.</p>
<p>For the controller support they made it so Steam Input now functions correctly if a controller is connected <em>after</em> launching the game, and controllers connected to a Steam Deck now work as intended when using Steam Remote Play. The latter is good, because that's exactly how I was trying to play it recently and my controller was acting a bit oddly. If you're using AMD FSR or Intel XeSS for upscaling, they've also improved it to reduce ghosting on snow particles.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Disco Elysium and Fallout, Weather Factory announce Travelling at Night</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This could be a good one! Weather Factory developers of Cultist Simulator and BOOK OF HOURS just revealed their third game called Travelling at Night. A combat-free game inspired by CRPGs like Disco Elysium, Planescape: Torment, and Fallout 1+2. Much like their previous games it will have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It's actually set in the same world as both Cultist Simulator and BOOK OF HOURS, although a standalone title. A dialogue-driven choices-matter combat-free CRPG with what they say has "forty-plus hours of notably replayable noir-myth narrative". Here you will guide "an occult carnival on a pilgrimage to locate buried power that could alter the balance of the Cold War". They love Disco Elysium so much they called it a Disco-like.</p>
<p>No trailer available yet so here's a couple of early screenshots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3142753931734009748gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3142753931734009748gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14476386391734009749gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14476386391734009749gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4407816691734009750gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4407816691734009750gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9760863901734009750gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9760863901734009750gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CHOOSE your Career and Passions. Are you an exorcist driven by Sorrow, a stage magician seeking to feed your Appetite, or a physician who can't resist Curiosity?</li>
<li>EXPLORE the wonders and horrors of a Europe changed forever by the War in the World and the War in the Sun.</li>
<li>BUILD your character from sixteen very different skills. Dignity is essential for physicians who need to be taken seriously. Spivvery is the only way to ensure a hot meal in a cold world. Any writer will tell you that Sophistication is useful, somehow. And everyone knows Skolekosophy is the study of things that shouldn't be studied.</li>
<li>FIND Memories and Signs as you roam the ruins, or glean them from your conversations with NPCs. Use them to grow your Skills and Passions, developing your character along the lines that run shining into the dark.</li>
<li>CONSPIRE WITH OR BETRAY the Incorporates, the Ministries, the remortals of the old order. Sell them the power you've unearthed, keep it for yourself, or surrender it to something new.</li>
<li>COMBAT? No. After six years of war, there's been enough of that for now. But there are still plenty of ways to die, and as anyone who's lived through the War in the World can tell you, there's worse things than death.</li>
<li>CONCLUDE with your choice of alliance, consequence, destination. Uncover multiple endings; see the consequences of difficult decisions made from different motives in each playthrough.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going to follow this one along with great interest. The style of it looks great and the story sounds like it could be quite exciting to play through.</p>

      <title>Golf With Your Friends 2 announced for Early Access in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Golf With Your Friends 2 has been announced by Radical Forge and Team17 bringing the next-generation of golfing chaos.</p>
<p>What to expect from it? So far they've revealed very little in the way of real details. It's going to go into Early Access first for about 6 months, so you're not getting a finished game right away. What we do know is that it will have new game mechanics, a weather system and cross-platform online multiplayer with the ability to build your own courses.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The eventual 1.0 release they say will have: </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6 Courses.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform Online Multiplayer.</li>
<li>Cross Platform Level Editor.</li>
<li>New Course mechanics.</li>
<li>Weather Hazards.</li>
<li>New ways to customise your balls.</li>
<li>Level Up and Unlock Rewards!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Only 6 courses seems pretty content-light and the first game ended up with quite a few DLC, with Early Access planned to only have 2 courses, so we'll have to see how this goes.</p>
<p>The announcement trailer was a whole lot of nothing, simply to start the hype machine:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l7e0BuVs4l8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34a699b32245944e00eb25716750a81e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l7e0BuVs4l8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not entirely clear what platforms will be supported just yet. The first game did have Native Linux support, but we've seen a lot of games drop that in favour of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for sequels. Either way, it will probably work fine with Proton.</p>

      <title>Chrysalis is a unique hybrid of tower defense and rogue-lite RPG action where you possess plants and creatures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chrysalis from developer Metamorph Games wins top marks for some originality here, and if you're a fan of cute tower defense games that mix in some exploration this is one for you. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>The whole idea here is that you're defending a Chrysalis and attempting to cleanse a garden of corruption, split across two different game phases. The first is more like an exploration game where as a Wisp you're able to fly around and possess various creatures and plants, as you expand and explore the map to gather resources to build up defences while waiting for the incoming waves. The second phase is tower defense when the timer is up and the waves of enemies begin coming in.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O68anybvTq4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9fbaa18e43006ff433e0e4508fe7d669.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O68anybvTq4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Playing like a mixture of a mini-RPG with tower defense and creature collection, it's certainly <em>different</em> with the blend of game mechanics. While you can only directly possess one creature at a time, that you can keep levelling up to access more power and abilities, you can also gain followers that each have their own level as well. They will follow you around and attack enemies with you helping you on your quest to purge the corruption across the map and defend your Chrysalis during enemy waves.</p>
<p>Wrapped up in a slower, sweet garden setting, once the enemies arrive the map and atmosphere warps into something slightly more sinister.</p>
<p>It starts off a little on the slow side as it eases you in, but once you get going the game will keep expanding with new types of enemies, bigger waves and various abilities you can add to your creatures. It's one that's worth sticking with to see how it expands and changes. A little gem.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tower Defense Roguelike Hybrid:</strong> Navigate dynamic, changing environments while strategically building up your defenses. Items you find while exploring have synergistic effects on both your creatures and your plant-based defenses.</li>
<li><strong>Symbiosis:</strong> take control of any friendly plant or animal in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Metamorphosis:</strong> level up your creatures and plants, transform them into more powerful versions, and apply elemental Spirits for further customization.</li>
<li><strong>Mutation:</strong> a complex mutation system combines different species to create new creatures with unique sets of abilities and metamorphoses. You'll still be finding new creatures with new abilities after dozens of playthroughs!</li>
<li><strong>Customization and Randomization:</strong> at the beginning of each playthrough, you choose a Chrysalis that caters to a specific style of play, with unlockable abilities that increase your power as you progress. By defeating waves of monsters, you will earn random Boons which grant additional passive or active abilities, offering further ways to enhance your controlled creatures.</li>
<li><strong>Procedurally Generated Levels:</strong> No two levels are the same - there are endless possibilities each run!</li>
<li><strong>Permadeath - with a twist:</strong> If a creature you possess with Symbiosis dies, the Wisp survives and can possess a new creature. But if your Chrysalis is destroyed, the game is over - it's time to use the knowledge you gained to start a new playthrough!</li>
<li><strong>Save Anytime:</strong> you can save the game at any time and the entire state of the current level is stored, so you can pick up right where you left off!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steampunk bullet heaven auto-shooter Airships: Lost Flotilla releases January 23</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla from developer David Stark and Metaroot has been announced for release on January 23, a bullet heaven survivor-like spin off from Stark's previous highly rated game Airships: Conquer the Skies.</p>
<p>It's a fun game and a good mixture of ship types and enemies that make it quite interesting. Enemies have different attack patterns you need to learn, and there's some huge boss fights as well.</p>
<p>The type of ship you pick and customise really affects you run as well. Pick the slow but powerful Battleship, the nimble Copter, or the Science Vessel with its railgun and energy shield. You build up a strategy around each of their strengths and weaknesses. As you progress through a run you improve your ship with new weapons and upgrades to find some fun combinations.</p>
<p>There's a demo available with Native Linux support, which went through a small update to mark the release date being announced. Also a new trailer you can watch below:</p>

      <title>Steam Beta for Dec 11 brings new game update options plus a new downloader style</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Steam Client Beta for Desktop and Steam Deck has been released, and Valve have given us new options for managing game updates and there's a new downloader style.</p>
<p>For some reason, Valve <em>still</em> won't just give us a "download all" button to then instantly queue everything up to begin downloading. What did we get this time then? It's still quite nice though.</p>
<p>Now in the main settings you get a global option to swap between letting Steam decide when to run updates, or only running them when you go to launch the game. If you just let Steam decide it will update your regular games shortly after they're released, and schedule others for later.</p>
<p>This can be tweaked globally and per-game too. So if there's a game that often has huge updates, you can now prevent those updates until you launch it. Or if it's a regular game you may want updates to be done right away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15238163511733998156gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15238163511733998156gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8673548121733998157gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8673548121733998157gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A fun little detail is the new section "Updates to installed games" which will give the example based on what you last set to download. In my case, the Command &amp; Conquer Remastered Collection.</p>
<p>On top of that the active download in the Steam client has an overhauled style to it. Left shot is the old one, right shot is the new one:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1762870541733998419gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1762870541733998419gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1852933061733998420gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1852933061733998420gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's nice that they've made the installing files section a bit clearer, which will help prevent some confusion when people seem to think it's not doing anything at times for bigger games, a question I've seen come up here and there.</p>
<p>The full Desktop Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545594976799556398?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets another big upgrade with more customisation and secrets in update 2.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CD PROJEKT RED put up another free big upgrade for Cyberpunk 2077, so is it time to dive back into Night City for another run? You may want to.</p>
<p>The developers mention this update was a collab with Virtuos, a studio that has worked on many AAA games across both PCs and consoles. As for what's new, it's all about extended customization and an improved Photo Mode. As they described in their email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of Update 2.2, players will access new character customization options — including new variants of cosmetic cyberware, tattoos, makeup options, and more. That’s not the only thing players can now modify — all luxury or sports cars that have partnered with Rayfield now have access to exclusive CrystalCoat technology, meaning players can swap out the colors of select rides. Changes have also been made to Photo Mode, which now boasts additional features — including improved camera modes, the ability to spawn up to three additional characters in the scene, increased camera range, and new lighting options. Players will also be able to enjoy the presence of Johnny Silverhand in the passenger seat as they drive through the city of dreams. On top of it all, Update 2.2 also brings a number of technical improvements and more secrets to Night City.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some nice additions and for those on Intel Arrow Lake based CPUs they say they've optimized the "threading system to improve performance by up to 33%".</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">You can get a full overview in their long update video:</span></p>

<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Click here to open the patch notes</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle's color scheme for a small fee. You'll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you'll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</li>

      <title>Ballionaire is annoyingly good and I want to play it all the time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ballionaire from developer newobject and publisher Raw Fury scratches all the right places in my brain, and I want more of it. <em>Note: key provided by Raw Fury.</em></p>
<p>We're certainly not short of excellent games right now are we? A time where the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/path-of-exile-2-now-in-early-access-and-it-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Path of Exile 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/marvel-rivals-out-now-free-on-steam-and-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel Rivals</a> are here, and I like them a lot, but what's been itching away at the back of my brain constantly has been Ballionaire. It's an itch that feels satisfying to scratch too. You know the kind where something is just burning, and so you have a good <em>hard</em> scratch on it and get that euphoric feeling after. That's Ballionaire — and someone is going to have to take it away from me soon or I'm going to get <em>nothing</em> done.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7899297161733933688gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7899297161733933688gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Ballionaire is a what they're calling an "autobonker", inspired by Pachinko machines originally from Japan. The idea is that you drop a ball down a vertical machine, and watch it bump into everything as it goes down. The fun part here, is that you're sticking all sorts of items onto the board to increase how much you earn from every ball you drop down. You can create some completely ridiculous combinations, and I can definitely see why Pachinko is popular. This has me hooked in something fierce.</p>
<p>It's "brain-tickling fun" the developer describes it as, and they're not wrong, I need more people to play it so they can tell me about the awesome boards they created with it to break the game and make lots of (fake) cash.</p>
<p>You <em>need</em> the cash too, because some weird Elders want a constant tribute, and you're playing the game to keep them all happy. Their demands just keep on increasing, and it's up to you to place down various items in such a way that will cause your balls to bounce about all over the place to create the most insane combinations you can.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-5KylcOuyGI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6148a33cb94fb03751645d5e7042d56a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-5KylcOuyGI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will eat at your brain more than just the excitement of dropping balls and seeing what happens though, because there's actually a lot of strategy to it. While there's an element of randomness with the physics on where the ball will drop and bounce, there's tons and tons of items to place and unlock to build up all these combinations and quite a lot to learn on how they all work together. Some of the runs I've had in it have been absolutely nuts, balls flying all over the place as I just sit back and watch the fireworks.</p>
<p>Even the meta unlock system leans into the absurdity of it all, acting like one of those toy machines children beg you for a coin to drop some random crappy little toy. It gets you to insert your card, and down will drop a ball that allows you to pick an item to unlock. Love it.</p>
<p>If that intro wasn't clear enough: go and buy it. Ballionaire is excellent. This is going to be a game that I repeatedly go back to for one more run.</p>
<p>Curiously, it does have Native Linux support, but it's not actually advertised on the Steam store page. It's also Steam Deck Verified, which was tested by Valve on the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned proper modding and Steam Workshop integration is coming soon too. Can't wait to see what the community cooks up to add into this one.</p>

      <title>Moon Watch mixes up the bullet heaven survivor genre with time-stopping and deck-building into something strategic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moon Watch is a new release now in Early Access from developer Jaspel, who also made Backpack Hero, and they're mixing genres together again into something new. <em>Note: their publisher sent over a key.</em></p>
<p>Taking inspiration from all the recent bullet heaven survivor-like games but turning it into something slower, more tactical that requires a bit of planning. This is because you control the flow of time, where the action only happens as you move. So instead of fancy finger-work on your keyboard or gamepad testing your reflexes, it's a lot more about that big beautiful brain of yours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14210529791733930756gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14210529791733930756gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You get as much time as you want to decide how to approach the waves of enemies. From where you're going to run, to what cards to put into play that form all your attacks and abilities. However, each card uses up a certain amount of power that you recharge as you move, so even though it's slower and time-stopping, it can still remain a bit frantic and challenging. I really do love the idea of this one.</p>
<p>On each level you have a certain amount of time you have to survive, that only ticks while you move too. So you're constantly thinking about just surviving.</p>
<p>After each battle you then get a Slay the Spire style little map to pick a node to travel to which could be another fight, a defence mission where you have to defend an object and other types of events to go through</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="R3Xmn6z98wk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8402de9f4ee4790634c6ba5b7eb4bd28.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/R3Xmn6z98wk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A really fun idea that I can't wait to see expand. It's already fun and has quite a bit of content, but runs often feel a bit too similar right now. The developer said they expect Early Access to keep going for 8-10 months, so they have plenty of time there to add more. Some of what they have planned to add includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Characters:</strong> More playstyles to master.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Cards &amp; Relics:</strong> Expanding your options for deckbuilding and combos.</li>
<li><strong>More Enemies:</strong> New challenges to overcome.</li>
<li><strong>More Rooms &amp; Events:</strong> Expanding the variety of encounters to keep every run fresh.</li>
<li><strong>Achievements:</strong> A way to showcase your milestones and progress.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Updates:</strong> Continued improvements to ensure smooth gameplay.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the £8.50 normal price it's good fun and well worth looking into if you like the sound of the idea. It's incredibly promising!</p>

      <title>Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog is a seriously cool visual novel love-letter to retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't play many visual novels, but I might have to break that habit again soon with Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog because it looks and feels like playing through a classic Gundam Anime story. <em>You can even try out a demo right now.</em></p>
<p>The game is directly inspired by retro anime and 80s Sci-Fi, a visual novel made in the spirit of classic PC-9800 titles and it really looks the part too. Developed by Space Colony Studios based in Wales, UK, they're a collection of independent artists, writers and developers working together to create the Stories from Sol anthology of games; a multi part, narrative focused series created to express their love of old school anime, retro sci-fi and interactive storytelling.</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>

      <title>Ruffy and the Riverside is a unique action-adventure where you have the power to copy and paste textures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is such a fun idea for a game. Ruffy and the Riverside is a colourful hand-drawn action-adventure where you've got a special power called SWAP, that lets you copy and paste textures in the game.</p>
<p>More about it: "As Ruffy, the Chosen One, you'll harness the magical power of SWAP, and use it to transform the game world. With SWAP you'll change the sun into the moon or ice into lava while overcoming countless puzzles and effortlessly manipulating objects to your will. You can turn a stone into wood to create a boat or swap a wall into rubble to clear your path, and much more as you fight, jump, and ride hay bales throughout the adventure. The unique SWAP ability opens up endless possibilities, making every moment feel magical and full of surprises."</p>

<p>Speaking over email their press team mentioned to me: "Linux Support is guaranteed indeed! (+ the dev will also try and get it Steam Deck approved as close as possible to the launch)".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Epic Games update the Unreal Tournament website linking to the free downloads from OldUnreal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/classic-unreal-tournament-and-unreal-now-easier-to-download-free-thanks-to-oldunreal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in November</a>, I reported on Epic Games giving their approval for Unreal 1 and Unreal Tournament becoming completely free to download. Now, Epic Games have updated the official Unreal Tournament website to link to the OldUnreal community.</p>
<p>Their new website is to go along with the Unreal Tournament episode of Amazon's Secret Level series, which is a new adult animated anthology series featuring original stories set within the worlds of some of the world's most beloved video games.</p>
<p>Epic likely did this since Secret Level having an episode revisiting Unreal Tournament might have caused some to think Epic themselves were going to attempt to revive it, again. Clearly though, Epic are done with it, as they continue building Fortnite into a Roblox-styled Metaverse with all sorts of games.</p>
<p>Nice to see Epic putting up a proper website to give thanks to the OldUnreal community like this though, who have been patching up Epic's classic first-person shooters for years.</p>
<p>Epic Games only previously announced Unreal 1 and Unreal Tournament as being freely available, but the page also links to the OldUnreal website for Unreal 2, but they only host the demo and patches <em>not</em> the full game. It's not clear at the moment if this will also become freely available. I've reached out to Epic Games for confirmation on that and the later Unreal Tournament games. <strong>Update 3PM UTC</strong>: Epic Games replied to mention "we have nothing more to share right now".</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Unreal Tournament website</a>.</p>

      <title>The Talos Principle: Reawakened announced that rebuilds and expands the original in Unreal Engine 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The much loved puzzle adventure The Talos Principle is being remade in Unreal Engine 5, with Croteam / Devolver Digital announcing The Talos Principle: Reawakened. <em>Seems like Croteam are finished with their own Serious Engine now. </em></p>
<p>Speaking about why they went back they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the success of The Talos Principle 2, we have some very cool projects going on, so why go back? There are many reasons, but the biggest one is simply that we love this game and while the original version is admittedly still pretty awesome, we wanted to create a definitive version that will keep the game fresh for years to come and allow a whole new audience to explore the Simulation.</p>
<p>Once again, we poured all our love and creativity into this project. We didn't just want to make a remaster with gorgeous graphics, although that's definitely part of it. But there's a lot more to this. There are quality-of-life improvements that make a real difference (seriously, the recorder puzzles are so much better now!). There's the puzzle editor. There's a whole new story to play! There are even developer commentaries.</p>
<p>Let's talk philosophy for a moment. We don't just think of games as products. These are the works that we will leave behind for future generations. The Talos Principle: Reawakened will both refresh and preserve this wonderful game that means so much to us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will include the Road to Gehenna expansion, along with a whole new chapter titled "In the Beginning". On top of that it will also come with a whole new puzzle editor for the community.</p>

      <title>Valve now sell refurbished Steam Deck OLED models</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced today that they've added the Steam Deck OLED 512GB and 1TB models into their Valve Certified Refurbished program, so you can grab one a bit cheaper. These have been made available in the US, Canada, UK, and EU.</p>
<p>Here's the prices you can expect to pay:</p>
<div class="scrolling-table">
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table-stripes-tbody">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Model</strong></td>
<td><strong>Normal Price</strong></td>
<td><strong>Refurbished</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>512GB OLED</td>
<td>£479 / $549</td>
<td>£389 / $439</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1TB OLED</td>
<td>£569 / $649</td>
<td>£459 / $519</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p class="plain-list-title">About the Certified Refurbished program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Certified Refurbished Steam Deck has been thoroughly tested to the same high standards as our retail units. Every device goes through a complete factory reset, software update, and an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve's facilities. Among the tests are all controller inputs, the audio system, the screen, and internals. Battery health is also assessed to ensure proper functionality and longevity.<br/>
<br/>
All refurbished units meet or even exceed the performance standards of new retail units. Although they may have minor cosmetic blemishes, they provide a reliable, high-quality gaming experience at a lower cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve say with each you get "same one-year warranty as a new Steam Deck (unless longer as determined by your country of residence)" along with a fully-tested power supply plus a carrying case as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps this would make for a great holiday gift for someone and you save a little monies. If you can get one that is, as with the refurbished LCD models, stock will come and go over time as Valve make them available and they generally sell out quick quickly.</p>
<p>In case you missed it: we have a<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-experimental-adds-initial-speech-synthesis-support-lots-of-game-fixes-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> big Proton Experimental update</a> out now too, making game modding easier than ever.</p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 released for arm64 works on Raspberry Pi 5 and Apple Silicon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 team have been busy as they've announced the release of RPCS3 for arm64 that includes like likes of the Raspberry Pi 5 and Apple Silicon (M1, M2 etc). Since Arm devices are becoming steadily more powerful and more readily available on the desktop, it's fun to see more like this get official builds.</p>
<p>RPCS3's crew tested their new Arm support across the Raspberry Pi 5, and Apple Silicon on both macOS and Asahi Linux (Linux for Apple Silicon Macs). On Apple Silicon, it seems to work quite well across both platforms, but due to the lower power of the RPi5 not many games work well and the resolution needs to be pulled down quite a lot. Still, this is exciting for future Arm hardware and for overall game preservation!</p>
<p>Windows has given them the most issues though due to various issues like no available devices to test on, but they managed it through a virtual machine to at least get somewhere. The main issue they said for commercial titles would that "Windows-on-ARM having a hard requirement for ASLR which doesn’t play too nicely with some aspects of RPCS3’s JIT engine". So downloads are only up for Linux and macOS right now.</p>
<p>You can see their RPi5 video below:</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator 2 the &#39;ultimate first person escape room experience&#39; announced by Pine Studio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pine Studio have announced a follow-up to their massively successful Escape Simulator, with Escape Simulator 2 that they plan to be the "ultimate first person escape room experience".</p>
<p>The first game had full Native Linux support but their plans for the sequel are not entirely clear. Initially they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1435790/eventcomments/596260472619053253/?tscn=1733509882#c596260472619054725" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">replied</a> to me to mention: "We're still looking into that. But Proton version is going to be tested for sure." and they have since updated the Steam page to note Linux support. So we'll have to wait and see exactly how you'll be running it.</p>
<p>With the sequel they're moving away from the colourful cartoon-like graphics, with a much more impressive but less inviting more realistic style. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gsl4DvPyJs4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a05ff14549378206b6698fd22e6fa19.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gsl4DvPyJs4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Boris Barbir, Co-Founder at Pine Studio said: “A sequel gives us the opportunity to start fresh and push the boundaries of the escape room genre. For Escape Simulator 2, we were inspired to explore darker themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle mechanics. This sequel also brings significant technical upgrades, including a new rendering engine, rewritten netcode, improved physics, and enhanced animations. While Escape Simulator 2 adopts a darker, more mysterious tone compared to the original, it’s not a horror game—there are no jump scares or gore. We love the Escape Simulator community and we plan to continue supporting the original game while expanding and enhancing Escape Simulator 2 after its launch.”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Puzzle-Solving mystery: </strong>Dive into the series’ most detailed environments yet and solve 12 brand-new, puzzle-filled escape rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Play Solo or Multiplayer:</strong> Tackle each challenge on your own or team up with up to 8 players for the ultimate cooperative escape room experience.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Physics &amp; Interactions:</strong> Feel like you’re walking into a real-life escape room, with every part of the room designed for interactivity.</li>
<li><strong>Room Editor 2.0: </strong>Create and share your dream escape rooms with an upgraded suite of tools including a brand-new lighting engine, building constructor, and animation editor.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Space Marine 2 adds DLSS3, FSR3 and Frame Generation - more playable on Steam Deck, needs launch option for Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 patch has landed improving many parts of the game, along with helping performance with an upgrade to NVIDIA DLSS3, AMD FSR3.1 and Frame Generation plus some improvements to their anti-cheat (Easy Anti-Cheat).</p>
<p>The version bump for DLSS2 and FSR along with adding Frame Generation should enable more systems to perform better overall. For DLSS 3 Frame Generation on Desktop Linux, you'll need the current <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-experimental-adds-initial-speech-synthesis-support-lots-of-game-fixes-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Experimental</a> or the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-90-4-beta-updated-with-more-game-fixes-needing-testing-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta of Proton 9.0-4</a> which both have support for it added. Another major change is that as of this update mods are no longer supported in public lobbies. As they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957?l=english" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">explained</a> previously, it was causing all sorts of server problems but they're still allowed in private games. Seems fair enough.</p>
<p>For Desktop Linux, if you want to actually play <em>online</em> multiplayer, you will need to pretend your PC is a Steam Deck with this launch command:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>This will initially also drop all your settings down to Low and 30FPS limit, so you'll then need to change your graphics settings. If you <em>don't</em> do the launch option on Desktop Linux you'll see an EOS error at the menu (single-player still works), and you'll be kicked from online games due to mods being detected (even with none).</p>

<p><em>Slightly annoying that we're seeing more games do this lately, but at least it's easy to work around. </em></p>
<p>With the launch option, online play appears to work without issue on Desktop Linux with Proton Experimental.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12661419051733832119gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12661419051733832119gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 on Kubuntu 24.04, online PvP</em></p>
<p>On Steam Deck directly though, the game launches without issue. And thanks to the AMD FSR update, it <em>should</em> look and perform better than before.</p>
<p>I don't have any direct comparison here for the Steam Deck though since I didn't try it previously. I've seen others play it, and it was <em>awful</em> originally. What's surprising here with Space Marine 2 update 5.0 now is that on Steam Deck with Low settings + AMD FSR Performance and Frame Generation On — it's actually a <em>lot</em> more playable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12588186241733833859gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12588186241733833859gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Since Frame Generation is usually <em>terrible</em> if the game is already struggling below 60FPS, I'm surprised that not only did it make Space Marine 2 on Steam Deck hit much higher FPS, but the frame timing remained mostly <em>okay</em> as well. I still firmly <em>don't</em> recommend it on Steam Deck though, as the visual quality is pretty poor and there's a fair amount of small text.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental adds initial speech synthesis support, lots of game fixes for Steam Deck / Linux and easier modding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proton Experimental has been updated from Valve with some new features like initial speech synthesis support, along with the usual assortment of fixes for specific games running on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Confused on what Proton is and how to use it? See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>The initial addition of speech synthesis currently requires you to manually install "<a href="http://steam://install/3086180" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Proton Voice Files</a>", something people saw pop up recently that led to some wild speculation. They've confirmed it works with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716360/Infinite_Stars__The_Visual_Novel/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Infinite Stars - The Visual Novel</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13496924271733826178gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other changes from this update include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now Playable: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924310/VIDEO_GAME/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">VIDEO GAME</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed Star Wars Outlaws not being playable on some setups.</li>
<li>Fixed Hell Let Loose crashing when joining a server after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fixed Rivals of Aether II crashing with Intel GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed fullscreen mode in The Bright Star Of Seraph-Katis.</li>
<li>Improved video playback in Max: The Curse of Brotherhood.</li>
<li>Fixed Dread X Collection 3 Bete Grise minigame.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regressions:
	<ul>
<li>Progressbar95 no longer has crackling audio when using mouse.</li>
<li>Hell Let Loose again plays audio when showing developer logos.</li>
<li>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin no longer requries constant mouse movement to progress.</li>
<li>Fixed Ghostbusters: The Video Game Remastered crashing when playing some of the HD bonus videos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed CPU topology override issues on machines with more than 32 logical cores.</li>
<li>Added support for game mods that load via custom dinput8.dll.</li>
<li>Fixed Space Engineers not registering trigger input with controllers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>All from the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</em></p>
<p>Writing about the update, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social/post/3lcxtzif7qs24" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted this</a> on Bluesky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On new Proton Experimental, most mods can now just be extracted/copied next to the game .exe, without requiring any extra steps like setting WINEDLLOVERRIDES. This change will also be in future stable Proton releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modding Windows games through Proton has long been a nuisance, so removing a barrier like this is fantastic news.</p>
<p>In case you missed it a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/proton-experimental-adds-dlss-3-frame-generation-support-plus-fixes-for-dragon-age-the-veilguard-rivals-of-aether-ii-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous Proton Experimental update</a> added support for NVIDIA Optical Flow API and DLSS 3 Frame Generation for Desktop Linux. We're getting some great stuff for gaming on Linux lately.</p>
<p>On top of that don't miss that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-90-4-beta-updated-with-more-game-fixes-needing-testing-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4 is currently in testing</a> as the next stable version of Proton that most games will be expected to use.</p>

      <title>Arch Linux Package Management (ALPM) gets funding from Sovereign Tech Agency</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like Arch Linux is going from strength to strength lately. Not only have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/more-info-on-the-valve-steam-collab-with-arch-linux-and-potential-future-hardware-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve begun funding parts of the Linux distribution</a> but now the <a href="https://www.sovereign.tech/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sovereign Tech Agency</a> are as well.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://lists.archlinux.org/archives/list/arch-dev-public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/MZLH43574GGP7QQ7RKAAIRFT5LJPCEB4/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the Arch Linux development mailing list developer David Runge shared the news that Sovereign Tech Agency provided funding for developers Arne Christian Beer, Heiko Schäfer, Orhun Parmaksız and David Runge to work on ALPM part time over 15 months. Work started back in October, with it expected to continue through until the end of 2025.</p>
<p>The announcement mentions the funding supports multiple milestones for the project, which I've noted below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Formal specifications for packaging data formats</strong></p>
<p>The Arch Linux packaging ecosystem uses underspecified/undocumented file and metadata types, yet we need to be able to use them reliably in other contexts such as package creation, build and package repository management tooling.</p>
<p>Therefore this milestone involves developing versioned specifications for all low-level descriptor file and implementing Rust libraries based on them. These will be based on the existing ad-hoc reference implementations in<br/>
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">makepkg</a> and pacman.</p>
<p><strong>Basic OpenPGP verification of artifacts</strong></p>
<p>Signature verification in Arch Linux package management currently hinges on a stateful GnuPG keyring. This solution is brittle and has already caused various issues related to the Arch Linux keyring in the past.</p>
<p>To simplify signature verification - while at the same time enabling the use of a more diverse set of cryptographic technologies - a specification for the <a href="https://uapi-group.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">UAPI group</a> will be written. An accompanying Rust library will be provided as a simple and stateless integration, not limited to use in Arch Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Rust library for handling of individual packages</strong></p>
<p>The structure of Arch Linux package files is currently not explicitly defined. This milestone focuses on providing a formal specification of what an ALPM-based package contains, how it is created and handled. A dedicated Rust library and tool will facilitate package creation, validation and installation.</p>
<p>These new Rust libraries will also expose a C API for possible integration into the C-based libalpm library.</p>
<p><strong>Rust library for system package management</strong></p>
<p>This milestone revolves around the use of the previously implemented components by providing a library for package download, validation, verification, installation and state handling similar to pacman's libalpm and will handle sets of individual packages on user systems.</p>
<p>A C-API will be provided for compatibility with libalpm-based applications.</p>
<p>One specific concern of this milestone is modernizing the OpenPGP integration.</p>
<p>Current package management tooling does not allow for scoping signature verifiers (e.g. OpenPGP certificates) for a specific purpose, such as "only packages" or "only repository metadata".</p>
<p>The new system will rely on a stateless approach such as the one to be proposed as specification to the UAPI group.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution-agnostic OpenPGP stack for the verification of distribution artifacts</strong></p>
<p>This milestone will focus on a set of foundational libraries, based on a UAPI specification from a previous milestone.<br/>
These libraries will add support for PGPKI (aka the “Web of Trust”) in the generic directory structure for OpenPGP certificates used for the verification of distribution artifacts.</p>
<p>The libraries mentioned above will be integrated into the ALPM context to allow for example the full verification of packages and repository metadata.</p>
<p>A Rust-based solution will be provided as a modern alternative to the current<br/>
GnuPG-based approach.</p>
<p><strong>The outcome(s)</strong></p>
<p>The ALPM project strives to build a modern, sustainable, maintainable and memory-safe framework for the Arch Linux packaging ecosystem. This framework will enable robust and predictable integration for all package<br/>
related tooling and libraries.</p>
<p>The project goals are intentionally ambitious while being constrained to a relatively short period of time.</p>
<p>The work is organized so that real world benefits will happen early and often. Several infrastructure related projects have already reached out with a concrete interest to make use of libraries created in the first phase of the project.</p>
<p>The work will be done in the open, on the <a href="https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/alpm/alpm" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Arch Linux GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone and anyone is welcome to join in and help out!</p>

      <title>Funko issue a statement about the itch.io take-down, while also apparently calling itch founder&#39;s mom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/itchio-store-was-taken-down-by-funko-due-to-trash-ai-powered-phishing-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I wrote about</a> how the much loved itch.io store got taken down by Funko (as in Funko Pop figures). The situation seems thankfully sorted with itch back up, but things got a little weird.</p>
<p>Writing on X / Twitter, the itch.io official account <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866239798924763227" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> to mention Funko called their mother:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4666813661733823447gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That's pretty crazy behaviour, if really true. Especially, when you see the below.</p>
<p>While the official Funko account an hour later on that same day <a href="https://x.com/OriginalFunko/status/1866255848366039468" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> up a statement: </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8361038231733823603gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Funko, we hold a deep respect and appreciation for indie games, indie gamers, and indie developers. We’re fans of fans, and we love the creativity and passion that define the indie gaming community.</p>
<p>Recently, one of our brand protection partners identified a page on http://itch.io imitating the Funko Fusion development website. A takedown request was issued to address this specific page. Funko did not request a takedown of the @itchio platform, and we’re happy the site was back up by this morning.</p>
<p>We have reached out to @itchio to engage with them on this issue and we deeply appreciate the understanding of the gaming community as the details are determined. Thank you for sharing in our passion for creativity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's two issues with the statement. The first, is that there's not even a simply basic apology included there. The second, is that it <em>wasn't</em> just a simple take-down request. As itch founder Leaf "leafo" Corcoran posted on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm the one running itch.io, so here's some more context for you:<br/>
From what I can tell, some person made a fan page for an existing Funko Pop video game (Funko Fusion), with links to the official site and screenshots of the game. The BrandShield software is probably instructed to eradicate all "unauthorized" use of their trademark, so they sent reports independently to our host and registrar claiming there was "fraud and phishing" going on, likely to cause escalation instead of doing the expected DMCA/cease-and-desist. Because of this, I honestly think they're the malicious actor in all of this. Their website, if you care: https://www.brandshield.com/</p>
<p>About 5 or 6 days ago, I received these reports on our host (Linode) and from our registrar (iwantmyname). I expressed my disappointment in my responses to both of them but told them I had removed the page and disabled the account. Linode confirmed and closed the case. iwantmyname never responded. This evening, I got a downtime alert, and while debugging, I noticed that the domain status had been set to "serverHold" on iwantmyname's domain panel. We have no other abuse reports from iwantmyname other than this one. I'm assuming no one on their end "closed" the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days.</p>
<p>I've been trying to get in touch with them via their abuse and support emails, but no response likely due to the time of day, so I decided to "escalate" the issue myself on social media.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What an absolutely insane situation.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 31 released with first-party YouTube Chat features, new NVIDIA filters and Linux improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio has a brand new stable release available! The awesome free and open source video capture tool OBS Studio <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/31.0.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">31.0.0</a> is out now. <em>This release went live on December 7th.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the release notes the main new features are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added NVIDIA Blur Filter and Background Blur.</li>
<li>Added preview scrollbars and zoom/scale indicator.</li>
<li>Added v210 format support for AJA device capture.</li>
<li>Added Amazon IVS service integration.</li>
<li>Added QSV AV1 Screen Content Coding.</li>
<li>Enabled first-party YouTube Chat features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18667317511733749234gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's various other improvements and fixes, including some tweak for the Linux client like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed display and window capture on Linux to not capture implicitly.</li>
<li>Improved screensaver inhibit functions on Linux in Flatpak</li>
<li>Disabled the (currently unsupported) built-in Automatic Scene Switcher when using Wayland on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed two crashes with the QSV encoder on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Linux when importing a scene collection created on Windows.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/pull/11232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> to display / window capture is a nice one, that will stop it automatically capturing a window without you directly telling it to, something that has been a problem for a long time.</p>
<p>At time of writing that <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.obsproject.Studio" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a> package has not yet been updated. Hopefully soon since it's been a few days since the release.</p>

      <title>EA pledge another 23 accessibility patents for public royalty-free use</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA did another actually genuinely great thing here. They've expanded their previous patent pledge for game developers to use without problems.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/ea-open-source-fonttik-helps-devs-check-text-size-a-contrast-m-plus-patent-pledges/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original pledge</a> a few years ago included the open source Fonttik tool along with six accessibility patents for public use, which they then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/ea-opens-up-more-patents-for-increasing-accessibility-in-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expanded in 2023</a> to include more patents for developers to use. This has expanded once again to include another 23 patents focused on accessibility that developers are free to use.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/2024-accessibility-patent-pledge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These newly pledged patents cover technologies to improve speech recognition, generate more personalized speech and simplify the use of speech recognition technologies in computing and gaming devices.  </p>
<p>Among other things, these patented accessibility technologies could be used to improve the gameplay experience of players who have speech disability or who prefer or need assistance with verbally expressing themselves. They could make it possible for those players’ speech to be more effectively recognized and reflected in-game in a way that is representative of their age, emotion, language and speaking style. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that they've also open sourced their <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS-Unreal-Plugin/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IRIS plugin</a> for Unreal Engine, which allows in-engine use of EA's photosensitivity analysis tech, <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/iris" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IRIS</a>, which was previously open sourced.</p>
<p>What does it actually mean? EA allow the use of all the listed patents royalty-free, so they will not go after any game developer that chooses to implement features the patents describe.</p>
<p>It's good to see patents be used in this way. Many companies use patents to go after other companies, so it's quite refreshing to see a publisher as big as EA stock them up to not just protect themselves, but for others too.</p>

      <title>Steam sets a new record with 39 million concurrent users online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the weekend the Steam store from Valve managed to smash another record, something it has done repeatedly this year and it shows no sign of slowing down.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the new concurrent user record of people online is 39,205,447 as of Sunday, December 8th at 2PM UTC. At the time 12,090,313 people were actually in-game as well.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Based on peak player counts, over the last 24 hours the top games were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>Path of Exile 2</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
</ol>
<p>No surprise really to see Steam hitting a record with both Path of Exile 2 and Marvel Rivals releasing over the last week. Both of them have been absolute monster releases with their peak player counts together hitting over a million.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some history for you of recent milestones of people online:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-breaks-38-million-concurrent-users-for-the-first-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">September 2024 - 38 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-sets-a-new-record-with-372-million-concurrent-users-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August 2024 - 37 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-breaking-records-again-hitting-over-36-million-players-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 36 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-broke-another-record-with-over-35-million-people-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 35 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-smashes-its-peak-players-online-record-to-over-34-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2024 - 34 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-breaks-more-records-with-33-million-online-and-over-10-million-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">January 2023 - 33 million</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can clearly see 2024 has been an absolute knock-out year for Valve. Steam was already a money-printing machine, and it seems now even more so.</p>

      <title>Minimalist mini-game filled survival city-builder Dawnfolk gets a release date and new demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dawnfolk from developer Darenn Keller is absolutely lovely, a minimalist survival city-builder with each tile having a little mini-game. Really unique and one you need to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The developer recently revealed it's going to launch on February 13th, which will have full Native Linux support, and there's even a brand new expanded demo you can try too.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Dawnfolk, you will explore an uncharted medieval fantasy world, manage resources, build cities, and survive against many dangers. Minigames add a unique challenge to supporting your people. The better you are at the minigames, the more resources you get and the more likely your community will weather the darkness. Every choice matters as you explore different strategies and play styles in Dawnfolk."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>itch.io store was taken down by Funko due to &#34;trash AI Powered&#34; phishing report</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This was an interesting one to come back to today. Game store <a href="https://itch.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> was taken offline recently, due to a "bogus Phishing report to our registrar".</p>
<p>For people who don't understand how websites work, there was no issue with their data on their actual hosting server, the problem was with the web address. Their domain registrar disabled their domain name itch.io directly, due to what itch said was a "bogus Phishing report".</p>
<p>Speaking in a social media post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itch.io/post/3lcu6h465bs2n" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the official itch account said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I kid you not, @itch.io has been taken down by Funko of "Funko Pop" because they use some trash "AI Powered" Brand Protection Software called Brand Shield that created some bogus Phishing report to our registrar, iwantmyname, who ignored our response and just disabled the domain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a follow up <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866022784222245305" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X / Twitter (they didn't post this to Bluesky), the itch account mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, for transparency, we *did* take the disputed page down as soon as we got the notice because it's not worth fighting stuff like that. Regardless, our registrar's automated system likely kicked to disable the domain since no one read our confirmation of removal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>It seems to be back up now.</em></p>
<p>What this does is highlight how anything like this should be manually reviewed first. Automated systems should not be able to take down such a high-profile and long-running website like itch. There's a lot of problems with how this was handled by both Funko / Brand Shield and iwantmyname.</p>
<p>It's an ongoing long-running problem across the whole web. Things can be taken down so easily without confirmation anywhere. The whole take-down system is just full of flaws and gets abused all the time, just look at YouTube, people have complained about it there forever.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 now in Early Access and it works on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Path of Exile 2 from Grinding Gear Games has officially arrived, although it's not quite finished yet as it's in Early Access. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The developer didn't reply to my request, so I've only just briefly jumped in today to check and see if it actually runs on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. The good news there — is that it does! The game does launch right out of the box with the <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest stable Proton 9.0-3</a>.</p>
<p>Grinding Gear said they expect it to remain in Early Access for "as long as needed" which they expect will be "at least 6 months". Even though it's not done, it's still absolutely huge. There's somewhere around 400 different types of monsters, about 50 bosses and a whole lot of end-game content to play through. This game will keep you going for a long time, just as the first game did.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VZsq_vJjGk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aed43cd7b1d2cb5ac150ca9cd9384157.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VZsq_vJjGk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<p>Testing on a Steam Deck LCD 512GB, with the game on the SSD and the game loaded up fine! Gamepad input detected as soon as I moved a thumbstick and so away we go. The game is definitely playable on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Performance has been a bit…<strong>strange</strong>. On the lowest settings I've seen times where the same area will barely hold 30-40FPS, and other times it will give me a <em>drastically</em> smoother 50-60FPS. It's been thoroughly confusing that's for sure, and I've had to re-write this section a few times after doing repeated testing when fully reloading the game. So, your mileage here may vary, it <em>might</em> perform well for you, it <em>might</em> not. Entirely possible it's some server instancing issue messing with the performance at times.</p>
<p>Pictures below on Low settings, AMD FSR Performance, 60FPS limit, Dynamic Resolution On:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11400292831733528660gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11400292831733528660gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5120963571733529376gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5120963571733529376gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>You won't get much more than 1hr 30mins on the LCD Steam Deck battery.</em></p>
<p>One big problem though is that lots of the text is small. There's some UI scaling, but seemingly no text scaling, so I still had to pull the deck up close to my face to read some parts. Especially annoying for a game like this, where you'll be reading over items and skills quite often. Higher levels of UI scaling can also cause some parts of the UI to go off the Steam Deck screen cutting it off.</p>
<p>Pictures below on Low settings, AMD FSR Performance, 30FPS Limit, Dynamic Resolution On:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/46868441733524805gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/46868441733524805gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18218564251733525035gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18218564251733525035gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>That was one heck of a boss fight…</em></p>
<p>There's also some clear bugs, with it being in Early Access and all, like my first crash to my Steam Library when entering a portal the game just threw this up at me:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7044950191733525449gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7044950191733525449gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Overall: definitely playable! I just hope the <em>weird</em> performance issue is figured out.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux</strong></p>
<p>Considering it ran on the Steam Deck, I wasn't expecting any trouble on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) with an AMD GPU and as expected, no real issues there.</p>
<p>However, for <u>NVIDIA</u> users, you may see a black screen. One fix there is to force the game into DirectX12 mode, which it seems you need to do directly in a configuration file. This file can be found somewhere like this depending on where you have it installed:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/2694490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2/poe2_production_Config.ini</code></p>
<p>Inside there set "renderer_type=DirectX12" on Line 7 (it will be Vulkan by default). Then you should be good to go.</p>
<p>Another <em>potential</em> fix I've been told that works with NVIDIA is to run the game with <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>.</p>
<p>On mostly High settings with my Ryzen 5800x, Radeon 6800 XT:</p>

<p><strong>Initial Launch Issues</strong></p>
<p>The actual launch was just a <em>bit</em> rocky, with the login not working as the developer had to do some truly last-minute <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865098048571113779" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">upgrades</a> on their database system. So over 400,000 people we're playing a loading screen simulator. I'm not exactly complaining though. Launching games is <em>hard</em>, especially online connected games such as this when a ridiculous amount of people are trying to jump in all at the same time. The community even <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1865128830907605273" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">took down</a> SteamDB as people were hammering it trying to see what was happening.</p>
<p>Still, when the servers went up, seeing then 19,658 people ahead of me in a queue was quite <em>frustrating </em>to say the least. A queue that seemed like it wasn't actually going anywhere. Got there eventually though, <em>only</em> another 5 minutes staring at the red number of people ticking down until it was my turn. At last! At least, that's what I <em>thought</em>, I had a brief 30 seconds of bliss with a cut-scene and the game booted me back to the login screen. A "configuration problem" the developer <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865134494321455276" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> this time.</p>
<p>40 or so minutes later, and I'm back into a queue. Just a few ahead of me, <em>only</em> 17,430 people and so another 4 minutes sat watching it tick down again. Got there eventually…for 5 minutes, then the London Realm and others <a href="https://vxtwitter.com/pathofexile/status/1865145572875018750" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">went down</a> and I was kicked out again. At this point, you get the idea, the launch has <em>not</em> been the best. Clearly, the <em>login screen</em> is the hardest boss of them all.</p>
<p>Anyway. Wonderful to see <em>another</em> huge game launch working on Linux platforms at release just like with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/marvel-rivals-out-now-free-on-steam-and-works-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p>

      <title>Pizza-delivery bullet heaven Pest Apocalypse is hilarious chaos - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pest Apocalypse from Kikimora Games is out now, a fresh Bullet Heaven blending together the worlds of Vampire Survivors with something like Crazy Taxi and it's thoroughly chaotic. I've made this joke before, and I'll do it again, this is VANpire Survivors.<em> Look it's a good joke okay.</em></p>
<p>What you get here is a quality mixture of mechanics. The repeated runs of building up a crazy combination of weapons and abilities popularized by Vampire Survivors, but with the spin on it that you're in a fast-moving vehicle equipped with a nitro boost. Each pizza you deliver enables you to pick a new passenger with their own weapon, and you really can make a pretty wild ride.</p>
<p>The developer sent over a release key and I've been having a real blast with it, sending my little van speeding across the map to collect and deliver one pizza after another, while also being chased by hordes of creatures.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sq14-U58btM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1df396ee8f245302b099ac05ba9455e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sq14-U58btM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only do you get to pick various passengers (weapons) after you do a successful delivery, but there's also a weapon upgrade system too. As you wheel-spin and drift your way around the map squishing all sorts of creatures, you can collect blue upgrade orbs they drop to level up, and depending on how many you have when you deliver the pizza, you'll then be able to further enhance your weapons.</p>
<p>Aside from that there's a meta upgrade system too. As you progress through a run you'll earn tips for doing a good job, which you can then use in the main menu to do meta upgrades like passenger damage output, attack cooldown, max vehicle health and more.</p>
<p>I also really love the silly cinematic camera that appears when you launch your vehicle over ramps. A fun little touch. It's a game that only gets funnier the more you play it. Across the maps you can find temporary pickups too like a big ball with spikes attached by a chain to your van. The physics in Pest Apocalypse can be a little funky, but that only adds to the comedic charm here I think.</p>
<p>Very similar in style to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/earl-vs-the-mutants-is-choatic-survivor-like-fun-with-vehicles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earl vs. the Mutants</a> that I looked at previously, but here you have a specific purpose pushing you on to keep going, and in terms of style, overall feel and content - Pest Apocalypse is a bigger and better game (with a higher price to match). Pest Apocalypse also has Native Linux support, built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Pest Apocalypse is surprisingly challenging too, a lot more so than I would say other Bullet Heaven games are. Partly due to the vehicle speed and your turning circle, making dodging enemies all that more challenging. But also the vehicle health, it doesn't actually take much to get destroyed if you're not careful. All that only adds to the intense feeling of needing <em>just one more drive</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910352511733501491gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20910352511733501491gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Another nice feature is that you have a tip level. I mentioned earlier that you gain tips for all the deliveries, but this adds up to its own special counter as well and each time it levels up after run you then get to pick a special unlock as well. This could be new drops from enemies that will appear during a run, new passengers (weapons), items and more.</p>
<p>No problems at all on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.10) with the Linux version. Pest Apocalypse is also pretty much a perfect Steam Deck game. Performance is good and the runs are reasonably short too.</p>
<p>A very firm recommendation. Now I need van to come and deliver me some pizza. For now I'll settle for another run to see what ridiculous weapon combo I can make. Go get it, great fun.</p>

      <title>MMO interplanetary crafting adventure SpaceCraft from Shiro Games (Northgard, Wartales) announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shiro Games developer of Northgard, Wartales and Dune: Spice Wars have announced SpaceCraft, and my space-nerd brain is now very excited. It's a "massively multiplayer interplanetary crafting adventure" according to the press email, whatever that actually means.</p>
<p>Looks like it will have a big mixture of gameplay with free open-world exploration across the stars, along with you being able to explore planets directly on the ground as well. On the planets you can mine for resources, do some crafting, build a base and there's even automation systems as well. The actual spaceships look modular with you building them up from various components, and the economy will be player-driven as well. </p>
<p>Overall it seems like a bit of a blend of Eve Online, Satisfactory and Avorion. Which could be awesome, although likely a huge timesink. Have a looksie at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bdd0avB3t-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/875b5d7dc81828ab3e5d50db018f52a2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bdd0avB3t-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We wanted to give players a spectacular open-ended world to explore, where their decisions have an impact and they have full freedom to choose their own destiny,” said Nicolas Cannasse, CEO of Shiro Games. “Build complex starships and bases, conduct trade deals in a real-time economy, and form alliances and rivalries at your discretion. From the time you start the game, SpaceCraft is your story to tell.”</p>
<p>Hopefully it will work well on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> with no <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> annoyances. Right to the top of my wishlist it goes.</p>

      <title>The Thing: Remastered from Nightdive Studios is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bit of a surprise! Nightdive Studios launched The Thing: Remastered, an upgrade of the cult-classic survival horror game. It launches with a Steam Deck Verified status, so you'll be all good on Desktop Linux too with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "In the frozen arctic tundra, a mysterious shape-shifting alien has wiped out the crew of the U.S. Outpost #31 research facility. In The Thing: Remastered, players step into the boots of Captain J.F.
