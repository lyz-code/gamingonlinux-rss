      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 patch 1.7 is out now with a mod manager, modding toolkit and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Larian Studios still aren't yet finished with Baldur's Gate 3 seeing a huge new update out now, with a few more patches still to come. The developer said that more patches to come will add "both crossplay and photo mode, alongside other fixes and updates" which sounds exciting to bring platforms together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This massive update to the game though adds in plenty for evil players with 13 new cinematics that offer varying conclusions to your most evil playthroughs. The biggest addition is their in-game Mod Manager and a new modding toolkit to download on Steam. So it has official modding support now, making it a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>Larian said that mods made via their own toolkit can be uploaded to the game, so people can browse and install them directly in the game itself. On top of that the game now officially supports " some scripted mods using Osiris, our in-house scripting language". So mod creators can reload their own scripts, handle build errors, and also carry out basic debugging.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12018747831725558545gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12018747831725558545gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - the in-game Mod Manager</em></p>
<p>They also revamped split-screen to have both sides dynamically merge together when characters are close, and split dynamically when you move apart along with various other improvements to split-screen.</p>
<p>Lots more has changed, including thankfully some performance improvements. The developer said there's been plenty of "performance and stability optimisations across the game" and in particular optimised performance for areas with lots of NPCs like Lower City.</p>
<p>And of course lots and lots more in <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-7-now-live_121" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Seems like it might finally be time for me to actually go and complete it properly. Or maybe start again, because I've completely forgotten what I was doing. There's too many good games to play.</p>
<p><em>Baldur's Gate 3 is rated Steam Deck Verified and Gold on ProtonDB.</em></p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-13 released bringing in a fix for World of Warcraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Only a few days after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/ge-proton-9-12-released-with-fixes-for-star-citizen-bully-scholarship-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-12 was released</a>, GE-Proton 9-13 is out now with a fix for World of Warcraft along with upstream code updates.</p>
<p>As your reminder: it's a community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-13" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-13</a> release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hotfix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton to latest git to include World of Warcraft MSAA fix</li>
</ul>
<p>proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>proton upstream fixes added</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional:</p>
<ul>
<li>protonfixes updated to latest git</li>
</ul>

<p>You can install GE-Proton with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/protonup-qt-v2102-adds-support-for-the-winezgui-launcher-and-old-compatibility-tools/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>.</p>
<p>For those of you reading who regularly play WoW on Linux with Wine / Proton, how's the experience nowadays? It's been a very long time since I tried, but I remember even years before Proton is mostly ran quite well.</p>

      <title>Black &amp; White (2001) open source game engine sees a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black &amp; White from Lionhead Studios released originally back in 2001 went on to great reviews, and won various awards. Sadly, it's one game that has also been lost to time but the openblack project plans to revive it with open source.</p>
<p>I originally covered this project way <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/09/openblack-is-a-foss-game-engine-for-black-white-currently-under-development/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2019</a>, and it seems it's come a long way since then, although still heavily under development. Yesterday, September 4th, the openblack project had a first actual release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15735906891725572224gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features implemented:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Camera movement system which matches Black &amp; White.</li>
<li>Landscape with higher resolution thanks to intermediate rendering of the landscape texture.</li>
<li>Model rendering and animation.</li>
<li>Morphable mesh rendering.</li>
<li>Audio support.</li>
<li>Dynamic sky controls.</li>
<li>Pathfinding for villagers.</li>
<li>Physics using bullet physics.</li>
<li>Early AI state machine.</li>
<li>The LHVM virtual machine is integrated and reverse engineered.</li>
<li>Runs on modern Windows, MacOS and Linux.</li>
<li>Experimental Android, iOS, web assembly support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some known issues like some colours being off and no launcher or global configuration options, so you need to launch it with command line arguments to find the assets. All of this of course will be improved as the project matures.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/openblack/openblack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You need a copy of the original game to run it which sadly is not easily available since Lionhead Studios no longer exist and the publisher Electronic Arts hasn't put it up anywhere.</p>

      <title>Try the refreshed demo of Pest Apocalypse a pizza-delivery survivor-like bullet heaven</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pest Apocalypse continues looking great. One I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/try-the-demo-for-pest-apocalypse-a-horde-survival-game-where-you-deliver-pizza-in-a-van/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highlighted before</a> and doing so again now due to a brand new demo, bringing vehicular action to the survivor-like bullet hell genre. <em>The update comes as part of the Games from Croatia event on Steam.</em></p>
<p>Similar in basic theme to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/earl-vs-the-mutants-is-choatic-survivor-like-fun-with-vehicles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earl vs. the Mutants </a>that I also recently covered, except this has you deliver pizza in the apocalypse and it's total chaos. Plus it has Native Linux support made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a>. The demo update includes "a massive amount of early game changes, a whole new map to help you learn the basics of the game, additional gameplay settings to help tweak your experience, and a whole truckload of graphical updates to improve your pixel-to-eyeball experience".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6762107751725543026gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6762107751725543026gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>SHORT BURSTS OF FUN</strong>: Quick runs that take ~12 minutes to complete!</li>
<li><strong>PIZZA DELIVERY SURVIVAL</strong>: There is more to this than just surviving, you have a job to do!</li>
<li><strong>VEHICULAR PLAYGROUND</strong>: Physics-based simulation for the best driving feel and fun!</li>
<li><strong>CUSTOMIZATION</strong>: Try various combinations of vehicles, survivors and modifications! Adapt and experiment to find what works best for the situation at hand!</li>
<li><strong>PEST CONTROL</strong>: Feel powerful as you slaughter an endless horde of disgusting pests!</li>
<li><strong>PROGRESSION</strong>: Use your in-game earnings to unlock new vehicles, weapons and more!</li>
<li><strong>2D + 3D</strong>: The charm of pixelated 2D sprites in a low poly 3D environment!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you're going to really like this one. It has the crazy upgrades and level-up system made popular by Vampire Survivors, really properly tuning it for vehicle-focused action while giving you a constant quest to pick up and deliver pizza that makes it feel like nothing else. Great fun.</p>

      <title>Get lost in a huge castle in the 2.5D metroidvania &#39;The Throne&#39; on September 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming with Native Linux support on September 30th is The Throne, a 2.5D styled metroidvania from BeByte. The developer already sent over a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>, so I'll be taking a look shortly and will have more to say closer to release.</p>
<p>More about it: "The Throne is a medieval adventure in the purest metroidvania style, with 2.5D pixel art aesthetics, in which you will have to liberate the kingdom taken by the terrible orc leader Bodrak. Follow the hero Eder through the labyrinthine castle and thrilling landscapes in search of the key to the throne room. Will you be able to save the kingdom?"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DY-LHmLKGZg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96fceb6d824aa7095f490c28ccffaf6f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DY-LHmLKGZg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Navigate through intricate paths and dangerous traps set by orcs throughout all the game's areas. Test your skill and control to overcome all the obstacles that stand in your way. Each area is unique, and you will need to adapt your playstyle to each one.</li>
<li>Obtain powerful equipment from enemies. Farm repeatedly to acquire stronger weapons that will give you the power to defeat increasingly larger and more fearsome foes.</li>
<li>Recover Eder's magical equipment that will allow him to face the most terrible threats. The path becomes increasingly intricate, and your new abilities will open up routes you never imagined, revealing entirely new areas filled with content.</li>
<li>The castle is ancient and intricate, filled with labyrinthine passageways and dark dungeons that will give you the opportunity to explore and get to know every corner of each area in detail. Light your torch and arm yourself with courage.</li>
<li>Free the prisoners of the castle who will be hidden throughout the environment to obtain valuable rewards.</li>
<li>Calm reigned in the castle, devoid of its army to support an upcoming naval battle when Gabón, the legendary commander of the royal guard, betrays his own to let in the powerful and evil Bodrak. Together with his army of orcs, he manages to take the castle. Now it is only up to Eder to restore peace.</li>

      <title>Paradox are bundling four DLCs into Europa Universalis IV free for all players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This sounds like a nice move by Paradox to improve Europa Universalis IV. In October, four DLC packs will be bundled free with the game for all players.</p>
<p>You can't really go anywhere that a Paradox game is mentioned, without someone mentioning the often overwhelming number of DLC. So it's nice to see a move like this. Europa Universalis IV for example on Steam has 37 DLC, although a few are free.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236850/view/4599951478208420913" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> Paradox mentioned "Rights of Man", "Art of War", “Digital Extreme Upgrade” and "Common Sense" will be free of charge as of October 17. Everyone who already purchased the game will get them free of charge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13567742291725534730gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13567742291725534730gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - screenshot from Europa Universalis IV: Art of War</em></p>
<p>As for why they're doing this? They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Europa Universalis IV has been with us for over a decade now (time flies!) - and during this time we continuously supported it with hundreds of free updates and dozens of DLCs. Over the years, it has become apparent that "Rights of Man", "Art of War", “Digital Extreme Upgrade” and "Common Sense" are the go-to choice for new players, while most veterans consider these DLCs to be an integral part of EUIV experience. It’s about time for us to recognize that officially - and make sure that both newcomers and experienced leaders can enjoy Europa Universalis IV equally from the get go. And is there a better way to do that than giving out these DLCs for free?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, one issue is that they will end up breaking saves for your current campaigns if you didn't already own them. Which is why they're giving the notice period on this, allowing people to finish up their current games.</p>
<p>The DLC together will add quite a lot of content and gameplay features into the game, so this really is an unexpected and extremely welcome move for the future of the game. Fantastic.</p>

      <title>Historic multiplayer shooter Holdfast: Nations At War gets Steam Deck Verified after updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set during the Napoleonic Era and WW1, Holdfast: Nations At War blends together both a third and first-person shooter. And, after a bunch of upgrades, it's now Steam Deck Verified too. This means it will also run great on desktop Linux, thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p><em>The main game is set during the Napoleonic Wars, with a free total-conversion DLC set during WW1 that released two years after.</em></p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/589290/announcements/detail/4584188879496362998" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam at the end of August the developers noted how it became Steam Deck Verified. Here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As part of our efforts to bring Holdfast into the new age, a portion of the team has been hard at work not only making Holdfast accessible for those who prefer to play with a controller but also gaining the verification and official support for the Steam Deck console.</p>
<p>Development with the Steam Deck was pleasantly straightforward and a lot of the game worked with little to no intervention. With a few touch ups and thanks to the Steam Deck's powerful hardware and brilliant design, it happily runs Holdfast and it's shenanigans with great graphical fidelity and at an impressive frame rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going over previous updates they worked on full controller support, general input improvements, UI scaling and other smaller fixes to get it working nicely.</p>

      <title>Exographer is a metroidvania inspired by real science - will be fully Steam Deck playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developers SciFunGames have posted an update about their upcoming metroidvania Exographer, noting how well it runs on the Steam Deck. <em>They have no official rating from Valve yet but that's not stopping them.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2834320/announcements/detail/4611210477274034301" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they noted that it's "fully compatible with the Steam device" with "all the original game's features, controls, text and resolution adapted" and it's fully optimized for the Steam Deck and once verification is done they expect it to be 100% Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>So what's all this science stuff about? The developer explained how it was "imagined by science-fiction author and physicist Raphaël Granier De Cassagnac" with the puzzle solving based on the discovery of elementary particles. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d5pBIbHo0j0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6c24e74461d01d6fccb156c9e1e568a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d5pBIbHo0j0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A 2D metroidvania adventure based on exploration, puzzles and platforming.</li>
<li>Science based powers, narrative and puzzles.</li>
<li>Discover traces of an ancient civilization on an alien planetoid.</li>
<li>Overcome obstacles using and combining 4 powers: Gluon Boots, Photon Sphere, Wedic Waves and Zediacal Boxes.</li>
<li>6 different atmospheres, 20 levels, 9 scientists and 139 hidden pictures to reveal. Find 17 pixules (corresponding to real elementary particles).</li>
<li>15 hours of gameplay</li>
<li>Soundtrack composed by Yann Van Der Cruyssen (Stray, Cave Story).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it will work great on Steam Deck that's again good news for desktop Linux players since it will work via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Looks like a good one to pop onto your wishlist.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2834320/Exographer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> with a release due September 26th.</p>

      <title>Popular ARPG &#39;Last Epoch&#39; to get Steam Deck Verified with a big update on September 19</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last Epoch from Eleventh Hour Games is set for a big v1.1 update with The Imperial Uprising event arriving on September 19th. This will also bump it up to Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>While it does have a Native Linux version, the current Playable rating for Steam Deck was done with Proton. Valve noted it has some controller issues, along with some in-game text being too small.</p>
<p>In an update posted August 30th the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/899770/view/4614588176979677054" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fans of the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and other handheld devices rejoice! As we continue to improve the overall experience for controller play, it naturally comes about that support for handheld devices is right around the corner. We are excited to announce that on September 19th, Last Epoch will be Steam Deck Verified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, a smaller update landed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/899770/view/4590944913258535989" rel="noopener" target="_blank">today</a> that already brings in some controller improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Turning is now allowed while casting skills, even if you cannot move, by pointing the left stick to the direction you want to turn.</li>
<li>When using a controller the Radial Menu now opens when pressing the assigned button once, instead of holding the button. It can be closed by pressing the button again.</li>
<li>Fixed Sanctuary of Eterra UI Panel not working with controllers.</li>
<li>Opening the Inventory on controller now highlights the last active location.</li>
<li>Added fixes for navigating the factions UI while using a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed collision issues when navigating the Shattered Road.</li>
<li>Improved map panning with controller. Map will now pan slower when zoomed in and faster when zoomed out. No change at default zoom level.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The 1.1 update comes along with The Imperial Uprising event which runs through until October 20th, which is the "first Cycle Event" which brings a Cycle Refresh and puts previous characters into a Legacy Cycle along with a Ladder reset, a bazaar reset and a fresh economy will start which many players have requested due to various issues from the launch of the game. At the same time there will be a 20% discount on all editions of the game.</p>
<p>Some of what's to come in the 1.1 update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Steam Deck Verification &amp; Improvements.<br/>
- New and Updated Shrines.<br/>
- Quality of Life Improvements to Dungeons.<br/>
- Loot Lizard Encounters.<br/>
- Stash Tab Priority System.<br/>
- Improvements to Bazaar Search.<br/>
- Month-Long Event Modifiers.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky adds fishing, a fishing skiff, a new expedition, deep-sea diving and loads more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Can someone tell Hello Games it's all good now, everyone is over the poor launch? Actually don't, I want to see just how far they will keep pushing No Man's Sky. The latest update is a goodie too.</p>
<p>The just launched Aquarius Update is the perfect addition after the big water overhaul in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-is-out-now-and-drastically-transforms-the-planets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Worlds Part I</a> bringing with it a whole lot of little bits of fun. Some of what's been added includes fishing, a fishing skiff, messages in bottles, a fishing expedition, a new diving suit, fish traps, new cooking recipes, a deep-water jetpack, a huge new fish variety and more.</p>
<p>Speaking about the update the developer said: "Something people really loved in the Worlds update was the new water technology – tons of players were posting videos of themselves just chilling at the water’s edge. One piece of fan art in particular stopped us in our tracks, of a player lazily fishing from their wing of their starship. This art, and others like it, was right at the heart of the inspiration behind the Aquarius update."</p>
<p>Once again, they say more will follow, so they're clearly not done with No Man's Sky just yet.</p>

      <title>Ember is a huge online tabletop RPG from the creators of Foundry Virtual Tabletop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Foundry Virtual Tabletop is a popular (and Linux-supported) modern online role-playing system and now the creators are working on a massive new game called Ember. Ember will use Foundry Virtual Tabletop, so it will work on Linux.</p>
<p>It sounds really ridiculously impressive too, a lot of which due to the work they've already done inside Foundry Virtual Tabletop. They've been working to build this up since 2022 and so the scope of it really is massive, complete with an original setting and a lengthy campaign.</p>
<p>What is it: "Ember is an online tabletop roleplaying game which is a hybrid between a tabletop RPG and a multiplayer digital game. It has all the elements of a traditional pen &amp; paper RPG but is enhanced with features inspired by video games to create a compelling hybrid of dynamic gameplay and a classical foundation. It is a collaborative storytelling experience for a gamemaster and group of players. Ember has been made specifically to be played online in Foundry Virtual Tabletop and has a ton of additional features, systems, and mechanics to facilitate and enhance gameplay."</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>

<li>Epic main story with years of gameplay.</li>
<li>Colossal open world of over 25,000 hexes.</li>
<li>Elegant character creation process.</li>
<li>Over 80 interactive and animated area maps.</li>
<li>Vista system for visual storytelling.</li>
<li>Codex to chronicle your achievements.</li>
<li>Dynamic and cinematic audio engine.</li>

<li>Solar, lunar, and seasonal calendar system.</li>
<li>Non-linear quests and consequential choices.</li>
<li>Token maker with infinite variation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foundryvtt/ember-rpg/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a>, and has absolutely smashed the initial goal with a current funding level of around £142,367.

      <title>Retroid Pocket 5 and Retroid Pocket Mini will have Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it has yet to have a proper full announcement, the Retroid Pocket 5 sounds like a nice device for those of you who love retro gaming and for the first time it will have proper Linux support too. Along with the Retroid Pocket Mini too.</p>
<p>As confirmed in a <a href="https://x.com/Retroid0fficial/status/1831275010817671369" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> from the official account on X / Twitter, they posted this image:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11286750001725458447gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11286750001725458447gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The image notes it will have official support for Batocera and Armbian, with an "open Linux kernel for community developers".</p>
<p>Details they have revealed about it so far include a 5.5" 1080p AMOLED 16:9 screen, with DisplayPort 1080p 60Hz, a 5000mAh battery and it's size is said to be 19.9*7.8*1.56cm. With a weight of 280g too so. Looking at the previous version, it's not too much bigger than the Retroid Pocket 4 but clearly an upgrade. Going from the pictures and teaser videos the thumbsticks will have some form of lighting as well.</p>
<p>We also know it will be available in a few different colours, along with a customizable back shell for DIY options:</p>

<p>They've been teasing it for only a couple of days, so hopefully a full announcement isn't too far off, but it's really nice to see more hardware vendors look to get Linux working nicely on their devices. Going by another social media <a href="https://x.com/Retroid0fficial/status/1831176401258447077" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> it will have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865.</p>
<p>It's not just the Retroid Pocket 5 that will have Linux support though, the also recently revealed Retroid Pocket Mini should also have Linux support as they <a href="https://x.com/Retroid0fficial/status/1831290998963441777" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a reply to someone. Since they're using the same chipset, that's not too surprising.</p>
<p>See more about their devices on <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their store</a>.</p>
<p><em>Looks like another company I'll have to keep a closer eye on.</em></p>

      <title>Acer enter the handheld PC gaming race with the Nitro Blaze 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again. Another vendor has decided to make their own PC gaming handheld and this time it's Acer with the Nitro Blaze 7.</p>
<p>It is once again using Windows, as most vendors shy away from Linux still apart from Valve with the SteamOS-powered Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/manjaro-linux-devs-show-off-the-orangepi-neo-prototype-handheld-with-gameplay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OrangePi Neo with Manjaro</a>. And again, it's another hardware vendor attempting to deal with the mess that is Windows with their own "Acer Game Space app".</p>
<p>With an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor, AMD Radeon 780M Graphics and a 1080p 144 Hz refresh rate FreeSync IPS touch panel it sounds like a pretty nice unit overall. However with no trackpads and no back buttons, I imagine plenty will be writing it off for something else already.</p>

<p><em>Note: their official press release says 39 AI TOPS, but AMD's own specifications for the processor say 38 AI TOPS as does Acer's product page. So I assume Acer had an error in the press release specifications.</em></p>
<p>There's no price, region availability or release date being shared just yet. They're jumping into a still quite small market against the Steam Deck LCD and Steam Deck OLED, ASUS ROG Ally and Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go, ZOTAC Zone, various devices from AYANEO, GPD and others I've forgotten. It's a crowded market already.</p>
<p>Apart from being just another handheld, I'm not really seeing anything to make it properly stand out. It's going to need a seriously competitive price considering the competition.</p>
<p>The question is: how long will it be from release to Linux working on it? We have many great Linux distributions designed for handhelds now including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=Bazzite&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=ChimeraOS&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=HoloISO&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HoloISO</a> and the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steamfork-is-yet-another-linux-distribution-aiming-to-be-a-steamos-like-for-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamFork</a>.</p>

      <title>Earl vs. the Mutants is chaotic survivor-like fun with vehicles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a whole lot of Vampire Survivor-likes and bullet hell / bullet heaven mixtures around, but not many stick you directly in the driver's seat like Earl vs. the Mutants. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Another super-cheap bit of happiness you can pick up here at only £2.49, you can't really go wrong with it if you love repeating runs where you build up a ridiculously overpowered character. Or, in this case, vehicle. Thanks to you being behind the wheel, the pace of it is many times quicker than other games in the genre, and for some that might be a great thing. You're speedy and reasonable powerful right from the start, so the action is speedy and satisfying right away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3488114081725448871gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3488114081725448871gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it's in a proper 3D from a top-down perspective, and you have wheels, you can actually properly use the terrain to your advantage here. Boosting over hills and smashing down into the hordes never gets old. Although, I will admit some slight disappointment that you can just drive through trees, it would have been more entertaining to accidentally wrap your car around a tree when fleeing the hordes as your turrets shoot around you.</p>
<p>There's two different control modes depending on how you wish to play. Twin-stick for easier gamepad use, and a more traditional mode for keyboard and mouse. You can set your weapons to auto-fire too, or manually control them to focus-fire on particular enemies so really you play it how you want.</p>
<p>Lots of upgrades are possible too. During runs you get per-level upgrades where you can pick various stat boosts, which are all random and sometimes you get some truly over-powered stuff. One run I remember gave me HP constantly for running over enemies, as well as driving fast, so I was basically god-like in car form. That was, until it started throwing bullet-sponge enemies at me, walking bombs (big ouch) and all sorts firing things at me to dodge which isn't particularly easy when you're boosting around in a vehicle.</p>
<p>The old lady boss likes to drop down extras for you too, like drones to follow you, new weapons and more. And thanks to the meta-progression, you can keep upgrading basic stats even when you fail.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NcL3ACnYQj8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac0e53ba62ca5a3acd0ae35774e5ef2a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NcL3ACnYQj8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've played a lot of these games now where you <s>run</s> drive around, smash through whatever weird types of enemies it decides to throw at you, collect gems and level up eventually becoming pretty much unstoppable. As far as Earl vs. the Mutants goes, it does exactly what's advertised and for that price you really can't argue on the value of it.</p>
<p>Nice short runs too at 5-10 minutes per level, so no sweat in you don't have a lot of free time.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2292010/Earl_vs_the_Mutants/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It runs perfectly on Linux with Proton 9. It has no Steam Deck rating from Valve yet but works fine.</p>

      <title>SteamFork is yet another Linux distribution aiming to be a SteamOS-like for handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Attack of the clones! Well, sort of anyway. We have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=Bazzite&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=ChimeraOS&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=HoloISO&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HoloISO</a> and now SteamFork as well. There's so much choice to get Linux on your handhelds.</p>
<p>Much like traditional Linux distributions aimed at the desktop where there's hundreds of different versions, the same is beginning to happen for those targeting handheld gaming PCs now too.</p>
<p>So why another? Well, SteamFork "is intended to be as close to 1:1 compatible with upstream SteamOS as possible" while making changes to expand the hardware support. So it's not trying to add in tons of extras like Bazzite for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9921234441725445494gol1.png"/></p>
<p>As the developer explained when sending it in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's a SteamOS based distribution that is intended to be as close to 1:1 compatible with upstream SteamOS as possible while making changes to support a wider range of hardware. It originated as a fork of HoloISO but it has been majorly overhauled to eliminate things like post-copy operations (as much as possible), introduce our own signed package repositories, add an automated release process, and provide many bug fixes and refinements. The focus has largely been on handheld gaming consoles, but it's in use on a variety of AMD based mini PCs as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full SteamOS UI/UX, including desktop mode.</li>
<li>Minimal changes to SteamOS to preserve upstream compatibility.</li>
<li>Power management optimizations ported from <a href="https://github.com/JustEnoughLinuxOS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">JustEnoughLinuxOS</a>.</li>
<li>Improved fan curves on supported devices.</li>
<li>RGB off by default, will flash on low battery (on supported devices).</li>
<li>Supports booting from removable media such as usb drives and micro sd cards (64GB minimum).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Devour famous paintings in the classic Snake-ish game ART for Snakes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the classic game Snake? Well this is ART for Snakes, a "snake-ish" game about eating the most expensive paintings you can before the time runs out. <em>Disclosure: one of the team is a previous contributor to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Here you use snake-like controls to move through and leap from painting to painting across a branching 4 course campaign. Originally created as a prototype during a Game Jam, a big 1.0 update was released a few days ago turning it into a full game and expanding basically everything.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uEHSG49Isgo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3d772a8c8917aa4ca959b53771686d80.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uEHSG49Isgo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's free, so might be a nice little casual one to check out on your next coffee break. Mastering the controls on this one is actually a little challenging. There's something weirdly satisfying about munching on paintings across the various galleries.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://splerp.itch.io/art-for-snakes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the itch.io page</a>.</p>

      <title>Cosmic Call is basically Nuclear Throne as a rogue-lite boomer shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CosmicDev recently put up a demo for Cosmic Call, a very scribbly-styled retro boomer shooter that sees you fight through small arena levels as you keep powering up. The demo is quite limited, but nicely showcases the idea.</p>
<p>I couldn't quite put my finger on what it felt like, until I looked at the Steam forum and a player <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3060130/discussions/0/4756451924767221306/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gave it</a> the perfect description of "Nuclear Throne but in first person" and yep, that's about right. It has the same sort of feel just translated into 3D, with the same sort of design of how you progress through it and that's actually great.</p>
<p>More about it: "Cosmic Call is a brutal 3D FPS Roguelike Boomer shooter set inside the prison of the Great One. Many have entered this prison, succumbing to its never-ending torture and its relentless cycle of death and retries, but none have ever managed to escape. Fight your way out of this hellish nightmare, collecting otherworldly weapons and horrifying items along the way. Unlock mythical skulls that grant you extraordinary powers, perhaps just enough to rip your way through all the beasts and monsters and finally break free from this accursed hell."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_d3o0EJzD3I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a441ea4be3bc0d2482f09ad90b6acf61.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_d3o0EJzD3I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo has the first two levels on repeat, with alternating bosses from the first level. Due to this, it's easy to become over-powered which the developer mentions won't be the case in the full game.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3174870/Cosmic_Call_Demo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim &#39;Thrive&#39; adds sprinting, visual upgrades, more competitive AI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love watching Thrive continue to grow. A free and open source evolution sim where you start off life as a single microbe. The latest release version 0.7.0 is out now adding new gameplay features.</p>
<p>With this release the world should seem a whole lot more alive. For starters, the auto-evolution system for the world around you with the AI has seen a huge enhancement. The new "Miche System" is in that defines various problems and pressures that organisms might face, and defining how species might respond to that pressure and the result is that it can allow the AI to better adapt to the environment. The developer say that you should find "worlds busier and more alive, with more competitive organisms popping up around them".</p>
<p>Compound clouds were also given a visual overhaul, to be more textured and less plain.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396975381725441053gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396975381725441053gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Thrive 0.7.0 on Linux</em></p>
<p>On top of that there's some new microbe gameplay features like the mucocyst, a new part that when you activate can encase you in a tough exterior coat of mucus. There's a sprinting mechanic, so no more just holding down the movement button and hoping for the best, you can now dart ahead and chase other creatures down properly. The sprint mechanic also comes with a strain system, which could cause your organism to get exhausted.</p>
<p>Various other gameplay mechanics were added like a healing cooldown, making toxins a more viable weapon and combat a bit more intense. There's also more customization for toxins too, allowing yous to choose an expensive, high-damage impact, or less expensive and faster but less-damaging hits so you can play your way.</p>

<p>Some other changes included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the experimental features mode, placing rusticyanin allows the player to shoot projectiles at iron to break off chunks, which will eventually result in the larger iron chunk being depleted fully. Enabling experimental features will allow players to test this out; feedback would be much appreciated.</li>
<li>Migration has been revamped, allowing the player to direct their species towards a new patch without necessarily playing in that patch themselves.</li>
<li>On easy mode, players can now switch to another species upon extinction.</li>
<li>Corpse chunks now have more resources, making heterotrophy more viable. Chunks spawning and despawning has also been refactored to result in more consistent performance.</li>
<li>You can now engulf when starving, though you take health damage.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Harebrained (BATTLETECH / Shadowrun) announced GRAFT, a post-cyberpunk survival horror RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Harebrained are back! After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/harebrained-schemes-and-paradox-interactive-to-split/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">splitting off from Paradox</a>, they've returned with a new game, and one Shadowrun fans might like to take a look at with GRAFT.</p>
<p>In GRAFT, you will navigate a crumbling, continent-sized space station known as the Arc, where the remains of a once-advanced civilization now lie in darkness and decay. As a survivor in this dying world, you must scavenge and graft parts from enemies to transform and enhance abilities, all while grappling with the philosophical implications of identity and memory. </p>
<p>See the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YhQZYJkfe8w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7856d1d23309e571a7e14bf78dcb3579.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YhQZYJkfe8w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Delve into a Haunting World: The Arc is rich with forgotten technologies and unsettling wonders. Traverse through massive chasms, labyrinthine techno-catacombs, and self-replicating corridors as you seek a way out. Master these ancient secrets and uncover the mysteries that lie within. </li>
<li>A Dark RPG Experience: Survival is not just about battling the horrors that lurk in the shadows. It's also about navigating the treacherous relationships with other survivors. Form alliances, build trust, and face the reality that anyone still living could be both an ally and a threat. Your decisions will shape your journey and determine the fate of those you encounter.</li>
<li>Tense Survival Horror Combat: Engage in visceral, survival horror combat against ancient experiments, monstrous abominations, and relentless agents of a mad AI. Manage your resources and choose your battles wisely to stay alive as you carve a path through the Arc's dangers.</li>
<li>Transform to Survive: Your evolving body is a potent weapon. With each Graft you acquire—whether ripped from enemies or found hidden in the depths of the Arc—you gain new abilities and powers. However, every Graft carries fragments of its former owner’s identity, shaping your memories, impulses, and even your very self. Each choice will have profound consequences on who you become.</li>
</ul>

      <title>A love letter to the Monster Tamer genre, Battle Gem Ponies is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a successful Kickstarter back in 2021, Battle Gem Ponies from Yotes Games has officially released as a love letter to the Monster Tamer genre. <em>You might also notice the clear inspiration from My Little Pony…</em></p>
<p>So basically, it's a Pokémon-like with a pony theme. Here you command a pony that alternates between 3 different forms to outsmart the opponent in strategic turn-based combat. An old-school RPG featuring a diverse vibrant cast of collectible pony characters. It does things a little differently to other similar games though. Instead of collecting a bunch to swap out during battles, your main creature can temporarily transform into others during a battle.</p>
<p>Have a look a the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Yuqza229Jsg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0617aeb8086e37165eb6c7820bcf914.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Yuqza229Jsg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned that now it's actually out there, they will keep fixing up bugs as they come in. After that they're planning free story DLC chapters, controller support and more content overall as they work towards an eventual Steam release sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>It has a Native Linux version which you can buy from <a href="https://yotesmark.itch.io/battle-gem-ponies" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the itch.io page</a>.</p>

<p>The Nexus mod platform team continue building up their newer open source and cross-platform mod launcher, with expanded support for Cyberpunk 2077 modding in the new 0.6.0 version out now. <em>Eventually, this could be the true go-to for modding on Linux and Windows.</em></p>
<p>Currently the app only supports Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk 2077, with more to come as the app features are expanded.</p>
<p>One big new feature of this release is Multiple Loadouts, allowing you to manage multiple different mod setups for a single game, allowing you to easily swap between them. There's also a new "tree view" display setting for the My Mods and Library pages.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12206112141725380189gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12206112141725380189gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11662397161725380190gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11662397161725380190gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For the expanded Cyberpunk 2077 support, the current downside on Linux is that the Nexus Mods app is currently unable to automatically run REDmod, so you need to do that manually. You also need to manually uninstall the entire app and settings before updating to this latest version.</p>
<p>More of what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Other Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the My Games page with new tile designs.</li>
<li>Game tiles now show a store icon to indicate where the game was downloaded from.</li>
<li>It is now possible to delete mods from your Library.</li>
<li>Within a <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/features/Workspaces/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Workspace</a> the active panel is now highlighted in the UI.</li>
<li>All panels and tabs in Workspace now have a history, allowing the user to navigate forward or backward using the new arrows on the top toolbar.</li>
<li>The fonts used in the UI have been updated to Inter in line with our new design system.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugfixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the game icon in the spine flickering when updating a loadout.</li>
<li>Reworded the "Update available" pop-up to make it more clear that updating the app requires a full reset of your mod setup.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Steam games would fail to launch on Ubuntu.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technical Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading files now uses a new "Jobs" system to make them easier to manage.</li>
<li>We are continuing our backend work to convert from "Mods" to "Loadout items". <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13495763-nexus-mods-app-1-august-progress-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">More Info</a></li>
<li>The synchronizer for handling loadout states has been reworked to provide much more robust coverage of edge cases.</li>
<li>Added generic support for path-based diagnostic checks when checking for missing dependencies.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Square Enix invests in Playtron for their Linux-based PlaytronOS - first Alpha out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playtron are quietly building up their Linux-based PlaytronOS behind the scenes, and not only have they released their first Alpha but they've pulled in another investor too.</p>
<p>As a reminder: PlaytronOS was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/playtron-plan-to-launch-playtronos-a-linux-based-system-for-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> back in March, with a plan to bring their Fedora Silverblue based Linux system to as many devices as possible. They're <em>not</em> a hardware company though, think of them more like a vendor making a specialised version of Linux to ship to OEMs. Unlike SteamOS from Valve they are working on direct integrations with not just Steam but also GOG, Epic Games and other platforms <em>directly</em> inside the system. The first hardware that will be actually using it is the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SuiPlay0x1</a>, a strange looking and sounding web3 / blockchain handheld.</p>
<p>Just announced via a press release shared with me today, Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd., have invested in the company. This is in addition to Samsung Next, Polychain Capital, Alumni Ventures, Mysten Labs and others that previously invested in them.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.playtron.one/press-release" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>"Square Enix’s investment in Playtron underscores its commitment to driving innovation and enhancing player experiences and access," said Hideaki Uehara, General Manager, Investment &amp; Business Development of Square Enix. "This collaboration aims to leverage Playtron’s"GameOS" to expand distribution of Square Enix’s portfolio of beloved franchises and explore new creative possibilities that are only possible when harnessing the full power of an operating system."</p>
<p>Playtron’s CEO, Kirt McMaster, added, “We are thrilled to join forces with such a legendary games publisher as Square Enix. The PC we know is morphing into new forms that require a purpose built OS for gaming that meets the demands of powerful new gaming hardware such as handhelds and new players who have grown up in a mobile 1st world with much more sophisticated UX sensibilities. This investment will accelerate the development and deployment of GameOS and create new experiences for players around the globe.”</p>
<p>Additionally, the first Alpha version of PlaytronOS has now been released for those of you who wish to test and give feedback. So far they note it has been tested across the AYANEO 2, ASUS ROG Ally, GPD Win 4 (2023), Lenovo Legion Go, Valve Steam Deck LCD and Valve Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p>One of their developers kindly shared a bunch of screenshots of it in action (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15140906251725357264gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15140906251725357264gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6812448801725357265gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6812448801725357265gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20555435931725357266gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20555435931725357266gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5319468531725357266gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5319468531725357266gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18535612531725357267gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18535612531725357267gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14629301751725357267gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14629301751725357267gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18691921541725357268gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18691921541725357268gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of what they do is open source, but seemingly not all of it. In their FAQ they noted: "At first, only the operating system code will be open source. We have plans to open source more and release API documentation to allow developers in the community to contribute and build their solutions using Playtron.". They will also still have the anti-cheat problem that SteamOS has but they do say they're "working with interested partners to enable anti-cheat services".</p>
<p>Still early days, but it's looking pretty promising. The real test will be getting more known vendors to use it once it's further along in development.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 43: Demons and Angels</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-42-upset-the-applecart/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 42: Upset the Applecart</a></strong></p>
<p>The Spanish game development scene does not get much attention paid to it, especially when compared to some of its other European counterparts, but sometimes you encounter polymaths like Ángel Ortega that deserve to be highlighted. As well as being a coder he is also an artist and a musician, and having been inspired by games like <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, he and a group of his friends decided to try their best to bring their own vision of a 3D shooter to life right at the start of the genre.</p>
<p><em>Freaks! 2002</em> is a reworking of <em>Freaks!</em> from 1993 first released for MS-DOS, with the game now allowing for full angle rotation instead of the limited 90 degree steps seen in the original version of the game, as well as the addition of sound effects and an array of new lighting and atmospheric flourishes. The game was also rebalanced by having corpses become health pickups, unlike in the original <em>Freaks!</em> where your health was restored simply by killing enemies.</p>
<p>As Ortega was so fond of crafting his own tools, building the game is akin to assembling a nesting doll. To satisfy the config.sh script you have to first install his Grutatxt and mp_doccer utilities, and then build both filp and qdgdf in so named sub-directories inside the main game directory. Then you can make the actual game binary which builds with support for both SVGAlib as well as for X11, although launching from the console with SVGAlib sadly just resulted in a segmentation fault for me.</p>
<p>Combat is basic with you being able to fire a limitless supply of green balls at enemies, much like in the seminal <em>Catacomb 3D</em>. This means you just circle strafe on repeat until any given monster dies; but if more than one monster is able to reach and then grab hold of you, then you will get locked in place for an almost guaranteed death, unless you manage to strafe. This can be a real bear to deal with when facing monsters in tight rooms, and makes frequent saving a must to get through the levels.</p>
<p>At times you just have to cheese them by getting monsters stuck on corners, or creep around to bait the hordes out to you in more manageable numbers. What keeps you playing then is the variety and inventiveness of the monster designs on offer, as well as the endearing worlds brought to life out of the primitive technology. Each episode contains a massive hub with a unique setting, with the first episode in particular presenting a cavalcade of critters and environments to both behold and explore.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16956574831725301973gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16956574831725301973gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14924556531725301974gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14924556531725301974gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>I was able to 100% the game with the exception of the second episode, as seven of the enemies were left behind glass with no apparent means of accessing them. One of them did get stuck on the wall in an adjoining room, allowing us to harm each other, but the others were unreachable. The penultimate episode also lets the game down a touch by having a bloated enemy count showcasing swarms of the exact same monsters, making clearing it become more like a series of slaughter maps.</p>
<p>The ultimate episode, which consists of just the one arena containing the final boss and his lackeys, also proved to be difficult to navigate. A visual effect is added to make the world seem to phase in and out, but I would also sometimes literally clip in and out of the map and become out of bounds, forcing me to find my way back in. Doors can be spatially awkward as well, as you just teleport through them into the next named area, which can be especially inconvenient when backing into one.</p>
<p>Ángel Ortega would also release another first-person maze game in 1997 called <em>Space Plumber</em>, which again he ported over to Linux using qdgdf. Rather than slaying monsters, players are instead tasked with seeking valves and consoles to prevent the gradual flooding of an evacuated mining station. This then is an early example of a game built around speedrunning, but if your interests lay elsewhere it is otherwise not that compelling, although the bleak atmosphere can still leave an impression.</p>
<p>There are thirty missions locked behind level codes, as well as the ability to procedurally generate your own maps, which again was forward thinking for the time. Building the game was much the same process as it was with <em>Freaks! 2002</em>, although filp is not required for compiling <em>Space Plumber</em>, and the SVGAlib version again still segfaults for me. Performance wise both games would have benefited from my having just a bit more CPU horsepower, but were still manageable none the less.</p>
<p>While both of the games are a little rough around the edges, there is a real auteur talent here that was impossible for me not to appreciate, and one of the joys of looking back like this is having the opportunity to give obscure creators like Ángel Ortega and his development house Triptico their due. In the same vein, I now intend to look into the history of another free software classic, this time originating in Japan before being expanded upon by people from all over the world.</p>

      <title>Risk of Rain creators Hopoo Games join Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Exciting times ahead for Valve and Steam as most of Hopoo Games, the creators of the Risk of Rain series, have now joined Valve. Announced via a <a href="https://x.com/hopoogames/status/1830763152818217461" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> on their official X / Twitter account, Hopoo Games itself sounds like its simply no more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/619461081725355112gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Risk of Rain 2</em></p>
<p>While Hopoo Games are the <em>original</em> team behind Risk of Rain, Gearbox under Embracer took over the IP back in 2022 so the series will continue on without them.</p>
<p>Here's a quote of the full thread they made about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Today, we have an exciting update: Duncan and Paul, alongside many other talented members at Hopoo Games, will now be working on game development directly at @valvesoftware!</p>
<p>We're incredibly grateful to Valve for their partnerships in the last decade, and are excited to continue working on their awesome titles. However, this does mean that we are stopping production on our unannounced game, "Snail".</p>
<p>It's been an exciting and transformative 12 years. We feel lucky for the opportunities we've had, and deeply appreciate both our team and fans that have supported us and our games.</p>
<p>We love making games - and will continue to do so, for years to come. We're excited to be working side-by-side with the talented people at Valve. But for now - sleep tight, Hopoo Games.</p>

      <title>Coromon: Rogue Planet blends creature-collecting with a rogue-lite twist</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coromon is one of the better monster-taming / creature collecting Pokémon-likes that I've played and now the series is getting a new and rather different entry with Coromon: Rogue Planet. <em>The first game is Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux too with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</em></p>
<p>This time it's less of a standard Pokémon-like, and more of a turn-based tactical strategy game, with rogue-lite elements to make "an endlessly-replayable Monster Taming gameplay experience".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2052008891725294782gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2052008891725294782gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12700543871725294804gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12700543871725294804gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>More about it: "Explore a variety of over 10 ever-changing biomes! Make tactical decisions on which paths to take as you navigate different events across the planet of Velua, weighing risk and reward. Each biome contains new and interesting challenges, as well as its own biosphere of Coromon. Procedurally-generated maps, encounters, and rewards ensure that every run feels fresh and new.</p>
<p>Unlock 7 different playable characters, each with their own story and playstyle! As you navigate your way through Velua’s diverse wildlands, you’ll find other trainers in need of your help. Join forces with them to permanently unlock them as a playable character, and complete milestone goals to discover their stories and gain new bonuses for every successive run!"</p>
<p>Check out the teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="b_R8ck05nUE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb388094f7d8a5146ca807cb0849bb15.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/b_R8ck05nUE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At its heart it's still very much a game all about taming those monsters though, with 130 of them this time around. Each having their own unique abilities. There's also going to be a meta-progression system to allow you to constantly upgrade your skills and abilities, along with upgrading a special hub area.</p>
<p>Something that pulled in my curiosity here is the mention of a mysterios interstellar spaceship you find the remains of. Each time you play you bring back new info and resources, and you're somehow working together with all other players to "progress a global narrative and unlock the secrets of the galaxy". </p>
<p>If that sounds like your kind of thing you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3195360/Coromon_Rogue_Planet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Tower defense fans should try Nordhold: Origins, a free prologue for a much bigger upcoming game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently reviewing well from users on Steam is Nordhold: Origins, a free tower defense game with high replayability where you build up a medieval Nordic village.

      <title>Linux smashes another market share record for August 2024 on Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh month and so we have the latest operating system market share details from Statcounter, and it's another impressive showing for Linux from August 2024.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/steam-survey-for-august-shows-linux-just-below-2-as-china-surges/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Steam Survey</a> showed a dip (mainly due to China), Statcounter gives a much wider overall picture based on data from 1.5 million websites.</p>
<p>Here's how things have looked over the last year:</p>
<ul>
<li>July 23 - 3.12%</li>
<li>August 23 - 3.18%</li>
<li>September 23 - 3.02%</li>
<li>October 23 - 2.92%</li>
<li>November 23 - 3.22%</li>
<li>December 23 - 3.82%</li>
<li>January 24 - 3.77%</li>
<li>February 24 - 4.03%</li>
<li>March 24 - 4.05%</li>
<li>April - 3.88%</li>
<li>May - 3.77%</li>
<li>June - 4.05%</li>
<li>July - 4.45%</li>
<li><strong>August - 4.55%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What it looks like since 2009:</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1730264961725286898gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1730264961725286898gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Statcounter</a>.</p>
<p>Always nice to see and hopefully it keeps up. It's just one measure of course, but they do have a pretty good sample size. It's not <em>that</em> surprising though. While Windows does still remain top on desktop, it wasn't going to last forever - especially with Microsoft pushing AI more, along with Linux becoming a really good platform for gaming over the last couple of years.</p>

      <title>OneShot: World Machine Edition is coming to Steam with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OneShot is a surreal top down puzzle / adventure game with unique gameplay capabilities that released back in 2016, a console adaption OneShot: World Machine Edition released in 2022 that is now coming to Steam with Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>KOMODO, the game developer / publisher and Valve's partner for Steam Deck distribution, announced the news today with a really short teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tec4LsCSwdM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b8580480c56f8e1220e1a176b0b55d7e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tec4LsCSwdM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not clear currently if this newer edition will have a Native Linux version like the original or not. But since they clearly state it will have "Steam Deck Verification" it will work on desktop Linux regardless with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The World Knows You Exist.</p>
<p>Experience an adventure game with puzzles that go beyond its own window and establish a unique bond with the main character.</p>
<p>In OneShot: World Machine Edition, you discover a strange computer operating system with a self-contained world installed. Explore this world to unravel its mysteries and help guide a child on their mission to restore the long-dead sun.</p>
<p>You hear that saving the world may no longer be possible... But it's worth a shot, you think.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find the original on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/420530/OneShot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. OneShot: World Machine Edition doesn't have a Steam page at time of writing.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 16:00 UTC</strong>: the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915460/OneShot_World_Machine_Edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam store page</a> for OneShot: World Machine Edition is now live. Showing it is in fact Steam Deck Verified. This is using Proton 9.0-2, and there appears to be no Linux version so stick to Proton. The Steam page lists it releasing on September 30th.</p>

      <title>Run a paranormal investigation business in point and click adventure The Phantom Fellows</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Phantom Fellows is a new point and click adventure that follows two best friends who start a paranormal investigation business together, and one of them is already dead. It has Native Linux support, with a demo available and they've announced it's launching on September 27th.</p>
<p>More about it: "Oliver Cobblestone can see and communicate with a dead. Not the dead, just a one Englebert Picklebender who has been in an ethereal entanglement with Oliver for many years. Together they run The Phantom Fellows, a paranormal investigation service that provides the breathers that hire them peace from hauntings, while bringing closure and rest to the floaters who torment the living, and often, themselves."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AymGEOo7dhA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6580a185fd5b155cd956981f646d8bb9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AymGEOo7dhA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Narrative based adventure game where the writing and the story come first.</li>
<li>Hand-drawn pixel art and animations!</li>
<li>Walk or float around the environments, freely explore the world you're in.</li>
<li>Switch between Oliver and Englebert! Sometimes being dead has its perks. Maybe. Switching between the two unlocks in Day 2.</li>
<li>7 Playable Days: Each day features its own goals and characters, while an over-arcing story builds to an unavoidable confrontation!</li>
<li>Fast Travel Map: Unlocks in Day 3, freely explore the town of Elderberry, revisit the location of previous days for more interactions, world building and alternative puzzle solutions!</li>
<li>Real World Puzzle Reasoning: Some puzzles have alternate solutions based on simple reasoning- you never have to leave the location of the day, but if you saw something in a previous day's location that would help you in your current day, you can go get it and use it!</li>
<li>Dialog-based Hint System: Englebert often plays the role of mentor to Oliver. You can speak to him for advice on what to do, and he will give you hints with increasing levels of detail, along with the option to have him stop so you may take as much or as little help as you wish.</li>
<li>Hotspot Heaven: It's all clickable! Oliver and Englebert will look at and interact with everything and provide you with unique lines, laughter and world building, for doing so.</li>
<li>Dual Controls: Optimized for easy, keyboard based control, while maintaining the option to instead point and click.</li>
</ul>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-12 released with fixes for Star Citizen, Bully: Scholarship and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh release of GE-Proton with version 9-12 has landed, bringing in upstream changes from official Valve projects, plus some game-specific fixes for Linux / Steam Deck gamers.</p>
<p>This is the community-build of Proton, not to be confused with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's all the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>added latest upstream proton changes.</li>
<li>added latest upstream steamclient changes.</li>
<li>updated wine to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git.</li>
<li>updated vkd3d to latest git.</li>
</ul>
<p>protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>libmspack, xrandr, cabextract are now built as part of the proton-ge build process instead of being included as prebuilt binaries (thanks R1kaB3rN).</li>
<li>winetricks updated to latest git.</li>
<li>star citizen protonfix updated (thanks marcan).</li>
<li>fix added for Full Metal Daemon Muramasa (thanks R1kaB3rN).</li>
<li>fix install location of xlive.dll for xliveless (thanks ProjectSynchro).</li>
<li>add fix for Bully: Scholarship edition (thanks Root-Core).</li>
<li>add fix for Dirt 2 (thanks ProjectSynchro).</li>
<li>add fix for CYGNI: All Guns Blazing (thanks Root-Core).</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<p>No surprise to see Black Myth: Wukong up on the list. It has no rating from Valve yet, but is listed as Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2358720" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>. A lot of familiar names there as usual, with a lot of people generally sticking to their favourites.</p>

      <title>Steam Survey for August 2024 shows Linux just below 2% as China surges</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out now for August 2024, so let's go over the details on where Linux stands right now.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the overall user share per operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.78% +0.23%</li>
<li>Linux 1.92% -0.16%</li>
<li>MacOS 1.30% -0.07%</li>
</ul>
<p>The interesting thing about the last month is we had the absolutely massive release of Black Myth: Wukong from Chinese developer Game Science. This, naturally, has lead to a surge in the numbers of people from China playing games and using Steam. And as usual, that pushes the Linux number down because it's just such a massive amount of extra people on Windows.</p>
<p>From our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker page</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8595716761725271775gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">On the Linux side here's the current most popular Linux distributions used on Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit (Steam Deck) 40.48% -0.49%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 8.22% +0.23%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.23% -0.12%</li>

      <title>Selaco hits 70,000 copies sold with a big update live and sale now on</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Altered Orbit Studios have done well with Selaco. They just announced some stats, along with a brand new update and a sale live now. <em>See also: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original thoughts on the Early Access release</a>.</em></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4286950670137685546" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> they've now hit 70,000 sales with an overall Very Positive rating on Steam from 2,500 players. Pretty great for their first game! To celebrate it's 20% off until September 6 at 6PM UTC, plus their "most significant patch to date" is up now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9783730131725043697gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main update highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lots of Quality of Life improvements, including backpack reloading, 'Last Weapon' button and more.</li>
<li>Added Smart Ammo Pickups.</li>
<li>Adjustable difficulty during a campaign.</li>
<li>Improvements to immersion.</li>
<li>Reworked Mutator menu with 3 new mutators.</li>
<li>AI Improvements.</li>
<li>Stagger Rework.</li>
<li>Weapon and enemy balance changes.</li>
<li>Further improved level design.</li>
<li>Vastly improved soundscape with more ambient noises, reworked sound effects, and more.</li>
<li>Rain reworks.</li>
<li>Fan Art Kit.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading through it properly, they really have done quite a lot! To the point that it probably already feels like a much better game (I haven't had time to re-test yet). Really looking forward to jumping back in with the vast array of improvements, seems like a lot of things people have been asking for.</p>
<p>What's coming next sounds equally as exciting with the randomizer mode that has "gotten a little out of hand and has become a much bigger project than originally intended". Plus, more story content to come too which will be great to see it continue.</p>
<p>Selaco has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dungeon Divers is a dungeon-themed take on Minesweeper that gets complicated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do you get when you cross Minesweeper with a sort-of dungeon crawler? Well Dungeon Divers is pretty much the answer to that. <em>Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>A turn based roguelike puzzle game inspired by Minesweeper is not something I expect to come across recently but here it is. More: "As the newest dungeon diver, you are tasked with clearing out derelict dungeons to make it safe for adventurers. Armed with your wits and some trusty items clear out all of the deadly traps as you travel to the dungeon core and defuse it entirely."</p>
<p>You have to hand it to smaller indie devs, they always find a way to take something and make it their own. And Dungeon Divers definitely comes across quite unique. This is far away from being the first to take Minesweeper and mash it into something, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/08/minesweeper-but-its-a-rogue-lite-with-tons-of-features-demoncrawl-is-out-for-linux-pc/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DemonCrawl</a> being one I got hooked on a while ago. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JRvvHif2o7Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f064c10fdb3b84e03b7e7a4bc537d97a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JRvvHif2o7Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Test Your Wits: </strong>With nearly a dozen different types of rooms to disarm each with their own conditions, quirks, and logic to solve what starts off as a simple task will become increasingly complex and difficult to decipher. Choose carefully as you only have a finite number of tries before your mission is deemed a failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arsenal At Your Disposal:</strong> As you progress through the dungeon you're clearing, objects of power may be uncovered to assist in your journey. Some simply help you survive mistakes, other may grant you the ability to uncover vital clues for your efforts, and some grant you extra riches. Choose wisely as you can only carry so many artifacts at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Every Dungeon Is Different:</strong> No two dungeons share the same layout. Procedural generation means that every delve is different providing countless hours of entertainment as you clear level after level. A host of challenge dungeons provide unique opportunities for interesting and complex puzzles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you like the sound of a logic puzzler that blends dungeon-crawling (sort of) with Minesweeper then check it out.</p>

      <title>Mechabellum, my favourite auto-battling strategy game launches September 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah, auto battlers, at one point they seemed like they would be all the rage, but most quickly moved on. Mechabellum thankfully, feels a bit different, and quickly became a real favourite and it's set to leave Early Access on September 26. <em>Disclosure: my key was originally sent by TriplePoint PR.</em></p>
<p>I think what really makes Mechabellum good is the actual action. I mean sure, you're not directing units manually like an RTS, but the explosive destruction when the battle gets going is just pure joy to watch. Unless the destruction is happening to you that is. Just look at these shots I took just today (click them to see bigger):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/452625471725029725gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/452625471725029725gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3210448621725029727gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3210448621725029727gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the email that went out the full release will bring in new unit techs, specialists, and a seasonal system with rewards, with more content planned for the future. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">1.0 Release Update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch of Season 1, including earnable rewards such as skins</li>
<li>Introduction of new unit techs and specialists</li>
<li>Balancing adjustments, optimization improvements, and bug fixes</li>
<li>Enhanced tutorial designed for new players</li>
<li>In-game reward for early access players</li>
<li>Regular content updates planned for the future</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lZIe7nWoB_w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6d5d8988ecbe8f5f38bebfe05861d51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lZIe7nWoB_w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a strategy game for people who love an RTS but don't have a lot of time, so it's a nice sort-of in-between game that for me fits the bill quite nicely. You get to pick a fun load-out of units each round, and watch them all clash in the middle while you sit back and watch the fireworks and decide what you're going to tweak for the next round.</p>
<p>The game works perfectly on Linux with Proton 9. Love it. </p>
<p>It will be $14.99 / £14.99 / €14.99 at release. Well worth picking up right now though.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Deadlock surpassed 100,000 concurrent players, Valve adds wall jumping</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's latest game Deadlock continues rising up the most-played games ranking on Steam, despite it being invite-only and the developers continue expanding it. As a reminder, Linux players need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and you <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/deadlock-from-valve-may-need-this-quick-fix-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">may also need a quick fix to stop it crashing</a>.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours it hit a peak player count of 106,447 putting it higher than Rust, Call of Duty, Stardew Valley, War Thunder and other usually very popular games. Clearly, Valve's idea for it is working and it seems a lot of people are fully coming around to enjoying and appreciating the design.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3362342751725015732gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3362342751725015732gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Source: <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#1w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a></em></p>
<p>As long as the player numbers keep up, it seems like Valve may well be onto truly the next big thing here. Still, the biggest test of course is when it's fully opened up but it's incredibly promising to see.</p>
<p>The design keeps changing too, only in the last update the developers added in wall jumping. So that's in addition to dashing, double-jumping, mantling over things and sliding too. Valve also added in some ropes to certain builds too so you can quickly climb up, and you can shoot while hanging on the ropes too.</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" data-responsive="true" style="text-align: center;">
<video autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" loop="loop" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/dldoublejump.mp4" style="height:auto; max-width:100%"></video>
</div>
<p>One thing that I really struggled with early on while learning Deadlock, and to some extend I <em>still</em> struggle a bit with now, is to <em>not</em> treat it like a shooter. Yes, it has guns (and finger-guns), but it's a MOBA like Dota 2 more than it is a hero shooter. Your guns aren't even particularly good and deal pretty low damage, a lot of the time they're just to get health down a bit for your abilities, or to finish someone off.</p>
<p>You can follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deadlock on Steam</a>. You'll have to find an invite from someone to access it.</p>
<p>Have you been playing Deadlock? Be sure to let me know what you think to Valve's latest in-development game in the comments.</p>

      <title>Valve tweak Steam pages again, giving developers some more options while dealing with the mess</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-store-pages-are-about-to-get-a-lot-cleaner-valve-puts-an-end-to-game-advert-spam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">put some new rules in place</a> for Steam pages, because they were getting a bit messy with some publishers using them like pure advertising boards for other games. Now though, Valve have announced more changes.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/4578559379959234050" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest update</a> Valve has now given developers the ability to adjust the highlight reel of games that appear after the description. So developers directly can pick the "set of games to draw from, as well as the sort order for those games, and set one or more of the included games to force to the front of the list".</p>
<p>For example, on the Starfield page when you scroll down, before the reviews section is this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11465312871725014537gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Developers can change the list to include various associated developers, publishers, and franchises. To use it though, developers do need to set up a developer homepage, publisher page or franchise page before the above section will actually display on store pages.</p>
<p>They can then set the sort order and <em>force</em> it to feature certain games.</p>
<p>Additionally, the DLC section has been updated so that developers can feature a specific DLC at the top. Like this example for Europa Universalis IV:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19239752541725014725gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While some developers and publishers still won't be happy they can't put multiple big Steam banner images for other games at the top of the page, this is a nice compromise. Gives developers more official options to show exactly what they want, without spamming store pages making it a mess for us normies.</p>

      <title>Bazzite Linux gets keyboard-less installation (good for handhelds) and smaller updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite, the Fedora-based version of Linux that's designed for the "next generation of Linux gaming" has a fresh release out with some great improvements, especially for gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo Legion Go, ASUS ROG Ally and others.</p>
<p><em>Also related: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/emudeck-team-announce-linux-powered-emudeck-machines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite is what's going to be used on the new EmuDeck Machines</a>.</em></p>
<p>Some of the biggest changes in Bazzite 3.7 include the option of keyboard-less installations, as it will give you a default username and password just so you can easily get it installed on handhelds. With a note that you should change your password as soon as possible once done. Additionally the installer has fixes for the Steam Deck OLED model.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2106990251725013121gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Lenovo Legion Go</em></p>
<p>Updates will also be smaller and faster now, they've updated to the NVIDIA 560 driver series, AMD Polaris is supported again as it will use an older Gamescope when detected, a new Linux kernel scheduler was added they say should "improve the speediness of navigating the user interface in Steam Gaming Mode and improve performance in minor ways in-game" plus there's various fixes for: Lenovo Legion Go, Ayaneo, ROG Ally and Ally X, support for the Minisforum V3 was added and much more.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-3-7-0-update-released/3726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release post</a>, with all the changes on <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/releases/tag/v3.7.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will get Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Saber Interactive have confirmed that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 will get full Steam Deck support, although not soon. The game is due to release September 9th.</p>
<p>In the most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4595447878567687876" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community update</a> they have an FAQ at the end that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will the game be playable on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>We are working on official Steam Deck support, but it's not ready yet. We’re currently targeting the end of the year for full Steam Deck support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great, because they also confirmed it will have Easy Anti-Cheat, so without their support with enabling it (as EAC is supported on Linux) it wouldn't work. This also means hopefully they will do plenty of performance tuning for the Steam Deck, which means it would run well on Desktop Linux too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5tqDxvpzsKM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6f2892fcffc6e1cab0b000a8b51f5d41.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5tqDxvpzsKM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully at least at launch the anti-cheat will be enabled, even if they haven't done the rest that's needed for full Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Additionally they confirmed there's no DRM (Denuvo or otherwise), it will have full PC and console cross-play, it will have DLSS2 / FSR2 at launch with later versions planned post-launch, </p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.2 adding a pop-up for donations, plus they want to make a next-generation KDE OS</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4490" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent change</a> was proposed last month to implement an on-by-default KDED (KDE Daemon) module that will gently ask you to donate to KDE as a pop-up on your notification system inside the KDE Plasma desktop, planned for version 6.2.</p>
<p>As per the merge request cited above and <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/08/28/asking-for-donations-in-plasma/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this blog post</a> from developer Nate Graham regarding the situation, we can find the following rationale behind this implementation: KDE usually ask through various social media posts, official channels and yearly fundraisers and blog posts which Graham noted you "may get the impression that we’re always begging for cash". However, if you're not a follower of those and just an average KDE (Plasma) user, you might never know that KDE (The Foundation) has these donations requests constantly being asked, or never know it could be in need of funding.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4600060731724954281gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4600060731724954281gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - The donation request in KDE Plasma, although the button has now been <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-workspace/-/merge_requests/4490#note_1011086" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a> to a less pushy "Donate" instead of "Donate Now".</em></p>
<p>With that in mind and the fact that other organizations already do this on a yearly basis (Thunderbird and Wikimedia for example), KDE decided to implement a KDED module that will ask for donations only <strong>once a year</strong> in Plasma 6.2+. While it may look <em>intrusive</em>, this is completely configurable for those which are packaging KDE so, it's up to each Linux distribution or users to disable it using the normal means of disabling KDED modules.</p>
<p>Something else to keep in mind is that they want to keep expanding too, they want to offer full-time employment to more people and hire more. On top of that, and quite exciting sounding, is that Graham noted in the blog post they eventually want to "fund the creation of a next-generation KDE OS we can offer directly to institutions looking to switch to Linux, and a hardware certification program to go along with it". Including (jokingly) they want to "take over the world" and get more distributions to use KDE Plasma by default.</p>
<p><strong>Editor's opinion:</strong> I think it is fair for KDE to expose that they need funding and asking that from inside the UI would not hurt for a software that delivered so much for free (as in freedom and as in "<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gratis" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gratis</a>"). It is not cluttered, and does not seem to break anyone's workflow.</p>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls Online now Steam Deck Playable, to be fully Verified in &#34;a future update&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Really great to see bigger developers actually start to properly take note of the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-shows-very-clearly-valve-are-selling-a-lot-of-steam-decks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since it's selling so well</a>. Now we have The Elder Scrolls Online from ZeniMax Online Studios and Bethesda Softworks getting improvements.</p>
<p>The thing is, the game has actually been playable as far back as June 2022. However, you did need to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/how-to-play-the-elder-scrolls-online-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some adjustments to get it to work</a> that I detailed but it seems this is no longer required. Thanks to this, Valve have now bumped it up to a Steam Deck Playable rating while using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/proton-9-0-2-brings-better-controller-support-in-launchers-more-playable-games-lots-of-bug-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-2</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15468591781724948189gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In their own <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/66641" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on this update the developers noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that <em>The Elder Scrolls Online </em>now has “Playable” status on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. This means that Steam <em>ESO</em> players can now venture into Tamriel’s Second Era using the portable PC gaming device. Never miss a Daily Login Reward again! </p>
<p>If you play on Steam and have a Steam Deck, simply find the game in your Library to begin the download. Note that while the game is now officially “Playable,” it won’t have full “Verified” status until a future update, meaning you might encounter some unexpected UI issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by their wording towards the end above, they plan to improve it further to get it Steam Deck Verified in future.</p>
<p>You can play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306130/The_Elder_Scrolls_Online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ESO from Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>EmuDeck team announce Linux-powered EmuDeck Machines</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind EmuDeck, a project that started off to provide easy emulation on Steam Deck / SteamOS have announced their own hardware with the Bazzite Linux powered EmuDeck Machines. <em>They're basically Steam Machines tailored more towards retro enthusiasts.</em></p>
<p>With a case that's very <em>obviously</em> inspired by the SEGA Dreamcast, the idea is to provide a great out of the box experience for modern emulation. Not just that though, since it's powered by Linux (specifically Bazzite), they have a platform for running other more modern games too. And a lot, thanks to Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20284749081724945544gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - EmuDeck Machines, Credit: EmuDeck team</em></p>
<p>As you can see on the front there's four USB ports, plus a power and reset switch. There's one USB-C port on the back, HDMI and it also has 2.5Gbps Ethernet too. Naturally EmuDeck comes pre-installed, so you'll get really easy access to emulation.</p>
<p>Shipping in two different versions with a low-powered and a much more capable unit.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>EM1:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intel N97</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
<li>512GB SSD</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>EM2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 8600G Overclocked</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
<li>512GB SSD</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You can also get them bundled with the Nova Lite Controller.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12541200251725011330gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Specs and expected performanced, Credit: EmuDeck team</em></p>
<p>Pricing starts around £277 for the EM1 and £512 for the EM2, although these are "Early Bird" prices so they will be higher at about £302 for the EM1 and £588 for the EM2 normally.</p>
<p>They're currently crowdfunding the effort on IndieGoGo. It's using a Flexible Goal, so they'll receive whatever funds are pledged rather than needing to hit a specific goal. This means they can produce as many as people pledge for.</p>
<p>On top of that, they're also planning a Docking Station, which you can use to bump up the power that will house an AMD Radeon 7600 Desktop card. They say the Dock will begin development once the campaign is finished.</p>
<p>Going by their timeline they provided the manufacturing would begin November with shipping planned for December 2024. While rather exciting and really fun to see more proper Linux-based hardware, it's worth noting this is still in the concept stage, and they have yet to prove themselves on hardware so it's on the pretty <em>risky</em> side.</p>

      <title>Stylish tactics-RPG &#39;Demonschool&#39; delayed until Q1 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necrosoft Games and Ysbryd Games have announced their stylish tactics RPG with hints of Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Italian horror cinema Demonschool has been delayed. Originally due out in September, they're no longer giving an exact date other than sometime in Q1 2025 (January - March).</p>
<p>More about it: "Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG where motion equals action. Defeat big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds as Faye and her misfit companions, while navigating university life on a mysterious island."</p>
<p>You can check out some gameplay below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6ei2Icsqcac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/49d9228963f541b873df7dee8dbe1da4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6ei2Icsqcac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the delay here's what Necrosoft Games said over email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You never want to delay a game, but Demonschool means a lot to us. We've really put everything we have into this project, and as we got closer to release we realized that meeting the Sept. 13th deadline would necessarily mean a game with less content than we originally envisioned.</p>
<p>After discussing with Ysbryd, we realized we have a couple of paths forward. We could:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ship the game in the state it’ll be in on Sept. 13. We’re proud of the game as it stands, but we want to make this world feel even livelier.</li>
<li>Ship the game in early 2025, which would allow us to manifest our bigger dreams into reality.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>We believe the second option would be better for everyone for everyone who has followed our work so far. So we are delaying the game to make sure it's as chock full of Things To Do as we had hoped. Realistically, the player would never have known. It still would've been a finished product. But we would have known that the game could have been more, and that's the game we want to share. Ysbryd gave us the flexibility to do this, which is very unusual for a publisher these days, and we’re thankful for the opportunity to do this right. Since we’ll be taking extra time, we plan to create short dev diaries up until launch to offer more insight into the work we have ahead. We hope you look forward to these deeper dives into our process. </p>
<p>We're sorry for those who are eagerly awaiting the game, but are very hopeful that all the extra content will be worth the wait. 2024 has been a very trying year for the team, so we appreciate your understanding.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo available on Steam</a> which continues to be updated and it has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Valve fixed resolution overrides for non-Steam games on Steam Deck plus more general Steam fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Beta release is out now for the Steam Client on both Desktop and Steam Deck. Here's the latest and what you need to know.</p>
<p>Since again this is a Steam Client update (not a SteamOS update) most of it applies to both Desktop and Steam Deck. Except the Steam Deck does have one specific nice bug-fix (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4590944278932981257?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed game resolution overrides failing to apply for non-steam games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This will be nice for those of you docking your Steam Deck while playing various non-Steam games from other launchers, emulators and more.</p>
<p>The rest of the changes (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4622469476327358756?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed screenshots copied to the clipboard displaying with swapped red and blue channels on windows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare bug that could cause the login page to continuously fail with "error 11" until the client was restarted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed copy to clipboard not working for screenshots and recordings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Output Icons to all Mode/Behavior dropdown menus. These indicate if the mode (by default) generates OS Mouse output, XInput (controller) Output, Steam Input API Action Output, or is a remapping tool/Overlay Menu (Touch, Radial, Hotbar).</li>
<li>Steam Input API Analog Actions that can have multiple modes i.e. "Camera | Camera as FlickStick" are now labelled as "... (via FlickStick)"</li>
<li>Steam Input API Analog Actions can now optionally be used "... (via Gyro To Mouse)" (default is still "As Mouse" or "As Joystick Mouse" depending on source).</li>
<li>Fix rare issue where Gyro Processing occurred before controller type is established.</li>
<li>Fix for Track Pad as Button Behavior not displaying any glyphs.</li>
<li>Fix "Gyro Calibration" Button appearing twice on Gyro config screen if there is a mode shift applied to the Gyro.</li>
</ul>

<p>I only discovered this as it advertises Linux support on Steam, but there <em>doesn't</em> actually seem to be a Linux version. So it's not clear what happened there. Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2199330/config/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, there doesn't seem to actually be anything for Linux. So most likely you'll need to force it to run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> where it will likely run well anyway. <strong>Update</strong>: the developer <a href="https://x.com/hooded_traveler/status/1829130881212031480" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> no actual Linux version so you do need Proton.</p>
<p>Available on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199330/Aestik/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam store</a>.</p>

      <title>Wine&#39;s Direct3D to Vulkan translation library vkd3d 1.13 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wine team have just release vkd3d version 1.13, an update for their own Direct3D to Vulkan translation library.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The noted highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic loop unrolling support in the HLSL compiler.</li>
<li>Effects compiler support for several version 4.0+ state objects.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just the main standout changes, there's lots of smaller changes too as they build it up. This will be bundled with the next release of Wine which will be Wine 9.17 which should be due out around the 6th of September.</p>
<p>All that's new can be seen in the <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/vkd3d/-/releases/vkd3d-1.13" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release post</a>.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with Valve's <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton</a> which was forked off from it a long time ago now. As explained before on this: Valve want things ready a lot faster, and with dedicated support for all the latest games in Proton. Valve are a lot more aggressive on getting all the newest possible stuff inside VKD3D-Proton. Meanwhile Wine directly has a much wider software target, including various applications (not just games).</p>

      <title>Frontline Crisis is a tough but engaging mix of tower defense and top-down shooting with a big mech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer BCQT released Frontline Crisis earlier in August, and like a lot of smaller games it seems to have flown under the radar but if you love tower defense and top down shooting you need to play this. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Made by one-person it's really impressive. You go through various levels, each being a small confined battlefield where you walk around in your big spider-mech. This mech does everything from mining to building to shooting. It's equal parts a tower defense game as it is a top-down shooter and it's pretty darn tough too. There's not often a lot of time to think and you'll be constantly on the move.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16849514431724866333gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>While your mech is powerful with its own weapons, the idea here is to get a few buildings down to face off against incoming waves of aliens. The problem is, your mech has to stay in place to mine resources, then move to a position where you can build which also keeps you still and defend everything you've built from the incoming onslaught.</p>
<p>You don't get a lot of space, which is what keeps you on your toes. You're not only limited by the screen space, since the maps are tiny, but by what "operators" you have picked. Each operator has a certain amount of space on the ground to allow you to build on, and during the pre-level setup you do a sort-of Tetris game of slotting them on the ground. And then after putting down the operators, you pick exactly what buildings will go where. So it's all about having a good pre-game plan here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6354048421724866292gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>You can upgrade your operators too, enabling you to unlock more squares to build on. Not only that you can also give them abilities like increasing the HP of buildings on their squares, the ability to rebuild, insure buildings to get credits back when destroyed and more.</p>
<p>It's <em>constantly</em> engaging your full attention. Do you go and grab some resources from your mining buildings? Or do you stand and fight while powering up a offensive tower you've placed down to speed up its fire rate? Maybe you want to hop over to a power-up building to dump some resources into it to power up your mech? You can't protect everything and can only do one thing at a time. It makes it pretty darn frantic really, and the design of it is just really clever.</p>
<p>With the different types of enemies you have to deal with, along with some insane boss battles, there's so much action going on it's a total delight. The bosses also aren't just big enemies walking slowly towards you. Each are properly formidable with different behaviours and attack patterns.</p>
<p>Naturally in a game like this as you progress through the levels you will get new items, towers and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L9CaDOAe1l8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/093ff6169df3f64d83343fb37ff7df1a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L9CaDOAe1l8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only are you an actual moving character on the battlefield, but you'll also be in charge in some missions of protecting certain buildings. If either are destroyed, you failed and when there's lots of aliens coming across the screen at you, it's really challenging. </p>
<p>It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and performs well with Proton 9. The only technical issue I saw was entering your name, as it minimized the game and required some alt-tabbing to realise it pulled up an extra external text-box to enter my name in. Bit weird, but otherwise great fun. Some of the text also needs another pass over it but mostly okay, some bits just need explaining better.</p>
<p>To top it all off, you can even play it in local co-op if you want. This will keep you entertained for many hours. Quite a surprise and definitely deserves a lot more attention.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3139620/Frontline_Crisis/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Clearly inspired by Advance Wars the turn-based infantry battler &#39;Warside&#39; gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you loved the classic Advance Wars and other more modern turn-based tactical battlers, you're probably going to love Warside. Currently in development by UK (London) based LAVABIRD, it's looking extremely promising.</p>
<p>Not only will it have a full single-player mode with more than thirty missions, it will also have local and online co-op missions. Plus the ability to take on friends and foes alike in local and online PvP.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_riZUqJGz-4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8c942fdb2a422285e50f07dce7c34cf0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_riZUqJGz-4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see Steam Deck noted directly in a trailer too, pretty cool, we don't see that often! They did previously confirm on their successful Kickstarter it would have Linux support so it's not surprising. It's also made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> which is great.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Forest, desert and snow biomes, plus the toxic wastelands.</li>
<li>Challenge friends and foes with multiplayer battles. Local and jnternet play are supported.</li>
<li>Design your own maps with the built-in mission editor for both single and multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More about it:</p>

      <title>Argonaut Games announced a return with a remaster of Croc Legend of the Gobbos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's quite a blast from the past. How do you feel about a little nostalgia? Argonaut Games announced a return with a remaster of Croc Legend of the Gobbos. Argonaut Games might be familiar for other games like perhaps Starglider, Star Fox and Alien Resurrection.</p>
<p>After releasing their last game in 2004, Argonaut are now making a big comeback. Not only with Croc Legend of the Gobbos but as a "boutique" publisher as well noting a planned slate of classic Argonaut IP and exciting original titles for both current and retro-gaming platforms.</p>
<p>See the Croc Legend of the Gobbos teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1lxQ4m_g21I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0ab4b2e23fa3eb9b60396bfe21e8837.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1lxQ4m_g21I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>Gary Sheinwald, Co-CEO of Argonaut Games, expressed his excitement about the future: “I worked closely with Jez on the design and production of Starglider, Argonaut’s first big hit back in 1986, so to take up the mantle of relaunching Argonaut Games nearly four decades later brings me full circle, and we have further exciting announcements in the pipeline in the coming months.”</p>
<p>“We wanted to honor the original game's legacy while introducing it to a new audience,” said Mike Arkin, Argonaut Games Co-CEO. “The HD remaster allows us to do just that. It’s been a labor of love for our team, and we can’t wait to share it with players on all the current consoles and PC later this year.”</p>
<p>The remaster will also include a special "Crocipedia" that will house an "extensive and meticulously curated digital museum containing long-lost development assets such as game design documents, concept art, animation tests, team member interviews, and much more".</p>
<p>Presumably it will be on Steam but they haven't revealed many other actual details yet.</p>

      <title>Cat Bait is another new take on the survivor-like genre about a cat running away from rats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another new take on what Vampire Survivors and Brotato made popular? Yep. Cat Bait is out now in Early Access and there's a demo available too.</p>
<p>Much like all the others there's plenty of randomness, and lots of running around collecting something (coins in this case) to upgrade abilities. However, the idea here is that you don't have any abilities directly. Instead, you hire helper cats that stand on top of the walls that use their abilities to help you dodge all the rats and other nasties out to get you. As the name suggests, you're just bait.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XkXBWgeOgZo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/248ed8903d8fd4c28162ec75f14e1ddb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XkXBWgeOgZo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique Helper Cats: Each helper has its own special abilities and characteristics. For example, summon the Druid Cat to slow down enemies with roots and deal periodic damage. And who said you can summon only one helper?</li>
<li>Upgrade System: Upgrade your helpers during each run. Increase damage, add more projectiles, and unlock other unique upgrades for each cat.</li>
<li>Meta-Progression: Collect coins from defeated enemies to upgrade your character and helper cats between runs, making each new attempt more powerful.</li>
<li>Skins and Abilities: Unlock new skins for the Cat Bait that not only change the appearance but also add new active abilities. For example, the standard skin allows repelling enemies.</li>
<li>Epic Bosses: Fight unique bosses, like the mouse rider on a rat. Each boss has its own set of moves and attacks, making each battle unpredictable.</li>
<li>Interesting Locations: Choose from various locations, each offering its own challenges and variety of enemies. Start with an empty character and choose your first helper cat to begin the adventure.</li>
<li>Session Gameplay: Short gaming sessions make it easy to jump in and out of the game, continuing from the same wave you stopped at.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, if you've played any of these single-stick arena fighting survival games, you'll generally know what to expect. It's only a small twist on it with the helper cat system, where you need to choose carefully and then keep upgrading the few you have to hopefully survive to progress.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2929730/Cat_Bait/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Chaosmonger Studio who previously released ENCODYA and Clunky Hero have now announced their completely over the top platformer-shooter Speedollama will release October 21st. In their email the developer noted it will have full Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Pulling in a big sprinkle of inspiration from classic titles like Metal Slug and Turrican, as well as modern hits like Broforce, Mercenary Kings, and Pizza Tower. If any of those types of games appeal to you, then get ready for some chaos it seems. Featuring vibrant pixel-art visuals that evoke the charm of retro arcades, while incorporating modern gameplay elements such as procedurally generated levels, chaotic humour, and gallons of pixelated blood.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EYFWldXi1bo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd730858a46150fd1b096d0db71db9a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EYFWldXi1bo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<li>Extremely fast-paced action for adrenaline-fueled fun.</li>

<p>From the developer: "I know the indie game market is crowded, with countless platformers being released every month. Standing out in that jungle is no easy task. But I believe Speedollama brings something truly unique to the table—it's fast, quirky, packed with animated details, and, above all, incredibly fun to play. I'm excited to take on the challenge and see how players react to this bizarre and entertaining experience!"</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era announced from the developer of Iratus: Lord of the Dead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Unfrozen who previously made Iratus: Lord of the Dead have teamed up with Ubisoft, and they recently announced the new Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era. One for fans of the classics!</p>
<p>Unfrozen's previous game did have Native Linux support, but since they're now working with Ubisoft I fully expect it to need to run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What's interesting here is that this is actually a prequel, and very much looks like a return to the roots of the gameplay. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7065674751724855345gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7065674751724855345gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it: "Heroes of Might &amp; Magic Olden Era is a new installment of the renowed series of turn-based strategy games, where action takes place in Enroth, on the continent of Jadame, mentioned but never explored in a Heroes of Might &amp; Magic game before. Traverse a vibrant and living fantasy world full of wonders and dangers, build magnificent capital cities, raise massive armies and clash in epic, highly tactical battles of heroes and mythical creatures.</p>
<p>Play solo with a new campaign, multiple single maps and limitless randomly generated scenarios, or engage in battle of wits and magic with other players — rivals or allies — in multiplayer mode. There is also an option to build your own story with the map editor tool, which you may make available to all the players around the world or keep to yourself."</p>

<p>It will enter Early Access in Q2 2025. You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105440/Heroes_of_Might__Magic_Olden_Era/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trese Brothers have kept up their ridiculous rate of updating Cyber Knights: Flashpoint during Early Access, steadily turning it into of of the best squad tactics RPGs.</p>
<p>What is it? A modern tactical RPG that blends elements of XCOM and similar games, with a big splash of Cyberpunk themes.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/4252047773027318019" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> is the "MAGNITUDE x2" update they said has effectively doubled the content available in the game, for the second time. This update has added in 2 new maps, 2 new objectives types and a total of 10 new map/objective combinations. The new mission types sound fun with one seeing you fight off a siege, and another sees you hunt down special items.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14102889241724854636gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14102889241724854636gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developers said now their procedural generation system has been boosted again to give more variety, they will be going back to make some more hand-crafted missions over the next couple of months. Nice to see it will have a decent mixture.</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough they dropped <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/4252047773029406551" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another</a> update (#132!) that added in a few new types of enemies, some of which use full-auto attacks that sound pretty menacing. Enemy scaling has been improved to keep it challenging, variety of enemy spawn combinations was improved and some bug fixes. With these updates together, it sounds like Cyber Knights: Flashpoint should have a pretty wide variety in everything now.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. Well worth a look.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck reaches over 16,000 playable and verified games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great milestone for the popular Steam Deck from Valve, which in the last day or so managed to hit over 16,000 games that have been rated as Playable and Verified.</p>
<p>This is using Valve's official rating system, so it only covers those games that have actually been tested. So keep in mind there's thousands more that do run. Not a perfect measure, with it at times having the wrong rating, but overall it's working well. Here's the current numbers at time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck Playable - 10,701</li>
<li>Steam Deck Verified - 5,318</li>
<li>Steam Deck Unsupported - 4,408</li>
</ul>
<p>Taken from <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> that shows unlisted games as well, since owners can continue to download and play them and Valve do rate them.</p>
<p>Some interesting fully Steam Deck Verified games rated over last month or so include:</p>

<p>There's still some major annoyances, namely EA with their newer EA anticheat which has repeatedly caused games to be entirely broken with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/battlefield-1-gets-ea-anticheat-in-september-will-be-left-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest being Battlefield 1</a>. And the number of developers with multiplayer games that just refuse to enable their anti-cheat. I really hope over the next year as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/black-myth-wukong-shows-very-clearly-valve-are-selling-a-lot-of-steam-decks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam Deck continues to sell really well</a> that developers will reconsider that.</p>
<p>What have you been enjoying the most on Steam Deck recently?</p>

      <title>Microsoft donates the Mono Project to the Wine team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is surprising isn't it? Microsoft are handing over the Mono Project to the Wine developers with a thank you note.</p>
<p>What is it? Mono is a software platform designed to allow developers to easily create cross platform applications. It is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime.</p>
<p>Posted on the <a href="https://www.mono-project.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mono website</a>, along with a <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono/issues/21796" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub post</a>, Microsoft's Jeff Schwartz announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mono Project (mono/mono)</a> (‘original mono’) has been an important part of the .NET ecosystem since it was launched in 2001. Microsoft became the steward of the Mono Project when it acquired Xamarin in 2016.</p>
<p>The last major release of the Mono Project was in July 2019, with minor patch releases since that time. The last patch release was February 2024.</p>
<p>We are happy to announce that the WineHQ organization will be taking over as the stewards of the Mono Project upstream at <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine-mono/mono" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wine-mono / Mono · GitLab (winehq.org)</a>. Source code in existing <a href="https://github.com/mono/mono" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mono/mono</a> and other repos will remain available, although repos may be archived. Binaries will remain available for up to four years.</p>
<p>Microsoft maintains a modern fork of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/main/src/mono" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mono runtime in the dotnet/runtime repo</a> and has been progressively moving workloads to that fork. That work is now complete, and we recommend that active Mono users and maintainers of Mono-based app frameworks migrate to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core" rel="noopener" target="_blank">.NET</a> which includes work from this fork.</p>
<p>We want to recognize that the Mono Project was the first .NET implementation on Android, iOS, Linux, and other operating systems. The Mono Project was a trailblazer for the .NET platform across many operating systems. It helped make cross-platform .NET a reality and enabled .NET in many new places and we appreciate the work of those who came before us.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the Mono developers!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only have Microsoft done a seemingly pretty good thing here, their acknowledgement of the Wine team and their work is also really nice to see.</p>

      <title>Battlefield 1 gets EA anticheat in September - will be left broken on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go once again, EA are about to completely break another game on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux and this time it's Battlefield 1. Originally released back in 2016, it still sees some pretty good player numbers on Steam hitting a concurrent player peak of 15,117 in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>In an official <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/eaac-and-battlefield" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a>, which was recently updated, it now states that Battlefield 1 is set to get the kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution <em>EA anticheat</em> in September. This follows on from Battlefield 2042, Battlefield V, EA SPORTS WRC and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 that all added it after release. It's also in their EA SPORTS FC series, with it originally first rolling out in FIFA 23 and has since expanded to include the others.</p>
<p>The big problem is, EA don't support Linux platforms at all with EA anticheat and so games using it won't work at all on Steam Deck or Desktop Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13134385071724781721gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>EA also recently did a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/ea-anticheat-safety" rel="noopener" target="_blank">separate post</a> on August 22nd talking about EA anticheat noting is has "prevented nearly five million attempts (and counting!) to cheat in EA anticheat-protected games" and they make it clear they plan to add EA anticheat into <em>more</em> titles across "FY25" (the 2025 financial year).</p>
<p>What this does is just highlight a problem with buying multiplayer games that aren't explicitly said to be supported on your platform. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> is incredible, it does enable tens of thousands of games to run on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, but in times like this EA can just write it off without a bother. How? Well, it's not EA selling it to you saying it's supported to run their Windows game it via Proton.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that Valve updated the Battlefield 1 Steam Deck rating from Playable to Unsupported 5 days ago. Still, no refunds will come for those who are outside the normal Steam refund policies, even if your primary way to play is a Linux-based platform and that stings to just have a broken game.</p>
<p>At this point, it's probably only a matter of time until Apex Legends gets EA anticheat. That one will really be a big issue, since it's one of the most popular games on Steam.</p>
<p>It's an interesting contrast with BioWare's Dragon Age: The Veilguard that EA publish, which is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-steam-deck-verified-well-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified</a> ahead of release with the developers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/dragon-age-the-veilguard-devs-talk-up-their-pc-features-optimisations-and-steam-deck-verification/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repeatedly mentioning</a> it. But hey, it's not a multiplayer game.</p>

      <title>Black Myth: Wukong shows very clearly Valve are selling a lot of Steam Decks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve don't exactly like to give out sales numbers, so we often have to make educated guesses but sometimes with huge hits like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, it gives us a slightly clearer idea on how the Steam Deck is actually selling.</p>
<p>For a while I've been tracking the top sellers lists on Steam to see where the Steam Deck ranks. It's important for us especially that it does well, since it's a Linux device (SteamOS) flowing out into the hands of the public. And masses of improvements there benefit Linux gaming as a whole from driver improvements to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> upgrades.</p>
<p>The thing is, the top sellers lists on Steam go by <em>revenue</em>, not units sold. The Steam Deck costs (in comparison) a <em>lot more</em> compared to games so naturally it will rank quite high anyway most of the time. But, here's where the fun begins. Black Myth: Wukong is a <strong>huge</strong> hit, a truly massive seller. According to the official X/Twitter <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">account</a>, by August 23rd it had hit already 10 million sales across all platforms. Right now another 4 days later, both <a href="https://vginsights.com/game/2358720" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VG Insights</a> and <a href="https://gamalytic.com/game/2358720" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamalytic</a> put it somewhere around 14 million sold <em>just</em> on Steam.</p>
<p>When you look at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2024-8-20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">global top seller list</a> on Steam right now, removing free to play titles so just those you have to pay for you end up with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Steam Deck</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>All three of those games will be selling a lot and the cheapest of them (Black Myth: Wukong) is £49.99. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 for example, is currently the second most-wishlisted game on Steam while also being a top seller on pre-orders. So, this shows pretty darn well in no uncertain terms, that the Steam Deck from Valve is also clearly selling a lot of units too right? Probably quite a few more than a lot of people thought. Likely even more than I thought recently too. Keep in mind that by November last year, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-global-top-seller-again-thanks-to-cheaper-lcds-and-the-steam-deck-oled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve said</a> the Steam Deck had already sold "multiple millions".</p>
<p>Perhaps no surprise then when we see developers getting their games Steam Deck Verified well ahead of release, like the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-steam-deck-verified-well-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.</p>
<p>So then, how about Fortnite on Linux / Steam Deck? Epic Games CEO <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/fortnite-on-linux-steam-deck-not-until-tens-of-millions-of-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tim Sweeney said</a> when it hits "tens of millions of users" that it "would actually make sense to support it". We must be pretty close by now right? Why ignore a platform that's sold multiple millions, and is clearly just continuing to fly off the shelves?</p>
<p>But, another thing, this also goes to show that Valve are likely in no rush at all on a Steam Deck 2. They simply don't need to do one right now. Also shows why Valve continue to roll out new Steam Deck features on Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-made-it-even-easier-to-see-who-played-on-steam-deck-in-user-reviews/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like the reviews filter</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/valve-has-a-new-steam-chart-for-the-most-played-steam-deck-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most played games chart</a> and why there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-confirm-plan-to-get-steam-decks-steamos-on-the-rog-ally-and-more-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">no rush to get SteamOS on other devices</a>.</p>

      <title>Judero is a strikingly odd looking stop-motion styled action-adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set to arrive on September 16, Judero is just something you have to see. An action/ adventure game inspired by the rich folk history of the Scottish Borders but it's really the style and animation that's really something.</p>
<p>As the developers explained it's "made from handcrafted objects and bespoke figurines, animated in the stop-motion tradition". For them they said the art style "invokes something nostalgic; in part comical but perhaps a little bit creepy too" and with the real-life models then rendered into a 3D world, it gives a real unique flavour to it while also giving it some flair like real-time lighting, shaders and post-processing effects while the cut-scenes use traditional stop-motion animation techniques and are much more cinematic.</p>
<p>Together you get something that's just seriously weird and quirky.</p>
<p>Have a look in the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fL_Xta4i0Xo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bffb62609a0069958ae01770ca8b43da.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fL_Xta4i0Xo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast and Fluid Combat. Strike, and dodge your way through a myriad of foes culminating in exciting and unique boss challenges.</li>
<li>Possess Enemies. Take on the form of lesser creatures to greatly expand your abilities. Use these enchanted minions in combat and to solve puzzles.</li>
<li>A Rich Text System. Discover the world of Judero through branching dialogues and pithy, aphoristic NPCs.</li>
<li>Mini Games. Through your adventures you will encounter a number of diverse Mini Games with differing mechanics and visual styles. Mini games also vary the pace of the game and allow us to explore other narrative tangents.</li>
<li>Rewarding Exploration. There are many secrets and discoveries to find as you roam through the world of Judero. From collectables and pick-ups to whole optional story-lines and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1960900/Judero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and it appears it will have Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Neva from the GRIS devs looks gorgeous, it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified and releases October 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nomada Studio are back. After releasing GRIS in 2018 to Overwhelmingly Positive reviews, their next game is Neva and it also looks bloody gorgeous.</p>

      <title>Cozy mining adventure Core Keeper 1.0 is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper is a lovely cozy underground mining adventure game from developer Pugstorm, that impressed me a lot during Early Access and now it's hit the big 1.0. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>Popular too with it hitting over 2 million sales during Early Access. Playable alone or in co-op, it's a total delight. If you enjoy games like Terraria, you'll probably like this one quite a lot too.</p>
<p>Explore diverse biomes, level up your skills, encounter the Cavelings, and defeat legendary Titans to unveil the power of the Core. Grow your garden, fish in mysterious waters, master recipes, hatch pets, drive vehicles, fight rival explorers in online PvP, and carve out your own unique adventure alone or with friends in an enchanting sandbox adventure.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Nkrcs0367Hc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/728a1027bc3f488df8be274eec9ddc39.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Nkrcs0367Hc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “After an incredible time in Early Access, we are thrilled to bring Core Keeper to console and launch into 1.0 today,” said Fredrik Präntare, Chief Executive Officer &amp; Game Director at Pugstorm. “We have been overjoyed to see all the love and support players have shown for the game over the last couple of years, with over 2 million players already. We can’t wait for new players to begin their underground adventure today, and to continue this experience alongside them.”</p>
<p>As for what's new in the 1.0 release? Well, a lot actually. The Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4247544173389770568" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> are long including new bosses, new world generation, new combat play-styles, optional PvP, lots of new equipment to find, new weapons and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria arrives on Steam with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Dwarves dug deep and broke out of the Epic Games Store, as The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria has released on Steam. Originally released back in October 2023 as an Epic Exclusive.</p>
<p>Free Range Games mentioned in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/4241914673865774571" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> that they've been working on getting Steam Deck Verified, and while there's no current status given to it from Valve they made it clear the "experience will feel good on the Steam Deck on launch day". Noting features like the full controller support along with the in-game keyboard being hooked up, smooth performance, the correct resolution is set, fonts should look good and so on. However, they did say there's "more improvements coming" for Steam Deck too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6614593211724771492gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Once again, it's great to see more developers doing proper testing to ensure compatibility! Steam Deck testing with SteamOS will mean it works well for desktop Linux users too since both use the same <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to run Windows games.</p>
<p>From the press release: “We are ecstatic to bring The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria to Steam and Xbox, providing the opportunity for a whole new audience to delve into the Mines of Moria," said John Miller, CEO, North Beach Games. "With the addition of all of the new features and content in The Golden Update, Return to Moria delivers the deepest look yet at a survival-crafting experience based on The Lord of the Rings, and we cannot wait to hear what players think.”</p>
<p>“The development team has put in so much work since we first launched in October 2023 and we’re really proud of how far the game has come,” said Jon-Paul Dumont, Game Director, Free Range Games. “From Crossplay to Sandbox mode, to all the new content and improvements based on player feedback, we’re more excited than ever for fans to play Return to Moria.”</p>

      <title>Wii U emulator Cemu 2.1 out now with AppImage and Flatpak support for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After going <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/wii-u-emulator-cemu-20-out-goes-open-source-and-gets-linux-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source back in mid 2022</a>, the Wii U emulator Cemu started providing experimental builds with Linux support and now it's out proper with the new Cemu 2.1 release.</p>
<p>Released late yesterday there's a lot of big improvements in this new release, that really advances Wii U emulation. This release brings together the 93 experimental releases since Cemu 2.0, they said to think of this like "the final experimental update". Basically, they're saying it's now properly ready for everyone to try out.</p>
<p>Major new additions include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added appimage and flatpak releases for Linux.</li>
<li>Added an experimental release for macOS. Available for x86-64 only for now but it can be run on ARM macs through Rosetta 2 emulation. MoltenVK is used as the graphics backend.</li>
<li>Added a tool to emulate the USB portals for Skylanders and Disney Infinity.</li>
<li>Added NFC/NTAG support. Pokemon Rumble U figures can now be scanned from a file similar to the existing Amiibo scanning.</li>
<li>Added support for titles stored in <code class="inline-code">.wuhb</code> (Wii U homebrew) and <code class="inline-code">.app</code> (NUS) format.</li>
<li>Added support for connecting to <a href="https://pretendo.network/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pretendo</a> network services.</li>
<li>Cemu on Windows is now non-portable by default for <ins>new installations only</ins>. All data and config files will be stored in <code class="inline-code">%appdata%/Cemu</code>. This makes the Windows installation match other platforms. Existing installations will not be affected.</li>
<li>Added portable mode by placing a directory named <code class="inline-code">portable</code> next to the Cemu executable. Cemu will then store data and config files in this folder. This works on all platforms.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And for those interested in the Linux improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added wayland support.</li>
<li>Added support for storing MLC and game files on case-sensitive filesystems.</li>
<li>Added an option to enable <a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameMode</a>.</li>
<li>Brought online features on a par with Windows builds.</li>
<li>Enabled DSU controller support.</li>
<li>Emulated games can now access HID devices from the host via libusb (e.g. Skylanders portal).</li>
<li>Many changes to improve robustness of the Linux build.</li>
<li>Added debug option to create core dumps on crash.</li>
<li>Improved diagnostics logging in case of crashes or other exceptions. Cemu is now also shipped with symbols so that stack traces show function names.</li>
<li>The CPU and memory statistics in the overlay now work on Linux.</li>
<li>The background colors of the Game List now match the brightness of the window theme instead of always using bright colors.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where closing the GamePad window would freeze Cemu.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the GamePad window would not render anything with OpenGL.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some UI dialogs would cause Cemu to crash after closing them.</li>
<li>Fixed many smaller UI issues specific to WxWidget's wxGTK backend.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also numerous improvements to their OpenGL and Vulkan renderers, lots of upgrades to the input system, fixes to online play support and much much more.</p>
<p>Incredible work by many different coders.</p>

      <title>Resident Evil 2 makes a return to GOG with lots of improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After re-releasing the first <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil</a>, GOG have now done the same for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 2</a>, getting a load of improvements in along the way. They haven't yet given a date on when <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 3 </a>will land other than "soon" but that will also come with similar improvements.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5193555761724760335gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>All the improvements in this version:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 11.</li>
<li>6 localizations of the game included (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese).</li>
<li>Improved DirectX game renderer.</li>
<li>New rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling and more).</li>
<li>Improved audio volume and panning.</li>
<li>Improved cutscenes and subtitles.</li>
<li>Improved savegame manager.</li>
<li>Improved game video player.</li>
<li>Issue-less game exit.</li>
<li>Improved game registry settings.</li>
<li>Improved key-binding settings and audio settings screens.</li>
<li>Improved end credits in the German version.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with Rooms 114 and 115 (missing text), Room 210 (invisible diary), and Room 409 (looping sound).</li>
<li>Full support for modern controllers (Sony DualSense, Sony DualShock4, Microsoft Xbox Series, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, Logitech F series and many more) with optimal button binding regardless of the hardware and wireless mode.</li>
<li>4th Survivor and Tofu modes enabled from the very beginning.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's a classic Windows game you'll need Wine / Proton to play it. Easy enough thanks to the Heroic Games Launcher which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/heroic-games-launcher-v215-has-expanded-gog-support-ea-games-from-epic-store-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">only recently had some big GOG improvements</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget there's also a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/claim-a-free-copy-of-tropico-4-on-gog-during-their-back-to-school-sale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big GOG sale now on</a>.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve may need this quick-fix on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Depending on your Linux distribution, you may need a small fix to get Valve's new game Deadlock to work properly. So here's what you need to know. Currently the game does not have a Native Linux version, so you need to run it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> and it runs pretty well. <em>It's also invite-only, so find a friend somewhere to invite you.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7979730991724758718gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7979730991724758718gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you find the game crashes when connecting to a server or otherwise, you likely need to raise your "vm.max_map_count". Yes, it strikes again. Many Windows games via Wine / Proton need a higher vm.max_map_count than some Linux distributions ship with out of the box.</p>
<p>You can find what yours currently is with this terminal command:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">cat /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count</code></p>
<p>To set it temporarily higher you can do this in terminal:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=1048576</code></p>
<p>That above is the newer default that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/ubuntu-2404-increases-vm-max-map-count-for-smoother-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>, Fedora and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/arch-linux-changes-vmmax-map-count-to-match-fedora-ubuntu-for-better-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arch Linux</a> were updated with. Previously many distributions had it quite low at 65530.</p>
<p>For a permanent change you can edit the "/etc/sysctl.conf" file or "/etc/sysctl.d" depending on your distribution, add "vm.max_map_count=1048576" to the bottom and then run:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -p</code></p>
<p>Which should keep the change.</p>

      <title>Mysterious narrative first-person climbing platformer Lorn&#39;s Lure release date announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for something a bit different? Lorn's Lure is a 3D atmospheric narrative first-person parkour platformer with an interesting climbing system. The developer recently revealed that it's going to release on September 20th.</p>
<p>More: "Leaving his home colony while tracking a mysterious glitch, an android finds himself in the midst of a vast and dangerous structure, completely hidden from his people's knowledge. Unable to go back, you must keep going to find out where he is being led... And why he left in the first place."</p>
<p>I also missed that it had a new demo update back at the end of July which is still up now, so it's worth a look. Check out the release date trailer below:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Odd Bug Studio have revealed that Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter will be releasing in February 2025 and there's a brand new trailer. I'm really excited for this one, the artwork is gorgeous. It was originally planned for later this year but they said the new date "ensures we can provide the very best experience possible".</p>
<p>As for the new trailer it shows off some fresh gameplay that showcases " Arlo’s brutal journey of survival and revenge" and that the "Viking-esque aesthetic of this new story is emphasized by Fever Ray’s haunting 2008 track, ‘If I Had a Heart’ – we think it’s a fitting accompaniment to the harsh and unforgiving world Arlo must navigate through in the game".</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sg5FBayiuWc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/980dfcf1a15942fc3cc68731f8120235.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sg5FBayiuWc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Set in the aftermath of the original game’s southern war between Rat and Frog, Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter builds upon its predecessor’s foundations, introducing all-new monster hunting against the gigantic beats of the North, while also elevating the franchise’s critically-acclaimed combat system with a number of new gameplay features. Also returning to the series are the distinctive, gruff tones of multi-award-winning voice actor, Doug Cockle (The Witcher 3, Baldur’s Gate 3, Alan Wake 2) who once again narrates Arlo’s campaign of bloody revenge."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore a vast and treacherous, snow-ravaged kingdom.</li>
<li>Master brutal soulslike combat, with dodge-rolls, parry bashes, and gruesome executions!</li>

      <title>Bungie retro FPS Marathon Infinity now on Steam, whole trilogy get Steam Workshop support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Aleph One developers have now put all three of Bungie's (Halo / Destiny) classic FPS series on Steam with Classic Marathon Infinity now available free.</p>
<p>Not only that, all three now also have Steam Workshop support with the update to the <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aleph One</a> open source game engine that powers all three games. The developers are still choosing not to put up the Native Linux versions though, so you'll either need to set them to use Proton, or if you do wish to run them with Linux builds there's <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18352630281724694454gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18352630281724694454gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I tested the game working nicely direct from Steam with Proton 9.</p>
<p>More about Marathon Infinity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marathon Infinity takes the closed universe of the Marathon series and blows it wide open. The solo/co-op campaign, “Blood Tides of Lh’owon,” is a 20-level scenario sporting new textures, weapons, and enemies. More than that, the scenario sheds a surprising new light on the story’s characters and the meaning of events. Having defeated the Pfhor and reawakened the ancient remnants of the S’pht, the player now faces a world where friends become enemies and all is not what it seems…<br/>
<br/>
This classic 1996 Bungie™ FPS is now maintained by the fan community. Experience authentic game play using the original data files, with optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60+ fps interpolation, just in case the original is <em>too</em> authentic.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve has very quickly risen up the most played list on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite still being invite-only and only having the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/deadlock-from-valve-no-longer-a-secret-store-page-is-up-and-we-can-finally-talk-about-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">softest of announcements possible</a>, Deadlock from Valve has seen its player count rise sharply.</p>
<p>Since the lifting of public discussion restrictions on it the player count has gone from around 30,000 to a peak of 89,203. This means it has been seeing more players than Team Fortress 2, DayZ, Dead by Daylight, Overwatch 2 and other multiplayer games. At time of writing it's number 14 on the most played list.</p>
<p>Not surprising though is it? It's a <em>new</em> Valve game, <em>obviously</em> there was going to be immense hype around it. This is basically like saying "water is wet", but hey it's a new Valve game that <em>some</em> of you can actually play, right now. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>I'm currently just cracking-up at the background info for some of the heroes like Lash who "is an asshole", and that's literally all we're given about them. Yes, this is really what Valve put in the game. Perfect, no notes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18288929021724692891gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18288929021724692891gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>But there's also Yamato, who doesn't speak English, and so their background isn't either:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126971541724692892gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126971541724692892gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve developers also confirmed recently in the Deadlock Discord server that they're currently working on "larger anti-cheat systems" for the game too.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. Currently on Linux you need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to play it.</p>

      <title>GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin getting an official Flatpak for Linux and Steam Deck </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Emulation fans might like this! The GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin, is going to finally get an official package for Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This will come thanks to Flatpak and be available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. It's actually <em>already</em> available, but was originally done by the community. However, one of the Dolphin developers <a href="https://github.com/flathub/org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu/issues/224" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> onto the GitHub page for the Flathub package about actually making it properly official.</p>
<p>As developer "OatmealDome" explained a few weeks ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the past 8 years, the Dolphin project has chosen not to create any official builds for Linux, instead opting to relegate that task to the distributions. However, with the rise of the Steam Deck, we've observed significant user demand for an official Flatpak version of Dolphin. As this unofficial Flatpak is being used by many people already, we think that collaborating with you and making this Flatpak official would be the best way to approach this. Is this something that everyone is interested in doing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The work towards it is ongoing, but it's looking very positive with the Dolphin project making code <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/pull/10556" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> to prepare for it, and the GitHub repository for the Flathub package being <a href="https://github.com/flathub/flathub/issues/5511" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moved</a> over to their control. So soon, the Flathub page should switch over to note it's official.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Well, it's like downloading and installing anything; you have the peace of mind to know that not only is it safe but actually maintained by the original developers and supported.</p>
<p>Nice to see the Steam Deck continuing to have a positive impact for Linux users everywhere. Valve clearly made the right decision to support installing apps via Flatpak/Flathub.</p>

      <title>Steam sets a new record with 37.2 million concurrent users online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Only a few months after Steam first hit 36 million, the record has been broken again this year with Steam remaining the champion for PC gamers.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, yesterday saw 37,266,324 concurrent users online with 12,534,703 actually in-game. Looking back through the history that makes it the 4th time this year that the record has been broken. We saw Steam hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-smashes-its-peak-players-online-record-to-over-34-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">34</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-broke-another-record-with-over-35-million-people-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">35</a> and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-breaking-records-again-hitting-over-36-million-players-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">36</a> million all in a single month back in March so it took a bit longer this time.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Around the time Steam hit the new record the top games were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG</li>
<li>Banana</li>
</ul>
<p>It's pretty clear that Black Myth: Wukong is really pushing the numbers there, itself hitting a peak concurrent player count of 2,068,291 in the last 24 hours and an all-time peak of 2,415,714 only 4 days ago. So it's doing really well, and has managed to become the second most-played game on Steam of all time just under PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS as per <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Randy Pitchford of Gearbox <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1117077275680264193" rel="noopener" target="_blank">predicted</a> in a post on X/Twitter, that Steam "may look like a dying store":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="From a track record point of view, my expectation is that Epic’s investment in technology will outpace Valve’s substantially. When we look back at Steam in five or ten years, it may look like a dying store and other, competitive stores, will be the place to be. The competitive store that happens to be the leader in 10 years may not be Epic’s store, but it probably won’t be Valve’s and Epic’s moves right now are opening the door and paving the way for a vibrant competitive economy." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19034512071724689714gol1.png"/></p>
<p><em>I think it's pretty safe to say that's not going to happen. </em></p>
<p>Worth noting Pitchford did follow that post up <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826261635389882574" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently</a> when poked about Borderlands 4 coming to Steam:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Yeah, Steam is the leading store for PC games and Epic is not pressing their advantage (which is a shame). I’m a Steam customer, but sure wish they had more and better competition that was more favorable to artists, designers, and creators than to the retailer. I will continue to support competitors to Steam and also support Steam." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/542935941724690284gol1.png"/></p>

      <title>Valve made it even easier to see who played on Steam Deck in user reviews</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-now-shows-who-played-mostly-on-steam-deck-in-user-reviews/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Just recently I reported</a> on Valve adding a new feature to Steam user reviews, showing off who played mostly on Steam Deck and now they've made this even easier.</p>
<p>Being able to see who mostly played on Steam Deck is great, as both an additional advert for the Steam Deck and to help potential buyers see if a particular game is worth picking up. My suggestion in the previous article was that "Valve just need to add a filter to show only Steam Deck reviews" and you'll never guess what — they did exactly that.</p>
<p>Now when you scroll down to user reviews on Steam and look inside the Playtime hover-menu, there's a specific option to show those who played mostly on Steam Deck (this is for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ELDEN RING</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/313404311724503080gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That way if you're playing primarily on Steam Deck, you can choose to see only those types of reviews if you want to.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the previous update that added the Steam Deck icon to reviews allows you to hover over the icon to see how many hours detected were played on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve no longer a secret - store page is up and we can finally talk about it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deadlock, perhaps the <em>worst</em> kept secret from Valve, has now been <em>softly</em> revealed as the latest game from the maker of Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Portal and Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7194375701724500622gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7194375701724500622gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even before it was officially announced, it managed to pull in over 44,000 concurrent players during their secret (but not very) invite-only play-testing. We know this thanks to public data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which tracks everything on Steam, and Deadlock itself has been on there for quite some time before being announced.</p>
<p>Technically, Valve haven't <em>really</em> announced it yet. They made a store page, which is incredibly light on details, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/deadlock-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch</a> category, and they have posted in their official Discord to note people can now talk publicly about it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="We are lifting the rules for public conversation about Deadlock to allow for things like streaming, community websites and discussions.  Nothing else is changing with our state of development. We are remaining invite-only and continue to be in an early development stage with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13742207061724499268gol1.png"/></p>
<p><em>Since it's still invite-only, you'll have to find someone who has access.</em></p>
<p>Previously, the game would give you a warning when you first load in, asking you clearly not to share details publicly, which some (hi <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) decided to ignore. This has now been replaced with a simple reminder that it's in early development and feedback is welcome.</p>
<p>So <em>what</em> is it? Well, that’s a little complicated to answer. But, I did have access pretty early thanks to an invite so my best attempt at a simple explanation: it takes the lanes, towers and AI creeps gameplay from Dota 2 and turns it into a third-person hero shooter with rails in the air you can jump on to travel across the map quickly. It’s definitely peculiar and much like Dota 2, it’s easy enough to get into but really takes a good while to learn properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10909323371724500620gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10909323371724500620gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With its two 6 on 6 teams, each team fights across defined lanes in the map that have guardians at specific points you need to destroy. You push through each lane with the help of your teammates and your AI creeps. Gradually, you push the enemy team back by taking down different types of guardians to eventually make it into the enemy base. Inside the enemy base you take down their Patron, which is like a multi-stage boss battle, while also trying not to die from the enemy team madly firing off every single ability they have at you.</p>
<p>You’re not forced into any particular lane though, you can run or rail across the map and go wherever you like. It’s a team game after all, but leaving a lane empty is of course not a good idea. The rail system definitely adds a nice spin to it, letting you quickly zip across the map from your base. You can get a fast speed-boost from it too, but once used it goes into a cooldown. Additionally, the rails for you only work in your territory, so once you push past an enemy guardian, your team's active rail length will expand.</p>
<p>It has a pretty fun character movement system too where you can dash, double-jump, mantle over things and slide too. So it's reasonably fast paced, especially during combat between players when you're all jumping around trying to avoid all the abilities going off.</p>
<p>There’s quite a number of characters already, all with their own set of abilities, much like Dota 2 or any of the various hero shooters out there. So learning it can be quite overwhelming initially, as you not only need to learn your abilities, but how to deal with whatever characters the opposing team picks. Thankfully, a good few of the characters are super-simple to play as.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16027965131724499688gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16027965131724499688gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just the characters though, you also need to keep upgrading as you go through a match and learn what works best for each character. And here's where it's once again like Dota 2. You have to earn a currency, souls, and then run along to a shop to buy up character upgrades. Thankfully, there's a suggested build system you can follow and anyone can make one and publish it for you to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10215610311724500862gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10215610311724500862gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18823123341724502223gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18823123341724502223gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve seem to be learning a clear lesson from the failure of Artifact here, building it up gradually with a growing community and tweaking it constantly based on player feedback. The secrecy around it, along with the invite system, has attracted a lot of attention and even though it's been leaked <em>constantly</em>, this plays quite well for free advertising for Valve.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens with it when Valve open it up fully. Will it have the staying power of other popular Valve games? Will it end up eating away at the numbers of CS2, Dota 2, TF2 and others? Who knows. It's a weird one, but it can be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Currently, there's no Native Linux version, but I can confirm it works really nicely on Desktop with Proton. I have yet to try it on Steam Deck but will soon.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a global resolution override in latest Beta, plus more desktop Steam fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a couple more Steam Beta Client releases recently for both Steam Deck and Desktop so here's all you need to know.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> side, you may be pleased to see that Valve has now added a global game resolution override feature to the display settings page. Available in Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Advanced, here you can set the maximum resolution allowed to be used by games. This feature technically isn't new, since it was available per-game already, but having it global is great for those who play a lot docked and want everything to be available at a higher resolution.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6847346651724499864gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6847346651724499864gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>

<hr/>
<p>While over on <strong>Steam Desktop</strong> a lot of the changes are the same, but there's a couple of differences.

      <title>Wine 9.16 released with more Wayland work and an initial Driver Store implementation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine 9.16</a> development release is now available for this compatibility layer to run Windows apps and games on Linux. Here's all that's changed. Reminder: Wine is a huge part of what makes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> able to do its thing so you can play lots of games on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial Driver Store implementation.</li>
<li>Pbuffer support in the Wayland driver.</li>
<li>More prototype objects in MSHTML.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those curious about this Driver Store looking it up on Microsoft's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> they explain it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with Windows Vista, the Driver Store is a trusted collection of inbox and third-party <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-packages" rel="noopener" target="_blank">driver packages</a>. The operating system maintains this collection in a secure location on the local hard disk. Only the driver packages in the Driver Store can be installed on a device.</p>
<p>When a driver package is copied to the Driver Store, all of its files are copied. This includes the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/overview-of-inf-files" rel="noopener" target="_blank">INF file</a> and all files that are referenced by the INF file. All files that are in the driver package are considered critical to the device installation. The INF file must reference all of the required files for device installation so that they are present in the Driver Store. If the INF file references a file that is not included in the driver package, the driver package is not copied to the store.</p>
<p>The process of copying a driver package to the Driver Store is called <em>staging</em>. A driver package must be <em>staged</em> to the Driver Store before the package can be used to install any devices. As a result, driver staging and device installation are separate operations.</p>
<p>A driver package is staged to the Driver Store by being verified and validated.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver with Linux kernel 6.10 causing kernel oops</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA is currently investigating a bug where their drivers are crashing on modern kernels (6.10+). This appears to happen across drivers 550, 555 and even the latest 560.</p>
<p>From the troubleshooting data that can be found on the NVIDIA forums and the crashes I'm facing myself, this seems to be a regression that started with Linux kernel 6.10 and it affects users when suspension mechanism is triggered or some application is processing 3D. It affects both the closed and open NVIDIA drivers.</p>
<p>This happened on my computer recently, and it is really annoying. Example log:</p>

      <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard devs talk up their PC features, optimisations and Steam Deck verification</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BioWare and Electronic Arts are gearing up for the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard on October 31st and they've revealed a whole bunch of details about the PC release.</p>
<p>We already saw before that it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-steam-deck-verified-well-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">became Steam Deck Verified</a>, clearly showing plenty of early testing has been done there. So it should be looking good on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> thanks to that too.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/6302310962453571761" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> the developers mentioned how PCs made up "40% of our platform testing effort, with over 200,000 hours of performance and compatibility testing", so with that in mind, I'm expecting some pretty good things from this since they "created a dedicated team to focus on PC". Then again, you would generally expect that sort of thing from a big game getting a PC release. And, as already confirmed before, no EA App is needed - so Steam Deck / Linux players won't have to deal with launcher breakage constantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9192046611724335396gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The good news continues with the controls and UI being nicely tweaked for keyboard / mouse and controller, with seamless transitions between control types. They even implemented character class-specific keybinds, so you can customize per character which sounds interesting.</p>
<p>And they gave a nice big list of all the settings available:</p>

<p>I'm curious to see how well this one runs, especially on Steam Deck where the Verified rating at times still has games dropping below 30FPS. I really do hope this is nicely optimized.</p>

      <title>Genki reveal a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer is in the works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Genki are returning to their racing roots with a brand new Tokyo Xtreme Racer in the works, due out for release sometime in 2025. The first series title in 18 years, no doubt fans of the classic Genki racers will be happy about this, especially as it's coming to Steam too so you'll be able to play it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Their teaser was brief and didn't really show anything:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sEhzyVcUCCM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/199d51036535b9ad8aae0df6b25a0afd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sEhzyVcUCCM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their Steam page was also light on any actual details too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tokyo Xtreme Racer" is a racing game set in a sealed-off future Tokyo, where you compete for the fastest speed in your customized cars on the highways that weave through the city, aiming to reach the top.<br/>
<br/>
Drive real cars on meticulously recreated courses, compete against powerful rivals,<br/>
slip through other cars, and engage in spirit-wracking battles.<br/>
This is a series with unparalleled appeal.<br/>
<br/>
A new title, "Tokyo Xtreme Racer" now in development<br/>
please look forward to the release of more information.</p>

      <title>Steam now shows who played mostly on Steam Deck in user reviews</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 22/08/24 17:40 UTC</strong>: Valve has now actually <a href="https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1826673475119186082" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> this change.</p>
<hr/>
<p>While I can't find anywhere that Valve actually announced this, they've done another tweak to the user review system on Steam to show who primarily played on Steam Deck. This follows on from the recent user review update that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-attempts-to-deal-with-jokes-memes-and-ascii-art-reviews-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attempted to deal with jokes, memes and ASCII art</a>.</p>
<p>Just another way for Valve to advertise their Steam Deck in a neat way, and importantly for potential buyers to see who is <em>really</em> playing on Steam Deck. It's a good way to gauge if a game is truly worth a purchase for you, if you're also primarily a Steam Decker.</p>
<p>When you look over various user reviews on Steam, you might now spot a Steam Deck icon, the same one that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/steam-will-now-show-you-who-is-playing-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added to the friends list recently</a> to show who is currently online on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As some examples here's one from the excellent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Selaco</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14668991371724327903gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And another from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DAVE THE DIVER</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/266177871724328096gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/266177871724328096gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This might even push more Steam Deck players to make a review, just to show off how many hours they've put into a game. Which can then help push even more game sales, and perhaps more Steam Deck sales too.</p>
<p>Now Valve just need to add a filter to show only Steam Deck reviews, and it should work quite nicely.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>#DRIVE Rally is an arcade-inspired rally-driving experience set in the golden racing era of the ‘90s, and now there's a new trailer along with a confirmed release date for Early Access of September 25th. It's also going to have Native Linux support too, and should work great on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>D.O.T. Defence looks like a fun spin on the RTS genre</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>D.O.T. Defence from Rattleaxe Games plans to launch in 2025 and looks like it will put a nice unique spin on RTS games, with matches you play in short bursts designed for single-player and local multiplayer. Another unique game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>!</p>
<p>More about it: "Welcome to D.O.T. Defence, a simplified yet deeply strategic RTS experience that seamlessly blends accessibility with tactical depth. We offer a simplified economy system, massive automated battles with light command, and a fun simplified upgrade system. Play in short bursts as matches last between 5-10minutes!</p>
<p>The only objective is to protect your HQ and destroy the enemies! Crafted by developers passionate about the genre, this game delivers a nostalgic experience reminiscent of their childhoods."</p>
<p>Check out the teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4iwfeI2oR4g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/920adaccb4c4e3d640565e23f42b2c8a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4iwfeI2oR4g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's all about capturing little square regions across the map to expand, and defend, so you can push further towards the enemy HQ. You end up with what they call Turret Mayhem, as you defend against hordes of enemies trying to capture your territory with various types of turrets to use. Split across a Wave Defense mode and a more traditional RTS experience in the Skirmish mode it sounds like it could be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It will support 1v1, 2v2 and free-for-all battles with local multiplayer and battles against AI.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124850/DOT_Defence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Aether Collector is a mysterious point and click adventure set inside an anomaly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for sci-fi fans, Aether Collector is a mysterious point and click adventure set inside an anomaly. Releasing later this year with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>More about it: "Step into the shoes of Samantha, a new hire at A-VOID Corporation's Outpost X, tasked with mining mysterious Aether from the air in the abandoned Quandary Valley. Navigate a world where reality bends and corporate interests clash with the unknown."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HsXKgSDTsPc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9953b21bd4606f4f8d387111fd1656e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HsXKgSDTsPc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore an eerie, abandoned town and surrounding forest.</li>
<li>Control a drone to harvest Aether and unlock spectral echoes.</li>
<li>Uncover dark secrets and face moral dilemmas.</li>
<li>Encounter strange phenomena and potential threats.</li>
<li>Silent protagonist in a richly atmospheric setting.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer said it blends together elements of existential horror with corporate satire and should set your back around 5 hours of adventuring.</p>
<p>However, I know plenty of you aren't keen on AI, and it does use AI in the game. Their statement on it: "The voices are generated using ElevenLabs and many of images are painted over and modified AI generations.". There will no doubt be a lot more games coming out using AI like this in some way.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m quite excited for the Starship Troopers: Extermination single-player</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination is already a fun game, but the initial Early Access release was short-lived due to a lack of content. Over time, Offworld have really built it up and the new upcoming single-player mode has me really excited. <em>I have a real sweet spot for Starship Troopers, as one of my favourite sci-fi movies.</em></p>
<p>There's been a lot of performance updates over the last year with DLSS and FSR3 also being added. Weak points were introduced to bugs to aim for; new planets; a new carnage system so the maps will fill up with bug bodies instead of them vanishing, that all have collisions too, creating some interesting interactions; different types of ammo and lots more.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer featuring Casper Van Dien from the original sci-fi classic movie:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q-z4hGP89YM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e18c149b1781a669ad2bb7cb5b96db2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q-z4hGP89YM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a new developer diary that goes over the upcoming massive tanker bug addition, appearing just as it did in the 1997 classic movie. Also mentioned is another new planet coming, the icy planet Boreas, where you'll face various mutated bugs.</p>
<p>On top of that there's some new details on the single-player mode, which sees you undertake a multitude of missions that vary in scope and objectives. Mainly, they're designed to prepare you for the 16-player online mode, with more missions planned after the October 11th launch out of Early Access.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kRpzrSa0ibI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fc1c6d90dadfcfd64197c35f5a87314f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kRpzrSa0ibI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully at the full release it will have more players, as it's good fun. The biggest problem with it is actually getting into a game, as you're forced to matchmake with seemingly no ability just to start a game by yourself and let others come in later.</p>
<p>It's currently Unsupported on Steam Deck, but does run on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Celebrating 6 years since Valve announced Steam Play Proton for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today marks 6 years since Valve decided to change everything, especially for Linux fans, with the announcement of Steam Play Proton. Thanks to it, the Steam Deck and Desktop Linux gaming have continued to thrive. <em>Want a Proton beginner's guide? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Got you covered at this link</a>.</em></p>
<p>Heck, the Steam Deck <em>never</em> would have been a thing without Proton. Could you imagine it? Trying to market a Linux handheld without the vast majority of games people want to play? It was also only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/5-years-later-valve-finally-gives-windows-compatibility-tool-proton-a-logo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in February this year</a> that Valve actually decided to give it a logo too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17719696571724266234gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Proton's official logo</em></p>
<p>Thanks to all the work put into Proton from Valve developers, contractors and everyone who contributes to <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine</a> development that Proton is based upon, we have a ridiculous amount of games where you can just click the Play button and forget about everything else in Steam.</p>
<p>Going by the official Valve Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, there's been 66 releases of Proton during this time, and that's not counting all the interim updates to Proton Experimental and Proton Hotfix for quick game-specific fixes. The Proton changelog has seen 388 changes, although some will be text corrections, that's again showing just how much goes into it. It's an incredible amount of work when you think about just how many games are on Steam, and developers really love to do some <em>weird</em> stuff that Valve often has to work around. And let's not forget the likes of <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a>, who employ people to work on Wine and Proton.</p>
<p><em>As for the current state of Desktop Linux and Steam Deck gaming overall…</em></p>
<p>Looking over the current numbers on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, the community website where anyone can report how games work: there's 22,002 games reported to work by at least one person, 13,297 by at least two people and 9,751 that has three or more reports.</p>
<p>Going by Valve's own Steam Deck Verified system there's 5,297 rated Verified and 10,646 rated Playable.</p>
<p>Both ProtonDB and Valve's own ratings are only a small slice of Steam though, which has over 100,000 according to the Game tag on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. There's only so many games Valve can test officially and that people can report to ProtonDB, so there's likely thousands of games not reported by anyone that will just work out of the box with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311193491724267345gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311193491724267345gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - HELLDIVERS 2 on Linux</em></p>
<p>It's pretty amazing that we can play the likes of HELLDIVERS 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Black Myth: Wukong, Grand Theft Auto V, Cyberpunk 2077, Fallout 4, Balatro, ELDEN RING, Hades II, Dead by Daylight, No Man's Sky and so many more at the click of a button in Steam now.</p>
<p>Now we just need more anti-cheat support, including from developers who already use anti-cheat that is supported to actually enable it. This is really the last major hurdle.</p>
<p>So here we are again, happy birthday to Proton, 6 years strong enabling gaming on Linux and Steam Deck to be an incredible thing.</p>

      <title>Humble is doing a big Resident Evil Bundle again that&#39;s worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to finish your collection? <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/resident-evil-decades-horror-village-gold?partner=gamingonlinux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil: Decades of Horror - Village Gold</a> is a freshly released Humble Bundle for you.

<p>Below I'll go through and individually list the expected compatibility on Steam Deck and Linux desktop, along with any <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating and noting any Native Linux versions available. Plus each is a Steam link, so you can go see more info on each if you need to.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 560.35.03 released for Linux with Wayland fixes </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today released driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/230929/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">560.35.03</a> as the latest stable version for Linux users, so here's all that's changed.</p>
<p>This is the first stable release of the 560 series, so it brings together all the changes from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/nvidia-560-linux-driver-beta-has-wayland-improvements-defaults-to-open-gpu-kernel-modules/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">560.28.03</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/nvidia-linux-driver-beta-5603102-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">560.31.02</a> that were released across late July and early August. That includes defaulting to open GPU kernel modules by default if your GPU supports it, VRR (Variable Refresh Rate) for Wayland on pre-Volta GPUs and more.</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug, introduced in 555.58, where some DVI outputs would not work with HDMI monitors.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause KDE Plasma Shell to freeze while hovering over or opening applets when running in Wayland compositor mode.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the display to freeze when presenting windows using Wayland direct scanout on multiple monitors.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause kernel crashes upon attempting KMS operations through DRM when nvidia_drm was loaded with modeset=0.</li>
</ul>
