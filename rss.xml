      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE arrives on Steam — plus it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE has officially landed on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the good news is that it works on Linux plus it's Steam Deck Verified. Seems Valve were well aware to get it Deck Verified status right away, looks like we know why <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-3 released recently then</a>!</p>
<p>You know the Steam Deck is getting noticed, and clearly <em>important</em> to the gaming industry, when the Final Fantasy VII series Executive Produce at Square Enix mentions it directly in the 25th Anniversary Celebration video that you can see below. I think the importance of moments like that cannot be overstated. The Steam Deck mention is at about 3:40.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wohQiEysqIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9184c75108971fa4977a83531f04ede1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wohQiEysqIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a big one, and one I was hoping to eventually play personally, I decided to dive in and take a quick look. Since it's Steam Deck Verified, every part of it <em>should</em> work well but that does depend on how thorough the verification system is, for such an expansive game.</p>
<p>Here's a fresh video for you (personal purchase from <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="okmu4ra0f1I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8de22a1d2522cd3e38d869c7101eb133.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/okmu4ra0f1I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the Steam page this is what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE contains the following content:<br/>
- FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE full game<br/>
- DLC "FF7R EPISODE INTERmission" (New episode featuring Yuffie Kisaragi)<br/>
- Weapon: Cacstar<br/>
- Armor: Midgar Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Shinra Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Corneo Armlet<br/>
- Accessory: Superstar Belt<br/>
- Accessory: Mako Crystal<br/>
- Accessory: Seraphic Earrings<br/>
- Summon materia: Carbuncle<br/>
- Summon materia: Chocobo Chick<br/>
- Summon materia: Cactuar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now. <em>You save a little extra if you're a Humble Choice sub too.</em></p>
<p>The next game in the series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, is confirmed for 2024 but will be exclusive to the PS5. Well, for now anyway, eventually it's likely to come to Steam just like other PlayStation games have been. Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion, a remake of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 for PSP, is also confirmed to be coming to Steam "this Winter".</p>
<p>Oh and if you missed it, we're even getting Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817070/Marvels_SpiderMan_Remastered/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in August. So hopefully Proton will be ready for that too.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper&#39;s first major update The Sunken Sea is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An absolute gem of a game this and now perhaps a good time to go back and spend some proper time with it, as the rather large The Sunken Sea update is out now.</p>
<p>Blending elements and a feel of the likes of Minecraft, Terraria and more it's a great underground exploration and crafting game that's currently in Early Access. It continues to do well after selling 500K in two weeks.</p>
<p>The new biome can be accessed once you've defeated the first three bosses, which brings down the wall that separates the sections of the game. There's also the sub-biome Forlorn Metropolis, a new boss, a new side-boss, 5 new enemies, a fishing merchant, boats, a new workbench type, portals you can craft for teleporting around, 10 new weapons including a bow, new food and fish types and lots more. Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wrQNpT6QNQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22c933b365cc37743f1ced94584f366d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wrQNpT6QNQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking forward to digging more into this one. Works great on desktop Linux and Steam Deck with the Native Linux build that's Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Epic Online Services gets free cross-play tooling that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games just announced a <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-online-services-release-free-pc-crossplay-tools?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank">big upgrade</a> to Epic Online Services, which will now include a full toolkit to enable developers to do cross-play.</p>
<p>Currently, the initial release of the new tools in the EOS SDK supports "PC" (they mean Windows), but they fully plan to support Linux and macOS as well. They already support Epic and Steam directly with more stores coming and consoles / mobile support coming later. EOS includes a special overlay (like the Steam Overlay) that brings together Steam and Epic friends and all the integration into a single list.</p>
<p>For game developers, this sounds thoroughly useful.</p>
<p>What it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All friends, one place.</strong> Steam and Epic Games Store friends merge into one overlay allowing players to see all friends in a single list.</li>
<li>Integrated game invites. In-game, players can search and send invites to friends across Steam and the Epic Games Store, making connecting and playing together easy.</li>
<li><strong>Account linking.</strong> Onboarding without emails or password prompts. With just a few clicks, Steam players can jump into a game while an Epic Games account is created under the hood for their Steam account.</li>
<li><strong>Update-free improvements.</strong> When games are installed, the crossplay features are distributed via a self-updating in-game overlay. Players can enjoy new features and improvements without needing to update anything themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-and-play SDK.</strong> Each Epic Online Services toolset is self-contained, so developers can mix and match the services they want to implement, incorporate the things they want, and leave the rest. Crossplay tools are no different.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully people will use this over Vivox, which still doesn't support Linux and can be quite problematic with Proton too. Even if you don't particularly like the Epic Games Store, what they offer with Epic Online Services seems pretty great.</p>

      <title>Starship Troopers: Terran Command on Steam Deck and Linux — a quick guide</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Terran Command [<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>] just released from The Artistocrats and Slitherine Ltd. but getting it on running on Linux desktop or Steam Deck requires a few steps. Video steps at the bottom if you prefer that.</p>
<p>Technically, on a Linux desktop it works out of the box with Proton but the videos don't play. For both Steam Deck and Linux you will need the community made GE-Proton. To grab GE-Proton you can use <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, which I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">a previous tutorial on</a>. No doubt an official Proton update will come to help but this will get you going right now.</p>
<p>Once you have ProtonUp-Qt and then use it to download GE-Proton, set the game to use GE-Proton in the Compatibility menu in the Properties (restart Steam for it to show up). On Desktop:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you will need to add this as a launch option otherwise while the videos play they don't look right at all:</p>
<p><code>WINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>To do the launch option, it's in the Properties menu of your game on Steam. On Desktop simply right click -&gt; Properties and then enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11181144691655404269gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11181144691655404269gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck. Pick the game in your Library, go to the Cog icon on the right and go to Properties and enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An extra fix needed for the <u>Steam Deck</u> specifically, is to have the launcher close when you hit play. Otherwise you just get a black screen! Find the "Launcher.exe.config" file in your installed folder, open it with a text editor and line 76 will have this:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="false"</code></p>
<p>Change it to:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="true"</code></p>
<p>Now it will work properly on Steam Deck too. Another case of a random launcher being a nuisance.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An immersive storyline campaign featuring unique missions, characters and a lot of Starship Troopers flavor.</li>
<li>Dozens of unique unit types, each with their own special abilities.</li>
<li>Terrain elevation, True Line of Sight &amp; True Line of Fire provide deep tactical gameplay.</li>
<li>Capture and hold vital radio stations, construct base defenses to repel Arachnid attacks and deploy technology buildings to unlock new weaponry.</li>
<li>Heroics, explosions, gore, and Bugs. Lots of Bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the game, so far it seems reasonably good. I love the attempt to capture to cheesiness from the original movie. We don't talk about the two sequels.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dudes! Beat &#39;em up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get punched with nostalgia and eat some pizza? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is officially out now along with Native Linux support and it's looking good on desktop and a Steam Deck too. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge features groundbreaking gameplay rooted in timeless classic brawling mechanics, brought to you by the beat ’em up experts at Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4) and Tribute Games. Bash your way through gorgeous pixel art environments and slay tons of hellacious enemies with your favorite Turtle, each with his own skills and moves - making each run unique! Choose a fighter, use radical combos to defeat your opponents and experience intense combats loaded with breathtaking action and outrageous ninja abilities. Stay sharp as you face off against Shredder and his faithful Foot Clan alone, or grab your best buds and play with up to 6 players simultaneously!"</p>
<p>This is basically a massive homage to classic beat 'em ups, TMNT, old cartoons and retro gaming all in one and I firmly welcome it. It's absolutely gorgeous but wow it will make your thumbs ache. That intro video as well, wow, what memories from my childhood! Launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ozKsDzumb0c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d95df53e619596267131012c5405d57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ozKsDzumb0c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconic 80s inspired retro Turtles brawling action on modern platforms </li>
<li>Six player local &amp; online co-op, featuring April O’Neil and Casey Jones’ playable debut in a TMNT beat-em-up</li>
<li>Attributes, moves and animations tailored to each fighter, channeling their personality and granting a unique edge in battle</li>
<li>Gorgeous pixel renders of signature locales like Dimension X, Coney Island and more</li>
<li>Absolutely bangin’ OST composed by Tee Lopes featuring cultural icons Ghostface Killah and Raekwon</li>
<li>Expertly crafted platform brawler gameplay from the teams who brought you <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> and <em>Panzer Paladin</em></li>
<li>Bodacious replayability from the challenge to master all seven characters with gameplay that makes each run feel totally radical</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it's a beat 'em up, there's quite a lot of moves to learn. As you first get into the game, there's 21 animated in-game slides of various moves to learn. Naturally you can't be expected to learn them all right away but a good bit of button-bashing is often all your need to make your way through and enjoy these types of games. Thankfully, you can access to move list from the pause menu at any point.</p>
<p>Want to see how great it is on Steam Deck? Check it out below:</p>

      <title>The Frogs will take you through a humorous renaissance artwork adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making use of public domain renaissance artwork, The Frogs is an upcoming comedy point and click adventure. A demo is available and now they're on Kickstarter. Very similar in style to what was done with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/04/the-procession-to-calvary-is-a-brilliantly-funny-adventure-of-renaissance-paintings-stitched-together" target="_blank">The Procession to Calvary</a> (different developer), and actually inspired by it. More of this sounds great because it's such a unique way to make a game.</p>
<p>"Join Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, ecstasy, and (most importantly) theater on a journey to Athens and subsequently the underworld in a comedic romp that pays homage to Aristophanes and his brilliant work, The Frogs! Over 15 hours of snark, satire and absurdity await as Dionysus must solve puzzles, convince people that he is a fun drunk and not just annoying, and find a replacement for the horrible poets and playwrights that are plaguing his festivals."</p>

<p>Just recently it went live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1792467505/the-frogs" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, where they have 58 days to hit $8,500 in funding.</p>
<p>What the developer says it will feature includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Innovative Point-and-Click Interface</li>
<li>Ancient Humor Circa 405 BCE</li>
<li>Choices That Matter</li>
<li>Multiple Solutions to Puzzles</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork</li>
<li>Classical Music</li>
<li>Hidden Optional Content</li>
<li>Tons Of Interactive Elements and NPCs</li>
<li>References So Niche You'll Wonder Why I Bothered</li>
<li>Multiple Endings Whether Aristophanes Likes It Or Not</li>
<li>What's He Gonna Do? Come Back From the Dead and Get Me?</li>
</ul>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III released for Linux with a port from Feral</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Total War: WARHAMMER III is the latest Native Linux game to officially land, with Feral Interactive once again delivering. The Linux version has the latest 1.2 update along with the hotfix from late in May.</p>
<p>WARHAMMER III plunges players into a cataclysmic power struggle between mortals and daemons with each aiming to save or exploit the power of a dying god. Featuring seven diverse playable races - including the video-game debuts of Grand Cathay and Kislev - alongside ground-breaking new features such as the Realm of Chaos campaign, eight-player multiplayer, and the customisable RPG-like Daemon Prince Legendary Lord.</p>
<p>Currently though, it seems to be the lowest rated in the series, with even Total War: WARHAMMER II regularly seeing double the amount of players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="senV4ZCKm4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c79920b934e7a6ad20ce08a66bc631e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/senV4ZCKm4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sadly, it's <em>another</em> port from Feral that has multiplayer locked per operating system. We repeatedly asked them to clarify it before release but they wouldn't say. Today at release they confirmed via <a href="https://twitter.com/feralgames/status/1537443725478985728" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our version of the game allows online multiplayer between players on the same Operating System only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you play the Linux port from Feral, you can <em>only</em> play other Linux port players. So if you want to play friends on Windows, you will still need to use the Proton compatibility layer to run the Windows version. A pretty big sore spot for a Linux port in 2022.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The last ever game from Zachtronics releases July 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No doubt plenty of puzzle fans will be sad, as Zachtronics will be hanging up their development hat and moving on after the release of Last Call BBS. Entering Early Access on July 5th, it's technically multiple games in one.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics!</p>
<p>The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<p>This isn't some marketing gimmick either, Zach has taken up a teaching job and really is moving on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>20th Century Food Court</strong>: Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio</strong>: Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path</strong>: Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams</strong>: Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional</strong>: Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li><strong>HACK*MATCH</strong>: The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. Early Access will only last a couple of month to get any issues ironed-out and perhaps another mini-game before it's finally time to move on.</p>

      <title>LightSpeed Studios (Tencent) joins the Open 3D Foundation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LightSpeed Studios, owned by Tencent, has joined up with the Open 3D Foundation who oversee the <a href="https://www.o3de.org/" target="_blank">Open 3D Engine (O3DE)</a>. They've joined as a Premier Member joining the likes of Adobe, Epic Games, Microsoft, Intel and others. This means they will be giving resources to the Open 3D Foundation to further development of the Open 3D Engine.</p>
<p>On top of that though and I'm sure this will raise some eyebrows, Tencent Senior Project Manager, Lanye Wang, will join the Open 3D Foundation's Governing Board.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are very excited to join the Open 3D Foundation, especially for the opportunity to leverage the connection with all of the other members to dive deep into the graphic technologies and build a top-level open source 3D engine community,” said Lanye Wang, representing LightSpeed Studios. “We look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>“It has been amazing to see the rapid growth of the O3D ecosystem, and we’re elated to welcome LightSpeed Studios to our community,” said Royal O’Brien, Executive Director of Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. “LightSpeed Studios has achieved a strong reputation as a leading global game developer, offering high-quality gaming experiences to hundreds of millions of users worldwide, and we are excited to collaborate with them as we enhance O3DE’s capabilities for global 3D developers.”</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher has a bug fix release AND a huge new overhaul Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two goodies for fans of the open source Heroic Games Launcher today. Those sticking with the stable release get some fixes, and those who want some fun can try out a huge new Beta.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.9" target="_blank">v2.3.9</a> stable release the developers added in some fixes for GOG games that use DOSBox and ScummVM, further increasing the compatibility as Heroic will properly handle the configuration files for them now. Always great to see!</p>
<p>Heroic <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta" target="_blank">v2.4.0</a> Beta is where the fun begins. This is a huge change to how the app looks and works. The biggest changes include a new collapsible sidebar that stays open so you get access to many quick-functions like accessing your library, store pages, settings, the wine manager, download list and download status and more. It's actually really useful and makes Heroic feel a lot better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5126101381655312855gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5126101381655312855gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3740439701655312851gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3740439701655312851gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You will also notice that the library is now unified into one list, although you can filter it per-store. Game cards will also now always show the game title and buttons for play, settings and updating.</p>
<p>Plenty of other changes like an option to change the game language if supported, a fix for GOG games using DOSBox and ScummVM (just like the stable release) and much more.</p>
<p>You can still swap it to a list if you prefer it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6425215761655313080gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6425215761655313080gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What do you think to the changes?</p>

      <title>Build cities on the back of a giant animal in The Wandering Village — coming to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village, a city-builder set on the back of a giant animal is now confirmed to be having Native Linux support at the Early Access release. Created by Stray Fawn Studio, the same team behind Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor, Retimed and Niche - a genetics survival game.</p>
<p>"In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a small group of survivors seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call 'Onbu'. Become their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with the creature to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world that now surrounds you."</p>
<p>They don't have a really up to date trailer, with their Xbox reveal being their newest:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Cgs-WWqadM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5f915e05e99d7e3cee7fed82e27713f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Cgs-WWqadM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I spoke to the developer some time ago and they weren't sure if they were doing Linux support or not. Their plans have changed, with confirmation to me via email that it will have full Linux support including at Early Access. A Linux build is already their for their Closed Beta and they continue improving it.</p>
<p>For players interested on Steam Deck, they do have plans for gamepad / controller support on PC / Linux but that will come later in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Wilderness survival sandbox Vintage Story has a massive upgrade out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I really haven't spent enough time with because it's great, Vintage Story is a blocky survival game that's thoroughly challenging and a huge upgrade is out now. Inspired by lovecraftian horror themes, it's definitely one of the more unique open-world survival games around.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/de-jank-and-game-juice-update-1170-pre1-r322/" target="_blank">Version 1.17.0</a> is now in testing, so it's not fully released, and comes with absolutely tons that's new. A big tech overhaul too that should improve RAM use, starting a world should be twice as fast, multiple improvements to overall performance and improvements to creature AI too. Heck, there's even a fancy new water system that allows water to flow through most blocks that aren't solid.</p>
<p>New trailer is below and it's seriously impressive:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NJjifFq1NGY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b3f37c76902ca800d5e216fd58d7c49d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NJjifFq1NGY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Other new additions include lightning strikes, 200+ new blocks, big visual upgrades to the temporal storms that happen, armour can now be repaired, 300 types of shield (a 30-fold increase), more and prettier flora, new and improved fauna like the addition of brown bears, black bears, sun bears, pandas and a gazelle, deserts storms are in, bamboo and straw hats and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Vintage Story doesn't get enough credit for being such a thoroughly interesting and massive game.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/vintage-story?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://tyronx.itch.io/vintage-story" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and the <a href="http://www.vintagestory.at/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Mixing action-adventure and tower defense, Dwerve is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwerve is a bit of an odd one, blending together elements of a dungeon-crawling action adventure with tower defense and it's out now. Created by Half Human Games, they previously made the space shooter Blacksea Odyssey. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>"Dwerve is a tower defense dungeon crawler RPG where you play as a young dwarf tinkerer who adventures into a ruined kingdom and unearths the lost technologies of the ancient warsmiths: turrets and traps. These are the only weapons that can protect the dwarves from Witch-Queen Vandra and her army of bloodthirsty trolls and monstrous creatures hellbent on conquering the surface."</p>

<p>A concept that isn't original (what is now?), with other games doing this mix too like Sanctum. However this is not a 3D shooter mix, instead giving you some pretty wonderful pixel-art. It blends together story-based adventuring, with real-time battles where you place down various towers wherever you want and watch as the action happens. Since you're a living character in this, you will be constantly running around.</p>
<p>Unlike more traditional tower defense games, towers and traps have a limit amount of health, so you will be repeatedly running back and forth between towers to pull them down when they're about done (or destroyed) to put them back up and continue your defence.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, plenty of it was a bit <em>too</em> slow when I initially played it and the developer has received a lot of feedback on this, to the point that they've released some patches to make it feel a little faster. Simple things like movement speed being too slow, which has been buffed up and the result is a slightly smoother feeling game now that I feel is easily worth a go if you want a slightly different take on tower defense.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15420166791655296667gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15420166791655296667gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once it really gets going, it can be surprisingly challenging too. Not only are you watching your tower health closely, but you also need to take into account the different enemy types too (some towers can't hit certain enemies) and once your towers are down — they will come for you. So it can be a little frantic to reposition your towers and get to safety. In a way, the battles feel a little like a 2D version of Orcs Must Die! somewhat.</p>
<p>I love the way it uses the area you're adventuring through in the story for the battling too. No special stages, no changing levels, you just keep exploring and place down towers whenever needed. Overall it's a pretty fun take on a mix of genres.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Tower defense combat!</strong> Build turrets and traps to fend off swarms of monsters!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Dungeon crawling!</strong> Explore a ruined kingdom brimming with hidden secrets and puzzles!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Upgrade your turrets and traps!</strong> Each has its own upgrade tree with 100+ upgrades in all!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Fight epic boss battles!</strong> Use strategy, wit, and fast reflexes to out maneuver massive monsters!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Discover powerful artifacts!</strong> Dragonfire Boots, Lionheart Shield, Gurrakk's Hammer, and more!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Embark on an adventure!</strong> Meet friends, travel throughout the mountain, stop the Witch-Queen!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In my playthrough, the Native Linux version worked great, no obvious issues and controller support worked fine too with my current-gen Xbox pad.</p>

      <title>BeamNG.drive gets experimental Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the new 0.25 release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/284160/BeamNGdrive/" target="_blank">BeamNG.drive</a>, the developers have now put up an experimental Native Linux version for you to try and give feedback.</p>
<p>What is it? BeamNG.drive is a driving sim based on realism. They have spent a long time on their sim, along with their soft-body physics engine simulating all parts of their vehicles in real-time that they say results in "true-to-life behavior". It's a huge game on Steam, with an Overwhelmingly Positive review score from over 100,000 users.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://www.beamng.com/game/news/announce/experimental-linux-support/" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the release of 0.25 we are including <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong> support for BeamNG Linux. We know that this is something a number of you have wanted for some time, and it seems the time has come to give our players the chance to experiment with this.</p>
<p>Since this is an experimental work in progress product, we do not offer customer support for BeamNG on Linux. This product may be buggy, crashy, unstable or all of the above, but if you are a Linux enthusiast we encourage you to try it out.</p>
<p>Your feedback will be invaluable in helping us get a properly supported version of BeamNG for Linux. In case of questions, <a href="https://www.beamng.com/threads/86422/" target="_blank">please make use of this thread</a>, but make sure to read the guidelines first.</p>

      <title>Check out Striving for Light if you love endless character-building skill trees</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Striving for Light is a new Native Linux release from Igniting Spark Games, one to check out for ARPG fans who love building up crazy characters.</p>
<p>One of the unique selling points on this one is that the skill tree is ever-expanding, allowing you to just keep on going and they say it's actually "infinite". Not just that, the visuals are certainly on the different side for such an action-RPG with them all being hand-drawn and it doesn't really look like any other I've played.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T39yA5Bwhxc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/49f0b5c825c00f12ff13043d63a64c23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T39yA5Bwhxc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems to work quite well on the Steam Deck too, although the dialog text size when chatting to NPCs is a little on the small side. Apart from that it seems to run just fine and great on desktop Linux too. With it being in Early Access it's not quite finished yet, with a good few months still go for the initial year they suggested it would be there.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dive into a dark, mysterious world full of dangers</li>
<li>Everything is hand drawn</li>
<li>Explore a big variety of random generated maps</li>
<li>Unique soundtracks for each environment</li>
<li>Level up and utilise a unique random generated and infinite expanding skill tree</li>
<li>Unlock new skills and weapons</li>
<li>Endless progression system</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1646790/Striving_for_Light/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> with a demo.</p>

      <title>Wine manager Bottles gets a bit of a makeover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, the fantastic and fast-moving free and open source application for managing the Wine compatibility layer has a new release out with a new code-name and a refreshed look. It's such a big release internally, they're now calling the releases by Brescia instead of Trento. So, what's new? A lot, as usual.</p>
<p>The backend has been bumped up to GTK4 + libadwaita, which has resulted in some tweaks to the styling along with overall performance improvements with it using more modern toolkits. Along with this, the onboarding experience was changed to look a bit fancier:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14971699381655291575gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14971699381655291575gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some other tweaks include changes to the Bottle screen with a reorganised utilities list, with the most-used items easier to access. A few others have been put under a Legacy menu together, which contains various Wine tools they haven't implemented directly into Bottles just yet. Some performance upgrades have been done for the way the Programs, Dependencies, Versioning and Installers screens are populated to reduce loading time too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19419184121655291777gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19419184121655291777gol1.png"/></a>Image Credit - Bottles team</em></p>
<p>Launch options were improved too, which now allow you to override some preferences from the Bottle. Which in some cases may allow you to avoid creating a whole new Bottle when one app inside needs a specific option (useful!).</p>
<p>A new notification system has been added, to alert you to what the application is doing to keep you informed. Loads more like high-resolution application icons, listing games installed via launchers like Steam in Wine and eventually other launchers too like Origin and Battle.net, an option to disable mouse acceleration, they added 14 new Windows dependencies plus various fixes.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.25 is out now, here&#39;s some of what&#39;s new</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get the latest and greatest from the KDE team? The awesome <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.0/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.25</a> release is officially out now. This is the desktop environment used on the Steam Deck when in Desktop Mode! Hopefully Valve will update it at some point.</p>
<p>One of the big new additions is the extension of what you can customize. Accent colours for example, can be automatically picked based on your background making everything fit nicely together. It's optional of course, you can set the colouring however you like. You can also now have floating panels, that will gracefully stop floating when you maximise a window and it looks pretty slick.</p>
<p>Switching between windows and workspaces is now a breeze, thanks to the new Overview affect that's shipped. This gives you a good look at everything you have open, allowing you to also search through apps, documents, and browser tabs with KRunner and the Application Launcher.</p>
<p>There's also masses of upgrades and new additions to touchscreen input and gestures on a touchpad. Oh, and the Discover Software app had the application pages redesigned to give you access to more and better info on what you're downloading and plenty of upgrades to their Flatpak handling.</p>
<p>See their flashy release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Az8NcYe3t70"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a382799996316b8475f66eccf1c1a425.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Az8NcYe3t70" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also absolutely loads (hundreds!) of improvements and fixes for Wayland support too.</p>

      <title>Turbo Golf Racing could be the next multiplayer hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo currently available in Steam Next Fest, the racer game Turbo Golf Racing is one to watch. Tested on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with Proton 7.</p>
<p>You can be in a match with up to eight players and you can go solo, or create a party. The idea is simple, from go you power as fast as you can into your personal ball and keep smashing your car into it until you get it into the hole at the end of the course. While racing, there's various power-ups you can collect and areas of the track that can give you a boost too.</p>
<p>Here's some footage of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AOdzgBXq4rM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b42cb46f7b42e9cdc948b0896b7eb294.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AOdzgBXq4rM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One bit does concern me though with Power Cores, special additions to your vehicle that can enable you to have an abilities boost that could create some messy balancing.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely hooked on this already though and I think if they do it right, this could easily be the next big multiplayer experience. Nice to see it working so well with Proton even before release too! It will not be free to play though, so it will be interesting to see how it does.</p>
<p>The developers say it will have free regular upgrades with new courses, cosmetics and more.</p>
<p>Try it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1324350/Turbo_Golf_Racing/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It enters Early Access on August 4th.</p>

      <title>Monster collecting game Cassette Beasts shows off the powerful fusion system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is an incredibly exciting looking upcoming monster collecting game, one that will offer a rather unique take on the genre and a new trailer is up showcasing the fusion system.</p>
<p>It's on the unique side, since you're not collecting these creatures or using them in a traditional way. Instead of throwing them out of some kind of ball, you turn into them. The fusion system is where it gets real interesting though, allowing you to combine two forms into something unique. The developers say it will be able to generate "over fourteen thousand unique fusions that will allow you as a player to fully customize your team to fit your unique style".</p>
<p>During the Guerrilla Collective digital games showcase a new trailer was shown below:</p>

<p>Developed with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it will have a Native Linux build at release.</p>
<p>You can wishlist / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>20 Minutes Till Dawn is like Vampire Survivors with guns — goodbye free time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>20 Minutes Till Dawn is what you get when you take the basic action-survival idea that Vampire Survivors made popular again, makes it really dark and puts a gun in your hand. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>I am thoroughly loving this return to simple, cheap and engrossing experiences that we've had recently. It's only £2.09 on Steam and you can get a ridiculous amount of time out of it and it's only going to get bigger since it's in Early Access right now. 20 Minutes Till Dawn is a rogue-lite survival action game, where you run around defeating an increasing number of weird creatures and collect little pips that drop when they die to level up. When you level up, you get to pick from a random list of upgrades to create a ridiculous character.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton, it works out of the box perfectly on Linux desktops, and with a Steam Input adjustment it can feel great on the Steam Deck too. Here's a look at it on the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ogCLZ9MfF-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/42892aae2a84dbd24a31965df092fb8f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ogCLZ9MfF-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not just guns though, there's a few different characters to unlock and they each have different weapons to unlock too as there's plenty of persistent progression to keep you going.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 50 different upgrades too choose from for a unique experience every run!</li>
<li>Wide cast of characters, with more to come post-launch.</li>
<li>Casual quick 10-20 minute play sessions, for busy gamers.</li>
<li>Rune System helps you become stronger</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think and hope they add some visual aids for people with poor eyesight though, because I can imagine it being a little difficult to see. That's part of the fun for me though, and certainly makes it on the tougher side to play through and keeps me coming back for more.</p>
<p>Right now, I think it's instantly become my new favourite game to blast through when taking a break.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966900/20_Minutes_Till_Dawn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Kandria is a promising 2D hack and slash open world action RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You're an android who awakens in a ruined future, this is Kandria. A new upcoming 2D hack and slash open world action RPG. Developed by Shirakumo Games / Nicolas Hafner, you'll be exploring a world full of caverns, tunnels, and ruined buildings while also fighting off hordes of enemies and there's plenty of challenging platforming thrown in too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7jdNvY1EMNY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4ea3ee7cf7cb378aeef7f2847e9d700a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7jdNvY1EMNY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I spoke with the developer today who confirmed that not only will it have Native Linux support, they also mentioned that they "develop primarily on Linux, so it'll stay supported". Another fun point, is that they plan to open source their code for their in-house game engine.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore over 2'100x1'200m of gameplay area</li>
<li>Beat 250 individual, hand-crafted rooms</li>
<li>Experience 50 quests that lead you through the world</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in the world with more than 2 hours of unique music</li>
<li>Choose your look from 33 different outfits</li>
<li>Discover secrets and lore from the old world</li>
<li>Craft your own levels with the integrated editor and share them with the community</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can try out a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1261430/Kandria/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> right now for Next Fest and support it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. The crowdfunding campaign has 29 days to hit at least 10,000CHF (Swiss franc), so it's about £8,246.</p>

      <title>Arctic Awakening is an upcoming cold narrative-adventure mystery</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With an initial setting that seems a little like The Long Dark, the upcoming Arctic Awakening seems like a thoroughly interesting story-focused exploration adventure. Shown off during the Future Games Show summer showcase, the developer confirmed to me today their plans to have it release with a Native Linux build.</p>
<p>"You are Kai, a pilot without a plane lost in the wilderness of the far north. You’ll need your wits about you to brave the elements, find your co-pilot and get the hell out of Dodge. Along the way, you might just discover what it was that cut your plane clean in two... and what it is making those noises after dark.</p>
<p>Arctic Awakening is a first-person narrative adventure set in the mysterious Arctic North where you and your robotic companion, Alfie, must search for your co-pilot... and a way home."</p>

The developers note many balance changes were done for this release, to really fine-tune the experience.

      <title>AMD announce Radeon Memory Visualizer support for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD <a href="https://gpuopen.com/radeon-memory-visualizer-on-linux/" target="_blank">announced</a> yesterday that they're now supporting the Radeon Memory Visualizer on Linux, as a result of "the rising popularity of gaming on the Linux OS".</p>
<p>This is a tool to help game developers solve some complex issues and analyze video memory usage on AMD Radeon GPUs. A good step, as it's not just enough to have games working well on Linux, we also need to pull in more game developers so we can eventually have great direct-support.</p>
<p>Starting with the June 2022 release of their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/tools/" target="_blank">Radeon Developer Tool Suite</a>, developers can analyze Vulkan applications on Linux. Officially, they're supporting Ubuntu 20.04 but other distributions will likely also work but may need some different dependencies installed. AMD say the experience is largely the same as the Windows version too.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest: June 2022 is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A celebration of upcoming games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest: June 2022</a> is now live for you to smash that download button on various demos to see what you think. Much like previous events, there will also be various livestreams on the official event page and on pages for individual games for you to speak to developers and see some footage.</p>
<p>Valve also created a little trailer for it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gnu-nh4NI0Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e643aa18c5e957adea0f9668d6598bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gnu-nh4NI0Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The event runs from June 13th to June 20th.</p>
<p>Here's just a small hand-picked selection of the demos that offer up Native Linux support and look interesting:</p>

</ul>
<p>Not only do you get to try some games, Valve has also added special badges you can earn during the event for playing various demos. So if you love collecting things on Steam for your profile, it's a nice bit of added fluff to get you to play more.</p>
<p>Since I've been excited for this one, here's some Linux gameplay from the FPS game Selaco:</p>

      <title>Initial thoughts on the HP Dev One laptop with Pop!_OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HP and System76 teamed up for the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a>, and for a little while now I’ve been using it as my main machine for everything possible for GamingOnLinux related and otherwise. Here's my initial thoughts, with more to come when I've had more time.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: this was a review unit sent directly by HP. I’ll preface this with a clear note, that initially I was offered a payment to review it. I denied the offer, since I <em>never</em> take payments for reviews and was later told it was a mistake by the PR firm involved. System76 has since said I can <em>keep</em> the device but that does not affect my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Available for $1,099, you can have it with the System76 Launch Configurable Keyboard (which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">reviewed previously</a>) and a HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse as optional <em>extras</em>. Not only is the hardware a thing of beauty but the operating system is pretty slick too, as it comes with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS</a> from System76. This was also my first <em>real</em> test of Pop!_OS for more than just messing around for an hour and it’s really easy to get along with.</p>
<p>Built for "developers", which is a pretty ambiguous way to describe who it’s really for, it’s actually a pretty solid all-rounder that just glides through most of what you can throw at it. Except playing the latest games at 1080p, although it does quite well at lower resolutions. It’s a powerhouse when it comes to the CPU but not the GPU.</p>
<p><strong>Main Specifications</strong></p>

<p>Since this is an AMD unit, which is still quite rare with Linux vendors, it does mean you get open source drivers with it too so that's a nice bonus for Linux and FOSS enthusiasts. This is also not a case of a rebrand for Linux, this was a Linux-first endeavour and you can feel it and see it all the way through.</p>
<p>Is it really a Linux hardware review if you don’t Neofetch it?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3175648691655130029gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It ships with a pretty standard proprietary firmware / BIOS. Coreboot was being evaluated but they simply didn't have time to get it onto it ready for production. The good news though is that it fully supports the <a href="https://fwupd.org/" target="_blank">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a>, so you can easily get updates directly on the machine without ever needing Windows.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2316521241655134138gol1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>System76 and HP together?</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most surprising part of the laptop and quite an important one to think on. Since System76 are a hardware vendor with their own laptops (and lots more), on top of making the Pop!_OS distribution, it's a great way for both System76 and HP to expand who is using Linux to the benefit of them both in the long run. Fantastic for us consumers too, as more choice for Linux is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the experience here with Pop!_OS is great too, especially as they haven't filled it full of fluff. It's largely a generic standard Pop install because it has such a wide target for Linux enthusiasts. A few of the tweaks include a different wallpaper by default and their own special selection to pick from, an EULA to accept on install and opt-in analytics for HP to get info to improve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/846734461655131342gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Access to software out of the box is great, with the Pop!_Shop software centre having both the standard repositories and <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> enabled together so the amount of extras you have access to should enable you to find anything you could possibly need and Flathub is growing all the time.</p>
<p>There are some things that makes it "special" according to HP like an integrated support panel within the OS, HP have specially trained their support teams for the device and HP also do a full QA certification for every kernel and firmware update for it. Safe to say they're making sure people who buy it are well supported. They even collaborated with AMD on suspend/resume support.</p>
<p><strong>The Dev One experience</strong></p>
<p>The screen, wow, where do I start? It’s glossy, so it has a few reflections in certain lighting conditions but apart from that, it’s absolutely <em>gorgeous</em>. The brightness is actually seriously impressive, somewhat blinding at max setting even. I’ve spent almost my entire time with it at 50% brightness but could easily go lower, it’s just that clear. Pretty great viewing angles from each edge too, I don’t think anyone is going to have any issues with the screen for sure.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise initially was the audio from the speakers. Not only is it crystal clear, it’s also incredibly loud. At 50% audio level, I could hear it pretty clearly in another room across my house so that’s pretty great. Putting it up to 100% audio level was really where the audio truly impressed me though, it still remained impeccably clear which is kind of ridiculous for its size.</p>
<p>How is the fan? When really pushing the device, I was amazed at how quiet the fan remained. It’s not silent by any measure but it is quiet, you only really hear a gentle muted blow out of it that puts to shame some other devices I have (including my own personal laptop). Fan noise can be stupidly distracting but here it was easy to tune it out completely. I fully expected to hear it start ramping-up when I pushed it to the limit but it remained quiet which I was genuinely astonished by.</p>
<p>A great keyboard too, and it even includes a trackpoint (otherwise known as a nipple) for those of you who loved that on the ThinkPads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19009311121655132659gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'm glad they chose a muted colour for the nipple though, so it doesn't overly stick-out against the the unit. Fits in quite well as a fun extra for those who like using one.</p>
<p>The keyboard as a whole feels great to use. It's quiet, which seems to be a nice theme with this unit so you won't have distracting clicks while you're working away, same goes for the built-in mouse buttons which are very quiet although the touchpad can be clicked in too but that's quite a nice muted sound. From what they say it's spill-resistant, although I don't dare to test that. The keyboard is backlit too, which has a few levels of brightness as well as having the backlight off so you can work under different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>A nice privacy feature they have, which took me a while to even notice, is that you can slide a privacy screen over the webcam. I absolutely love that and I honestly think every laptop should have this. Directly above the webcam is a tiny slider that you just pull across.</p>
<p>This is probably the nicest laptop I’ve ever used. Not something I say lightly either, practically everything about it feels <em>just right</em>. I would have vastly preferred a matt screen but that is about the only issue I’ve personally had with it. Due to the screen, working outside with it is not really possible. Shot below is in the shade on max brightness:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20111906061655309893gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20111906061655309893gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And then sat in the sun on max brightness:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17934988981655309844gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17934988981655309844gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Yeah, you're not going to be working outside with this at all. Again though, that is about my only complaint with it and I never work outside anyway. However, think an anti-glare matt screen will do much better anyway? It won't do a whole lot of good outside that's for sure but does look better inside — as long as it's not pointing at a light. For comparison here's it up against the Asus VivoBook S510U inside and then outside:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18827625551655310911gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18827625551655310911gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722301141655310958gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722301141655310958gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I have to hand it to HP and System76 here, together they’ve managed to craft a truly great machine to work with. An impressive device overall when thinking about every angle of it.</p>
<p>No problems encountered with anything either. WiFi worked exceptionally well even when pushing it hard with downloads and streaming together, with it maxing out at 167 Mbps download and 26 Mbps upload with my Google Mesh WiFi which is actually great — more than enough for the vast majority of uses.</p>
<p>Also, another small but very welcome tweak is that the Power button has is tougher to push down so there’s less of a chance of hitting it accidentally. I hope more hardware vendors do this.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, it's pretty great actually. When you really push it, you're not looking at more than 2-3 hours but this is a developer-focused machine so coding with music playing, you're looking at nearly a full day of battery life but of course that also depends on things light screen brightness, audio levels, bluetooth on and more. Battery testing is always a tough one because people use such devices very differently. I'm impressed with it though and it's been more than enough to get lots done without needing a charge. Charging is pretty quick too, with it able to get up to at least 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Currently it’s U.S. only but it sounds like they might have plans for expanding shipping in future, which was mentioned during a Q&amp;A session but no ETA.</p>
<p>While doing the review I also used the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/products/hp-935-creator-wireless-mouse" target="_blank">HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse</a> they supplied as my main mouse too, and found that to be a truly comfortable experience as well. It’s really light, and has a perfect shape to nicely fit my hand. Seems HP keeps impressing me. The battery life on that has a claim of 12 weeks and so far it hasn't needed charging. As a great extra, they also built a Mouse Configurator (that's <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/mouse-configurator" target="_blank">open source</a>) just for using it with the Dev One.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13962661691655134588gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some good attention to <em>all</em> the details here.</p>
<p>Right now, I can see absolutely no reason not to recommend it if you're in the market for a laptop around the $1,099 price-point as not many will be able to match the quality for that.</p>
<p>If you’re after a really wonderful laptop that comes with Linux, the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> is an absolutely brilliant unit that shines and I'll have more to say after spending a while longer with it. If I'm not at my desk, this is my go-to laptop now.</p>
<p>To readers: what would you love to see tested on it? Do let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Techland ends support for Dying Light, 7 years after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland are moving on from the original Dying Light, after giving it 7 years of free updates and expansions. Not many developers support their games for that long, if they're not some sort of live-service thing. Techland certainly did well overall with it.</p>
<p>While it won't see any major updates now, they will still be trickling in a steady "reroll" of previous events into the game for people to play but their main focus is now shifting over to Dying Light 2.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UrneVfMZt30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cea514b760eec6a7462aa8e2cdf4031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UrneVfMZt30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Dying Light also now only has two editions, to make it less confusing. There's Dying Light Enhanced Edition and the new Dying Light Definitive Edition, both of them on a heavy discount on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>To go along with it, the Harran Tactical Unit Bundle DLC has been made free to claim for two weeks. People who owned the Platinum Edition were also upgraded to the Definitive Edition free. This is after they also gave away The Following expansion to all previous owners.</p>

      <title>System Shock remake gets a brand new flashy trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming System Shock from Nightdive Studios is still coming, and a brand new trailer was recently shown off during the PC Gaming Show 2022. We don't know when it will release though.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1994, this remake was crowdfunded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and it hasn't been without trouble with development at one point being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/development-on-the-new-system-shock-has-been-paused/" target="_blank">paused</a> but it seems they're close to the finishing line now. Linux support for it was a stretch-goal at $1.1 million USD that was hit, so hopefully they will come through with a good version of it.</p>
<p>You can see the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Microphone noise suppression app NoiseTorch returns with a new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch" target="_blank">NoiseTorch</a>, a popular real-time microphone noise suppression app recently had a possible <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/developer-of-popular-noise-suppression-tool-noisetorch-has-dev-machine-compromised/" target="_blank">security issue</a> but it's been reviewed thoroughly and it's back.</p>
<p>"NoiseTorch is an easy to use open source application for Linux with PulseAudio or PipeWire. It creates a virtual microphone that suppresses noise, in any application. Use whichever conferencing or VOIP application you like and simply select the NoiseTorch Virtual Microphone as input to torch the sound of your mechanical keyboard, computer fans, trains and the likes."</p>
<p>In the new version 0.12.0 they completed a review of the code, and no issue was found. To help against any future issues, they're no longer using a separate update server and instead they will be using GitHub releases so it's all more transparent. For added security, they're also now using more GitHub features to validate the code too.</p>
<p>On top of that the new release also has some code cleanups, and the actual filtering status will be clearer now so it should give a better user experience.</p>

      <title>Usagi Shima is an idle bunny collecting game that I simply need</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Usagi Shima, from developer pank0 (aka Jess Yu), is an upcoming idle bunny collecting game I've been following for quite some time and the first-ever short gameplay trailer just went up. Shown off as part of the recent Wholesome Direct 2022, it's nice to finally see more than screenshots and tiny gifs on their popular <a href="https://twitter.com/_pank0" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account.</p>
<p>"You’ve been tasked as caretaker of an abandoned island — as you decorate it over time, curious (but adorable!) bunny visitors start to appear! Buy toys, plants, and build structures on an abandoned island to entice curious bun tourists to pay your island a visit. Discover, take photos, and make friends with a variety of bunnies that visit based on how you’ve decorated and arranged the island."</p>

<p>Some of what it will feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover and record 30+ rabbits with unique looks and features!</li>
<li>Over 100 items to decorate with, some even interactive!</li>
<li>Hand-drawn and traditionally animated art style</li>
<li>Pet and engage with a variety of activities with the bunnies to build friendship</li>
<li>Receive keepsakes from bunnies you’ve become best friends with, and even invite them to stay on your island.</li>
<li>Synced with real time, experience the island ambience matching your time of day</li>
<li>Relaxing idle gameplay – no time limits, no stress, enjoy the ambience and play at your own pace!</li>

      <title>Playing OXOGO could land you a big real-life prize that increases with its sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of OXOGO are hoping to entice some people to play their retro-styled adventure, with the added excitement of the possibility to earn a real-life prize.</p>
<p>OXOGO is an adventure styled like games from early 90s handheld consoles, so it would fit right in on the Game Boy. In OXOGO your dog has been kidnapped, and you end up in some sort of prison. An adventure about finding your dog but also a real treasure hunt at the same time. The developer is putting a small amount of each sale into a pot, to give away to whoever can put together all the clues to find a password.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bu-9cORkWHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9acd1b7b45343aa73d6addb0a75a95f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bu-9cORkWHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If no one claims the prize by December 2025, any of the <em>extra</em> (not the whole thing) they added to the initial pot will be donated to free software development projects.</p>
<p>The pot started at €5,000 and they said they will update their <a href="http://oxogo.info/" target="_blank">website</a> once a month for how it's doing.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://oxogo.itch.io/oxogo" target="_blank">buy on itch.io</a> as pay-what-you-want and get treasure hunting.</p>

      <title>Phasmophobia gets new Voice Recognition to work on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you been itching to play Phasmophobia? Well, you no longer have to wait for Wine and Proton to be upgraded as the developers have ripped out the Windows-specific stuff.</p>
<p>In their latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/3339995286952592740" target="_blank">update notes</a>, they mentioned how they "are no longer relying on Windows' speech systems, meaning it supports many more languages and platforms, such as ‘GeForce Now’ and Steam Deck, with no setup required (and fixes that pesky tab-out bug)."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phasmophobia is a 4 player online co-op psychological horror where you and your team members of paranormal investigators will enter haunted locations filled with paranormal activity and gather as much evidence of the paranormal as you can. You will use your ghost hunting equipment to search for and record evidence of whatever ghost is haunting the location to sell onto a ghost removal team.<br/>

You can choose to support your team by monitoring the location with CCTV cameras and motion sensors from the safety of the truck or head inside and get your hands dirty with the ghostly activity that will get increasingly hostile as time goes on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This should hopefully bump the game up on Steam Deck from Unsupported to Verified.</p>

      <title>AMD tease roadmap for Zen 4, Zen 5, RDNA 3 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the recent Financial Analyst Day, AMD revealed a little bit more about their upcoming roadmap and there's plenty to be excited about for their next-gen CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>Some of the points that were mentioned for desktop and laptop users, those were interested in here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zen 4 CPUs later this year as the "world's first" 5nm x86 CPUs. AMD say it will give an IPC uplift of 8-10% and more than a 25% increase in performance-per-watt and a 35% overall performance increase compared to Zen 3 when running desktop applications. We can also expect Zen 4 with V-Cache, and a Zen 4c revision and some will be on a 4nm process.</li>
<li>Zen 5 "Granite Ridge" CPUs planned for 2024, which is being built from the ground-up. Zen 5 will have both 4nm and 3nm designs.</li>
<li>AMD RDNA 3 "Navi 3x" will bring a chiplet design, which will also have their Infinity Cache tech with a 5nm process which they claim a 50% boost in performance-per-watt compared with the previous generation. AMD said to expect Navi 3x GPUs later this year.</li>
<li>A new "Phoenix Point" mobile processor coming in 2023, which will have Zen 4 along with RDNA graphics followed up by the "Strix Point" processor in 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the Steam Deck got a passing mention, with AMD patting themselves on the back for their position amongst the main consoles since they power the Steam Deck, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV: By Blood Alone expansion announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have plenty more coming with the Hearts of Iron IV: By Blood Alone expansion announced, although there's no date yet they've teased it.</p>
<p>In By Blood Alone you chart the course of Mussolini's regime in Italy <em>or</em> subvert Italy's historical path in one of many new alt-historical paths in the new Italian focus tree, driven by the constant involvement in war from the beginning to the end of the game. This includes a new expansive focus tree for Ethiopia and one for Switzerland too. Plus you get to design your own planes which sounds thoroughly interesting.</p>
<p>As always, it will also release alongside a fresh free upgrade for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="owqpUZy6Gbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91c4f87ece0b50c61bc918513a009572.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/owqpUZy6Gbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What it will offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Italian Focus Tree: Follow the historical path of Mussolini’s Italy or rewrite history by restoring power to the monarchy, leading a Communist revolution or promoting democracy.</li>
<li>New Ethiopian Focus Tree: Defy the odds to defeat the Italian invader or resist the conqueror from abroad using unique Government in Exile abilities.</li>
<li>New Swiss Focus Tree: Surrounded by France, Germany and Italy, the mountain nation of Switzerland finds strength in its neutrality, balancing competing factions and overtures from the great powers.</li>
<li>New Peace Conference Options: Demilitarize zones of the map or entire nations, bid on the capital ships of defeated powers, or claim control of enemy resources or factories as reparations.</li>
<li>Aircraft Designer: Design and build your own planes, from nimble interceptors that prioritize speed to durable bombers crafted to unload tons of destruction from high above.</li>
<li>Unit Medals: A log of each division’s accomplishments lets you track their performance, and even allow you to award medals to those that have performed well.</li>
<li>Embargo Interaction: Embargo your enemies with a new diplomatic interaction, preventing them from trading with you if they have generated enough world tension.</li>
<li>New Unit Models: More than 20 new pieces of unit art for Italian, Ethiopian and Swiss armies.</li>
<li>New Plane Models: 67 new plane models.</li>
<li>12 New Music Tracks</li>
</ul>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to get Steam Deck and Gamepad controls in Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get a better Minecraft experience on Steam Deck or with Gamepads as a whole? Thanks to a new mod, it's easily possibly with the latest versions of Minecraft.</p>
<p>The new mod is named <a href="https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/MidnightControls" target="_blank">MidnightControls</a>, a fork of the old and unmaintained LambdaControls and it's open source. The developer who has taken it on has made sure it's cleaned up and working again, along with adding in support for the Steam Deck and in my own testing it works rather nicely. For this, I used the <a href="https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC" target="_blank">PolyMC</a> launcher available easily for Linux and Steam Deck. You can see a previous guide on PolyMC <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/getting-minecraft-and-mods-on-steam-deck-is-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">in this article</a>.</p>
<p>First up is the video example on how to do it followed by the text guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zvj-6iUwdQI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/429eb50e87933d2dee689b40c6a1cb2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zvj-6iUwdQI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>First with PolyMC, set Steam Input into Gamepad with Mouse, and set the right trackpad to Left Mouse Click.</li>
<li>Open PolyMC, add a new instance and set the mod loader to Fabric and click Okay.</li>
<li>Now hit the View Mods button and then Download Mods.</li>
<li>Pick the Fabric API, MidnightLib and MidnightControls.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, load up your new Minecraft instance.</li>
<li>Go into the Options -&gt; Controls -&gt; Controller.</li>
<li>Set the Mode to Controller and under Appearance set Controller Type to Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Now you're all set and it will just work.</li>

      <title>How to play The Elder Scrolls Online on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Elder Scrolls Online is currently noted as Unsupported on Steam Deck but don't let that stop you. Getting it running is actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised it's noted as Unsupported though, considering how quirky the initial install actually is. You're not just downloading from Steam, you're also using their launcher to install an update and that is the main cause of the problems. A launcher being a nuisance — where have we all heard that before?</p>
<p>First up a video example, below that is the text guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B3ahI0_czYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/26e29603491e6da845f63bb2258225e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B3ahI0_czYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the game in your Steam Library, hit the little Cog icon on the right and go to Properties</li>
<li>In the launch options text field, add this: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_SET_GAME_DRIVE=1 %command%</code><br/>
<em>This basically sets up a fake drive in Proton for the game in your Steam Library that the launcher can read correctly</em></li>
<li>Now set Steam Input to Mouse and Keyboard to make it easier for now with the updater and launcher</li>
<li>Load it up, and when you get a black screen, simply press the A button. Proton currently doesn't render it properly, but it's just an accept button to continue on the installer<br/>
<em>You may find it dumps you back to the Steam Library, just reload and it eventually works. Mine only took one extra attempt</em></li>
<li>Load the game</li>
<li>Create / load into your character using the right trackpad as the mouse. Once in-game head to the Options menu in Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Gamepad &gt; Enable Gamepad</li>
<li>Open Steam Input again, set to Gamepad but edit the right trackpad to be a mouse with a left mouse click. This enables you to properly interact with the main menu and get proper gamepad controls in-game</li>
<li>Enjoy.</li>
</ol>

      <title>You can now try Resident Evil Village directly in your browser using Stadia tech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capcom has released a cloud gaming browser demo of the popular Resident Evil Village, so you can try it out in only a click and a few seconds waiting on pretty much any platform. As long as you're using a Chromium-based browser, that is.</p>
<p>It uses "Immersive Stream for Games" from Google, which is their rebrand of the technology used for Stadia that they give out to publishers and developers for direct use. So while the actual Stadia store continues limping on, the tech behind it at least should live on for years as more developers offer up quick cloud demos like this.</p>
<p>Google noted in their <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/discovery-and-trial-immersive-stream-for-games/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about it that they've continued to expand Stadia's own cloud game trials, with 15 games now available to try out at no cost without even having a Stadia account too and they plan to increase that number over the next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18572171041654852288gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18572171041654852288gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - a shot taken from testing it today.</em></p>
<p>For Resident Evil Village, it certainly helped that the developer already had a version for sale on Stadia, so they didn't need to do a port to Linux (since Stadia uses Linux) or wait for Google's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-talk-about-their-windows-emulator-for-stadia-and-they-use-dxvk-already/" target="_blank">upcoming Windows compatibility layer</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck update improves Home Screen performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another small update to the Steam Deck, this time focusing on some bugs and UI performance.</p>
<p>Really, this is just Valve continuing to clean up after the last major <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2 update</a> that came with better fan curves, refresh rate switching and a lot more.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance for the Home screen Recent Games carousel</li>
<li>Fixed boot glitching and crashes experienced by some customers</li>
<li>Fixed Quick Access volume sliders not working after suspend/resume</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the controller reorder screen where moving to a controller slot higher than the current number of connected controllers would show as '!' until the Quick Access Menu screen is re-opened</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux on YouTube</a> you're missing plenty of hands-on videos not covered in articles. Here's a couple recent videos:</p>

      <title>Dota 2 gets a nice performance improvement with the Vulkan renderer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Battle Report Update is out now for Dota 2, with the majority of it being for Dota Plus but there's also some of the usual balancing changes and a nice improvement for people using the Vulkan renderer.</p>
<p>Valve say it has a "significant performance improvement aimed at removing hitching when playing with the Vulkan renderer". They're making use of the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/reducing-draw-time-hitching-with-vk-ext-graphics-pipeline-library" target="_blank">VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library</a> extension, which is currently only supported by the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver</a> but it will be coming to the stable drivers for all vendors eventually. So if you're on NVIDIA, perhaps give it a try and see what you think.</p>
<p>For Dota Plus there's loads new! Including a new Battle Report screen to give you in-depth info on your performance plus Weekend Spotlight, a new queue for everyone to explore an assortment of Dota game modes and events all while stocking up on Dota Plus Shards. Valve also adjusted Immortal Item spell effects, so they can now be equipped regardless of the item you have equipped.</p>
<p>Have a great moment you want to share? There's also a new clip feature to capture those moments. Plenty more in the full <a href="https://www.dota2.com/battlereport" target="_blank">update page</a>.</p>

      <title>Arietta of Spirits gets fixed up for 30FPS mode on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arietta of Spirits, a story-driven action-adventure game with easy to approach game mechanics, has a new update out that makes it run better on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Arietta of Spirits is a charming adventure game with emotion-filled narrative, no-filler gameplay, and fast paced combat. The game tells the story of Arietta and her family, visiting their Grandmother's cabin for the first time after her passing away a year prior. However, the family trip takes an unexpected turn when Arietta meets a mysterious new friend and gains the ability to see strange spirits that inhabit the island."</p>
<p>It's currently Steam Deck Verified, but it appears that verification didn't test putting it down to 30FPS. At least now it's accurate properly. Some games just don't work well below 60FPS due to the way they are programmed, and it seems this is one of them. Thankfully, the developer noticed some reports on it and released a patch to improve it. Now it will work properly at 30FPS which saves battery life.</p>
<p>The developer also fixed up pixel perfect scaling at aspect ratios other than 16:9, added speedrunning features and fixed some other issues.</p>

      <title>Back 4 Blood gets a small update for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/back-4-blood-adds-experimental-support-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Back in April</a> the Zombie shooter Back 4 Blood added experimental support for the Steam Deck, and they're continuing the support along with a new patch.</p>
<p>Along with lots of tweaks to weapon balancing and some new features, they've now added some dedicated default graphical options for the Steam Deck and there's multiple to pick from. This is great, and something I hope more developers add in so Steam Deck players can get the best possible experience. It already worked <em>very</em> nicely out of the box, but hey more tweaks that the developer has directly tested is always welcome.</p>
<p>You can see my previous look at the performance in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x7CHdPuOXxw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94da3ce1d3778cd2821c727dac295b96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x7CHdPuOXxw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the new features in this update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Deck Draw
	<ul>
<li>Play all 15 cards from your deck at the start of a Campaign for all difficulties.</li>
<li><em>Developer Note: We felt like the 15 card draw in No Hope went over well with the community, and wanted to roll out this option to all difficulties. In the future we are considering adding multiple deck styles like ordered draw and full random decks. Some difficulties have been rebalanced to work better with this feature.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Player Kicking
	<ul>
<li>The new Player Kicking system identifies and allows kicking from a Mission when a Cleaner is idle for too long or deals too much friendly fire damage.</li>
<li><em>Developer Note: We discussed this feature at length to try and do what's best for the community, so we want to try this conditional kick feature that will only trigger if someone is playing outside the bounds of the game. We also feel that the traditional Vote to Kick can be exploitable and toxic. This feature is not final and we will be monitoring it closely.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New banners, sprays, and emblems</li>
<li>12 New Burn Cards</li>
<li>New Warped Chest Corruption Cards</li>
<li>New Cleaner skins</li>
<li>Legendary Accessories</li>
<li>A more detailed breakdown of Supply Points, Copper, and Skull Totems is now present on the post-round screen.</li>
</ul>

      <title>One of the highest rated games on Steam, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition from Larian Studios recently became Steam Deck Verified. Plus, we have a longer talk from Swen Vincke, the Founder and Creative Director of Larian Studios.</p>
<p>It gained official Steam Deck Verified status last week, which I somehow completely missed. Looking over the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">top 250</a> on Steam, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is number 68 of the most highly rated games so it clearly has a lot of fans and is arguably one of the best RPGs available on Steam too.</p>
<p>Back when the Steam Deck released, we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6UXZH_FONg" target="_blank">had a few clips</a> of developers talking about the Steam Deck and their games, as it turns out Larian had kept back more of their footage that they just released that you can see below:</p>

<p>In short: they're going to ensure all their games and future games work well on it. Really nice to hear!</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/divinity_original_sin_2" target="_blank">on GOG</a> if you wish to try with Wine.</p>

      <title>Linux hardware vendor System76 is coming to Europe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you wanting to get some hardware from Linux vendor System76 but they don't currently ship to you, or it's expensive to do so? Well, you're in luck! They're coming to Europe. System76 make a lot of hardware including desktops, laptops, servers and a keyboard now too (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">which I reviewed</a>).</p>
<p>In an interview over on Tweakers (<a href="https://netherlands.postsen.com/technology/18352/System76-gets-distribution-center-in-Europe-and-is-working-on-a-new-keyboard-%E2%80%93-Computer-%E2%80%93-News.html" target="_blank">translated</a>), they spoke to System76 principal engineer Jeremy Soller, who confirmed "Laptops and desktops have a lot of restrictions and the costs are higher, so we will start with our Launch keyboard and sell it from a European distribution center, so that the shipping costs and taxes for that market are lower".</p>
<p>This is quite exciting, as their products are generally quite highly rated too, and I know plenty of people in the Linux space personally who use them too. Being able to get my own hands on one of their laptops would be excellent, and I've been lusting over their Thelio desktop case since it was first announced — so looks like I have some saving to do.</p>
<p>When can we expect this to happen? Sometime "in the coming months" Soller said. System76 are working on adjusting their Launch keyboard for ISO versions, and they're looking for storage space to set up their distribution location. They're also working on a smaller version of the keyboard with a Lite version with a 65% layout and no integrated USB 3.2 hub.</p>
<p>Thankfully their laptops are already conforming to the CE marking needed for Europe and they're working on the keyboard layout there. For desktops, they're working towards certification but of course it's far more complicated than a keyboard.</p>

<p>Minecraft 1.19 - The Wild Update is out now. Not only that, all owners now get both Java &amp; Bedrock together as they've been merged into a single purchase.</p>
<p>Not that it particularly matters to Linux players, since Microsoft / Mojang still have no plans to bring the Bedrock version to Linux but still good as a whole to see. They will remain as two separate editions but now you always get both.</p>
<p>Anyway, The Wild Update! It's here! Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="htOLSv8-oR8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9a85b619a0ca8158728c834f9d2e5ea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/htOLSv8-oR8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's new includes the Mangrove Swamp biome, Mangrove Trees, Mangrove Blocks, Mud and Mud Brick Blocks, Clay renewability, Frogs and Tadpoles, the Deep Dark biome, Ancient Cities, Darkness mob effect, Sculk, Sculk Veins, Sculk Shrieker, and Sculk Catalyst Blocks, Warden mob, Allay mob, Boat with Chest, new music, 3D Directional Audio simulation and much more has been added in.</p>
<p>There's plenty of tweaks to existing features too. See the full <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-wild-update-out-today-java" target="_blank">update notes</a> for more.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>GZDoom is the game engine that started off life as a simple enhanced port of the Doom engine for modern platforms, since the original release it has massively grown and now powers some pretty interesting games — why reinvent the wheel after all when GZDoom has a lot to offer.</p>

<p>With the GZDoom 4.8.0 release they've added:</p>
<ul>
<li>HUD scaling from Raze (Raze is a fork of Build engine games backed by GZDoom tech and combines Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, Redneck Rampage, Shadow Warrior and Exhumed/Powerslave in a single package).</li>
<li>Menu scale adjustments for ultra-wide aspect ratios.</li>

<li>Discord Rich Presence support.</li>
<li>Tons of modding improvements and fixes.</li>

      <title>Some new interesting Steam Deck Verified titles, there&#39;s now over 3,200 confirmed Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interested in picking up some more games that will work nicely on Steam Deck or a Linux desktop? Here's a quick run over some recent notable titles that are fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The amount is always increasing, as a bunch go through Deck Verified every day. There's a lot that are Playable and Unsupported but if you just want a click and play experience, this is a nice little reminder for you on what's around. Going by the numbers it's now on 3,245 in total as Verified or Playable. As a reminder though: there are games listed as Unsupported that actually do work, and those that aren't tested doesn't mean they don't work — a lot more do.</p>
<ul>

      <title>Dome Keeper is going to be my next craving, demo is great on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dome Keeper, previously known as Dome Romantik, has a brand new demo available and after testing it, I fear it's yet another simple but addictive game I'm going to wake up craving to play more. Built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it has perfect Linux support so far as I can tell and it feels like perfection on the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>It's a rogue-lite game about defending and upgrading a Dome on a hostile planet, while you dig down below for riches. Quite simple overall but it has that repeatable hook that suckers you into it as the hours fade away. I love the differences between the two sections of the game. The drilling and mining is quite peaceful and fun exploration, while the combat parts feel absolutely nuts at times and really can make you sweat.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WnssSzto5b0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f5a94f1677a06819101bb03aea338a5d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WnssSzto5b0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Love the artwork too!</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig - Drill tunnels beneath your dome in search of precious materials. Watch the time, you need to get back to the dome and be ready when the next wave of attack comes. How deep will you get this time? How much can you carry back?</li>
<li>Defend - Take control of the defenses and fend off the alien attacks. Air and ground, slow and fast, the attackers must be prioritized and dealt with before they tear your dome apart.</li>
<li>Develop - Use your mineral harvest to gain powerful upgrades; improve the strength of your weapon, make your drill more powerful, increase the speed of your jetpack and research other improvements. Find artifacts to give an extra boost to your survival odds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/" target="_blank">new demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs now supports the new Valhall architecture</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for fan of Arm devices, as developer Alyssa Rosenzweig has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/conformant-open-source-support-for-mali-g57.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs now supports the new Valhall architecture.</p>
<p>This open source graphics driver now has <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_980" target="_blank">fully-conformant</a> OpenGL ES 3.1 on Mali-G57, a Valhall GPU, with the final Mesa patches landing and the kernel patches are <a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-misc/commit/?id=5ba99fca1de0272ce05b65f19bcc184b5cb43285" target="_blank">queued for merge upstream</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware, it means the MediaTek Chromebooks with the MT8192 and MT8195 system-on-chips like the ASUS Chromebook Flip CM3 will work out of the box with accelerated graphics providing you have Mesa 22.2 and an appropriate kernel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5171063671654603455gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5171063671654603455gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - ASUS Chromebook Flip CM3</em></p>
<p>Seems it's a nice improvement over the previous generation chip too, with better Vulkan performance and hardware changes to improve other problems they had with the previous generation.</p>

      <title>RimWorld has another upgrade out for Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld on Steam Deck gets even better with the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/294100/announcements/detail/3325358588164752807" target="_blank">update</a>, as the developer continues tweaking to give the best experience possible. While it is thoroughly playable thanks to the last major update, a few lingering issues remained that hopefully this patch will solve.</p>
<p>Specifically for Steam Deck here's what changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed multiple cases where on Steam Deck some keyboard shortcuts were mentioned</li>
<li>Commands now show "button A" glyph instead of "A" label on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>When architect search bar is focused on a Steam Deck and the on-screen keyboard is visible, move gizmos up so that they're still visible.</li>
<li>Added "Keyboard mode" option on Steam Deck in case someone connects a keyboard to the SteamDeck.</li>
<li>Fix: Dismissing on-screen keyboard on SteamDeck doesn't unfocus the text field.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see a previous quick-look I did below:</p>

      <title>iFixit have the Steam Deck Battery prices up but already sold out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">official iFixit launch</a> for Steam Deck replacement parts but one major bit was missing — the Battery. Now though, it seems the store pages for it are properly live and they're already out of stock.</p>
<p>As I was writing this the EU and UK <em>had</em> some stock, I refreshed and they were <em>gone</em> so obviously a few people were waiting ready. Originally, when the initial launch happened there were only placeholder pages for the Battery replacements and no prices. iFixit told various outlets that they didn't currently have a solution to it but it seems that's being solved.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18030585181654597571gol1.jpg"/>Pictured - the full Battery Kit</em></p>
<p>So while you again can't buy it yet, we at least now have the full price required now:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/products/steam-deck-battery?pk_vid=cca664783d4d44f61654597360dbcbf1" target="_blank">UK</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only:  £84.99</li>
<li>Kit:  £89.99</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Miscellanous/Steam-Deck-Battery/IF260-001?o=2" target="_blank">US</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only:  $89.99</li>
<li>Kit:  $94.99</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-battery?pk_vid=cca664783d4d44f61654597323dbcbf1&amp;variant=39920887169105" target="_blank">EU</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only: €89,95</li>
<li>Kit: €94,95</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently they're still missing the replacements for various main buttons. While they have the triggers, they do not have the D-pad, Action buttons, Steam button, Quick Access button and others missing too.</p>

      <title>Gamers Nexus have a fascinating look at the Steam Deck fan situation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For all the hype around the Steam Deck there is one major controversy with the fan. There's two fans being used, with one having a noticeably louder pitch than the other and now Gamers Nexus are attempting to find out why and how bad it is.</p>
<p>Since I've been through both fan types, I can safely say they are very different in the type of noise they give out and it's good to see people with the right equipment attempt to dive into the <em>why</em>. The original fan that was used in the review units is still used, Valve just switch to whatever they have available at production time it seems. The original "Huaying" model sounds more like a nice blower, but the "Delta" fan gives this annoying high-pitch <em>whine</em>. Although, recent fan curve updates from Valve has dramatically helped with that.</p>
<p>In the Gamers Nexus video they do a tear-down of each fan, and you can see there are some pretty big differences. Notable bits being the blade design with the Delta fan blades being much more curved, how close the Delta fan is to the inside casing and the Delta fan outer casing also has bigger cut-outs for airflow too.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the Gamers Nexus video below because it's a good one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G2EEtzhsr2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b615b1138b32bd7b7319c5048413f22f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G2EEtzhsr2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The good news is that if it bothers you, it's clearly real easy to swap the fan for a different one as it's really accessible. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">iFixit are also stocking</a> the original less-noisy fan, although they're out of stock as expected.</p>

      <title>Diablo Immortal works on Steam Deck, plus a fix for Battle.net being slow</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Diablo Immortal is the hot new thing, I decided to attempt to give it a go on Steam Deck. Turns out the Battle.net launcher really hates some connections, here's a fix and a Diablo Immortal video.</p>
<p>Currently, Diablo Immortal does work on Steam Deck (and so Linux desktops too) but it seems gamepad support is not working yet. So you will need to use Steam Input to adjust your configuration of any gamepad or Steam Deck to act like a keyboard and mouse. For the most part, that works reasonably well, not that I would recommend it considering the ridiculous micro-transactions involved in the game.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's the video of it running:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E4J2-nlTzHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99f08895d96545ef532ad0cb18f23e4a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E4J2-nlTzHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You might find the Battle.net launcher which you can install easily with Lutris (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/lutris-now-has-a-flatpak-beta-available-and-updated-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck Lutris Guide</a>) can take <em>forever</em> to actually load or do anything. Now, this might be specific to whatever WiFi hardware you have, in my case it's the Google Mesh WiFi system and Blizzard don't seem to like it. An easy fix though is to manually set your DNS to <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/" target="_blank">1.1.1.1</a> (or any other free DNS service). On Steam Deck, simply right click on the WiFi icon in Desktop Mode and hit Configure Network Connections:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15697545591654511382gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15697545591654511382gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From there in the IPv4 (and IPv6 tab if you use it), switch it to "Automatic (Only addresses)" in the Method dropdown box and then set DNS Servers to 1.1.1.1. After that, disconnect and reconnect via the WiFi icon on your Plasma taskbar at the bottom and then reload Battle.net and it will work properly. It's incredibly weird but it works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8474013301654511169gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8474013301654511169gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you can properly use the Battle.net launcher on Steam Deck, if you also had this weird problem.</p>
<p>You can also add Lutris to Steam as a Non-Steam game, which allows you to launch Lutris and Diablo Immortal in Gaming Mode (so you're not stuck in Desktop Mode). I can confirm that also works just fine.</p>

      <title>GOG Summer Sale now live with new releases from SEGA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For readers who prefer to shop over on GOG, their <a href="https://www.gog.com/summer-sale-2022" target="_blank">Summer Sale</a> has just started along with some new releases.</p>
<p>To go along with it, more SEGA titles are joining GOG with the first being <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/alien_isolation_collection" target="_blank">Alien: Isolation Collection</a>. Plus <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/two_point_hospital" target="_blank">Two Point Hospital</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/warhammer_40000_space_marine" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine</a> are coming soon. All for Windows though but you can try with Wine if you wish.</p>
<p>GOG has a few fun collections up to browser through including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_80s" target="_blank">80's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_90s" target="_blank">90's Games</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_00s" target="_blank">2000's Games</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Their <a href="https://www.gog.com/summer-sale-2022" target="_blank">full sale page is here</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm tempted by <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/metal_gear_solid" target="_blank">Metal Gear Solid</a>. An absolute classic I remember fondly blasting through on the original PlayStation and would love to sit in bed with that on the Steam Deck. It's only 29% off though so not a big discount but should be easy to get going with the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>Additionally, GOG are giving away Sanitarium for 48 hours. Scroll down the <a href="https://www.gog.com/" target="_blank">homepage</a> to find the banner to click.</p>
<p>Let everyone know in the comments if there's a particularly good deal you're going for.</p>
<p>Their sale runs until June 27th, 2022.</p>

      <title>Free to play shooter Rogue Company verified &#39;Playable&#39; on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Company, a free to play shooter from First Watch Games and Hi-Rez Studios recently had an update of Easy Anti-Cheat and now it's confirmed as "Playable" (not fully Verified) on Steam Deck. The situation is a little odd for the Linux desktop though.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, it works out of the box. It's noted as <em>Playable</em>, as it has some text sizing issues and you may need to bring up the on-screen keyboard manually. In my own testing though, it was great. Not only does it perform well but it looks really good and feels like a great fit for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's a look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a39F7N-Upzs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba69e2cb65fbf1589d0a46d313d9a1b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a39F7N-Upzs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On Linux desktop though, there's currently some issues preventing it working properly. If you install Steam as a Flatpak, it seems to work. With a normal Steam install though, a lot of distributions don't have it working. Thankfully, developers RichardYao and "GloriousEggroll" (GE-Proton dev), discovered <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/v4xezh/figured_out_reverts_needed_to_run_rogue_company/" target="_blank">the issue</a> is with glibc 2.35/34. Now the issue is known, hopefully it can be solved so more Linux gamers can play it too.</p>
<p>Free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/872200/Rogue_Company/" target="_blank">play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Endlanders is a glitchy RPG with real-time deck-building grid-based combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Endlanders and the prologue demo Endlanders : First Encounter have a graphics style that reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter and Resolutiion while offering rather different gameplay. A game that offers up a single-player RPG experience, along with a blending of deck-building and real-time grid-based combat wrapped up in a glitchy world.</p>
<p>"Delve into foreign worlds, translate languages, combat enemies and understand the universe."</p>
<p>One fun feature that sets it apart from other grid fighters, is that the grids aren't special stages. You can create a combat grid nearly anywhere, as long as there's enough space, so you're fighting on the map you're exploring.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UN7PcWnqeSk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3899c386c11a781dc27892c8b239f0ac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UN7PcWnqeSk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endlanders/endlanders" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, this game is developed with the free and open source Godot Engine and plans for a release in 2024 but you can play the Endlanders : First Encounter now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2010450/Endlanders__First_Encounter/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Action Quake 2 (AQtion), considered the &#39;precursor&#39; to Counter-Strike now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Action Quake 2 (AQtion), a free and open source first-person shooter that the developers say "spawned one of the most popular and influential games of all time, Counter-Strike" is now available on Steam. Originally developed in 1998 to recreate the look and feel of an action movie, having a fast pace and a semi-realistic damage system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iLc8OnzFpmQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66ed620b1be33d564201e92fc1f8729b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iLc8OnzFpmQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers say the new release has been upgraded, with plenty of polish to make it worth playing.</p>
<p>Various modes available:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Deathmatch - Spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and by default players battle out with only pistol, and a combat knife in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the time or frag limit is reached. Additional "unique" equipment can be picked up throughout, meaning that only one exists on that map at any time.</li>
<li>Capture the Flag - You will have to team up with other players and manage your offense and defense in pursuit of bringing the enemy's flag to your base in order to score. The team that captures the enemy flag the most wins!</li>
<li>Teamplay - Players are split into two teams and play is round based. Players select one primary weapon and one item to use, in addition to the default pistol and knife. The teams spawn on opposite sides of the map and are then let loose to kill each other. If one team eliminates the other, they win the round.</li>
<li>Team Deathmatch - Like Deathmatch but with teams, spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and by default players battle out with only pistol, and a combat knife in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the time or frag limit is reached.</li>
<li>Play Offline - Engage in battle against bots that will challenge your skills both with and without using your network connection. You can adjust their capability as well as select from several game modes.</li>
<li>Espionage - Similar to teamplay mode, with the exception that the team points are awarded based on successful completion of a scenario. Players also respawn periodically, a fixed amount of time, if a certain amount of members of the team are dead, or instantly. Scenario types CNH, CTB and OFC are continuous play, as in there's no 'end' to a round until the roundlimit or timelimit is reached. The others types rounds end when an objective is met.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ScummVM, the excellent open source software that bundles together multiple game engines has a new release coming and now it's <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20220605/" target="_blank">time to help test</a>.</p>

<li>Added support for the RetroWave OPL3 sound card.</li>

      <title>Gravitar: Recharged released from Atari revamping another classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another remake of a classic has landed, with Atari's Gravitar from the 80s now being available on Steam with Gravitar: Recharged. This was was in collaboration with developers Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox, along with artist and composer Megan McDuffee.</p>
<p>Blending the action of Asteroids and Space Duel, along with the physics fun of Lunar Lander, Gravitar was pretty popular back in the day and remembered quite fondly for the challenge but it was not a commercial hit at release. Perhaps now it might do a little better?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zAeimDfxYWY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3fdc9aa1edb2cf7b3b1158048c3191df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zAeimDfxYWY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gravitar: Recharged Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Far from Home: Travel across the galaxy in arcade mode, visiting planets to progress through ever-more-challenging solar systems in a quest to get home     </li>
<li>Explore, Triumph, Repeat: Take on 24 distinct missions, aiming to climb global leaderboards and assert yourself as the ultimate space adventurer     </li>
<li>Powerful Power-Ups: Utilizing the tech at your disposal, make use of your tractor beam to grab power-ups including homing missiles and electrifying EMP disruptors     </li>
<li>Not so Lonely Anymore: No longer doomed to wander the universe alone, play with a partner in each game mode. Connect to your player two via a tether and work together to accomplish each goal and make your way home.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905430/Gravitar_Recharged" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Since Atari seem to be going back through their classics to bring out updated version, is there a particular game you want them to do next?</p>

      <title>Craftomation 101 merges survival, crafting and automation programming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the developer of while True: learn() and Learning Factory comes yet another game with programming. Craftomation 101 brings together elements of a survival game, crafting and automation.</p>
<p>The idea is to help teach visual programming in a fun way, letting you tell robots what to do while helping them to survive on a frozen planet. Your mission is to make the planet habitable so you need to build up resources, make tools, melt ice, plant trees and produce oxygen. You could do it yourself, but with an army of programmable robots, why not get them to do it?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rdaPcULSnCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab76881a2aed9cd0562427c08805f9f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rdaPcULSnCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in an email, the developer explained how the idea came about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically, it all started when one of us (not me) tried to create a piece of javascript to try all the craft combinations in one really nice web game. But it’s too silly to be the reason for creating a whole game (okay it was me and I was kinda close to succeeding with this javascript).</p>
<p>The other piece of this puzzle was in a huge spreadsheet with feedback from players of our previous game <strong>while True: learn()</strong>. A lot of players asked us to add more “real programming” in our next games.</p>
<p>Another thing we were inspired by was an amazing article <em>Artificial Living Plants</em> by Edward F. Moore (1956). It was dedicated to using self-replicating machines for resource mining and production (not just on Earth, but on other planets as well). Additionally I was shocked by the idea of Freeman Dyson who proposed using self-replicating machines to deliver ice from Enceladus to Mars to help with terraforming.</p>
<p>It all lead us to brainstorming: what kind of game could encompass all those amazing concepts, while showcasing programming as a really useful tool for automating various systems, small or huge?</p>
<p>To be honest, “self-replicating programmable robots used for terraforming” sounds really charming, inspiring, and awesome to us. We simply had to try and make this concept into something playable!</p>
<p>The work began in early 2021, as our artist Alex started making sketches, while Dima and Ivan were getting familiar with the Defold game engine (read below) and how it works with Spine animations.</p>
<p>But the real push for us was Ludum Dare 48, which happened in April '21. This online event suggests participants to develop their games in 48 or 72 hours sprints, and we at Luden.io have a long lasting tradition of participating in it.</p>
<p>After a short brainstorm, we decided to make a game about mining resources and investing them into something - something cool, like building a rocket! So we’ve piled up some premade art assets, ideas that could be implemented in a short period of time, and a lot of coffee - and made it into a prototype.</p>
<p>That was a glitchy, but fun little game. After reading 30+ cheerful comments with tons of kind words and meaningful feedback, we thought that the concept was worth working on.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s another big Queer Games Bundle live on itch.io for 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to support queer creators? Now is a good chance for you, while also grabbing a whole chunk of games too in the Queer Games Bundle 2022.</p>
<p>This is another example of how great the game store itch.io is, with it previously hosting multiple mega charity bundles. This one is a bit different though, since you will be <em>directly</em> supporting various developers. Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/itchio-hosting-a-huge-queer-games-bundle-2021-with-hundreds-included/" target="_blank">last year</a>, it comes in two editions with a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1404/queer-games-bundle-2022" target="_blank">main bundle</a> and a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1405/queer-games-bundle-2022-pay-what-you-can-edition" target="_blank">pay what you can</a> edition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month. </p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life changing way and in exchange you get over 500 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buying it helps support over 400 different creators and gain access to over 500 incredible varied experiences, no doubt a bit of something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>The main bundle has already raised over $20,000 at time of writing and it runs for another month so there's plenty of time to look through it.</p>

      <title>Hands of Necromancy is an upcoming GZDoom powered dark fantasy shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love retro shooters? How about those with a little magical flair to them and dark fantasy? The GZDoom engine powered Hands of Necromancy is coming to Steam with a teaser demo up now.</p>
<p>The developer explains that it's a metroidvania styled game, in the spirit of the classics like Heretic. Looks pretty great too, and also awesome to see more developer use the thoroughly versatile cross-platform GZDoom instead of reinventing the wheel again for a game engine that's well suited for the classic FPS style and mechanics. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ga11coGneIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c96e7b75364f5aac2b3eb59d3abc031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ga11coGneIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore many beautiful environments - a country side, a forest, a cemetery, a castle, an ice cave, a volcano, and more - all teeming with danger to prove yourself against, as their denizens try to destroy you.</li>
<li>Get weapons, use magic spells, and learn transformations to fight your enemies, using their own abilities against them and bending nature to your own will.</li>
<li>Use the Tornado Spell to toss your enemies away with wind, or the Ring of Ice to freeze them solid, or even an Unholy Hand Grenade to blow them to smithereens!</li>
<li>Gain transformations as you grow in power - become the Swamp Serpent who can slither into tight spaces while breathing underwater, or the Stone Breaker Golem that smashes walls into tiny bits, the Hell Burner Demon that safely walks on lava, or even a flying Wyvern!</li>
<li>All of them are your key to defeating the many creatures in this metroidvania, as you explore the 21 maps in 3 giant and exciting hubs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Old Skies is an upcoming time travel adventure from Wadjet Eye Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great looking point and click adventure is on the way from Wadjet Eye Games! They just recently teased their latest called Old Skies. They also confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/WadjetEyeGames/status/1532053665137274880" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it will support Linux too and there will be a demo available during Steam Next Fest which happens next week.</p>
<p>"Time Travel is real and history is up for grabs! In this point-and-click, you play Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency. Your job is to keep close watch on seven travelers who have the desire (and the bank accounts) to sightsee in the past. Some are simply curious. Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The wonderful Oxygen Not Included from Klei Entertainment has seen a big free update released, which also brings with it full support for the Steam Deck and it's now Verified.</p>
<p>Klei said they spent a few months improving performance for both the base game and the DLC, along with lots of tweaks that might not be noticed individually but altogether it should add up to a much more playable game overall especially later on when there's lots going on.</p>
<p>Check out their new animated short too:</p>

<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ranching gameplay improvements, including gaining Husbandry experience during Critter grooming</li>
<li>Fixed many Critter bugs</li>
<li>Improvements to UI and Critter performance</li>
<li>Significant memory savings on both new and late-game saves</li>
<li>Added four new Duplicants</li>
<li>Added four new Critter morphs</li>
<li>Added new Overjoyed trait: Yodeler</li>

<li>Steam Deck compatibility verified</li>
<li>Speeding Things Up</li>
<li>We’ve made a significant reduction to the amount of memory that ONI takes up on your system. Plus, frame times have been reduced—great news for very large bases—and the New Game and Load Game screens now open faster. </li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck now lets you override display resolution for games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have some games on Steam Deck that won't get the right resolution? Now you can force them into what you want. This will be useful for quite a lot of retro games especially, and some that just won't behave.</p>
<p>Announced as part of a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287861418016" target="_blank">update</a>, you can now go into the Properties menu of any app on Steam Deck and select to force the resolution:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10808615751654247666gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10808615751654247666gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/564345141654247666gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/564345141654247666gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the full update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Game Resolution setting to App Properties, allowing players to override the max display resolution for games, on a a per-game basis</li>
<li>Added mouse cursor (using right trackpad) for built-in web browser interactions when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Improved default aspect ratio behavior for external monitors - games will now default to 1280x800 for 16:10 external displays and 1280x720 for all other external displays</li>
<li>Improved UI performance in game carousels</li>
<li>Improved UI performance when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Improved controller order when using external gamepads to assign the controller slots by the order of input. This should help with compatibility in games which locked onto the Steam Deck controller.</li>
<li>Fixed 'Enable updated fan control' toggle not remembering its state across reboots</li>
<li>Fixed Bluetooth controllers not working on the lockscreen</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting issues on the Steam Deck Chord Summary page</li>
<li>Fixed issue preventing deletion of some controller layouts</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled adaptive brightness toggle, as it was causing performance and stability issues. Big thanks to the community for catching this weird bug - we're working on a fix for it now.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve reveals the top 10 most played Steam Deck titles and they&#39;re all fully Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just put up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3332113352306852873" target="_blank">another</a> of their round-up posts going over all the recent work on the Steam Deck, and they also revealed the current most popular titles.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>For regular readers this won't be news since I go over the changes often but it's still a good catch-up for those who have fallen a bit behind on the news. Some of what's new includes the lock screen, multiple window support, keyboard improvements, external display upgrades, per-application performance profiles, improved fan behaviour and more. Check out their video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZtkISSyZYSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5ae9bff9f932f2823d5c3bce1d4cdb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZtkISSyZYSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what's popular based on user play-time (<a href="https://twitter.com/gregcoomer/status/1532876301014421506" target="_blank">source</a>), over the last month these were the most popular on Steam Deck</p>
<ul>
<li>Elden Ring </li>
<li>Vampire Survivors </li>
<li>Rogue Legacy 2 </li>
<li>Stardew Valley </li>
<li>No Man's Sky </li>
<li>Slay the Spire </li>
<li>Hades </li>
<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </li>
<li>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth </li>
<li>Aperture Desk Job</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve was keen to point out that it's not just because of Steam Deck upgrades or Proton, but effort directly from developers too and four of those titles were previously listed as Unsupported or Playable until they got updated to be Verified. They're making a clear and obvious point: if developers get their games supported, players are more likely to buy them and spend time in them — not exactly a big surprise. Plenty of us just want to play games and not have to tinker so hopefully more will get cracking on updating their games.</p>

      <title>Splitgate the free online FPS with portals has Season 2 live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mixing together some fast-paced shooter with a bit of a Halo feel and portals like out of Valve's Portal series, Splitgate has a big new update out now.</p>
<p>While there's plenty of new content additions, one of the biggest changes is to the matchmaking system. Matchmaker 2.0 brings with it faster and smarter matchmaking with human players (less bot matches), players can now be added into an in-progress unranked match if it began less than a minute prior, players are more likely to hop directly into a match than having to be in a waiting area and much more.</p>
<p>There's also three new game modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Juggernaut </strong>(Free For All): Every player against one (hard to kill) Juggernaut selected at random. Score points by surviving as the Juggernaut.</li>
<li><strong>Hotzone </strong>(Team): Capture and control the neutral zone for 30 seconds to score a point. </li>
<li><strong>Lockdown </strong>(Team): Score a point by controlling all three hills at the same time. After each point, the hills move.</li>
</ul>
<p>A new progression system is also in, they revamped the interface, big additions to the map editor and the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/splitgate-beta-season-2-patch-notes" target="_blank">list goes on</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bLbqB6DmEfA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fce69ca6884054105f59dcbf336ea928.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bLbqB6DmEfA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game definitely feels a lot better than when I tried it previously. While it was fun before, it did have a few minor tech troubles (especially in the Linux build there were some quirks) but it seems to be thoroughly smooth now, seems like they improved it a lot overall. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Splitgate is free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/" target="_blank">play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>System76 and HP bring the HP Dev One with Pop!_OS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/hp-teamed-up-with-system76-for-the-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os-linux/" target="_blank">we reported previously</a>, The HP Dev One is a new laptop collaboration from System76 and HP that brings Pop!_OS Linux to even more people. It's now available to order.</p>
<p>Quite an exciting one, as it's always good to see more vendors dip their toes into selling and supporting Linux machines directly. Not only that, it's interesting because it's one hardware vendor teaming up with another. Hopefully this is the shape of things to come with more collaboration. Right now it's only available in the USA and priced at $1,099.</p>
<p>Some key specifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processor</strong> - AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong> - 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR4 3200 MT/s (2 SODIMM)</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> - 1 TB PCIe 3x4 NVMe M.2 2280 SSD</li>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> - AMD Radeon Graphics</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - 14” diagonal FHD LED UWWA for HD Webcam (1920x1080) (1000 Nits)</li>
<li><strong>Audio</strong> - Dual stereo speakers, 2 multi-array microphone</li>
<li><strong>Wireless</strong> - Realtek RTL8822CE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac (2x2) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 combo</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong> - HP Smart 65 W External AC power adapter</li>
<li><strong>Ports</strong> - 2 SuperSpeed USB Type-C 10Gbps signaling rate (USB Power Delivery, DisplayPortTM 1.4); 2 SuperSpeed USB Type- A 5Gbps signaling rate (1 charging); 1 headphone/ microphone combo; 1 HDMI 2.0; 1 AC power</li>
<li><strong>Battery</strong> - HP Long Life 3-cell, 53 Wh Li-ion</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong> - 12.73 x 8.44 x 0.75 in; 32.34 x 21.46 x 1.91 cm</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“System76 is thrilled to work with HP to advance open source and bring the Linux desktop to a much wider audience,” said Carl Richell, CEO, System76. “By bringing together our engineering, marketing, and customer support, System76 with HP are introducing HP Dev One to combine powerful hardware with optimized Pop!_OS for the app dev community.”</p>
<p>“Pop!_OS development and innovation has always been a top priority for System76,” said Jeremy Soller, principal engineer, System76. “We are working to develop new features and optimize current ones into Pop!_OS at a much faster pace than previously possible.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8600261501654195858gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8600261501654195858gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>“Software developers are looking for a device that is customized and optimized for the way they code,” said Tylitha Stewart, Vice President and Global Head of Consumer Services and Subscriptions, HP Inc. “By working with System76, we are meeting this need and providing a premium experience with Linux Pop!_OS preinstalled to deliver the new HP Dev One. The device has features important to developers including an optional Linux keyboard tuned with a super key and designed to be more efficient at the core.”</p>
<p>I'm hoping to see a review unit, so keep an eye out for what I think in the coming weeks. I might also be having a chat with System76 CEO Carl Richell about it soon too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck already hits over 5% of Linux users on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out for May 2022, and while it sees a tiny drop in the overall Linux user share, we can see the Steam Deck rising up. As usual, our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> has been updated for the latest figures, with a screenshot of the current status below for all to see:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12386350071654155336gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12386350071654155336gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Currently the overall Linux share is <u>1.12%</u>. Still a pretty clear upwards trend, and drops in a couple months are to be expected as that's just how things go. No doubt it will bounce up again within a couple months. The interesting thing to see now though, is how the Steam Deck will affect it since Valve actually hooked up the survey in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-gets-per-app-performance-profiles-hardware-survey-and-loads-more/" target="_blank">recent Steam Deck update</a>.</p>
<p>When filtering to <em>just</em> Linux, here's the current top:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 12.85% +0.53%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 11.75% -2.53%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 11.09% -0.46%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 8.04% +8.04%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 5.97% -0.39%</li>
<li>"SteamOS Holo" 64 bit 5.23% +5.23%</li>
<li>Other 45.07% +6.46%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So it might look like Arch Linux is on top at a quick glance, but not quite, since you need to take into account the various versions of Ubuntu as people tend to stick to LTS releases for years. The real interesting thing to see though is <strong>SteamOS Holo</strong>, which is the Arch-based Steam Deck operating system already hitting well over 5% of Linux users on Steam. Not only that, the Steam Deck GPU "AMD AMD Custom GPU 0405" is shown as the second most popular already for just Linux systems on Steam.</p>
<p>Using May's 1.12% share, that puts Linux users at around ~1,478,400 estimated "monthly active users" based on the last time Valve gave out their user data. You could say that to be around ~77,320 Steam Deck users, although keep in mind it’s an additional device for a lot of people, it depends where the survey is taken. The actual number is likely higher.</p>

      <title>Valve delay the Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a move that's not exactly unexpected, Valve has now delayed the launch of the official Steam Deck Docking Station.</p>
<p>Written in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287857025157" target="_blank">official update</a>, the Valve team said it was due to both a shortage of parts and closures at their manufacturing facility due to COVID. No further date has been given and they said they will share more info when they have it. The good news though is that the schedule for shipping the actual Steam Deck is not affected as it's different parts and a different factory responsible for it.</p>
<p>Valve ended the post by mentioning how they continue to improve the "docked experience for Steam Deck with all USB-C hubs and external displays".</p>
<p>Right now, the docked experience isn't the best. For all the pros the Steam Deck has, the docked experience is something of a sore spot. It's a mixture of things between issues in the KDE Plasma desktop when connecting up external monitors, to resolution issues in Gaming Mode when docked. The problems are all solvable and for the most part it works but there's a lot of quirks left to solve. Valve may not have said so, but it's likely also a big factor in the decision not to release it yet.</p>
<p>If you are after a USB Hub that works well, I've used <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B099F6R6TC/" target="_blank">this</a> for months now and it has been working nicely for me.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect - Gangs DLC and free Kite update announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox and Double Eleven have announced the Prison Architect: Gangs expansion, along with the free Kite update. Here's what to expect from it.</p>
<p>I don't think this exactly needs much of an explanation does it? I think we all know what a gang is huh? Inmates will now form up, with different groups having their own personality and reputation inside your prison. As gangs grow and flex their power, things might get a little bit heated. Thankfully, you get a few new tricks to deal with them too.</p>
<p>Gangs DLC Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meet the gang: </strong>Gangs form and grow by gang members arriving by in-take or by recruitment. Each gang has its own personality and traits, and will naturally be drawn to recruiting prisoners with the same specific attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Now you can measure your inmates and your prison’s “temperature”. As gangs grow and begin to flex their strength, the 'danger temperature' of your prison will rise. Thanks to the 'Boiling point' UI, you get a detailed overview of what's affecting the life of your inmates, allowing you to act swiftly, keeping them happy, and preventing irrepressible riots.</li>
<li><strong>Reform and release:</strong> Gang members are now allowed to leave their crew, help them come clean by removing their tattoos and enrolling them in the Gang Rehabilitation Program.</li>
<li><strong>New rooms: </strong>Use the Tattoo Removal Room to remove gangs' tattoos, or have gang members train in the Fight Club Room, turning their destructive energy into fighting in a controlled environment.</li>
<li><strong>Crooked guards: </strong>Gangs may coerce guards into smuggling contraband or accepting bribes. You can vet guards during the hiring process (Bureaucracy) as well as recruit C.I.s to identify guards that have turned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their brief and not very useful announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="54LgqxKijmo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b490b6fae8bed6e323f5a59996e748c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/54LgqxKijmo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Gangs introduces a whole slew of creative challenges for Wardens to overcome. While it sounds intimidating, the Gangs expansion keeps things fun and light-hearted for our players," says Gaz Wright, Game Director on Prison Architect at Double Eleven. “We designed the reformation features to feel authentic while giving wardens clever options to handle gangs and increase their population's happiness. Gangs expands Prison Architect's management gameplay and adds enjoyable new mechanics, offering players a fuller and more fun gaming experience."</p>
<p>Due to release "soon" but no actual date given yet.</p>
<p>The free Kite expansion releasing at the same time will add in more wardens, guard dogs, room sizes, prison capacity options, improvements to the game menus and tweaks to other mechanics.</p>
<p>You can buy Prison Architect from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/prison_architect?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/prison-architect?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Golfie mixes together minigolf with a deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've seen a few attempts to spice-up Golf like Golf with Your Friends which is great but how about blending it together with a deck-building card game? Golfie is the answer to that. Note: key provided for me. It works out of the box on Linux desktop and the Steam Deck, thanks to Steam Play Proton.</p>
<p>"Deckbuilding meets minigolf in Golfie – the only game in which you can power-up and modify realtime golf shots by collecting and crafting a deck of cards."</p>
<p>It's the game you know (and love?) but with the main quirk being your shots can be changed and warped with cards. You will need to use them too, as the courses are quite varied and need you to hop over obstacles or shoot around corners. It mostly works too and there's a lot of replay value here.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i8cjYU9nbPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6298f6a1d4ea8f52e56f7782406ccfb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i8cjYU9nbPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a pretty great idea actually, and with it being in Early Access it has plenty of room to grow and tweak the cards and the maps available to expand on the initial set. The developer expects to keep it in Early Access for around 9 months with plans to add in new cards, power-ups, course options and modes.</p>
<p>Like any good deck-builder, you get an initial set of cards and it does take a good few runs to really get into it but thanks to the unlocks system you can really do some ridiculous stuff with the cards. Hovering your ball in the air with a jetpack, to smash it across the course is always hilarious.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Four distinct biomes such as Cherry Garden and the Dungeon to pitch and putt your way through</li>
<li>Procedurally generated nature of each hole, meaning no two courses are the same</li>
<li>Cards, coins and perks to collect on your way to golfing glory</li>
<li>Incredible shot synergies which can result in extraordinarily powerful ways to play – can you get a hole in *none*?</li>
<li>Entirely randomised courses or compete against the world in Daily Runs, which offer one chance to play the same course as the rest of the world</li>
<li>Free play mode offers mini golf without the pressure</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/golfie?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579020/Golfie/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom gets a Steam Deck update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom from Game Atelier and DG Entertainment recently gained a small but sweet update to improve gameplay on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While it's currently tagged as "Unsupported" by Valve, this should hopefully bump it up to fully Verified. It previously had an issue where all the button mapping icons where broken. This latest update adds full support for the Steam Deck controls, and additionally adds in native 16:10 aspect ratio support too. Thanks to that update, Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom should now be a great experience on Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ufE6mOdZ2U0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5fe705f96f83214eeef3b82cbcc93cda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ufE6mOdZ2U0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Six awesome forms</strong> with unique combat and platforming abilities to make your adventure exciting from start to finish.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock new paths and secrets with special equipment:</strong> look for magic weapons and items that gradually open up the world.</li>
<li><strong>Over 15 hours of epic adventure:</strong> explore the new Monster World in a vast interconnected environment.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Drawn animations:</strong> characters and enemies come to life with detailed animations and fun facial expressions.</li>
<li><strong>Soundtrack from iconic Japanese composers:</strong> Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Michiru Yamane, Keiki Kobayashi and Takeshi Yanagawa.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/449610/Monster_Boy_and_the_Cursed_Kingdom/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Or you can buy it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/monster_boy_and_the_cursed_kingdom" target="_blank">GOG</a> if you want to try it with Wine.</p>
<p>Here's a short look at it running on a Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Steam Client Update released with Remote Play improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a small <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/139004" target="_blank">update</a> to the stable version of the Steam Client, with it mostly being about fixing up Remote Play. It's not a big surprise to see the focus on Remote Play right now with the Steam Deck, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2 update</a> bringing full Remote Play Together compatibility for the Deck too.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved desktop capture quality on Windows, now supporting variable framerates</li>
<li>Fixed crash on Windows when the stream resolution is changed</li>
<li>Fixed streaming connections failing after Steam has been restarted</li>
<li>Fixed Remote Play Together dialogs occasionally not resizing correctly</li>
<li>Fixed color quality when streaming from Linux to Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS/Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed game install/update failing for Steam libraries installed on a filesystem that does not support preallocation (e.g. ExFAT, FAT32)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see the Linux fixes there too, another reason to love the Steam Deck as it means other parts of Steam / Linux keep getting fixed up.</p>

      <title>Try out the demo for Ragtag Crew, a turn-based tactical rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo arriving as part of the DreamHack Beyond event, Ragtag Crew seems like a promising upcoming turn-based tactical rogue-lite to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Plenty of options to build up a full squad of scavengers, that you will send across a wasteland in pursuit of profit, food and lots of battles too of course. The developer mentions that each class not only has the usual differing abilities but also a little personality thrown into the mix that will provide an "unrepeatable adventure", as the combat is broken up by little events and each choice you make changes the history of your squad with a big pool of events to pull from.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NyB_RIHGG18"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3b960ef5ed7bf64f22df3329d28393e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NyB_RIHGG18" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Each run, choose 3 characters out of 8 classes (some unlockable). Experiment with synergies and party compositions to slay everyone in your way!</li>
<li>Every character can choose a personality from the 7 available (some unlockable). These influence their dialogue, battle capabilities, relationships, morale, stats, and overall style — but most importantly, they can drastically change the course of events.</li>
<li>The heart of the game lies in the tough tactical fights. The enemies are strong, but often have flaws to exploit. Adapt, improve, overcome!</li>
<li>Slay bosses… or sneak past. These large and unique enemies come with their own mechanics and storylines. The rewards may be game-changing — but are you in a good enough condition to take them on? Sometimes it’s smarter to walk past a fight.</li>
<li>As you progress through the game, more options become available.</li>
<li>Every node on the map offers a text event. A smart choice can grant you loot, help two characters form a bond, or hint at the deeper truth behind the events. An unsuccessful one might end in a disaster.</li>
<li>Over the course of an adventure the party members will grow to become friends… or bitter enemies. Nudge their stories to receive unique events and outcomes!</li>
<li>From cute baby lizards to passionate fighter-pilgrims, all kinds of characters may aid you on your journey.</li>
<li>A mixture of post-apoc, Westerns, and sci-fi creates a relatable yet original world. "Firefly meets Douglas Adams."</li>
<li>Try again. Most bands of misfits fail — this is a roguelite, after all. But even failed runs bring progress in the form of unlockable classes, personalities, and items. You’ll be better equipped next time — and the game’s high variance offers high replayability.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/882590/Ragtag_Crew/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's due for release later this year with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Fate of Iberia is out along with a free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best strategy games around has grown with the Crusader Kings III: Fate of Iberia DLC now available, along with the usual Paradox free update for all players. Paradox call it a "flavor pack", so it's not quite a full expansion but has enough new content that looks like it may be worth picking up.</p>
<p>"A centuries long Struggle will force you to rethink how to achieve your goals, as a variety of interested and competing parties fight to impose their will on the Iberian Peninsula."</p>
<p>Features in the DLC include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Struggle system: Entirely new system for historic conflict, available to modders and other content creators.</li>
<li>Decide the Fate of Iberia: Choose the path of conciliation or the path of conquest as you unite Spain or, alternately, agree to a peaceful division of spoils.</li>
<li>New content: Two new Legacy tracks (Metropolitan and Coterie), new cultural traits emphasizing special historical characteristics of the Iberian peninsula, new friendship interactions and duels over the chessboard.</li>
<li>New Events: Dynamic historical events related to the struggle for Iberia.</li>
<li>New Art: New character art reflecting Iberian cultures of the medieval era, new unit designs, new 3D models of holdings and artifacts  and a host of new art for backgrounds, events and loading.</li>
<li>New Music: Additions to the Crusader Kings III soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w0Av16wx6Y8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de7aa75d314a377afd86f01fa3c9f3ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w0Av16wx6Y8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for the free update, this is what's new there for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can now convert to Era Zaharrak when you're an established Basque-cultured sinner in your current faith</li>
<li>Several faiths can now have the same Head of Faith:
	<ul>
<li>Several Islamic faiths now share a Head of Faith at game start, temporal Islamic faiths need to decide on creation which existing caliph they'll submit to (optional for Muhakkima &amp; Zandaqa)</li>
<li>Conversos, Mozarabic, Insular and Catholic all have the Pope as their Head of Faith</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Rite tenet, allowing theocratic faiths to retain their old Head of Faith on creation if they don't differ too heavily from their mother faith</li>
<li>Added Mozarabic Christianity as a Rite-faith, sharing their Head of Faith with Catholicism</li>
<li>Reworked the Found Aragon decision to create Aragonese culture, be more frequent, and allow for slight varieties in Aragonese</li>
<li>Reworked the Avenge the Battle of Tours decision: it now shifts Aquitaine under the De Jure of Hispania when taken as it’s hard to accomplish.</li>
<li>Reworked the Form Portugal Decision: it can now be taken during the opportunity phase of the Struggle without being independent.</li>
<li>Added new special contracts for Clans: Marriage Favor, Jizya, Iqta, and Ghazi</li>
<li>Added a new faction type: the Dissolution faction will destroy the primary titles of their target, removing a Realm from the map</li>
<li>Added a new 867 Bookmark for Iberia: play one of the influential vassals and forge the destiny of your dynasty!</li>
<li>Added a dozen of new emblems for Coat of Arms and new patterns for Iberian cultures</li>
<li>Added a new field “Face item” for the Barbershop to, well, customize the character’s face</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the DLC is priced around $6.99 / £5.19 / €6.99.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 515.48.07 out now, Gamescope improvements and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA released a brand new stable driver release for Linux, building on the previous Beta that released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">along with their new open source kernel modules</a>. Version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/189809/en-us" target="_blank">515.48.07</a> contains all on the updates from the 515.43.04 Beta, along with some additional improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog:</p>
<div class="tabcontent" id="tab1_content" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Published the source code to a variant of the NVIDIA Linux kernel modules dual-licensed as MIT/GPLv2. The source is available here:<br/>
	https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules<br/>
	and will be updated each driver release. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf and VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier Vulkan extensions. To use this functionality, the nvidia-drm kernel module must be loaded with DRM KMS mode setting enabled. See the DRM KMS section of the README for guidance on enabling mode setting.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-suspend.service, nvidia-resume.service, and nvidia-hibernate.service to use WantedBy= rather than RequiredBy= dependencies for systemd-suspend.service and systemd-hibernate.service. This avoids a problem where suspend or hibernate fails if the NVIDIA driver is uninstalled without disabling these services first.<br/>
	See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/21991<br/>
	If these services were manually enabled, it may be necessary to update their dependencies by running<br/>
	sudo systemctl reenable nvidia-suspend.service nvidia-resume.service nvidia-hibernate.service</li>
<li>Interlaced modes are now disabled when active stereo is enabled.</li>
<li>NVIDIA X Server Settings will now display the quit confirmation dialog automatically if only there are pending changes that need to be manually saved. The corresponding configuration option to control the appearance of the quit dialog was thus also removed.</li>
<li>Removed the warning message about mismatches between the compiler used to build the Linux kernel and the compiler used to build the NVIDIA kernel modules from nvidia-installer. Modern compilers are less likely to cause problems when this type of mismatch occurs, and it has become common in many distributions to build the Linux kernel with a different compiler than the default system compiler.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to skip test-loading the kernel modules on systems where no supported NVIDIA GPUs are detected.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to avoid a race condition which could cause the kernel module test load to fail due to udev automatically loading kernel modules left over from an existing NVIDIA driver installation. This failure resulted in an installation error message "Kernel module load error: File exists".</li>
<li>Updated the RTD3 Video Memory Utilization Threshold (NVreg_DynamicPowerManagementVideoMemoryThreshold) maximum value from 200 MB to 1024 MB.</li>
<li>Improved performance of GLX and Vulkan applications running in gamescope.</li>
<li>Added a "kernelopen" feature tag to the supported-gpus.json file, to indicate which GPUs are compatible with open-gpu-kernel-modules.</li>
<li>Improved Vulkan swapchain creation failure reporting. Applications can use the VK_EXT_debug_utils extension to receive additional information when an error was encountered in vkCreateSwapchainKHR().</li>
<li>Added a new configuration option for NVIDIA NGX to allow disabling the DSO signature check. See the "NGX" chapter of the README for more information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where HDMI audio output was not working in some cases, especially with high display refresh rates (120Hz, 100Hz, etc.) using Fixed Rate Link (FRL) transmission mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be fantastic once <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> works fully with NVIDIA, as it's one of the absolutely most useful projects around. Used by the Steam Deck, it fully controls the window for games so they don't mess with your system at all. Great for multi-monitor uses too, as lots of games like to misbehave. It also provides some added extras to allow you to control scaling, add in FSR and more. This driver is another step towards it.</p>

      <title>In the relaxing sim Sprout Valley you&#39;re a cute cat farming a tiny island</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sprout Valley looks quite sweet. A game where you play as Nico, a cute cat that has stepped away from their busy life to clean up a tiny island and create a nice farm. One I missed that had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zefrost/sprout-valley-chill-and-relaxing-experience" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> that finished earlier this month.</p>
<p>It's like a mini accessible animal-based Stardew Valley. You plant and water your crops, collect resources and sell them to keep progressing. There's a dynamic weather system, which the developer said will add-in some additional mechanics to the game too. What really makes it interesting is that each island is procedurally generated with a seed system, so you can play through the game an endless amount of times and share world seeds with others.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ecUjzb5D4T0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d6a0253213e77f05ea30e1560e74f06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ecUjzb5D4T0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said it will also feature an events system, a full storyline, foraging, fishing, multiple islands, a quest system, an upgrades system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Looks like one we're going to need to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>You can try out the experimental builds from <a href="https://zefrost.itch.io/sprout-valley" target="_blank">itch.io</a> right now and wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964820/Sprout_Valley/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Made with Godot Engine, it offers Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Crystal Project is a wonderful new RPG you need to pick up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love classic JRPGs? Final Fantasy? Or anything like it? Well, Crystal Project released recently from developer Andrew Willman and it's quite wonderful.</p>
<p>It arrived on Steam back at the end of March, which somehow I missed actually covering even though I have been playing it and enjoying it thoroughly. Bringing back fond memories of playing through some classics on Game Boy Advance it really does scratch the itch for some adventuring and exploration. Seems most players on Steam agree too, with it seeing a Very Positive rating and the developer has a Native Linux build too that seems to work to perfection.</p>
<p>There's two things that really pull you in with Crystal Project. The first being the graphics with it mixing in flat-looking pixel characters in a 3D world that resembles Minecraft / Minecraft Dungeons in the presentation. Then there's the non-linear nature to it, as you're free to explore at your own pace and do what you want.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rr3T1Kdhtiw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d9d754ea4ab9e3b28de7638183aa7ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rr3T1Kdhtiw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No random encounters!</li>
<li>Manage Threat to control which party member a monster will attack.</li>

      <title>ROTA is a cute and colourful gravity-bending puzzle-platformer worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It might look colourful and inviting but don't let that fool you, ROTA is going to test your brain with its gravity-defying puzzle mechanics.</p>
<p>As you walk over the edge of each section, you begin to rotate gravity and then use pushing, pulling and rotating mechanics with blocks to get through each stage and solve the puzzles. Gravity affects the blocks you use too, and you need to position them in the right place to get over various obstacles.</p>
<p>It's simple and effective but the developer was pretty creative with the setting to the point that it will keep you interested, while also make you scratch your head a few times with the added challenging of collecting all the gems. If you love puzzle-platformers, it's definitely one you need to take a look at.</p>

      <title>SCS put the Heart of Russia DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 on hold for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Software have put out a statement about the Heart of Russia upcoming DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and they've decided not to release it. With the ongoing barbaric invasion of Ukraine from Russia, it's not exactly surprising that releasing a DLC expansion for a game that's focused on Russia might cause problems.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/05/heart-of-russia-dlc-statement.html" target="_blank">statement</a>, SCS mentioned how they "try to be as apolitical as possible" but in this case, they simply could not stay silent on it "with so many people suffering, we decided to refrain from releasing the DLC so that it is not perceived in any way as being in support of or tolerance of the aggression".</p>
<p>Sounds like it's not completely cancelled though, as they will hold onto it until Ukraine can "rebuild and heal" so they will then "endeavour to find a way for our Heart of Russia DLC to play whatever part it can in that healing process, for everyone".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20980082261653929649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A tough situation for SCS to navigate through, considering all the effort they put into their work and their DLC are usually quite well received too due to the work they put in to capture the essence of the areas they add in.</p>
<p>You can buy ETS2 from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/euro-truck-simulator-2?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Indie classic Super Hexagon gets a big free Neo update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Hexagon, a true indie gem classic from Terry Cavanagh has a big update out now and it has also become Steam Deck Verified with it. Previously available in Beta, it's now in the Stable branch for all players.</p>
<p>While the gameplay is the same, a lot of the tech behind the game was rewritten to perform better, along with much improved gamepad / controller support. This is only the start too, with a Part 2 coming at some point that has also been teased. Developer Ethan Lee wrote some comments about the work involved on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1531298835368005632" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and you can see the <a href="https://superhexagon.com/neo/" target="_blank">Neo update page</a> for the full details.</p>

<p>This should keep the game running smoothly on all platforms for a long time to come.</p>
<p>You can buy it in many places like <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/super-hexagon?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/Super_Hexagon/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/super-hexagon" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/super_hexagon?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>The QuickLaunch plugin for the Steam Deck is a great time-saver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Deck you can install various third-party games and applications in desktop mode. However, it's a bit annoying adding them all to Steam and so the QuickLaunch plugin can save you some time.</p>
<p>Making great use of the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a>, this <a href="https://github.com/Fisch03/SDH-QuickLaunch" target="_blank">QuickLaunch</a> plugin gives you a list in the Quick Launch menu of all your installed Flatpak applications on the Steam Deck (those you install via the Discover software store). Simple brilliance. No need to add each individually to Steam, no need for another app to keep adding them when you install something new, just an always up to date list via a plugin.</p>
<p>Here's a quick demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B3pqt6ANcDA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9955c271a58d4ed71e36bdb3e702a76c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B3pqt6ANcDA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's various other plugins <a href="https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz/" target="_blank">available</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerTools - for even more performance tweaks.</li>
<li>SDH-Bluetooth - quickly connect to an already paired bluetooth device.</li>
<li>Mopidy-Controller - controller for the Mopidy music server, with tile view, tracklist view and playlist picker.</li>
<li>spdck - spotify controls</li>
<li>+ plenty more appearing</li>

      <title>Survival game Rust might be playable properly on Linux and Steam Deck soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rust, the massively popular and quite brutal survival game from Facepunch Studios is working towards Easy Anti-Cheat support for Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>This has been a long-time coming, as they previously removed support for their Native Linux build but confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/garry-newman-of-facepunch-mentions-working-with-eac-for-rust-on-linux-with-proton/" target="_blank">back in July of 2021</a> that they were working on getting it running properly for the Steam Deck. In a fresh update reply to a user on Twitter asking about Easy Anti-Cheat, Facepunch head Garry Newman <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1531235676653510657" target="_blank">mentioned</a> how "They're working on it, maybe next month if it turns out to be stable enough".</p>
<p>Good news for fans of Rust and Linux / Steam Deck, considering it is still one of the most popular games on Steam and has remained so for years.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher gets more Steam Deck and Flatpak improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> for Epic Games and GOG on Linux and Steam Deck has a new update out, mostly focused on cleaning up some problems but also sprinkles in some new features like a command-line interface.</p>
<p>This free and open source app has quickly become the go-to for running any games on Linux from Epic and GOG. especially as neither of them offer an official Linux client.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6369059551653908359gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6369059551653908359gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Version 2.3.4 Main Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a CLI parameter <code class="inline-code">--no-gui</code> that opens Heroic with no user interface. Might get in handy to create some scripts or add a Heroic game on other launchers. Basically, you just need to call <code class="inline-code">heroic --no-gui heroic://launch/{appName}</code>.</li>
<li>Added more feedback on errors and fixed some error messages that were not exactly clear.</li>
<li>Now it's possible to pass any wrappers on the Environmental Variable sections. Might be good to some advanced users.</li>
<li>[Linux] Heroic now will search for Proton versions and Runtimes outside the main library, so in any other drive or partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Main Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Linux/SteamDeck] Several fixes related to the Steam runtime and Proton.</li>
<li>[General] Fixes Force Download and Force Upload of Cloud saves not working properly.</li>
<li>[Linux/SteamDeck] Fix Winetricks on Flatpak/SteamDeck for good now.</li>
<li>[General] Fix GOG games not running the setup correctly;</li>
<li>[Linux/Mac] Fix the Windows version of a native GOG game not working properly</li>
<li>[macOS] Heroic will check if the crossover bottle exists before launching now.</li>
<li>[macOS] Fix Installing games on the folder with spaces.</li>
<li>[General] Library Refresh now will refresh only that specific library, making it more responsive.</li>
<li>[General] Fixes some styling issues across the settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Shortly after version 2.3.5 landed with these adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable most verbosity since several dialogs with false positives were being shown.</li>
<li>Fix corrupted config message on Windows.</li>
<li>Fix Library is not showing after log in with epic games.</li>
<li>Disabled auto-update on macOS</li>
</ul>
