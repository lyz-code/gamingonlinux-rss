      <title>Sackboy: A Big Adventure is another Sony port working well on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony and Sumo Digital recently put out another port, this time it's Sackboy: A Big Adventure an offshoot of the LittleBigPlanet series.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Sony releases, it didn't have a Steam Deck rating before release and still doesn't yet. The good news is that it works out of the box on both Steam Deck and Fedora Linux seemingly without any major technical issues. It does have some shader stutter, which smoothens out over time though (likely as it had no full testing before release).</p>
<p>With Proton 7, it's click and play on Steam Deck and Linux. Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WxdGZQ8ZpvE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdb96f8c0f5d6d2dcf810f194b732449.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WxdGZQ8ZpvE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Very happy with how this runs. On my desktop, max settings produced a very smooth experience overall. On Steam Deck, keeping it on High settings, with the screen locked to 40Hz and TDP set to 10 — gave a really good feeling too with better battery life than the default (a good while over 2 hours).</p>
<p>On desktop, it seems it doesn't get along with MangoHud, which vanished every time on the initial loading screen so in the brief desktop bit in the video, you will see the normal Steam FPS counter in the top left corner.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sackboy-a-big-adventure?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599660/Sackboy_A_Big_Adventure/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>VRR (external screens) and Allow Tearing options coming to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that both options for Variable Refresh Rate and Allow Tearing are coming to the Steam Deck in a future update (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/yg0ou5/variable_refresh_rate_and_allow_tearing_options/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>), here's what that means.</p>
<p>Firstly, no, the Steam Deck itself will not have VRR, as the screen doesn't support it (As confirmed by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1586208015543578624" target="_blank">Twitter</a>). This will be for <em>external</em> screens when docking. The point of VRR is to have your screen continue to dynamically change the refresh rate to match the game, enabling it to remain smooth and tear-free.</p>
<p>As for the Allow Tearing option, this is due to the current way that Steam Deck Gaming Mode works with the Wayland display server, with it always forcing VSync. Once ready, this will allow you to properly have it off, and therefore reduce any extra latency it introduces and get some tearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8292577531667046667gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8292577531667046667gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - the new options in the performance menu.</em></p>
<p>Both of these are going to be pretty big and exciting additions, especially for those with VRR capable screens and for times where you really need that little bit extra input performance.</p>
<p>The options turned up in the Steam Deck "Main" updates channel, which is one of the extra update channels you can turn on via Developer Mode not actually meant for users. As with any in-progress developments, it can change at any point.</p>

      <title>Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds gets cross-play between Steam and Consoles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the more unique fighting games available on PC (Native Linux + Steam Deck Verified), Them's Fightin' Herds has launched on consoles and it now has cross-play. This means no matter the platform you want to fight on, you're good to go.</p>
<p><em>The game currently has a Very Positive user rating from 2,578 user reviews.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709471391666976058gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709471391666976058gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Released as part of the 3.1.2 update they noted that players can find each other across the matchmaking queue, classic lobbies, and Pixel Lobbies regardless of platform plus some HUD elements were added to identify people on different platforms. However, account progress is separate between platforms. Consoles use Epic Online Services, while Steam is sticking to Steam netcode.</p>
<p>The Season 1 Pass is also now live as a DLC that gives you access to 4 new characters, an exclusive character palette pack and 4 exclusive Pixel Lobby accessories although not everything is out yet. The first of the new characters, Texas, was teased in a short trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oSM20gOntLM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e5ad30296488359d25d90b4a56570573.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oSM20gOntLM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, the update also fixed up hosting a custom Pixel Lobby server on Linux.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/thems-fightin-herds?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/574980/Thems_Fightin_Herds/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The third game in the popular Monster Prom series recently landed (that I missed) and this time, it's not a dating sim, instead it's all about survival in Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the dating sim style was never really for me. However, the original in the series <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/in-monster-prom-i-was-rejected-even-after-letting-a-princess-ride-me/" target="_blank">completely won me</a> over and it was a genuine delight to play. Flipping things around this time it keeps the great writing, quirky humour and multiplayer angle along with the diverse set of characters but you need to survive a roadtrip. Although, scoring a date is still possible but not the focus.</p>
<p>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip has you and up to 3 friend face "all kinds of wacky conflicts". Just like the previous entries, it has Native Linux support too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RWmddudktsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/169d768bdfba5d8a02ac79ca570ef71a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RWmddudktsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The signature style of the Monster Prom franchise: unique, charming characters and irreverent humor.</li>
<li>A co-op narrative adventure with survival mechanics.</li>
<li>You can play with friends both through local and online multiplayer!</li>
<li>YES! There's still the option of dating. This time flirting is not the core of the game, but you can still get a date with Polly, Scott, or one of the 10+ available hitchhikers by the end of the game!</li>
<li>TONS of beautiful art like you have never seen before in these series (seriously, there's A LOT of art packed in here).</li>
<li>Even if it's a co-op game, there's a social competitive aspect that will provide a thrill for the game. Choosing how much to seek your own benefit and how much to focus on the group goal!</li>
<li>Several brand new characters, and some beloved characters from previous games will be making a comeback!</li>
<li>Radio stations to choose from, with different music genres to build the perfect mood!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for monster-collecting game Cassette Beasts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is an upcoming monster-collecting RPG from Bytten Studio and publisher Raw Fury. The recent Steam Next Fest demo was pretty great and a new trailer is live now for <a href="https://www.mediaindieexchange.com/" target="_blank">The MIX</a> event.</p>
<p>An interesting idea for such a game, with you recording various creatures on retro cassette tapes and the fusion system allows you to create tons of unique and powerful monsters. New trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pydbU0FovBw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cc385239eac01f1185e1d710e07d7be1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pydbU0FovBw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?!</strong> Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li><strong>Fuse monster forms!</strong> Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li><strong>Explore a rich open world</strong> Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li><strong>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions</strong> Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li><strong>Master a deep battle system</strong> Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, I took a quick look at the previous demo on Steam Deck recently too:</p>

      <title>Valheim gets an important bug-fix for Linux players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that the survival game Valheim had quite an unfortunate bug for Linux players, which has now been solved.</p>
<p>Players discovered a little while ago, that the ability to move saves between Cloud and Local might end up deleting characters or worlds. Ouch. At least it's fixed now. This update also brings the Jack-o-turnip seasonal decoration item since it's Halloween season once again.</p>
<p>Here's the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a Linux-specific bug that deleted characters/worlds when moving them back and forth between Local and Cloud</li>
<li>Prevent joining servers from the main menu if incompatible server version right away (instead of loading and then kicking you back out)</li>
<li>More PlayFab tweaks</li>
<li>Enabled Jack-o-turnip seasonal decoration item</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta adds QR code logins, Gaming Mode UI in Desktop Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put up a fresh Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3394051799812669717" target="_blank">Client Beta</a> with numerous fixes, along with new features like the QR code login you can use with the mobile app. To try it out you need to be in the Beta or Preview update channels.</p>
<p>This update also brings with it an update to the desktop Steam client on Steam Deck, so that you can also now use the Gaming Mode UI in Desktop Mode too which just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-deck-ui-comes-to-desktop-in-beta-to-replace-big-picture-mode/" target="_blank">recently landed</a> for normal desktop / laptop users. QR code logins sure will make things a bit nicer, especially for those using longer passwords that can be a real pain to enter on the Deck login.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck UI comes to Desktop in Beta to replace Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has finally done what a lot have been waiting for, made the Steam Deck UI <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3394051164709183116" target="_blank">available for desktops</a> although it's only available in the Steam Client Beta for now.</p>
<p>To access it open Steam -&gt; Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; hit the Change button under Betas and select the Steam Client Beta. After that, you also need to add "-gamepadui" as a launch argument. So in terminal on Linux you can just simply run <code class="inline-code">steam -gamepadui</code> for it to work. Or just add it to the end of whatever shortcut you're using, same can be done on Windows too.</p>
<p>For anyone who has been following any Steam Deck footage from me or others, you will know what it looks like by now but here's a couple shots from my desktop running it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4215040561666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4215040561666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6260385831666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6260385831666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3145167311666898962gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3145167311666898962gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3853570881666898960gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3853570881666898960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not perfected yet of course, hence it being in Beta and hidden behind a launch argument. One issue I already found (shown above), was that the Steam menu ends up showing whatever I have behind it. Weirdly though, the Quick Access Menu doesn't have that problem.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it will still be called Big Picture Mode but it just gets replaced from the old to the new, taken from the Steam Deck UI design.</p>
<p>Valve say the updated UI includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Home Screen, where you can continue playing recent games, and see what’s new with the games in your library.</li>
<li>New Universal Search, that searches across Library, Store, and your friends</li>
<li>New controller configurator, designed for ease-of-use of picking, adjusting, or creating custom controller configurations</li>
<li>Optimized Steam Store for controller navigation</li>
<li>Updated in-game overlay, with access to achievements and guides
	<ul>
<li>Press Steam / Guide / PS button while in game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New system menu, for quick navigation to different parts of the interface
	<ul>
<li>Access this with the Steam / Guide / PS button</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New quick access menu, for access to notifications, friends list, quick settings, and more.
	<ul>
<li>Access this with Steam / Guide / PS button + A</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a quick run over it:</p>

      <title>Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translator VKD3D-Proton version 2.7 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here is an absolutely huge open source release! <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton</a>, the translation tech used in Steam Play Proton to translate Direct3D 12 to Vulkan for Steam Deck / Linux version 2.7 is out now.</p>
<p>This is the first tagged release since March, which pulls together all the work done for the Steam Deck launch up until now and it sounds pretty impressive.</p>
<p>The new release does have higher graphics driver requirements including Mesa 22.0 or NVIDIA 510 series, which should be easily available in most distributions but the release notes say Proton 7.0 will stick with VKD3D-Proton 2.6 but Proton Experimental and future main Proton releases will jump to version 2.7.</p>
<p>Some of the major additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An improved pipeline cache, now enabled for all games along with it being smaller (helps performance).</li>
<li>Lots of optimizations and better GPU performance for various features.</li>
<li>It now supports D3D12 Mesh shaders and Advanced ExecuteIndirect.</li>
<li>DXR 1.1 had some more feature implemented that were missing.</li>
<li>Basic Shared resources and fences supported with Proton.</li>
<li>Preliminary HDR support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loads more including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix random GPU hangs in Hitman 3.</li>
<li>Fix crash in Redout 2.</li>
<li>Fix random GPU hang in F1 2021.</li>
<li>Fix random flicker in Guardians of the Galaxy.</li>
<li>Update some API checks required by latest AgilitySDK runtime features. Fix crash in F1 2022.</li>
<li>Add various workarounds for game bugs in Halo Infinite.</li>
<li>Add workaround for amdgpu kernel issue for certain games using imported host memory and multiple Vulkan devices.</li>
<li>Workaround glitched rendering in F1 2020 due to game bug.</li>
<li>Workaround certain games that violate placed resource API w.r.t. subresource initialization.<br/>
	Spiderman Remastered and Lost Judgment are affected. More games will likely surface.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dark Reign: The Future of War, a true classic RTS is being remade in OpenRA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Anyone else remember Dark Reign: The Future of War? Released back in 1997, it's a real classic and at the time it had some pretty favourable reviews too. The good news is that <a href="https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign" target="_blank">it's being rebuilt</a> by fans using <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a>.</p>
<p>OpenRA is the same game engine that revived classic Westwood RTS games like Command &amp; Conquer,  Dune 2000 and Red Alert. It's highly versatile and open source, making it a good base to use to revive other classics too and this makes me happy.</p>
<p>Dark Reign is easily one of my all-time favourite RTS games, next to Total Annihilation. Both managed to spice things up nicely that other RTS games around the time weren't doing. Heck, I even wrote about Dark Reign <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2016/11/wine-allowed-me-to-re-live-a-gaming-experience-i-had-from-when-i-was-a-child-on-linux/" target="_blank">here back in 2016</a> when trying it out in Wine (wow — has my opinion on Wine changed or what?). Just look at how gorgeous it was:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17909460541666885980gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17909460541666885980gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14893085941666886113gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14893085941666886113gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<blockquote>
<p>A colossal war between the Imperium and Freedom Guard is annihilating your world. To save your civilization, you must enter the heart of an empire at war. Command over 35 units with specific orders and deploy suicide bombers, hostage takers, saboteurs and more. Use precisely calculated battlegrounds to your strategic advantage and play against a highly responsive and unpredictable AI that detects and adjusts intelligently to your tactics. Vanquish the military powers to alter the destiny of a galaxy.</p>
<cite>The official blurb</cite></blockquote>
<p>I had this OpenRA "mod" on my watch-list for a long time, hoping for the best but I wasn't aware that it was being <em>actively</em> developed. To the point that you can download an AppImage from the GitHub, download the demo content inside it and then get playing and it's really coming along nicely, although far from complete.</p>
<p>What do I hope with this article? Perhaps there's a few fellow Dark Reigns fans lurking that might like it, and perhaps some might help give it a push along with code so we can see another classic truly revived for modern audiences.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15060194471666886645gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15060194471666886645gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Dark Reign in OpenRA.</em></p>
<p>Find the project on <a href="https://github.com/drogoganor/DarkReign" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It works with the demo assets but you'll likely need a full copy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dark_reign_expansion" target="_blank">GOG</a> at some point.</p>

      <title>Guide a convoy through a ruined world in the Sandwalkers prologue demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sounding a bit like Vagrus - The Riven Realms, we have the upcoming game Sandwalkers from Goblinz Studio and the new prologue demo Sandwalkers: The Fourteenth Caravan. The demo already has Native Linux support, and the full game will too (the developer confirmed this to GOL).</p>
<p>In this world some kind of "meteorological chaos" keeps all the tribes apart, so it seems your mission is to go through a perilous journey and meet up with them all. Manage diplomatic relations, trade, explore, fight and more. Looks like it could be pretty good!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2Z65VM-utH0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3653fc3248edc65686743fb7dad2d9c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2Z65VM-utH0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Guide a caravan of adventurers through ever-changing landscapes.</li>
<li>Fight and survive in the face of acid rain, sandstorms and heat waves.</li>
<li>Tame hostile creatures, rescue refugees, seek allies for mutual aid, or follow the blood path and loot everything you can.</li>
<li>Seek rich arable soil to plant a new tree city for your people.</li>
<li>Progress by passing on your knowledge to a new caravan.</li>
<li>Repair the broken climate, and put an end to centuries of wandering.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently being <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goblinzstudio/sandwalkers-a-roguelike-turn-based-exploration-game" target="_blank">crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a>, where the developer is trying to get at least €40,000 and they're off to a good start with over €12,000 pledged and they have 29 days to go. This is the first time they've done a crowdfunding campaign too, as they usually do Early Access on Steam.</p>
<p>At release it will be up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/sandwalkers" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1639080/Sandwalkers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Although the prologue demo only has a Linux version on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966290/Sandwalkers_The_Fourteenth_Caravan/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Comedy adventure McPixel 3 releases November 14th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another point and click adventure? McPixel 3, yes they skipped the number 2, is heading to Linux and Steam Deck on November 14th.</p>
<p>The developer explained that "McPixel 3 runs on 100% software-rendered McPixel Engine, so in the age of unaffordable graphics cards, you can be sure you will be able to run McPixel 3 just fine!</p>
<p>The engine has been written from scratch just for the purpose of running McPixel. That makes the game run smoothly even on the oldest computer, so make sure you install McPixel on your grandma's PC next time you visit! Additionally, that makes the game environment-friendly! McPixel 3 saves the planet (and battery life)!"</p>
<p>A fun part of this is their <a href="https://twitter.com/Sosowski/status/1585329526015684610" target="_blank">thread on Twitter</a> showing the game running across a classic Asus EEE PC 4G, Steam Deck, Windows 95, FreeBSD, Raspberry Pi, in a Linux terminal window, Haiku OS and more.</p>

<p>Some pretty amusing and clever marketing that.</p>

      <title>Valve finally clears up Steam game release dates, also adjusts pricing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two important pieces of info today for both players and game developers, as it will affect both quite a bit with release date changes and pricing changes.</p>
<p>Firstly, prices! Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3314110913449340511" target="_blank">announced</a> to developers various updates to how they handle multi-currency. Developers and publishers are still free to set their own pricing but now Valve are giving developers a new tool to make it easier, along with adjusting their recommendation on prices across seemingly all currencies on Steam. This may result in price increases across many games on Steam in many different regions, as Valve said "with purchasing power and foreign exchange rates constantly evolving, we needed to make significant changes to those conversion recommendations to stay current".</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-price-matrix-2022-update/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, as always, keep tracking changes on Steam and did their own blog post to highlight the changes. According to SteamDB the only currencies not changing have so far been CIS - U.S. Dollar, Costa Rican Colon. Israeli New Shekel, Kuwaiti Dinar, Singapore Dollar, South Asia - USD and U.A.E. Dirham. They included various tables, showing the changes against the dollar at various price points with this one showing just how big an increase it can be:</p>

<p><em>Thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/blog/valve-price-matrix-2022-update/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. </em></p>
<p>Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3289340571611574692" target="_blank">big change</a> is how release dates are presented on Steam. Soon, gone will be the days of developers setting whatever format they wish for their dates, along with some including funny messages instead of an actual date. Instead, Valve will have a standard way to present dates that can be correctly formatted to your region so there will be no more confusion on days and months too.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a> for example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10741759131666866898gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10741759131666866898gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What is changing is that developers will need to put an exact date that only they and Valve can see, and then pick between these types of public views:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The exact date. “Aug 24, 2023”</li>
<li>Month-and-year. “August 2023”</li>
<li>The quarter of the calendar year. “Q3 2023”</li>
<li>The year. "2023"</li>
<li>No date at all. “Coming Soon”</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This change makes sense, and was a long time coming.</p>
<p>With this change, it will also affect how developers have their games shown in upcoming lists on Steam. Valve will position games "at the last possible date of that time range", so if developers pick to have just a month and year they will appear as if they select the last day in that month. Hopefully this will also help fix the issue of some developers repeatedly changing their date to keep bumping their game in the upcoming lists.</p>

      <title>Thoughts on the official Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After having and playing with the official Steam Deck Docking Station, here's some thoughts on the experience. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">earlier in October</a>, along with the Steam Deck itself no longer having a reservation queue, I was very keen to see what Valve would give us officially. Especially since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler</a> already provide <em>great</em> docked experiences for a lower price (since they don't give you a charger too).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15625936341666864552gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15625936341666864552gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>For the basic design it's perfectly fine. All the ports are on the back out of the way, so you only see the short lip at the front when you've docked your Steam Deck. No ethernet wire poking out the side like with JSAUX (although ivoler don't have this issue). There's no problems with the design or build quality at all, except for those of you keeping thicker protective cases on where it won't fit in. It also has a nice non-slip cover on the bottom so it won't move around.</p>
<p>A reminder on what it has available: 3 x USB-A 3.1 Gen1 Ports, Gigabit Ethernet, DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, USB-C Power Delivery pass-through input and an included charger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6714503211666864544gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6714503211666864544gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>When you first get it, you'll likely need a firmware update before you really use it. A big benefit of it, is that Valve provide firmware updates directly, so there's no messing with anything external. You either get a pop-up telling you one is available, or you can go into the settings and check for updates to have it appear. It probably won't be updated often but it's still a nice touch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9711401061666863019gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9711401061666863019gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>So it looks nice and it can get easy updates — how is the overall experience? Well, that's where things aren't so good in this case. I've now used 4 or 5 different JSAUX docks (I've lost count) and one from ivoler, I use my Steam Deck docked all the time and have done since before the original release (since I was an original Steam Deck reviewer) via two different USB-C Hubs, so I think I have a fair amount of experience here.</p>
<p>The problem is that the official Steam Deck Docking Station has its quirks with actually connecting to external displays, tested by connecting to multiple TVs and PC Monitors all from different vendors. Sometimes, it works right away. Most of the time though, I have to do a little dance between powering the Steam Deck down and on again, turning screens on and off and so on. Unfortunately, for me, the official Docking Station is very much <em>not</em> a plug and play experience. Sadly, I am apparently in a long list of people having issues with it. Looking on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/3?snr=1_614_steamdeckdock_steamdeckdock_1601" target="_blank">Steam Forum</a>, there's a great many posts of people seeing the same or just not seeing a signal on their external screen at all. A few in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">our Discord</a> have also reported such issues too.</p>
<p>At 4K, the Steam Deck UI acts a bit weirdly too. Things don't always match up on the screen and the UI doesn't perform well. Thankfully, Valve added external screens settings so I can put it into 1080p and it works fine while still looking good overall. Not a big issue but one I hope they sort too.</p>
<p>Since Valve has put a lot of work into the docked experience, overall once it's actually setup <em>correctly</em> it works quite nicely. I have no big main complaints about the main docked experience right now. Bluetooth controllers both PS4 and Xbox work just fine, as do controllers plugged in via USB. Honestly, playing with the Steam Deck while docked is a really fun experience and really continues to show how versatile the Steam Deck is as a gaming device. However, I really do hope Valve add an easy way to deal with external drives as more people wish to use them to expand their storage even more. It's possible to do, like with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-jsaux-m2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-is-a-great-choice/" target="_blank">JSAUX M.2 SSD Dock</a>, but the setup is annoying to do. They have the functionality there for SD Cards, so it's not a stretch to say they could expand that for other external drives too.</p>
<p>If Valve manage to sort out the issues with it connecting properly to external screens, which is the <em>main</em> function, it might turn around into a recommendation. For now though, I would suggest going with JSAUX or ivoler instead and if you already have a spare charger, you'll be saving money too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>CD PROJEKT RED announce The Witcher Remake in Unreal Engine 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a big fan of The Witcher series you will probably love this: CD PROJEKT RED have announced The Witcher Remake. Working together with developer Fool's Theory, it will be developed in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>This is what was originally teased as "Canis Majoris", it will be a modern reimagining of the classic from 2007 and it "will use the toolset CDPR is creating for the new Witcher saga" — sounds fancy. Hopefully it will release in a better state than Cyberpunk 2077, with Fool's Theory having veteran developers who previously worked on The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and CD PROJEKT RED is providing full creative supervision. Fool's Theory have also contributed to the development of Baldur’s Gate III, Divinity: Original Sin 2 DLC’s, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, Outriders and Gord.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p><em>"The Witcher is where it all started for us, for CD PROJEKT RED. It was the first game we made, ever, and it was a big moment for us then. Going back to this place and updating the game for the next generation of gamers to experience it is just as big, if not bigger</em>," said Adam Badowski, Head of Studio, CD PROJEKT RED.<em> "Collaborating with Fool's Theory on the project is just as exciting, as some of the people there have been previously involved in The Witcher games. They know the source material well, they know how much gamers have been looking forward to seeing the remake happen, and they know how to make incredible and ambitious games. And although it will take some time before we're ready to share more about and from the game, I know it'll be worth the wait."</em></p>
<p><em>"I am very happy that my professional paths have crossed again with fellow developers from the time of working together on The Witcher 2 and The Witcher 3. Especially when it's a remake of a project that is so close to our hearts," said Jakub Rokosz, CEO, Fool's Theory. "We are excited to join forces with CD PROJEKT RED, and our goal is to give players another great game from the iconic Witcher series."</em></p>
<p>Hopefully whenever it releases, Proton will run it nicely on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. Although, perhaps by the time it's out we might have a Steam Deck 2 as no doubt it is quite a long time away from release.</p>

<p>JSAUX were getting close to release another (yes, another) Steam Deck Docking Station, this time with RGB lighting around the bottom but due to a "leak" and a competitor "copying" it they have cancelled it and will re-do it.</p>
<p>Outlined in a <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/blogs/steam-deck/statement-on-product-leaks-and-the-new-rgb-dock" target="_blank">blog post</a>, JSAUX mentioned: "Today we are here to announce some irritating and disappointing news. In the past few months, we were dedicated to develop and test a new RGB Steam Deck Dock long awaited by our fans, and we are almost to release it. Unfortunately, someone leaked and copied our development scheme.".</p>
<p>They sent out samples to select few outlets to try it and give feedback, with GamingOnLinux (hello) <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1581207438145224707" target="_blank">being one of them</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18078343251666799574gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18078343251666799574gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - the original JSAUX RGB Steam Deck Dock.</em></p>
<p>In the blog post, JSAUX showed off what they say are shots of them designing it back in July, along with a patent application for it.</p>
<p>According to JSAUX, an unnamed company reached out to various Steam Deck content creators and told them about their RGB Dock. JSAUX caught wind of this, investigated and claim they found it was the factory they were using that leaked their files on it thus allowing a competitor to make it and so they have now "terminated the cooperation" with said factory.</p>
<p>As a result, the current design has been cancelled. However, for RGB fans, the good news is that JSAUX will still be doing it but "will start with a completely new look with different lighting effects".</p>
<p>I reached out to the company in question (who I won't name, since JSAUX didn't either), since I know who it was, and they simply denied it completely.</p>

      <title>EA begins swapping out Origin for EA app on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the time has come, EA has begun the process of swapping from Origin to the EA app on Steam, which could cause a few issues for Linux and Steam Deck with Proton. Multiple titles on Steam got updates within the last day, with no patch notes or announcements from EA that I can see. The only difference seems to be introducing the EA App.</p>
<p>Checking my existing install of The Sims 4 on Steam Deck and it seems fine. It briefly showed a new EA App screen, then showed Origin and then went into the game.</p>
<p>An existing Titanfall 2 install on Fedora Linux (desktop) however refused to initially launch, it gave me the EA screen and with Proton 7.0-4, Proton 7.0-5 (RC) and Proton Experimental it just wouldn't launch. Removing the compatdata folder, where all the Wine / Proton prefix data is stored and reloading got it a bit further, to some sort of blank EA App screen after successfully installing it that got stuck. Killing all Wine processes and exiting Steam, then reloading Titanfall 2 and after a few blank EA App screens appeared and vanished — it works again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9827645101666779604gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9827645101666779604gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Let's not.</em></p>
<p>With a fresh install of Titanfall 2 on Steam Deck with Proton 7, it had the issue again of a blank EA app screen that got stuck. Quitting and reloading, it once again showed the blank EA app screen. Forcing Proton Experimental on it, and then it actually worked.</p>
<p>Trying a new install of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order on Fedora Linux (desktop) with Proton 7, and a similar issue as the above although it didn't need a compatdata folder removal. EA App seemed to install, then I just got greeted by a blank EA App window. Seems it's actually a sign-in window, as I was able to highlight things on it by trying to drag things out of the window. Anyway, in this case simply quitting and reloading just seemed to fix it.</p>
<p>So it's a bit of a nuisance and acts differently between games, but it appears the EA app <em>can</em> still work with Proton but it <em>might</em> need a little extra work.</p>
<p><em>Note: the below can remove settings, possibly saves etc, do at your own risk.</em></p>
<p>If you find you also need to remove the compatdata folder for some EA games (for Steam Deck, be in Desktop Mode): find the Steam App ID (Right click a game -&gt; properties -&gt; updates) or grab the ID from the URL of the Steam store page for it. Then inside your steamapps folder you will find compatdata and inside a folder with the same ID. Where it is depends on what drive you have games installed on, the default is <code class="inline-code">/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/</code>.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments how things are going for you on various EA games on Linux desktop / Steam Deck now.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 6,000 games marked Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just short of two months after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-verified-and-playable-hits-5000/" target="_blank">hitting 5,000</a> — Valve has now marked over 6,000 games as formally Verified or Playable for the Steam Deck. A big milestone for still pretty early days of the system, that you can now grab <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">without the reservation queue</a> (along with the official Docking Station).</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which includes unlisted titles, these are the current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 2,401</li>
<li>Playable - 3,680</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2,196</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the recently fully Verified titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/brotato-is-going-to-be-my-next-horde-survival-arena-shooter-obsession/" target="_blank">Brotato</a></li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/" target="_blank">Unrailed!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In other (good?) news, Valve <em>finally</em> marked Paladins as Unsupported, after leaving it saying it was Playable even though it was broken by Easy Anti-Cheat for months. I definitely want them to react quite a bit quicker to games being completely broken and this was a prime example of the issues they face with game updates and Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>The Long Dark: Tales from the Far Territory announced with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Long Dark: Tales from the Far Territory is the first paid expansion to the chilly survival game from Hinterland. It was announced just recently and a teaser trailer is up.</p>
<p>With this being the first extra paid content since the game came to Steam in 2014, it should be interesting to see what they've been cooking up for it. As a reminder, they're going to be splitting the game up between the episodic story mode and the survival mode (existing customers keep both).</p>
<p>The big <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/3387295765245751414" target="_blank">announcement</a> covers a lot of the details and is worth a read but in short it's an Expansion Pass that will come with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three new Regions, connected by the long travel zones and hub region. The first of these Regions, “Forsaken Airfield”, and the travel zones all launch with the Expansion Pass. The other two Regions will be released over the course of the 12-month campaign.</li>
<li>Three Tales, narrative-themed Challenges that take place within your Survival game, each revealing insights into the Far Territory’s mysterious history.</li>
<li>New gameplay systems including: Handheld Shortwave, Travois, Safehouse Customization, Trader, Complex Recipes for Cooking, and new Item Variants. We’ll share more info about each of these features on the larger Expansion Pass site we’ll be launching closer to release.</li>
<li>20+ minutes of new Survival music (10+ minutes included in the first Drop).</li>
</ul>
<p>Free updates will still be coming and this is their current plan for free updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full global loot and wildlife refresh. We’ve redone all the loot tables, all the pre-placed loot, and rebalanced the loot economy across the entire game. The Resource refresh will go live for all players when the Expansion launches, and the full Wildlife refresh will come some time next year.</li>
<li>Visor Notes. You’ll be able to find notes under visors (and other locations) that point to supply caches and other useful things, hidden all over the world.</li>
<li>New First-Person animations. We’ve added a whole bunch of new animations for harvesting actions, and more.</li>
<li>Thermos. You know — to keep your drinks warm.</li>
<li>Visual enhancements (focused on high-end systems).</li>
<li>Burdock, a new edible plant.</li>
<li>Improvised Crampons, so you can make them yourself. Watch those ankles!</li>
<li>...and a range of enhancements to existing systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those lists are only some of what is to come, more to be revealed later. Check out the teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pc47uXSOLEY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d622452303b03ffda48e162a5b049f02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pc47uXSOLEY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will cost $19.99 at launch, plus a bundle discount for existing owners of the game, and will launch sometime in December.</p>
<p>Sounds like it has done well too, as they revealed some player numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam (paid): 4,000,000</li>
<li>Xbox (paid): 750,000</li>
<li>Xbox Game Pass (subscription): 2,000,000</li>
<li>PlayStation (paid): 500,000</li>
<li>PlayStation+ (subscription): 1,300,000</li>
<li>Switch (paid): 68,000</li>
<li>WeGame (paid): 125,000</li>
<li>Epic Game Store (combo paid + give-away): 1,500,000+</li>
</ul>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets an official Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a short Beta period, Return to Monkey Island from Terrible Toybox and Devolver Digital now has a Native Linux port available. Sounds like the game is doing well, as said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2060130/view/3389547565085212657" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "Thanks to you, loyal customers, Return to Monkey Island is now the fastest-selling Monkey Island game EVER! At least, I think so. My sales data is a little "fuzzy." But let's go with it!".</p>
<p>"It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.</p>
<p>Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory."</p>

<p>Really great to see them deliver on it just as they said they would for those who appreciate the direct Linux versions.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>

      <title>Victoria 3 is an ambitious society sim that will engross you if you let it</title>
      <author>BTRE</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Development Studios’ latest game depicts a century of history with a focus on economics and society. Facing the challenges of a changing world can be daunting but the game is good at letting you play at your own pace.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> Key provided by Paradox</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2039858541666641152gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2039858541666641152gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When I first booted up Victoria 3, I was greeted by optimistic, celebratory images that seemed to portray a world where anything could be possible. The preselected nations, categorized neatly in various sorts of tutorials or guided experiences, describe problems and background of each but all invariably have a tinge of hope in a better future. Even after several dozen hours playing the game, dealing with messy wars, social unrest, industrialization and colonialism, I find that initial impression has stuck around.</p>
<p>The map is probably the prettiest yet in a Paradox title with the art direction really hitting all the right notes. Things like major rivers, lakes, islands, mountains and other major features more or less accurately-represented around the world as delicate clouds float by, wisps of smoke rise from volcanoes, and the occasional signs of wildlife. Signs of civilization are also depicted with cities growing, railways extending and trains running about, and mines and industry popping up as you build them up. It’s a pleasure to look at even when zoomed out, as the map takes a more paper-like look and trade routes and country names appear.</p>
<p>All of this gives an impression that there’s many parts to the whole. And, make no mistake, this is a complex game. It, in fact, revels in its complexity; adjusting tariffs on exported goods, bolstering support for groups such as industrialists in order to pass legislation, and making sure your citizens have not only basic goods but can purchase luxury goods are all the meat of the gameplay. With that in mind, the game seems content to let the player figure things out at their own pace: the world continues to run more or less in sensible ways even without the player there to steer things along. Through the various in-game tutorials and guidance, the tool tip system, and good old fashioned trial and error I was able to come to grips with how things work.</p>
<p>The heart of the game is how it portrays its society. The population is broken down into Pops which are units that represent the class, education, ethnicity and the like. These are not necessarily politically active but those that are will support various interest groups such as landowners, the clergy, or trade unions. Depending on their clout and whether or not they are part of the government, it may affect which laws can be passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7931070881666641149gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7931070881666641149gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Good management makes most political realities feasible and stable. When the population’s various needs aren’t being met, it opens the door to radicalization. Enough of that and there may be demands for reforms like, say, implementing limited voting rights. And, well, those with clout and in-power who benefit from the way things are will be against that sort of thing. So pushing through any sort of change can quickly become hazardous—political instability may lead to rebellions and secessionist movements. Figuring out how to keep your country from devolving into chaos while continuing to expand the economy or your nation’s borders is a tough balancing act.</p>
<p>The tension in between potential economical and social reform makes for interesting gameplay and it’s not just the obvious big things like ending serfdom or universal suffrage that can cause a stir. More than once I found myself with long periods of tension and civil war when I pushed too hard or too fast in any given direction and had to back down and accommodate my interest groups in order to not fracture my country.</p>
<p>There is a varied bag of tools and ways to shape things in the direction that you may want over longer periods of time. Laws allowing for secret police to keep radicals down will help the more polarized things are but more subtle tools like suppressing or bolstering interest groups are also available. Incidentally, those tools are lost the more open your society becomes. Something like protected speech means that the government can no longer use some of its more heavy-handed approaches. The events that pop up from time to time with issues of the day (like a mine collapse) become a handy way of placating (or radicalizing!) parts of the population.</p>
<p>Managing the economy is something else that’s a continuous balancing act. On the one hand, growing the resource and industrial base as large as you can in order to be able to afford a large army or provide for a large population is an obvious goal. On the other, focusing too much on any one area can make things harder in the long run: being the top producer of steel is great and all but without investing in administrative buildings it’s difficult to run the country and without universities it’s difficult to find qualified workers for more modern production techniques, let alone keep up with technological research. As you might expect, those things aren’t exactly directly profitable. And go too far with certain industry and your population may not be able to afford staple goods anymore and … what’s that? In the meantime the nation has fallen into debt and has to pass higher taxes to fix its budget issues which can quickly radicalize the population which, in turn, introduces more problems into the equation.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6557602081666641151gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6557602081666641151gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Supply and demand drive growth as might be expected but things like the economic laws set in place may allow for subsidizing industry and for collecting tariffs on import or export routes. Basic, extractive, industries remain relevant all throughout the game although they may be modernized like all other industries. Part of the challenge is figuring out what to manage and when as there are often trade-offs to consider; using new techniques may create greater output but may require additional resources like coal or oil and optimizing by automating and reducing the workforce is great—so long as those unemployed laborers can find other jobs and not radicalize. I’ve experimented a lot in various short games I tried and have come to understand a fair deal over the many hours I put in. Although I’m certain there’s a lot more that I have yet to learn. I couldn’t even begin to venture on whether or not there’s an “optimal” way of playing as the circumstances of each nation affect how the economy develops.</p>
<p>That each nation has its own resource limitations is one of the main drivers of conflict and colonization in the game. This conflict isn’t usually war, however. Instead of declaring war outright, nations engage in what are termed “diplomatic plays”, a stated objective against a nation such as taking a state, forcing it to open up its markets, becoming a protectorate etc. It proceeds by phases and nations which have an interest in the region may take sides (or be swayed to take one by promises of something). Things only escalate to a war if neither side backs down and things like mobilizing troops can serve as a bluff to get others to concede. Once mobilized, however, nations can’t demobilize until their conflict is over and, worse still, may convince others that they need to intervene militarily, which may unexpectedly turn a trifle into a real costly mess.</p>
<p>It’s a clever system but not without its flaws. I found that the AI is a little too easy to sway if a little groundwork is done between plays, such as raising relationships. In essence, if a big-hitter country is trying to intervene somewhere, it is too easy to get another great power to intervene on your side and, if war breaks out, bear the brunt of the fighting. While 19th century was the century of the balance of power doctrine as best exemplified by disastrous interventions like the Crimean War, it is still odd to see a nation like France intervene against the UK in the Opium Wars instead of joining in to take a slice of the Chinese market for itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/101977251666641151gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/101977251666641151gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Ideology also seems to not really factor in; reactionary countries will intervene in favor of revolutionary ones and vice-versa in a manner that doesn’t quite feel like Bismarkian Realpolitik. Given that in the game’s time period covers the height of imperialism, the rise of (and reaction to) socialist politics and, later, fascism, it can feel a little jarring. As an example: mismanagement and internal conflicts drove me to adopt socialist policies and become a council (i.e. soviet) republic. There was an attempt at an undemocratic counter-revolution that escalated to a civil war. Austria, which had managed to remain an absolutist monarchy, took my side against its ideological bedfellows because I offered them a relatively unimportant concession. I avoided a prolonged civil war and Austria got an "obligation" from me which it used to call me into an minor conflict later on. I clearly won that exchange.</p>
<p>Likewise, I like the war system and its abstraction, overall, but find that there are strange aspects to it that likely need more tweaks. It’s a more hands-off system with mobilized troops being under the command of generals who attack and defend along fronts as best as they can. I am fine with the loss of tactical control because things like technology and personality traits go a long way in determining outcome. What I take issue with is how there’s very little intermediacy in the scale of conflicts. In other words, local conflicts don’t really exist and colonial powers will send their largest armies almost every time, often into places far from their origin like Africa or Asia to fight.</p>
<p>I’ve also failed to see any sort of World War 1-type conflicts that involve the whole world and millions of casualties happen, even when multiple great powers participate. Casualties are not nearly high enough and the stakes that are fought over aren’t large enough—there is a lack of postwar negations for particularly large conflicts. It may run counter to the diplomatic play system but the time period depicted by the game also had one of the most consequential conferences in history: the Paris Peace Conference that lead to the Treaty of Versailles. The changes to the world order went beyond the prewar stated aims. So even when larger conflicts erupt, their results feel anticlimactic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17283015011666641150gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17283015011666641150gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There’s also not enough that makes each country have its own unique feel beyond economics and laws. Yes, that does make each session play out differently but in terms of general objectives it’s much more directionless. The little potential direction that is there left me wanting more. For example, there are conditions for unifying Germany as one of the powers in the region. Another for restoring the emperor to power in Japan. Yet another for the potential fracturing of China. But these feel tacked on rather than part of the core identity of each—what drove them to act in a certain way in history beyond simple economics or vague notions of prestige or power. It’s a sandbox game, I understand, but there’s little of the atmosphere that lead to specific approaches.</p>
<p>Another strange omission, I think, is that colonialism is just treated in a rather matter-of-fact way. Setting up colonies is a matter of having the law in your country, declaring an interest in a region and hitting a button. Rarely this may lead to a war with the nation whose territory you are stealing. It is an uninteresting execution. Given that issues that concern interest groups and the characters that lead them may see events and choices, it feels odd that there isn’t anything like it for colonial management. In fact, the only event that I saw along those lines was when another colonial power attempted to rile up the natives against me. It’s not only strange that the natives have no real representation in terms of events but also that your own Pops don’t have their own events regarding their stances on the colonies especially given that all sorts of other political movements and stances are of concern to them.</p>
<p>The computer opponents are fairly competent despite my complaints about some of their oddities. They expand and secure their interests with relish and compete with the player on many fronts and are eager to pursue hegemony not only economically but diplomatically by signing treaties and pacts of all sorts. Still, overall, I’d have to say that ultimately Victoria 3 is a game that you are playing against yourself. What matters the most is your own population and economy and all that’s going on beyond your own borders is of secondary concern. It’s a game that lets you play at your own pace, with your own level of understanding and get something out of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9210924311666641573gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9210924311666641573gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With all the caveats and complaints I may have about some of the design implementations, I think that the fundamentals of the games are solid. Despite some of my complaints that boil down to “I wish there was more content,” its a game that has content galore as-is. Though I crossed the 20-hour mark without really realizing it, the 40-hour mark with pleasure. Even late last night I found myself playing more while trying to wrangle all of my thoughts into coherent form for this review. While I’m not sure I’ve managed to explain clearly, I think I’ll say that it’s easy to forgive the imperfections I’ve encountered on account of its polished and appealing core gameplay.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that there’s nothing else quite like Victoria 3 out there. It may not be the perfect society simulator but it’s certainly a very ambitious one and I’m grateful that it doesn’t try to run away from that fact. It is a game as optimistic in its presentation as it is the belief that its players will enjoy themselves the more they immerse themselves in it.</p>

      <title>SCS Software hope Euro Truck Simulator 2 has another &#39;decade of further growth&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Euro Truck Simulator 2 from SCS Software recently celebrated its <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/10/euro-truck-simulator-2s-10th-anniversary.html" target="_blank">10th anniversary</a>, and it seems there's absolutely no stopping it.</p>
<p>A huge success for the developer with it having sold over 13 million copies, along with 80 million DLCs purchased. That's an incredible number, more than 1 million sales every year since release. It's no surprise then that the developer plans to keep on pushing it, as they said they "do hope that Euro Truck Simulator 2 has at least another decade of further growth in front of it" and that "there are so many features will still want to implement, and so much new stuff we plan to bring you".</p>
<p>In this case, it seems there's simply no need at all for a third entry because this one is continually upgraded, it keeps expanding and obviously it's selling well for SCS.</p>
<p>The next DLC release for the game will be with the West Balkans, with no current ETA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discover, deliver and expand your trucking company to the countries of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia.</p>
<p>From large bustling cities to the countryside filled with beautiful nature, you will be able to explore what the Western Balkans have to offer.</p>
<p>You can look forward to many new things that these countries have to offer. Whether in terms of the industry, nature, landmarks, road networks, or a lot of other exciting content!</p>

      <title>System76 upgrade the Thelio desktops with Intel 13th Gen and new AMD Ryzen 7000 CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out for a new desktop? Want one from a company that builds them for Linux and has their own Linux distribution? <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a> just gave the Thelio line a nice big upgrade. Available across the Thelio and Thelio Mira, with the Thelio Major sticking to AMD Threadripper.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20743272571666625335gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20743272571666625335gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release: "What sets the Thelio desktop line apart from other desktops is its system-specific thermal engineering. The internals are engineered for optimal airflow, allowing the user’s components to perform at their best. Now, with the addition of Intel and AMD’s latest processors, Thelio and Thelio Mira will see boosted performance thanks to enhancements from CPU manufacturers."</p>
<p>Even better, you can save a whole lot of monies right now too as System76 are running a Halloween-themed promotion where the more you upgrade the bigger the discount. This applies to desktops <em>and</em> laptops, so you don't have to grab a Thelio to save.</p>
<p>Current starting prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thelio: $949</li>
<li>Mira: $999</li>
<li>Major: $3,499</li>

      <title>Steam continues growing hitting over 30 million online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days of the original green Steam client, that no one particularly liked? Hard to believe that it now sees over 30 million people online.</p>
<p>This huge new record was hit yesterday, with the new all-time peak according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" target="_blank">Steam Charts</a> page at 30,027,003. However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> lists it as 30,032,005. During this time the top games were Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, PUBG: Battlegrounds, Apex Legends and Lost Ark. So three out of the top five when Steam was at its peak work on Linux officially — not bad. About 8.5 million people were actually in-game at the time.</p>

<p>While I have you here: what have you been playing recently, what's your current top game on Linux? I've been sucked in really hard by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/brotato-is-going-to-be-my-next-horde-survival-arena-shooter-obsession/" target="_blank">Brotato</a>, trying out all the different characters and weapons has been a lot of fun.</p>

      <title>Widelands, The Settlers II inspired strategy game version 1.1 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love strategy games? Originally inspired by The Settlers II, the free and open source game Widelands has a big new release out now.</p>
<p>If you've somehow never played The Settlers: you start off with a small amount of territory, and you build up your village and gradually expand across the map. It's real-time but compared to a lot of strategy games it has a much slower and more relaxed style to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10630850521666622754gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10630850521666622754gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's new in Widelands 1.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Three new scenarios</strong>: One each for the Atlantean and Frisian campaigns, and a new standalone singleplayer mission.</li>
<li>An <strong>add-ons webserver</strong> allows efficient down- and uploading of add-ons as well as interactions such as voting and commenting on add-ons.</li>
<li><strong>High-resolution images</strong> for many units.</li>
<li><strong>Multithreading</strong> provides smoother performance.</li>
<li>Multiple enhancements to the in-game <strong>encyclopedia.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong>: Manage your alliances during the game.</li>
<li><strong>Fastplace</strong>: Assign custom shortcuts to buildings to place them with one keystroke.</li>
<li>In-game loading and restarting of games and scenarios.</li>
<li>Save and load in-game windows.</li>
<li>Editor tool history dialog.</li>
<li>Various AI enhancements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's available easily on Linux thanks to <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.widelands.Widelands" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. Or see more download links of their <a href="https://www.widelands.org/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve starts roll-out of the Steam Deck controller configurator to desktop Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3428954061810264313" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> replaces the old Big Picture Configurator for individual games, with the one from the Steam Deck and it's quite an improvement.</p>
<p>Big Picture mode was always slow, wanted full-screen and was generally a nuisance on desktop. The new one from the Steam Deck, that should eventually replace Big Picture entirely is much more fluid, can be resized and allows you to easily move the window around. It is a big improvement in just interacting with it as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9110501641666434615gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9110501641666434615gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19748482271666434569gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19748482271666434569gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20511981431666434703gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20511981431666434703gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7989993241666434825gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7989993241666434825gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Click screenshots to enlarge them.</em></p>
<p>To be clear, this is available via the right click -&gt; manage -&gt; controller layout menu on individual games. Valve has not yet replaced it for the generic controller settings from the main Steam settings area. Amusingly, they haven't quite ripped out all of the Steam Deck specific language yet though with a few screens just straight-up from the Deck (woops).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Full patch notes:<br/>
<strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improve responsiveness to changes in the local network connection</li>

      <title>Valve put up a few more fixes in the new Steam Deck Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another Beta update is available for the Steam Deck, with Valve adding in just a few more "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3414317363016822648" target="_blank">Friday fixes</a>". It's available in the Beta and Preview channels. You can opt into this in: Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved login times for users with large libraries.</li>
<li>Fixed links to store/discussions/etc in the Library.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when trying to view emojis in virtual keyboard in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Fixed improper DPI scaling on initial load.</li>
<li>Decreased load time of virtual keyboard and standalone controller configurator in desktop mode after the first time.</li>
<li>Properly resize virtual keyboard in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Streamlined joining a voice chat in groups without multiple voice chat channels. The footer button will now directly join or create a temporary channel rather than go to the voice chat management dialog.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone with 2,623 games in their Steam Library, I very much appreciate the updates to make the experience smoother because login time and initial load time on Deck is a bit slow for large libraries.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for Valve to fix or add next to the Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>Minecraft on Steam Deck Guide with Prism Launcher (and gamepad support)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Prism Launcher</a> has been released for Minecraft, rising from the ashes of the controversy with PolyMC (that you should no longer use). Here's all the info on it, plus a fresh Steam Deck Guide. I won't reiterate what happened with PolyMC, see the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/if-you-use-polymc-for-minecraft-you-should-switch-away-now/" target="_blank">previous article</a> on that, and please keep the comments focused on Prism and the Guide.</p>
<p>What is it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prism Launcher is a custom launcher for Minecraft that was forked from MultiMC. It allows the creation, and management of multiple installations of the game, or "instances" rather, each having their own separate mods, resource packs, settings, and more. While originally being forked over packaging/redistribution concerns, Prism Launcher brings new and exciting features developed by the community for the community. Furthermore, Prism Launcher is still just as true to its roots as ever in providing a project that vows to never bring hostility to those looking to fork, redistribute, or repackage, so long as the terms of our license are respected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, it gives you lots of features the official launcher doesn't have, along with really easy modding and it's great to use on Linux / Steam Deck too!</p>
<p>Here's a little guide video showing a fresh install, along with how to get gamepad controls thanks to <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controllable" target="_blank">Controllable</a> and some extra tips:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M8oqFUl791Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/791f47e726d2a2f07ac017f2595b78c1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M8oqFUl791Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text Guide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Steam Deck Desktop Mode -&gt; Open Discover and search for Prism Launcher, then install it.</li>
<li>From the KDE Plasma Menu, find Prism, right click and select Add to Steam.</li>
<li>Open Prism, select Manage Profiles and go through the process to add your Microsoft Account.</li>
<li>Then you can select Add Instance, and pick whatever Minecraft you want to install.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Gamepad Support:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the Edit button with an Instance selected.</li>
<li>Go to Mods on the left panel, select Download Mods.</li>
<li>Select CurseForge on the left, then search for and install Controllable.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the basic setup done.</p>
<p>However, if you wish to have Prism load a single instance, you can add this to the end of your Steam Launch Option in the Properties window of Prism: <code class="inline-code">-l *instance name*</code></p>
<p>Additionally, if you still wish to show the launcher, say you wish to pick from multiple instances, you may want to have it close automatically once you're playing Minecraft. Find those in the main Settings, select Minecraft on the left and down the bottom are two tickboxes to control this behaviour.</p>

      <title>Persona 5 Royal is a great Steam Deck experience</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With another major release from SEGA and Atlus now here with Persona 5 Royal, the good news is that it's Steam Deck Verified and it really does work nicely.</p>
<p>It's really interesting to see how far Proton has come as a Windows game compatibility layer, considering the previous game had numerous problems for quite some time and yet this works right at release. Nice to see the work from Valve and CodeWeavers on it paying off.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zQtliJ69FZY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e3426c5a41bde74b16371561891f4a26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zQtliJ69FZY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Out of the box, you'll get somewhere between 2 and a half to 3 hours on a single Steam Deck charge, if you keep at it 60FPS which is pretty reasonable. Probably even longer than that, since the power draw dips down every time there's a cut-scene (and there's many). You will easily get even more juice putting it down to 30FPS, which in this type of games feels fine.</p>
<p>Text entry even brings up a full-screen text area with the Deck on-screen keyboard, showing it was properly tested and hooked up for the release. That, and the performance is pretty much spot-on, with it mostly sticking to 60FPS. Honestly, it has been one of the best Deck Verified experiences I've seen yet.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore Tokyo, unlock Personas, customize your own personal Thieves Den, experience alternate endings, and more.</li>
<li>Become the ultimate Phantom Thief and defy conventions, discover the power within, and fight for justice in the definitive version of Persona 5 Royal.</li>
<li>Includes over 40 items of previously released downloadable content.</li>
<li>Choose between Japanese and English VO.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone who never got into Persona before, this has been a really great experience and I would now somewhat consider myself a Persona fan.</p>
<p>Buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/persona-5-royal?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>RimWorld - Biotech and the free 1.4 update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ludeon Studios have just released a rather big expansion to the colony building sim RimWorld with Biotech, along with the free 1.4 update for all players.</p>
<p>This big new expansion really does change the game in quite a number of ways. With you being able to have children colonists now, who will grow up and you will be able to choose traits for them and hopefully turn them into productive workers. There's also the ability to turn colonists into a mechanitor, a person with a special brain implant that lets them psychically command semi-living machines. On top of that you also get gene editing, giving you the ability to create xenohumans with special exotic traits.</p>
<p>As a reminder on the 1.4 patch that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup performance improvements.</li>
<li>Painting and color customization for walls, floors, furniture, and lights.</li>
<li>Actually useful shelves that store lots of stuff.</li>
<li>Two new turret types.</li>
<li>Starting possessions for some colonists.</li>
<li>Rot stink from corpses.</li>
<li>New mod manager UI.</li>
<li>New options menu.</li>
<li>Heat overlay.</li>
<li>Quest search bar.</li>
<li>Tile inspector.</li>
<li>+ More</li>
</ul>

<p>Some compatibility notes to be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unmodded savegames from 1.3 will load in 1.4.</li>
<li>Many mods have already been updated by wonderful modders during the 1.4 preview over the last few weeks. However, some are not yet updated and won't work on 1.4.</li>
<li>If you want to keep playing version 1.3, please use Steam beta branch "version-1.3-latest".
	<div class="bbcodes_Italic_3PSCE BB_Italic">To do this, r-click RimWorld in the Steam library, go to properties, open the betas tab, and select the version from the dropdown.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Ubuntu 22.10 &#39;Kinetic Kudu&#39; is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical has released the latest version of their Linux distribution <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> with Ubuntu 22.10 "Kinetic Kudu".</p>
<p>This includes another 6 months of software improvements throughout the whole stack since the last release. This is not a LTS release though, with it only being supported for 9 months until July 2023. If you need to have a fully stable system that keeps being updated, stick with Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10101023211666352466gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10101023211666352466gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14759168621666352465gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14759168621666352465gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the big new features includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux kernel 5.19, which supports the new futex_waitv that can help gaming along with lots of new hardware support.</li>
<li>PipeWire for audio by default.</li>
<li>Default image apps now support the .webp format.</li>
<li>GNOME 43.</li>
<li>Various improvements for Raspberry Pi users.</li>
<li>Plus all the usual updates to various included software.</li>
<li><a href="https://ubuntuunity.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Unity</a> is now an official supported flavour.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a video overview, our friends at <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/10/ubuntu-22-10-video-new-features" target="_blank">OMG Ubuntu</a> gave it a fresh look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MzBsI9XZpEg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5d872fa622b2de03111ccde5aaff5892.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MzBsI9XZpEg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://ubuntu.com//blog/what-the-steam-snap-is-evolving" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Canonical also detailed more info about their Snap package of Steam. They noted it has seen "more than 75 thousand downloads", so it's clearly a lot more popular than comments across various places would make you believe. Sounds like they're doing better on getting driver updates out faster too.</p>

      <title>Valve doing quick hotfixes in Proton for big game releases on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an interesting one I came across recently. It seems Valve are doing small hotfix releases of Proton, to go along with some of the bigger releases to get them working.</p>
<p>The problem is that each release of Proton needs a fair amount of quality assurance testing by Valve and their partners CodeWeavers. Proton releases are quite a while between, and with the amount of games releasing constantly, they don't always make a new release in time to get them all working on Steam Deck / Linux.</p>
<p>So this is where quick hotfixes come in.</p>
<p>Recently there was a Beta of <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais showed off on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1578571751696797696" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. In the replies, they <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1578573603498790914" target="_blank">noted</a> "All the fixes are now deployed on Proton Hotfix and that branch is selected by default for the game for all players.".</p>
<p>This happened again recently with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, with Griffais posting on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1582138691514175489" target="_blank">Twitter</a> "We have just deployed a performance hotfix for Cyberpunk 2077 on the Deck, no update necessary beyond just restarting the device to get it picked up.".</p>
<p>Today we have <em>Gotham Knights</em> releasing, and once again Valve are on top of it. Gene Park from The Washington Post noted on <a href="https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1583080913428414465" target="_blank">Twitter</a> how it wouldn't run on Steam Deck and Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1583263905845227522" target="_blank">replied</a> "We've just made a couple fixes and backend changes - it should launch if you un-force Proton selection and try again (or force Proton Hotfix).".</p>
<p><em>Since Valve set it automatically, you don't need to do anything, unless you forced a version of Proton then you need to undo it.</em></p>
<p>No doubt there will be plenty more of these quick fixes in future, as developers find so many ways to do things differently and break things or use things that the main Proton releases don't yet support. Valve are up against a moving target for Windows compatibility with Proton. Eventually though, Proton hopefully get to a stage where things like this aren't needed.</p>
<p><em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/proton-70-5-is-coming-soon-improving-steam-deck-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-5 is currently in testing</a> to bring more game support to Steam Deck / Linux.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta adds way to view components, Valve confirms fan changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3414317363013182309" target="_blank">Steam Deck Beta</a> and it's a rather interesting one, with a few nice new features along with the ability to see what components your Steam Deck shipped with. You can also now skip the intro video.</p>
<p>Skipping the intro video was no doubt added as developers at Valve laughed at how someone set their boot video <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/y3htzd/help_ive_set_my_boot_video_to_shrek_and_now_i/" target="_blank">to the movie Shrek</a>, and had to sit through it.</p>
<p>The new ability to view your Steam Deck components is also an interesting one, Valve said they did this to "provide further clarity and transparency about the components and their sources for your specific Steam Deck" and so you don't have to open it up. Useful for repairs and replacements. You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/hardwareused" target="_blank">view via the web</a> directly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8876279461666346820gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8876279461666346820gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, it also included a note about fan noise. Valve confirmed they've put in some engineered foam on the Steam Deck backplate to reduce noise, along with confirmation both fan types are still being used. This was likely inspired by a user who fixed their noise <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uckns3/how_i_fixed_my_whiny_delta_fan_with_electrical/" target="_blank">with electrical tape</a>.</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Vampire Survivors started a craze and the 1.0 release is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors is a time-survival <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde game</a> that started something of a craze, with many games copying their blueprint and now Vampire Survivors 1.0 is out.</p>
<p>With an Overwhelmingly Positive user review score from over 100,000 people, it's clearly hit the mark and it's easy to see why. With simple pick up and go gameplay, and the still low price at the 1.0 release — it's an ideal game to sink some time into regardless of it being on a coffee break or half your evening.</p>
<p>In the 1.0 release they've added quite a lot including a new event stage, new character art, a new weapon, a new B-side soundtrack, lots more translations, Twitch integration, an "Inverse Mode" that flips the maps, an Endless Mode that gets progressively more difficult forever and lots more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aS7JqyHdQQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b0d16ad23a843acd6bd4e927d422e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aS7JqyHdQQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Going by their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/vampire-survivors-10-coming-october-20th-seems-a-linux-port-is-still-planned/" target="_blank">previously announced roadmap</a>, they're still working on a game engine port along with a supported Linux version once that's done.</p>
<p>For such a simple game, I've sunk a surprising amount of hours into it. With the 1.0 release, no doubt I will be playing plenty more of it, although it has to compete with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/brotato-is-going-to-be-my-next-horde-survival-arena-shooter-obsession/" target="_blank">Brotato</a> for my time which is very similar and also great. I really do love just how insane these games get once you've put a few minutes into them, with the screen covered by enemies as all your abilities are flying around.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2777375981666285538gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2777375981666285538gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Vampire Survivors 1.0 - my first run today</em></p>
<p>There's just something about these simple games I can't get enough of. I can easily recommend you go and pick this one up, lots of replay value and plenty to unlock as you go through it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>An interview with the creator of Deckmate, the Steam Deck attachment system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you seen the <a href="https://deckmate.me/" target="_blank">Deckmate</a> yet? I'm a big fan and use it quite often. A thoroughly useful attachment system for the Steam Deck and I had the chance to speak to the creator about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16919121991666208578gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16919121991666208578gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Q: First of all, can you introduce yourself?</strong></p>
<p>"My name is Siri Ramos. Mechanical engineer by trade, maker/designer also by trade, DIY home renovator by night."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get started making things like the Deckmate?</strong></p>
<p>"Surprisingly, it’s only recently that I started to make the connection between my childhood desires and my current skill set. I always watched How it’s Made on the Discovery Channel with intense fascination and was endlessly entertained by gadgets and product design. Looking back now it seems like destiny that I ended up doing what I do.</p>
<p>It was only by pure chance that I ended up in my field. I didn’t even know it existed until I was a junior in college. I stumbled across it during a career fair while I was searching for my first internship. Another coincidence: I studied the exact right discipline that would land me a job in this field.</p>
<p>Once I discovered Product Design Engineering, my entire focus landed on getting that first job in the field. I took design for manufacturing classes, my senior thesis was a product idea I wanted to make, I delved into the world of startup design. The field seemed endless at the time, and I was at just the right school to tackle it, Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>By the time my curriculum was complete, I had one big choice to make. On one hand, I had landed an incredible job offer from Apple as a Product Design Engineer. On the other hand, we were getting some traction with some seed round investors on our senior thesis idea to redesign the Epipen to be flat packed as an iPhone case.</p>
<p>The choice boiled down to: Do I venture out and make my own product, or do I accept the job offer from Apple?</p>
<p>In my young naivete, I turned down the Apple job.</p>
<p>We got a seed round of funding, and we all aligned our lives to try and make a brand new medical device. 3 broke and inexperienced college kids taking on one of the most complex type of product design that exists. Medical devices, in hindsight, was one of the worst entry points to release a product. Regulatory compliance, high cost of failure (people dying!), and very little money add up to a company that was doomed to fail from the very start.</p>
<p>Needless to say, less than a year later we were even broker and at each other’s throats as founders. I made the tough decision to leave on a Friday morning in October.</p>
<p>That afternoon, I emailed the hiring manager at Apple that had previously offered me the job. Tail sheepishly tucked back, I asked if he still had a role open for head count.</p>
<p>What happened next honestly astonished me. He called me immediately after opening my email saying the team was off the following Tuesday to all fly to China for work. He asked if I could come in and interview with the team on Monday before everyone flew out. Of course I said yes.</p>
<p>After a whirlwind of flights and interview prep, I arrived on Monday morning semi-ready for a full 8 hour day of back to back technical interviews. By the end of the design challenge around 4pm, my new manager walked me out and offered me the job. I had the  job offer in hand less than 1 business day after I had quit my startup.</p>
<p>I learned everything I know at Apple. From design for manufacturing to how things are actually made, I consider Apple to be my university for product design. This is where I learned how products are truly made. Not in theory, but in practice and at MASSIVE scales. I was single handedly designing products that were being manufactured at a peak rate of 1 million units per day. Needless to say the engineering side was technical, and it had to be perfect.</p>
<p>I chugged along designing stuff for other companies and startups for over 10 years. It’s only recently that I decided to delve fully  into a little side project I designed called Deckmate."</p>

<p><strong>Q: How did you get the idea for the Deckmate? Why did you make it?</strong></p>
<p>"Honestly, I got the idea because the Steam Deck needed it. Some things you use and the design is begging for a slight modification. This is what happened to me and the Deck. Within one day of using mine (got an early unit around April), I knew it needed a kickstand at the very least. Then it got my design brain thinking about everything else it could do. It really made me want to have a quick system that could interchange and morph into exactly what I needed based on how I was using the Deck.</p>
<p>After posting the rough idea on Reddit, I got feedback and ideas for other use cases. This is how the VESA mount was born. To be honest this is my favorite mount of all. My Steam deck lives essentially permanently above my PC on a monitor arm unless I’m using it to go.</p>
<p>There are tons more mount ideas in the works, and the system will expand to far more devices as well. My intention is to make Deckmate the Quad-lock for video games. Every mount to fit your needs on any device you own."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you tell us a little about <em>how</em> you actually make it? What’s your process like?</strong></p>
<p>"It all starts in a software program called CAD. I use a professional grade CAD program by Siemens called NX.</p>
<p>The process goes a bit like this: </p>
<ol>
<li>Sit back and process what idea you want to make.</li>
<li>Start modeling in CAD and solidify how it will work</li>
<li>3D print a prototype</li>
<li>Repeat 50 times</li>
</ol>
<p>The modeling in CAD is where a lot of the experience comes in. As you model you need to not only know how to use the program to effectively model what you want, but you need to keep in mind all the constraints that you’ve learned over the years. Everything from manufacturing limitations and cosmetic concerns, to strength and product reliability must be kept in mind when modeling.</p>
<p>It’s very easy with 3D printing to design something that you can print. This is because 3D printing has relatively few manufacturing constraints. When you are designing for Injection molding, the parts have wildly different constraints. This is the big reason the molded parts are different from the 3D printed parts that you can download on the website.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with the design, you reach out to molding suppliers and start a process called DFM (design for manufacture). They process what it will be like to actually make in the mold. Everything from where the material shoots into the empty cavity, where the cooling lines in the steel are, how the plastic flows across the cavity, temperatures and pressures, etc. This is where the really technical stuff gets done and determines how your final product comes out and how reliable it is. Here are some screenshots of that process:"</p>

<p><strong>Q: Had any weird attachment requests from customers?</strong></p>
<p>"The one I always find a little different is people asking about a way to mount a screen above the Deck. It’s a very interesting application, but I don’t think Deckmate is the right solution for it unfortunately. With the spring system in the Deckmate, having a screen mounted wouldn’t do well with vibrations."</p>
<p><strong>Q: It’s been out for a little while now, has it been a success?</strong></p>
<p>"I would say it has been a phenomenal success! I’ve now shipped almost 3,000 orders with only 4 people who wanted to return it. That’s a phenomenal return rate.</p>
<p>More importantly, I get people messaging me every day how much they love it. And that’s my main motivator. I want to make things people love and that can make their lives easier. My biggest indicator of success came when I got an email from a customer who was using their Deckmate system to allow them to mount their Deck to their leg. It honestly melted my heart and it made me feel the most success over anything."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17664763191666208350gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17664763191666208350gol1.jpg" style="width:80%"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Q: Any plans for more Steam Deck accessories? Or perhaps you have some more attachments for the Deckmate planned?</strong></p>
<p>"There are so many more mounts that I want to tackle: Car mount, airplane mount, ¼-20 camera/tripod mount, etc.</p>
<p>There are also a ton of other devices I want to make grips for: Nintendo switch, All the Aya devices, etc.</p>
<p>With those two approaches together I think Deckmate can become a pretty powerful mounting system for video games!"</p>

      <title>Someone released the FOSS RTS 0 A.D. on Steam without speaking to the developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve has now taken it down.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here's a "fun" one for you. The developers behind the free and open source RTS named <a href="https://play0ad.com/" target="_blank">0 A.D.</a> (pronounced “zero-ey-dee”) have announced that someone (they don't know who) has put it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2158440/0_AD_Empires_Ascendant/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>This is sometimes the perils of open source, as there's a lot of people out their looking to make a quick-buck and they don't care who they burn in the process. To be clear, the version of 0 A.D. that has released on Steam (with it missing the second dot in the name), is not actually from the people who make the game — even though Wildfire Games are listed as the developer on Steam it's not them. Confusing right? Valve allowed it and approved it, so it does make me curious what legal checks are even done for this to happen.</p>
<p>I was notified of this on Twitter, with the official 0 A.D. account <a href="https://twitter.com/play0ad/status/1582881816062873600" target="_blank">tweeting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out the only reason <a class="css-16my406 css-18t94o4 css-4rbku5 css-901oao r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-bcqeeo r-poiln3 r-qvutc0" href="https://twitter.com/YouTube" target="_blank">@YouTube</a> added the game back is because somebody uploaded 0 A.D. to  <a class="css-16my406 css-18t94o4 css-4rbku5 css-901oao r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-bcqeeo r-poiln3 r-qvutc0" href="https://twitter.com/Steam" target="_blank">@Steam</a> without our consent. It also explains the typo in the name…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/play0ad/status/1583100868236546050" target="_blank">tweet</a> sent today by the 0 A.D. team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT: The person who released the game on steam today is charging 8€ for it. Please do not buy it. The game is free and always will be. It might contain viruses and other malware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine it doesn't have anything nefarious inside it, otherwise you really would have to wonder what Valve are doing…</p>
<p>Looking on the official game forum <a href="https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/96792-will-0ad-be-released-on-steam/" target="_blank">there's a topic</a> asking about it, the developers seems to be at a loss as to what is happening.</p>

      <title>AMD to fully reveal next-gen AMD Radeon RDNA 3 in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A short but sweet announcement was sent out by AMD today, as they've now set a date for when they will fully reveal AMD Radeon RDNA 3, their next-gen GPU architecture. Something we had a very brief teaser of when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/amd-announced-qzen-4q-with-ryzen-7000-series-rdna3-teased/" target="_blank">they announced Zen 4</a>.</p>
<p>Their "together we advance_gaming" event will be livestreamed on November 3rd at 1PM PDT / 8PM UTC. As the press released noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced “<strong>together we advance_gaming</strong>,” a livestream event to unveil the next generation of AMD Radeon™ graphics. AMD executives will provide details on the new high-performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA™ 3 architecture that will deliver new levels of performance, efficiency and functionality to gamers and content creators.</p>
<p>The show premieres at 1:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday, November 3, on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AMD" target="_blank">AMD YouTube channel</a>. A replay can be accessed a few hours after the conclusion of the event at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/radeon-rx-graphics" target="_blank">AMD.com/Radeon</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are <em>you</em> really hoping for from AMD RDNA 3?</p>
<p>For me: I'm hoping for power requirements that aren't completely ridiculous (hi NVIDIA), along with cards that don't just serve the top-end. It's not much to ask really is it?</p>

      <title>Silent Hill 2 remake announced and coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A much loved action-horror classic Silent Hill 2 is getting a modern remake and the good news is that it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. So it will most likely run in some form on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet and it's likely a good while off, so it gives Valve (and their partner CodeWeavers) plenty of time to keep on improving the Proton compatibility layer to ensure it's ready for more big hits like this. The Silent Hill 2 remake is being developed by Bloober Team SA, who are known for Layers of Fear, Blair Witch and The Medium.</p>
<p>I remember trying to play the original and "noping" out of it pretty quickly. Scary stuff back then.</p>

      <title>UNCHARTED is great on Steam Deck! Here&#39;s how to fix it on Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection out now and Steam Deck Verified, I've been able to see that it does work great! However, it requires some very small tweaks to get it working on a normal Linux desktop.</p>
<p>No doubt at some point Valve will get these fixes into the Proton compatibility layer directly, but until they've sorted it (which could be weeks / months) here's what to do. Thankfully on the official Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6246" target="_blank">bug tracker</a>, users have been reporting the issues and coming up with solutions.</p>
<p>For <strong>AMD</strong> GPUs you need this Steam launch option set:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">WINEDLLOVERRIDES="amd_ags_x64.dll=b" %command% </code></p>
<p>For <strong>NVIDIA</strong> GPUs you need this Steam launch option set:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 %command%</code></p>
<p>If you don't know how to set a launch option: right click the game in your Steam Library, go to Properties and the General tab has the text box at the bottom:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14900158671666270888gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14900158671666270888gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That should be all you need to do, then the game should load properly on a normal Linux desktop / laptop. On the Steam Deck though, it's click and play. I've been thoroughly impressed with the Steam Deck experience overall, apart from an initial Deck-specific hiccup I experienced that needed a reboot. I seemed to catch a rare bug where Steam Input just stops working but all good after a reboot, so not a problem with the game but a random bug on the Steam Deck itself.</p>
<p>Here's some footage below on Medium (the default) and then later on High settings:</p>

<p>Here's what's changed in version 0.5.12-beta1:</p>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix authentication issue with Origin.</li>
<li>Fix authentication issue with EGS.</li>

<li>Add Discord Rich Presence integration.</li>
<li>Add ability to extract icons from Windows executables.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6499202761666199359gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6499202761666199359gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Lucy Dreaming is a quality point and click adventure with great British humour</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You know a game is going to be good, when you're already chuckling away in the first few minutes. Point and click adventure Lucy Dreaming is out now.  Note: the developer sent a key over.</p>
<p>It's a good time to be a point and click adventure fan right? With the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/return-to-monkey-island-gets-a-linux-beta-version/" target="_blank">Return to Monkey Island</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/foolish-mortals-is-an-upcoming-spooky-point-and-click-adventure/" target="_blank">Foolish Mortals</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/sweet-point-and-click-dino-adventure-zid-journey-is-up-on-kickstarter-with-demo/" target="_blank">Zid Journey</a> all mentioned here recently. Anyway, this time it's Lucy Dreaming. Influenced by the classics from the 90s from the pixel-art style to the silly humour, it's a great little game worth your time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OEpatYJIG4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63608b3708efd8f7b7bc4baaa1a6b6c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OEpatYJIG4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The humour might perhaps not be to everyone's tastes though, considering the very Britishness of it and some of the jokes might fly over your head a bit. I certainly appreciated it though! Some pretty clever and very funny references throughout, like the "Now That's What I Call Chill" tape that reminded me of all the classic TV adverts for the music CD collections and the "Sorny" laptop. The references keep going, even in the first room there's a good few to spot but I don't want to spoil it all obviously.</p>
<p>If you usually like these types of point and clickers, you can't really go wrong with it. Plenty of logical puzzles and item hunting, with combining various items and an unusual way to dry your clothes. Lucy Dreaming didn't have a big budget, it was a tiny team that made it and yet it's quite a memorable little experience.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a wide variety of detailed dreams and real-world locations from a neon-lit comedy club with an unusual clientele to a post-apocalyptic boulangerie<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Encounter a cast of characters from Lucy’s maniacal brother to a giant duck with a bread problem.</li>
<li>Explore rich environments with an abundance of witty retorts to almost everything you can point your cursor at.</li>
<li>Reveal hidden Easter eggs and pop culture references.</li>
<li>Enjoy the distinctive and beautifully realised voice acting (English)</li>
<li>Travel instantly between scenes with a double-click.</li>
<li>Having trouble? Just hit the space bar to get a sneaky peek of each scene’s hotspots.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532710/Lucy_Dreaming/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and <a href="https://tallstorygames.itch.io/lucy-dreaming" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>FIFA? Nah, give me more of Pixel Cup Soccer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more Football in your life? Yes, I said Football, get over it. Pixel Cup Soccer - Ultimate Edition is officially out now along with Native Linux support. This game took over from Pixel Cup Soccer 17, which the developer unlisted on Steam, as this big new version is quite different as the developer said "the essence of the new game is the same, the technological differences are huge".</p>
<p>It recently left Early Access and it is also Steam Deck Verified, so could be a good one to look at for you sports fans, especially with the latest FIFA being unsupported (and it has a Mostly Negative rating). This definitely looks promising with a Very Positive user rating too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n17quOCXIeU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eda3299ac9f58669b513ab40dc311552.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n17quOCXIeU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simplified Controls For Casual Players.</li>
<li>Easy to pick up and enjoy, with clean and challenging gameplay.</li>
<li>Retro-style art resembling old games and evoking nostalgia.</li>
<li>Women’s Soccer.</li>
<li>Penalties, Free Kicks.</li>
<li>Fouls, injuries, yellow and red cards.</li>
<li>Tactical and Strategy panels, to manage player substitutions, team formation, and attitude.</li>
<li>Deep gameplay mechanics: short pass, through pass, lob pass, aiming when shooting, controlled shots, player skills, super shots, etc.</li>
<li>Lots of Animations (overhead kick, scorpion kick, scissor kick, diving header, etc.)</li>
<li>Challenging AI. Teams with very different playing styles (ie: Catenaccio like Italy or Tiki-Taka like Brasil).</li>
<li>Many game settings, including Zoom Level, VSync, Slow motion, Assisted mode, Language Selection, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Growing up playing the likes of Sensible World of Soccer on the Amiga, this game definitely ticks a lot of nostalgia boxes for me.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620540/Pixel_Cup_Soccer__Ultimate_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There is also a demo available too!</p>

      <title>GB Operator is a fun gadget for Game Boy fans tested on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/play-real-game-boy-cartridges-on-steam-deck-linux-with-gb-operator/" target="_blank">Recently</a> I mentioned <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/" target="_blank">GB Operator</a> a little USB gadget that reads cartridges of the Game Boy, Game Boy Colour and Game Boy Advance. After giving it a go myself (personal purchase), I'm impressed and a little in love.</p>
<p>The idea is that it allows you to play games from cartridges directly using a built-in emulator with their Operator app, along with the ability to back up to roms to have your own private collection that you can then use in whatever emulator you want. You can also mess with save files, allowing you to back them up (say if your cart won't save properly) or edit them for your own entertainment.</p>
<p>Here's a first look at the device with a Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZMxK3SK30Dc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70610e4edfbb125415326b9c9c90918b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZMxK3SK30Dc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As mentioned in the video it's not perfected yet. They need an easy way to cleanly exit the cart on Steam Deck, with it currently relying on keyboard ESC which doesn't work properly. It also sometimes won't open the Operator app, unless you unplug the device and plug it back in. Some small quirks that can probably be fixed quite easily but overall a pretty fun experience to begin playing with.</p>
<p>If you're a collector of retro games, this is great. Awesome for game preservation too and the fact that it works on Linux so easily, that's another big tick in the box.</p>
<p>Once I've had more time to play with it, I'll have a lot more thoughts but if you do have any comments or questions do let me know.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck adds External Display Safe Mode setting, 30 second boot videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now the official Steam Deck Docking Station is out, a lot more people are testing the Steam Deck on external displays showing up numerous issues so Valve has added a little something to help.</p>
<p>In true Valve style when it comes to the Steam Deck, they released a Beta and then only a few <em>hours</em> later put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3414317363006517615" target="_blank">stable release</a>. They sure do love pushing things out early. This does pull in the changes from a bunch of recent other Beta versions too so here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>General</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>The Quick Access Menu will now open to the notifications tab when you have new friend chat messages, game invites, or voice chat invites</li>
<li>Notifications for Game Invites in the Quick Access Menu now have an option in the footer to accept them without having to navigate to the chat window</li>
<li>Added External Display Safe Mode to developer settings. When enabled, the next time an external display is plugged in Steam Deck will pick a low resolution configuration, which may help in some cases where the external display has issues.</li>
<li>Increase boot animation max length from 10 seconds to 30 seconds</li>
<li>Added controller-specific glyphs on the Lock screen</li>
<li>Don't show the "switch to desktop" option in the power menu when the lock screen is active.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Steam group chats with long names or descriptions could cause break the layout of the chat screen</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the Lock screen where you'd have to dismiss the On-Screen Keyboard manually if you slept the device while it was up</li>
<li>Fixed invoking the On-Screen-Keyboard while already in a full-screen keyboard input scenario causing bad behavior.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the Performance Overlay would still show when set to off.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Restore the previous behavior of using stick deflection rather than the capacitive sensor for Radial Menus that don't have center buttons bound</li>
<li>Fixed an in-game crash</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with editing command settings from inside the virtual menu screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm currently still testing the official Steam Deck Docking Station myself, and should have some thoughts up at the end of the week after I've played around with it some more.</p>

      <title>Windows compatibility layer Wine version 7.19 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just before the weekend hit, a new development release of the Windows compatibility layer Wine went up with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.19" target="_blank">version 7.19</a>. This is part of Steam Play Proton, which allows you to play tons of Windows games on Steam Deck and Linux desktops. Once a year they make a big new stable release, and eventually Proton updates to it too.</p>
<p>Release highlights for Wine 7.19:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for storing DOS attributes on disk.</li>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.5.</li>
<li>Support for MPEG-4 audio format.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>17 bugs this time were noted to be solved including fixes for: Resident Evil Revelations 2; Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Kheops Studio adventure games, Sonic Adventure DX and various other miscellaneous bug fixes.</p>
<p>Want help managing Wine installs? I usually use the <a href="http://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> app, which makes it pretty easy.</p>

      <title>Sweet point and click dino adventure Zid Journey is up on Kickstarter with demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your point and click adventures and want to see more? Zid Journey is a new one from the team behind Zniw Adventure. It's a classic 2D point 'n click adventure game, developed in a tiny team from Poland. Just like the first game, it will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Zid Journey tells the story of Zid, and focuses on his quest of reuniting a little Daspletosaurus hatchling with its lost parents, while also trying to uncover his own mysterious origins. The developers said that their first game, Zniw Adventure, was "welcomed with enthusiasm and enjoyed by many players" and so this encouraged them to continue making more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EvwbdgQBDas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6f857bc201c59a1bf820bc716d08782.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EvwbdgQBDas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A relaxing point 'n click with an cartoon/comic-book aesthetic and familiar prehistoric world.</li>
<li>Charming visuals featuring cartoony art style, hand-drawn backgrounds, and frame-by-frame animations!</li>
<li>Over 20 dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures to meet during your journey.</li>
<li>Visit new places, landmarks, and settlements in the lore-rich, prehistoric world of Polisemia!</li>
<li>Seveal unlockables, including dinopedia pages and bonus content!</li>
<li>A safe adventure for everyone - no gore, blood, or bad language.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their Kickstarter campaign only has a small goal of €8,000 which has already been hit. A very small goal to make a game with, and it seems like it's mainly to hire a little help to get it across the finishing line.</p>
<p>Fund it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/azuremountain/zid-journey" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and try the new demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1814690/Zid_Journey/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Theme park building sim Indoorlands is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indoorlands, a somewhat unique theme park building sim has left Early Access as a finished game ready for you to get clicking around. What's the different about this one then? Well, as the name hints towards, you're building everything inside. An indoor amusement park, that you build up using these massive connected rooms. It comes with Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e80MfXtOiO8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fd005c31ed7194a446d4750cf4f60eda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e80MfXtOiO8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As a <strong>manager</strong>, you have to build and expand your park, analyze and satisfy your guests’ needs, research attractions and buildings and keep the economy running.</li>
<li>Place <strong>research </strong>centers to generate research points and unlock more attractions, restaurants, shops, halls, and rides. Research points can also be spent on general park improvements.</li>
<li>Thrill rides take center stage: As a <strong>ride operator</strong>, you realistically control your rides and record unique ride programs that put a smile on your guests‘ faces.</li>
<li>The ‘<strong>Create Your Ride</strong>’ tool even offers the ability to construct your own, completely unique rides and share them via STEAM workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Roller coasters</strong> attract visitors. You can construct your own tracks and use different types of gondolas and stations. Of course, blueprints and the Steam workshop can also be used here.</li>
<li>Different <strong>visitor types</strong> have different demands and desires. Attention should be paid to this as new types of visitors arrive at the park over time and certain buildings should be built accordingly.</li>
<li>There is no limit to your creativity: Over 1000 <strong>decoration</strong> objects from various themes to choose from. All themes and objects are freely combinable, so each hall is unique due to the individual design choices. </li>
<li><strong>Blueprint System</strong>: Show your creativity &amp; share your hall interior designs, and ride and coaster creations with other players via STEAM Workshop integration.Planning the park architecture is a challenging task.</li>
<li>Space is expensive and maintenance buildings like toilets should be built apart from the <strong>flow of visitors</strong>. Different tools like the feedback report, heatmaps, and individual visitor details provide all the information needed.</li>
<li>React to <strong>special events and temporary trends</strong>. Choose and fulfill contracts to receive rewards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Leon Jeutter, Community Manager of Pixelsplit Simulations, says: “What a ride this has been - our great community supported us all the way through Early Access. Now the game is ready we are excited to present Indoorlands to players worldwide in the form it was meant to be played, a deep, engaging theme park management simulation with lots of ways for players to experience it according to their playing style.”</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/indoorlands?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1378890/Indoorlands/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>LOST EMBER should run nicer on Steam Deck / Linux, as dev fixes video issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LOST EMBER is an adventure game all about the power of nature. Released back in 2019, it seems recently that went back to it to ensure it works nicely on Steam Deck (and so Linux too).</p>
<p>Going by various reports of people who tried to play it previously, it had a problem where the movies wouldn't work and it seems that just stopped the game working as a whole. The developer was paying attention thankfully and put up a patch to solve the issues.</p>
<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/563840/view/3328747612251304994" target="_blank">announcement</a> earlier this month, the developer posted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might have noticed that Lost Ember is finally playable on the Steam Deck! :) The game had a couple of video issues on the Steam Deck, but we've finally found a way to eliminate those soooo:<br/>
<br/>
- Lost Ember is now running on Steam Deck!<br/>
- Alongside the development for both Steam Deck and the VR version, a variety of fixes made their way into the new build. Especially a couple of crashes and collision bugs should no finally be fixed<br/>
<br/>
We love Lost Ember on Steam Deck! Let us know what you think &lt;3 And if you're still experiencing bugs, please continue reporting them!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vo7CPfVu7MY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cd29ef5424c2f4f0ce9cd4dcc44ac14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vo7CPfVu7MY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As always, great to see developers ensure their games work better on the Steam Deck. It now has a Deck Playable rating, mainly as the text can be a little too small to be Deck Verified. Hopefully the developer will solve that too, which is an issue many games have where it seems the developers made it with their eye-balls directly up against the screen.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lost-ember?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563840/LOST_EMBER/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-5 is coming soon improving Steam Deck / Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are preparing to launch the latest update to Steam Play Proton, the compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Proton 7.0-5 is now in the Release Candidate testing stage, so it's not quite finished but you can give it a test yourself. Right now, they're looking for testing and reports on anything that is broken that wasn't before. For instructions, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6240" target="_blank">GitHub topic</a>.</p>
<p>The tentative changelog (as it may change before final release):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Now playable:
	<ul>
<li>Rift</li>
<li>Unravel 2</li>
<li>Airborne Kingdom</li>
<li>ToGather:Island</li>
<li>Nancy Drew: Legend of the Crystal Skull</li>
<li>Re-Volt</li>
<li>Warhammer: Vermintide 2</li>
<li>Aspire: Ina's Tale</li>
<li>Battle Realms: Zen Edition</li>
<li>Deathsmiles II</li>
<li>Primal Carnage: Extinction</li>
<li>Pico Park Classic Edition</li>
<li>Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind</li>
<li>Darkstar One</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Emperor Tomb</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered displaying dialog about outdated drivers on AMD systems.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) having no audio.</li>
<li>Fix Return to Monkey Island not reacting to mouse clicks after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix upsidedown videos in VRChat and many other games.</li>
<li>Fix Call of Duty Black Ops II Zombies and Multiplayer hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fix Bail or Jail Demo crashing when opening the Terms of Serivce.</li>
<li>Improve GTA V situation with not loading textures.</li>
<li>Fix Red Dead Redemption 2 crashing after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher functionality after game update.</li>
<li>Fix OpenXR compatibility with Blacktop Hoops.</li>
<li>Fix cutscene stutter in Disgaea 5.</li>
<li>Fix Thrustmaster HOTAS having non-functional dial in Elite Dangerous.</li>
<li>Fix Planet Zoo randomly crashing.</li>
<li>Fix SCP: Secret Labratory not being playable after a recent game update (again).</li>
<li>Fix Tekken 7 crashing at launch.</li>
<li>Implement network video support for The Good Life and VRChat.</li>
<li>Update dxvk to v1.10.3-28-ge3daa699.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 should probably not be listed as playable, since it has some pretty major problems still.</p>
<p>Also, Valve, are you ever going to actually mark Paladins as Unsupported again? It has been broken due to the anti-cheat for months. It's really not inspiring any confidence in Deck Verified if a well-known broken game continues to be listed as Playable…</p>

      <title>If you use PolyMC for Minecraft you should switch away now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: </strong>here's a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/minecraft-on-steam-deck-guide-with-prism-launcher-and-gamepad-support/" target="_blank">fresh Steam Deck guide</a> with Prism Launcher.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems a developer on the Minecraft launcher PolyMC went completely rogue and so for your own safety, you should remove PolyMC from all systems. Last night I was made aware of the situation and posted about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1582103691762405378" target="_blank">Twitter</a> but for those who don't follow along, here's what happened.</p>
<p>14 hours ago, according to GitHub, the creator removed the Code of Conduct with a commit <a href="https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee" target="_blank">message</a> titled "reclaim polymc from the leftoids". After that, they then kicked out the other developers from the project in some kind of completely hostile takeover.</p>
<p>People thought they got hacked but unfortunately this person seemingly just decided to attack others. In a message in the PolyMC Discord, they said this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3869764111666082503gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Regardless on your views, this kind of behaviour is <em>not</em> something anyone of any sane mind should support. What they've done is only show how they are completely untrustworthy, and they've basically killed the project. You should 100% consider PolyMC to be compromised and move onto another launcher. There's nothing to indicate malware or anything like that but any trust is simply gone, who knows what they would do next?</p>
<p>Sadly, this means the various videos and guides I did on PolyMC are no longer valid, and so I will be looking to cover other launchers in future. You should also revoke any permissions you gave to PolyMC via your <a href="http://microsoft.com/consent" target="_blank">Microsoft account</a>.</p>
<p>What are your options for right now? You can try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atlauncher.com/" target="_blank">ATLauncher</a></li>
<li><a href="https://multimc.org/" target="_blank">MultiMC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gdevs.io/" target="_blank">GDLauncher</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Although, MultiMC comes with its own controversy for Linux packaging and licensing stuff but at least the developer isn't malicious.</em></p>
<p>Is there some good news? Seemingly so. The team who were kicked out have banded together to carry it on under <a href="https://github.com/PlaceholderMC/PrismLauncher" target="_blank">PrismLauncher</a> but it's very early days on that yet.</p>
<p><em>Article was updated after publishing to clarify malware was not an issue at the time. The issue is the developer and what they did.</em></p>

      <title>LEGO Bricktales is out now with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Who doesn't love LEGO? ClockStone and Thunderful Publishing just recently released LEGO Bricktales and surprisingly, it came with full Native Linux support along with being Steam Deck Verified. They didn't mention anything about Linux before release, so it caught me by surprise but a welcome one and so I picked up a personal copy to give it a go.</p>
<p>LEGO Bricktales is set across 5 different themed biomes, where it's up to you to solve various puzzles by building anything that can help you. With physics at play, you need to ensure you're building something sound that won't fall apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9607615721666006954gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've actually been really quite enjoying this one. A great atmosphere, and it really does look the part — the LEGO style here is practically perfected. Having your constructions in the world, exactly as you make them is a really nice touch too, as is the ability to go back in sandbox mode and build them all bigger. While there is an overall story of helping your grandad rebuild a theme park, it's full of little mini-adventures as you go through and it's quite charming really. Good for all ages.</p>
<p>LEGO Bricktales is not really like any other LEGO game that has come before it. Most of them focus on some sort of action, whereas this is a stripped-down puzzle adventure from the creators of Bridge Constructor.</p>
<p>My only real gripe with it is that the camera controls can be a little annoying but you eventually get the hang of it.</p>
<p>Here's an intro and some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6KZWVXyYxJM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ade00aff9ceb2afc0be856d45655fba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6KZWVXyYxJM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: currently, the Steam Deck uses Proton by default.</em></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A globetrotting LEGO adventure:</strong> Experience a whimsical and epic adventure around the world, packed with charming dialogue and fun secrets to unravel.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful diorama worlds:</strong> Explore five varied story world biomes and the amusement park hub, all fully built out of LEGO bricks.</li>
<li><strong>Build like never before:</strong> Discover the most intuitive brick-by-brick building in a LEGO video game, as you see your creations come to life in a three-dimensional world.</li>
<li><strong>Test your skills with varied puzzles:</strong> Different types of puzzles will test your building skills. Use your engineering brain in functional physics-based puzzles to build a bridge for a digger to get across a river, put your designer hat on to build a stunning new throne for the King, or customize the rides in the amusement park.</li>
<li><strong>Master your builds in Sandbox Mode:</strong> Unlock the Sandbox Mode upon completing a construction spot, then you go back in and improve your build with a huge selection of additional bricks from different themes.</li>
<li><strong>Heaps of items to collect and unlock:</strong> Find collectables in the different dioramas and use them to buy cool new items for your wardrobe or new brick color sets for the sandbox mode.</li>
<li><strong>Build your unique character:</strong> Create your own minifigure character from a huge selection of parts and unlock more options inspired by the worlds you visit as you progress through the story.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamDB makes it easier to track upcoming releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamDB, the unofficial website that tracks basically everything Steam, has a new and improved way for you to track upcoming games. With so many new releases happening all the time, it's pretty easy to get completely lost in it all. My own backlog of things to look at grows constantly and I do keep missing some pretty great looking stuff but perhaps no more.</p>
<p>Mentioned by Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1579772667879886850" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (the creator of SteamDB), the <a href="https://steamdb.info/upcoming/" target="_blank">Upcoming</a> page has been upgraded to be a weekly tracker and you can easily go back through previous weeks and check out upcoming weeks as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11356428011666010917gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>By default it's sorted by the amount of people following along, so you get the most popular titles showing at the top which is pretty useful. The trend is also a good way to see what games a lot of people are really excited about. Simple, to the point and exactly what I like without lots of big flashy banners to scroll past like on Steam directly.</p>
<p>I quite like their <a href="https://steamdb.info/calendar/" target="_blank">monthly calendar</a> too, showing off the big main game each day for an even easier glance at what you perhaps don't want to miss.</p>

      <title>Minecraft 1.20 Beta coming soon with camels and a new &#39;sniffer&#39; mob won the vote</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Minecraft Live recently happened and they showed off many new things coming to Minecraft with the 1.20 update.</p>
<p>As usual, they're not announcing everything and plenty <em>more</em> will be revealed over the coming months with a first "snapshot" (a Beta) coming relatively soon with some new fun features. They also haven't revealed the name of the update just yet. Some of what's new includes: seven new default skins, a camel mob, hanging signs, a new bamboo wood set, rafts as new boat variants and a chiseled bookshelf.</p>
<p>On top of that a new mob was announced with the sniffer, which won this year's mob vote. This new mob will hatch from eggs you find hidden in chests, and when it grows into an adult it will help you find ancient seeds that you can grow into different decorative plants.</p>
<p><em>The Minecraft 1.20 update will launch in full in 2023.</em></p>
<p>Here's the Minecraft 1.20 video clip from Minecraft Live:</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a Linux Beta version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you own Return to Monkey Island or are you thinking of buying it? Good news, as the developer now has a Native Linux version ready for Beta testing.</p>
<p>The Steam page currently seems to indicate it has Linux support already with the SteamOS icon but it is currently only in Beta for owners of the game. Announced by Ron Gilbert on <a href="https://twitter.com/grumpygamer/status/1580990722580566018" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, they mentioned you need to head to a special Steam Community forum post, that only owners can access for the instructions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAlDNn43QQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f958408d5ffd2ee1ff2f6a26be8bd30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAlDNn43QQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We knew it was coming, as stated in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/return-to-monkey-island-is-out-now-linux-version-due-soon/" target="_blank">original release article</a> as Gilbert said previously it would be "soon after" so it's nice to see a developer deliver on their words for Native Linux fans.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/return-to-monkey-island?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck plugin system Decky Loader solves some major issues in new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/decky-loader-get-easy-steam-deck-plugins-and-make-colours-pop/" target="_blank">Last week</a> I showed off <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> properly, a fantastic plugin system for the Steam Deck and the developers have now put up a new release solving some problems.</p>
<p>While it worked and the plugins were great, they had some issues where it could cause crashes and make the Quick Access menu "laggy". All of those problems should now be a thing of the past as of version <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/releases/tag/v2.2.7" target="_blank">2.2.7</a>. So if you didn't have a great experience or saw instability with it, now is a good time to take another look! Really nice to see they found the problem and solved it so now more people can enjoy such a great extension system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YQhvNiI3hKI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd93ae009c399252cc75e9e90d568082.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YQhvNiI3hKI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Release Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gamescope crashes and laggy QAM should now be a thing of the past. Notifications patching was being done pretty much everytime the UI was being interacted with, rather than just when it was needed. Also you can now back out of plugins using the B button as you might expect with the rest of the deck UI!</p>

      <title>Play real Game Boy cartridges on Steam Deck / Linux with GB Operator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.epilogue.co/" target="_blank">GB Operator</a> excites the collector in me, giving you a small device to plug into your PC or Steam Deck, allowing you to play real Game Boy cartridges.</p>
<p>Costing $49.99 (plus shipping), it gives you a device that supports cartridges for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color and the Game Boy Advance. Along with their cross-platform Operator application, with a tightly integrated version of the mGBA emulator so you get plenty of features.</p>
<p>Honestly, I hadn't heard of this until it started appearing in my Twitter feed. The developers of the device mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s official - enjoy your childhood cartridges, now on SteamDeck! Today we validated at the office that GB Operator and the Operator app are fully compatible with Steam OS and run impeccably on SteamDeck. This makes the experience fun and portable, we're happy to support it 💪🏻</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's been around for some time too, so it hasn't just suddenly appeared and a lot of people seem to quite like it.</p>
<p>I have one ordered and on the way so I can see what all the fuss is about. Seems like collecting Game Boy cartridges is going to turn into something I end up doing now…</p>
<p><em>The creators are also currently working on a SNES version.</em></p>

      <title>NVIDIA &#34;unlaunching&#34; the RTX 4080 12GB, apparently 4090 Ti cancelled due to melting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of big NVIDIA news for you today one confirmed and one not so confirmed, which concerns a double-cancellation with the RTX 4080 12GB and a 4090 Ti / Titan.</p>
<p>Firstly, the RTX 4080 12GB is confirmed to be cancelled by NVIDIA directly. There was a lot of backlash on this due to both the naming of it and the price considering there is also the RTX 4080 16GB which is still a thing. Part of the issue was that while they shared the model number, they were clearly vastly different cards in actual spec no doubt what should have been a 4070 but NVIDIA wanted to price it higher.</p>
<p>In a very short <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/12gb-4080-unlaunch/" target="_blank">statement</a> they simply said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing.</p>
<p>So, we’re pressing the “unlaunch” button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th.</p>
<p>If the lines around the block and enthusiasm for the 4090 is any indication, the reception for the 4080 will be awesome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for a potential 4090 Ti / Titan, according to sources familiar with YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wih0h8ps44" target="_blank">video</a>) who claims they are a legitimate source based on all the information they've been given, this has also been cancelled as it was "tripping breakers, melting power supplies, and sometimes melting itself".</p>
<p>Seems like NVIDIA aren't having a good time lately. Especially after EVGA <a href="https://forums.evga.com/Official-Message-from-EVGA-Management-m3574574.aspx" target="_blank">pulled out</a> of doing any future NVIDIA cards too.</p>

      <title>Valve filed a &#39;computer game software&#39; trademark for &#39;NEON PRIME&#39; (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is perhaps exciting, seems Valve are cooking up something new with a <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/97625453" target="_blank">trademark application</a> for NEON PRIME. The application notes it's for "categories of computer game software, electronic game software, video game software, computer game programs downloadable via the internet" and so quite likely some new game is on the way.</p>
<p>It could be a game but then again it could be anything and it doesn't mean something will be released, as we've seen in the past Valve (like a lot of developers / publishers) prototypes a lot and cancels plenty before they ever see the light of day.</p>
<p>NEON PRIME was sent in as a trademark application on October 10th, so by doing so it's become public and anyone can go in and see. It doesn't give us a lot to go on though mind you but sure would be exciting for a new Valve game (or series?).</p>
<p>Valve are certainly on a roll lately with Half-Life: Alyx, Steam Deck and Aperture Desk Job. They've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/valve-have-multiple-games-in-development-they-will-announce-says-gabe-newell/" target="_blank">said before</a> that multiple games are in development, so perhaps we're finally getting closer to seeing one of them?</p>
<p>Then again, it could also be multiple years away and could even be a new VR game for their long-rumoured upcoming VR headset codenamed Deckard. Of which, we know that they're still working towards that too, thanks to a <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/jobs?job_id=52" target="_blank">new job listing</a> that clearly mentions the developer will be responsible for "prototype, ship, and support consumer gaming products leveraging visual-inertial tracking (HMD and controllers), camera passthrough, environment understanding, eye tracking, and hand tracking".</p>
<p>What do you think NEON PRIME from Valve could be?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 15/10/22: as pointed out in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/comment_id=233848" target="_blank">comment</a> (thanks) there's <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/97625459" target="_blank">another</a> trademark application for NEON PRIME that gives us a different idea of what it could be as it's "intended to cover the categories of entertainment services, namely, providing online video games; provision of on-line entertainment, namely, on-line computer games; providing on-line computer games and on-line video games; electronic games services provided by means of the Internet; providing information in the fields of computer games and entertainment via the Internet; organization of competitions relating to video games, video game education, and video game entertainment; providing information in the field of on-line computer games and on-line video games and computer games".</p>
<p>Certainly a little eye-opening. Is it more than just a game? A whole service? Perhaps finally Steam Cloud Gaming, their own streaming service? Or, a service attached to a game somehow.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated helping Halo Infinite and Spider-Man Remastered</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a really small update to Proton Experimental on October 13th, so here's what's new and how to use it. This is the special version of the Proton compatibility layer for running Windows games, with lots of extra special fixes that eventually make their way into the main Proton version that's most used.</p>
<p>From the October 13th Update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Halo Infinite crashing without internet.</li>
<li>Fix Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered displaying dialog about outdated drivers on AMD systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder, you now need Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer for Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

      <title>UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you ready for another Sony game on Steam? The UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection arrives on October 19th, and it's been Steam Deck Verified already.</p>
<p>This is similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/marvels-spider-man-remastered-is-steam-deck-verified-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank">Spider-Man Remastered</a>, as clearly Valve and Sony are talking behind the scenes to get testing done and ensure the Windows ports are in good shape with the Proton compatibility layer. What a time to be alive, games from Sony releasing on Steam and being verified on a Linux gaming device. Still quite hard to believe but amazing to see.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eYJMMLg2FpU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/41f502f358f5469d39db06890a1aedaa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eYJMMLg2FpU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I do find it thoroughly odd that they're putting the newer games up before the originals, which is likely down to easier porting on these more modern games.</p>
<p>Will you be picking them up to play on Linux / Steam Deck? Let us know in the comments. I'll be taking a look with a video hopefully up soon after the release to see how it runs.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Client Beta updated, plus official Docking Station update coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another small Steam Deck Client Beta update to fix some lingering issues, plus they've announced a Docking Station update is on the way.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6186282400391934912" target="_blank">Beta update</a> available in the Beta and Preview channels: you can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel here's what's new.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the Performance Overlay would still show when set to off.</li>
<li>Don't show the "switch to desktop" option in the power menu when the lock screen is active.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for their new official Steam Deck Docking Station, Valve put out this <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1580678549006323712" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all, a quick update on the Steam Deck Docking Station. Thanks to reports from the community, we've discovered cases where MST and FreeSync functionality still require work. The team is actively working on these bugs, and we'll be shipping software and firmware updates soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The docked experience clearly still needs some work, and no doubt more issues will appear as many more people get their hands on a dock now as the official Docking Station still remains in the global top 10 sellers on Steam.</p>
<p>On top of that, they've made another additional <a href="https://twitter.com/ondeckupdates" target="_blank">Twitter account @ondeckupdates</a> where they will be posting smaller updates, that aren't big enough for the main OnDeck account that you might wish to follow.</p>

      <title>The JSAUX M.2 Docking Station for Steam Deck is a great choice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After playing with it for a few weeks, here's what I think along with how to set up the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/m-2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0604?variant=43340045156572" target="_blank">M.2 Docking Station</a> for Steam Deck from JSAUX. Note: JSAUX sent a Dock and a 2TB SSD for review that I can keep.</p>
<p>Unlike other Docking Stations (including the official one from Valve), this has a built in M.2 SSD slot so you can give you Steam Deck a whole lot more speedy storage. You can buy the dock by itself but JSAUX also offer it with either a 1TB or 2TB SSD. It features a USB-C slot for charging, HDMI 2.0, two USB-A 3.1 ports and gigabit ethernet on the side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8166187871665746593gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8166187871665746593gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It's a pretty great looking dock overall, and thanks to the SSD slot being on the back, it keeps it nicely out of the way so you don't really notice it. My continued gripe with JSAUX applies here though, with ethernet on the side being a little annoying because it sticks right out. I do wish the design was a little more like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler</a> and Valve with it on the back. A pretty minor gripe though all things considered.</p>
<p>Here's an overview video along with the setup:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dsVu-uYONWY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/87406f982336593265f02d5462d8ce4a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dsVu-uYONWY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It is more on the pricey side at $129.99 <em>without</em> an SSD, $199.99 with a 1TB SSD and $269.99 with a 2TB SSD. However, for the price you're getting something incredibly useful. Really, the pricing depends on if you use it while docked enough to want this, without a different kind of external drive taking up a USB slot and this way it's all nicely integrated.</p>
<p>Thankfully once you've got it set up and ready to go, it works great. All the ports work fine and SSD has been running smoothly inside it with a number of games tested repeatedly on it. The biggest annoyance is the initial setup though, which is down to Valve for only really supporting the Micro SD slot directly.</p>
<p><strong>How to set it up (and any other external drive):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set a desktop password with "passwd" in the Konsole terminal app.</li>
<li>Load the KDE Partition Manager, select the drive and remove any NTFS partition on it.</li>
<li>Add a new ext4 partition, label it something like "External" and apply the changes.</li>
<li>You can then use <a href="https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Mount-External-Drive" target="_blank">this script</a> to auto mount it and it works great!<br/>
<em>The script has a one-liner you can copy and paste into the Konsole terminal app.</em></li>
<li>Now you need to give yourself permissions on the folder the drive is mounted in. As an example you can run this command in terminal:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo chown deck /run/media/deck/*drive name / ID*</code></li>
<li>On the drive in the File Manager make a "steam" folder. Right click -&gt; Create New -&gt; Folder.</li>
<li>In Steam go to Settings -&gt; Downloads and add this "steam" folder from the new drive.</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/m-2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0604?variant=43340045156572" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta update tweaks notifications, boot video length upped to 30 seconds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fresh out the oven, Valve has put up a new Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6186282400389030369" target="_blank">Client Beta</a> that tweaks how some notifications are accessed. This update is available in the Beta and Preview channels: you can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Quick Access Menu will now open to the notifications tab when you have new friend chat messages, game invites, or voice chat invites</li>
<li>Notifications for Game Invites in the Quick Access Menu now have an option in the footer to accept them without having to navigate to the chat window</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Steam group chats with long names or descriptions could cause break the layout of the chat screen</li>
<li>Increase boot animation max length from 10 seconds to 30 seconds</li>
<li>Added controller-specific glyphs on the Lock screen</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the Lock screen where you'd have to dismiss the On-Screen Keyboard manually if you slept the device while it was up</li>
<li>Fixed invoking the On-Screen-Keyboard while already in a fullscreen keyboard input scenario causing bad behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with editing command settings from inside the virtual menu screen</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've no doubt many will appreciate the max length change to boot animations, considering there's so many great videos being showcased. Now there's even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-deck-boot-videos-get-an-easy-app-plus-videos-coming-to-the-points-shop/" target="_blank">an easy to use app</a> to download and install them.</p>

      <title>Steam Mobile App gets a huge revamp out now for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some time being in Beta, Valve has officially released the new shiny new Steam Mobile App for all.</p>
<p>This really is a big upgrade, and one we've all been waiting for. Valve let Steam Mobile die a slow death until this revamp, so let's hope they keep up with it this time. It has a new design, along with it being built on a whole new framework. Major new additions like QR code sign-in, making it easier than ever to jump into Steam on new devices.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8YhYPGltHyI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d36cd3615129a622c9fc78f7bda355a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8YhYPGltHyI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>App Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two-factor authentication to ensure you’re the only one with access to your account</li>
<li>QR code sign in - Scan a QR code to sign into Steam instead of entering a password or…</li>
<li>Sign in confirmation - Confirm your regular Steam sign ins with simple “approve” or “deny”</li>
<li>Authorized Devices - Manage access to the devices your account has signed in</li>
<li>Easy access to the Store, Community, News, etc from wherever you are</li>
<li>Your Library with access to your game content, discussions, guides, support, and more</li>
<li>Remote download of games and updates on your PC, managed from your phone</li>
<li>Customizable Steam notifications: wishlist, sales, comments, trades, discussions, friend requests, and more</li>
<li>Trade and Market confirmations – to ensure items don’t leave your account without your approval</li>
<li>An improved Store browsing experience for mobile screens</li>
<li>Support for using multiple Steam accounts in the app</li>
<li>Customizable tabs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve makes it clear that Steam Chat will remain a separate app, for some reason. It will also be getting some major upgrades today on Android and iOS "soon".</p>
<p>As for what's next. Valve are bringing the QR sign-in to Steam Deck, adding in new notification types and adding the Authorized Devices list to the Steam Client and browser.</p>
<p>The app is available in the <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-mobile/id495369748" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>, the <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.android.steam.community" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>, and as a <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://store.steampowered.com/mobile?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_" target="_blank">standalone APK</a>.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Factorio and RimWorld, space colony building sim Stardeus out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking plenty of inspiration from Factorio and RimWorld (including a very RimWorld style), Kodo Linija and Paradox Arc have released Stardeus into Early Access. It comes with Native Linux support, along with it being Steam Deck Verified. <em>Note: the developer provided me a key months ago for early testing.</em></p>
<p>Set on a broken spaceship long after Earth was destroyed, your take in Stardeus is to build it back up with the help of various drones to make it habitable once again for your hibernating human survivors. Build up and travel the stars in a procedurally generated universe, with a lot of heavy simulation going on in the background.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zDeQ3FX3nyQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6afbdfb9ec01f84cf46c9791a62a736a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zDeQ3FX3nyQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it is a pretty huge game, with lots to learn, it's also surprisingly accessible. The developer has kept it in a closed-beta for some months now, and the introduction has been smoothed-over quite nicely with a tutorial that nicely walks you through various parts of the game as you go. Thanks to that, it's quite easy to get into it.</p>
<p>Unlike certain other similar games, Stardeus does have an end-game win condition. The whole point of what you're doing here is not to aimlessly wander the stars. Instead, the idea is that you build up enough and explore to find a suitable planet for colonization. It can take many tens of hours to get there though, and with it being in Early Access no doubt it will change and expand over time.</p>
<p>Even though it's unfinished, there's a lot to enjoy with this one already and tons of content available to play through with a few different scenarios. Kido Linija expect it to be in Early Access for 2-3 years where they will add in more scenarios, story events and various other features. It will still sprinkle in some quests though, so you're not entirely alone right away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9513253371665590916gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9513253371665590916gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since there's a huge amount to the game, the tutorial only covers so much and it does get to a point where you're on your own. It's there that Stardeus thrives, letting you click around and discover everything it has to offer as you research new buildings, and attempt to revive more of the population you have sitting in stasis.</p>
<p>It has some fantastic ambiance to it too. The music is soft and blends nicely into the background, while you're listening to all your little robots and people get to work. Honestly, I've been really sucked in by this one and the hours really do just fade away into space.</p>
<p>There are some niggling issues with it though, and some things just need to be made clearer, which no doubt the developer will get a ton of feedback on now that anyone can buy it and play it. Not a huge amount though, just a lot of little things that need a better even small explanation of why they won't work. Sometimes your actual people will take a bit too long to make a decision to do something too, leaving you waiting around even when the exact facilities they need are available.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>With only a handful of drones at your disposal, salvage, repair and rebuild your destroyed ship and restore life support before the crew suffocates in the vacuum of space.</li>
<li>Design and rebuild your ship according to your own needs and desires. Balance the onboard systems of oxygen, heat and power to ensure long-term survival.</li>
<li>Process resources into useful components to maintain and expand your ship’s facilities. Grow crops and turn the harvest into food for your awakening colonists. Generate energy to power your ship and create a robust interconnected system.</li>
<li>Use and expand your massive computing power to research alien technologies. Discover new ways to survive the harsh universe and take care of or exploit your human crew.</li>
<li>Once powered and crewed by skilled colonists, take your ship on an odyssey to explore and mine the procedurally generated planets and systems of a vast universe.</li>
<li>Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. Live through an endless number of events and encounters introduced by the story-generating AI. Be it alien face huggers, benevolent traders or pirates: always be vigilant and deal with whatever happens the way you chose.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the smooth gameplay, and backing from Paradox, I've no doubt this will be a hit. I'll happily recommend it even in this early stage. I can see myself spending many weeks playing this.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 520.56.06 driver adds easier NVIDIA NGX updates for Wine / Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/193764/en-us/" target="_blank">520.56.06</a>, adding support for NVIDIA RTX 40 series and adding a bunch of new features and fixes for Linux gamers.</p>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implemented support for over-the-air updates in the Proton and Wine NVIDIA NGX build. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Updated the Vulkan driver so that the following extensions no longer depend on nvidia-uvm.ko being loaded at runtime:
	<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_acceleration_structure</li>
<li>VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations</li>
<li>VK_KHR_ray_query</li>
<li>VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline</li>
<li>VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch</li>
<li>VK_NV_ray_tracing</li>
<li>VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur</li>
<li>VK_NVX_binary_import</li>
<li>VK_NVX_image_view_handle</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow use of the "--add-this-kernel" feature by non-root users.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a more accurate progress bar when building the kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a warning message if a Vulkan ICD loader is not detected.</li>
<li>Reworked nvidia-installer's support for DKMS: the kernel modules will now be optionally registered with DKMS after the installer has already built and installed them on its own. nvidia-installer will now register the kernel modules with DKMS by default when the dkms(8) utility is detected on the system.</li>
<li>Added a new CUDA Debugger implementation for Pascal and newer architectures as a part of the driver package: libcudadebugger.so (previously released separately as "CUDA GDB Developer Preview").</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption in geometry and tessellation control shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs when starting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crash with Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Roguelike tactical auto-battler Despot&#39;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despot's Game: Dystopian Army Builder has now left Early Access along with Native Linux support, this roguelike tactical auto-battler is certainly unique.</p>
<p>It sees you run through various rooms in different levels of a dungeon, commanding an army of little pink fleshy people you equip with all sorts of random items. Turn your people into swordsman, wizards, healers, give them damage-soaking refrigerators, yoga pants, stale pretzels and more.</p>
<p>As you go through the dungeons you will come up against hordes of aliens, robots, demons and other monstrosities. Thankfully you have a lot of people and weapons at your disposal. Not only are you building up an army, but you also want to build up combinations by equipping people with a similar class to unlock special ability levels too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hM6USMrRFAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/179336d350032d4ed46a0d1b6d4f34fd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hM6USMrRFAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You're also picking special mutations for your team as you progress too that you collect from certain rooms, allowing you to have special buffs like special abilities being more likely to trigger, or returning a certain percentage of damage back to enemies and lots more. You also get a list of mutations you can buy and level up as you progress too, allowing you truly create a ridiculously powerful team.</p>
<p>It's an auto-battler, so while you're the one building up a team and moving your people around, you don't control them during battle. You get to pick their positions, or you can get the game to position them for you, but when the battles start it's a hands-off approach as you watch to see who wins.</p>
<p>There's different game modes too. The traditional mode has you go from room to room until you reach the end, while the King of the Hill mode sees you take on other players. Although, lots of the mini-modes available need you to play more of the game to unlock them.</p>
<p>“Despot’s Game is a culmination of all our team's hard work, shared experiences, and dedication,” said Nikolay Kuznetsov, Game Creator, Konfa Games. “We are extremely excited to share our unique idea fully realized, especially after garnering so much positive feedback.”</p>
<p>Overall, I like it a lot. Doesn't need fast reflexes, allows you to sit back and relax with it as you come up with a good strategy moving your people around and equipping them weird some really weird combinations. Easy to pick up and learn, while difficult later on to build up a good team that needs some thought put into it. If you want a game the blends dungeon crawling, strategy and auto-battles it's a good choice.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/despots-game?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227280/Despots_Game_Dystopian_Battle_Simulator/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/despots_game_dystopian_army_builder" target="_blank">GOG</a> version is not released.</p>

      <title>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 game engine OpenRCT2 gets another big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> is a free and open source game engine reimplementation for RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, upgrading many parts of it and making it work well cross-platform on modern systems.</p>
<p>Not only does it work better on modern platforms it also adds in an improved interface, improved guest and staff AI, more editing tools, increased limits, and cooperative multiplayer. It also re-introduces mechanics from RollerCoaster Tycoon that were not present in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17153393401665574705gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17153393401665574705gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights from Version 0.4.2 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ability to load .SV6 files from RCT Classic that have more than 9601 guests.</li>
<li>Fully support RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic as a RCT2 base install path.</li>
<li>Add new track elements for Flying Coaster and Lay-Down Coaster and add paint code for more elements.</li>
<li>Ride operating settings can be set via text input.</li>
<li>Added Zero G rolls, medium loops and large corkscrews to the Hybrid and Single-Rail coasters.</li>
<li>Add three real-life flying roller coaster colour schemes.</li>
<li>Add “Classic Wooden Coaster” with shallow banked turns.</li>
<li>Staff members now wait for passing or stalled vehicles before crossing railway tracks.</li>
<li>Add additional pirate roofs.</li>
<li>Add additional glass roofs.</li>
<li>Add the Steel Roller Coaster train and 2-across Inverted Train from RollerCoaster Tycoon 1.</li>
<li>Add asset pack manager and asset packs.</li>
<li>Park and scenario names can now contain up to 128 characters.</li>
<li>Add support for rectangular heightmaps.</li>
<li>+ much more and lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You need the data files to play it so buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it running on Linux is nice and simple too since they offer an official AppImage and there's also a Flatpak available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>A Robot Named Fight! source code released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of a nicely reviewed metroidvania called A Robot Named Fight! has released the source code, hoping that others can learn from it.</p>
<p>Currently though, it's not fully open source as they have it under their own license but they made it clear they're <a href="https://github.com/BartMartner/OpenARNF/issues/1#issuecomment-1268745170" target="_blank">considering</a> putting it under something like the GPL if they can. It also uses the Unity game engine, so it still relies on a proprietary game engine but it's still a good step and nice to see more developers consider open source.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iLN4k2GBS9w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca32cac299e85a107dc0c434b84f05f1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iLN4k2GBS9w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"A Robot Named Fight is a Metroidvania roguelike focused on exploration and item collection. Take on the role of a lone robot tasked with stopping the entity known as the Megabeast. Explore procedurally-generated labyrinths, uncover randomized power-ups and artifacts, find secrets, and blast meaty creatures in this deliciously gory Metroidvania."</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore a procedurally-generated labyrinth with more than 4 billion unique runs.</li>
<li>Prove your worth with true permadeath.</li>
<li>Take on over 60 menacing enemies solo or with a friend via local co-op.</li>
<li>Adapt to a different item set every run with more than 80 unique items</li>
<li>Complete achievements to unlock new content.</li>
<li>Play using your favorite controller.</li>
<li>Enjoy an unreasonable amount of meat!</li>
</ul>

<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/603530/A_Robot_Named_Fight/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and see the source code on <a href="https://github.com/BartMartner/OpenARNF" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>A lot of people were clearly waiting on the official Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that the Steam Deck is available <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">without reservation</a>, and the official Steam Deck Docking Station has released, it appears a lot of people were waiting on Valve for docking.</p>
<p>As of writing this, on the Global Top Sellers list, the Steam Deck Docking Station is currently at number 5, showing that quite a lot of people are buying it when you take into account that it's up against big hitters like FIFA 23 (and the price difference there is reasonably small too).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3185217981665573809gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3185217981665573809gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Only a few days ago, it was sat at the number 2 spot so while it's not selling as much a few days later, it's clearly holding some ground so a lot of people are buying it.</p>
<p>My own official Steam Deck Docking Station should arrive Friday, so I'll be letting you know when I think about it during next week after I've had some quality time with it.</p>
<p>Have you picked one up or are you going with something like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler</a>?</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Boot Videos get an easy app, plus videos coming to the Points Shop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/theres-now-a-dedicated-website-for-steam-deck-boot-videos/" target="_blank">Recently I mentioned</a> the new Steam Deck Repo website, allowing people to upload and download custom Steam Deck Boot Videos, well now there's an <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.steamdeckrepo.manager" target="_blank">easy to use app</a> (<a href="https://github.com/CapitaineJSparrow/steam-repo-manager" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) to go along with it.</p>
<p>This makes grabbing videos quicker and easier than ever. It's only just released so the Steam Deck Repo Manager app is limited but a perfect start to stop users having to make folders, and move files around manually. It also goes to show how fun and exciting the Steam Deck modding scene is, with new things appearing all the time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D-cl72fhfZk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee6c64a41f00bf69c7085b5116dacc7f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D-cl72fhfZk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, according to xpaw from SteamDB on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1580102765531258880/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Steam Deck Boot Videos will be coming to the Steam Points Shop. They track lots of changes happening to the Steam Client, with new language strings appearing in an update clearly showing it's in Valve's plans. Looking on <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/commit/aafcb45f7dfec2b149817974fa3f972f899558d7" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, you can clearly see what they're doing. Some of the new strings include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Redeem_Equip_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "You can select your Startup Movie by going to Settings =&gt; Customization on your Steam Deck."</li>
<li>"ShopPageTitle_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "Steam Deck Startup Movies"</li>
<li>"Redeem_UsePoints_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "Use your Steam Points to get this Steam Deck Startup Movie. You can set this movie to play when your Steam Deck starts up."</li>
</ul>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.26 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team have done it again! Giving us a fresh new Plasma desktop with plenty of upgrades and <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.26.0/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.26</a> is out now.</p>
<p>KDE say it's "All About the Widgets" and they're not wrong. When it comes to Widgets, they're referring to almost everything you see around the main Plasma desktop from what you add directly to the desktop, to the various icons and features on the bottom Plasma panel. With this release, you can now even resize those from the Plasma panel too which is quite a useful change.</p>
<p>Lots of Widgets saw upgrades too like the Dictionary allowing more than one dictionary definition or translation, the Sticky notes, User switcher and Media Player were all given new features too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mRNe8llSQ1g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b409588905a58805aeb64e6f19b32a7e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mRNe8llSQ1g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The 5.26 release also brings in officially the Plasma Big Screen mode, designed for use as the name suggests, on a big screen like a TV giving you a much better interface to use.</p>
<p>This also comes with it's own media player just for it called Plank Player. It even supports navigation with a remote, perfect for use on the sofa.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7659544191665494008gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7659544191665494008gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of focus on spit and polish with this release too. Their support of Wayland continues to improve, wallpapers change between light and dark themes to match, an option for changing the screen colouring for both night and day, a lot of bugs are also being fixed up as part of their "15-minute bugs" project so expect a more stable experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5/5.25.5-5.26.0/" target="_blank">list of improvements</a> goes a very long way down and it seems the Discover software store saw a rather large amount of fixes and improvements like multiple Flatpak updates, and actually inhibiting suspend while doing updates so you're not left with a broken system — quite an important one that. There's even a share button to properly direct people to apps inside Discover, nice! The numerous Flatpak upgrades will be very welcome for Steam Deck users, whenever Valve decides to upgrade it in SteamOS.</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">KDE devs talk Steam Deck</a> and their work for it at Akademy 2022.</p>

Step back into the role of Detective Carl Faubert and dive deeper into the surreal mysteries of Kona. Make your trek through the snowy landscapes of Northern Canada and discover that you are not entirely alone. Find other stranded people - both victims and survivors of a devastating avalanche - and uncover the hidden dark truth of the Brume."</em></p>

      <title>VirtualBox 7.0 is out with their DirectX 11 support using DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this was an interesting one entering the GOL inbox recently. VirtualBox, the general-purpose full virtualizer has a big new release out and even they are now using DXVK.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> is the Vulkan-based implementation of D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11 for Linux / Wine that's used in Proton. There's also <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>, designed for running apps and games that have Linux Native builds (like VirtualBox itself in this case). It's quite incredible to see how this amazing open source tech is being used in more places, just goes to show how essential and performant it has become.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in VirtualBox 7.0 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Virtual machines can be fully encrypted now, including the VM config logs and saved states (CLI only for now).</li>
<li>GUI: Added a new utility similar to "top" or "resource monitor" which lists peformance statistics (CPU usage, RAM usage, disk I/O rate, etc.) of running guests.</li>
<li>GUI: Improved theme support on all platforms. Linux and macOS use native engine while for Windows host it is separately implemented.</li>
<li>Audio: Added "default" host driver type to make it possible to move VMs (appliances) between different platforms without the need of changing the audio driver explicitly. When the "default" driver is selected, the best audio backend option for a platform will be used. This is the default for newly created VMs.</li>
<li>Linux Guest Additions: Reworked guest screen re-size functionality, added basic integration with some of guest Desktop Environments.</li>
<li>Devices: Implemented new 3D support based on DirectX 11 (and DXVK on non Windows hosts).</li>
<li>EFI: Added support for Secure Boot.</li>
<li>GUI: Improving mouse handling in multi-monitor case on X11 platform.</li>
<li>Devices: Added virtual IOMMU devices (Intel and AMD variant).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus quite a lot more you can see on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-7.0" target="_blank">the official site</a>, they've been busy.</p>

      <title>Fanatical running an awesome &#39;Dollar Collections&#39; sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to get some more really cheap games, as Fanatical have launched their <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100721639-13797872?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fcollections%2Fdollar-collections" target="_blank">Dollar Collections sale</a> and there's plenty of good choices in there to get you through the upcoming cold winter nights.</p>
<p>As the name suggests it means you can grab game bundles for $1 / £1 and plenty of them work on Linux and Steam Deck quite nicely too with a number of Steam Deck Verified / Playable games. The majority of them in this case would be run with Proton.</p>
<p>Here's what they have to pick from:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Walking Dead Season 1 &amp; 2 Complete Pack</li>
<li>Deponia Full Scrap Collection</li>
<li>Leisure Suit Larry Wet Dreams Double Pack</li>
<li>Commandos Collection Pack</li>
<li>Dungeons 2 - Complete Edition</li>
<li>Men of War: Collector Pack</li>
<li>Tropico 4 Collectors Bundle</li>
<li>POSTAL Paradise Pack</li>
<li>Sudden Strike Trilogy</li>
<li>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 1 &amp; 2!! Double Pack</li>
<li>Tropico 3: Gold Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly that The Walking Dead Season 1 &amp; 2 Complete Pack is a complete ridiculous steal for such a price. Don't miss out on that one. It even pushed me to finally pick it up to see what all the fuss is about as a fan of the TV series.</p>

      <title>The upgraded ivoler Steam Deck Docking Station is another good choice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't fancy buying from JSAUX and don't need the charger + extra expense of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">official Steam Deck Docking Station</a>? ivoler are another good choice.</p>
<p>They sent over their newer refreshed model, which has an aluminum casing compared with their original plastic one. It also now has gigabit ethernet, with the previous model not having ethernet at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15992466731665482944gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>The upgraded <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX Docking Station is great</a>, however the ethernet sticking out of the side really does annoy me. Here with ivoler, that's not a problem since it sits nicely at the back so I can position it around my desk or TV unit a lot easier. Honestly, that one change alone makes me like it ever so slightly more than the JSAUX offering. ivoler's choice design here just helps keep all the wires out of sight and out of mind.</p>
<p>Not the only major difference though. In terms of bulk, the ivoler version is slimmer and honestly just looks better but it is <em>slightly</em> longer but not by an amount that really makes any difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12942880241665483071gol1.jpeg"/><em>ivoler bottom, JSAUX top.</em></p>
<p>One other difference here and another improvement, is that the ivoler dock blocks none of the air intake on the back of the Steam Deck which JSAUX do. It's never been a problem for me with JSAUX as the intake pulls air in just fine but having the entire thing uncovered is obviously best and so ivoler wins again here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20396630201665483382gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>From the official specs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[One is Enough] ivoler 6-in-1 aluminum docking station for Steam Deck, equipped with 1000M Ethernet, an HDMI 4K@60Hz output, a PD 3.0 fast chargering port, and triple USB 3.0 port. USB-C power delivery port support 90W, which supports fast charging for steam deck and most mobile devices, also compatible with iPads and Android phones with USB-C ports. [❗Note: Charger, HDMI cable, not included.]</li>
<li>[4K@60Hz HDMI Output] The Steam Deck dock stand comes with a 4K@60Hz HDMI 2.0 output. Advanced built-in chips, plug and play, supports HDCP 1.4 to play protected content from iTunes / Netflix / DirectTV etc. When you connect an external 4K monitor (1080P), it can provide you sharper and smoother visual experience, so you can enjoy the visual feast on your games.</li>
<li>[Full Charging Speed for Steam Deck] ivoler Steam Deck docking station supports 100W Max power input and 90W Max power delivery, which is sufficient to charge your Steam Deck at full speed when paired with the original charger. [❗Note: the MAX charging speed of Steam Deck is 45W.]</li>
<li>[Portable &amp; Lightweight] This is A Perfect Combination for the Steam Deck. ivoler all-in-1 Steam Deck docking station blends Hub and stand together perfectly. You don't have to buy a regular hub and a stand base for your Steam Deck, which is not only easier for you to use, but also keeps your desktop neat and organized.</li>
<li>[Safe &amp; Reliable] ivoler USB C Hub block built-in safeguards protect your devices against excessive current, overheating, and overcharging. ivoler is a brand dedicated to providing customers with high quality product. When you encounter failure in use, please contact us, our customer service team will reply you and provide support within 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to say a whole lot about it without needlessly padding the article here. It's a Steam Deck Docking Station with a good price, good features and it just works.</p>
<p>I can happily recommend this one if you're after a Steam Deck Dock that works well, doesn't cost a fortune and has a good design as well. A no-frills Docking Station that just gets the job done and stays out of your way, what more could you want? You really can't go wrong with this and it quickly replaced the JSAUX dock on my own desk.</p>
<p>On pricing without discounts, it's the same as the upgraded JSAUX version at £49.99 / $49.99.</p>
<p>You can buy it easily on Amazon:</p>

      <title>Decky Loader, get easy Steam Deck Plugins and make colours POP!</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Did you know you can extend the Steam Deck with various plugins? I’m going to show you how to do it, and some of what’s available using <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>. This was mentioned by me <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steamos-plugin-manager-should-enable-lots-of-fun-on-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">some time ago</a> but it has come a very long way since then.</p>
<p>This allows you to browse, download and install plugins for the Steam Deck with an interface built into the Quick Access Menu (the three dot button on Steam Deck). In my video below, I'll show how to install it and demo a few of the plugins, with vibrantDeck being something quite amazing, at least to my eyes but it is not something everyone will like. The screen on the Deck really does look quite dull without using it now.</p>

<li>Make sure you have a password set with the "passwd" command in terminal to install it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vOMYGj22rQ" target="_blank">YouTube Guide</a>).<br/>
<em>It won't show a password being entered as a security measure but it is working.</em></li>
<li>Open a terminal ("Konsole" is the pre-installed terminal application) and paste the following command into it:
	<ul>
<li>For the latest release (recommended for all users):
		<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">curl -L https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/raw/main/dist/install_release.sh | sh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After that you can just boot into Gaming Mode, and the plugin menu will be available in the Quick Access Menu as shown in the video above. You can also turn off Developer Mode once it's installed, as I tested it working just fine.</p>

      <title>The new Steam Mobile App is getting close to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few updates later while in Beta and Valve has put out the first Release Candidate for their completely overhauled <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamMobileApp" target="_blank">Steam Mobile App</a>. Having a Release Candidate means they're very close to releasing it for everyone, it just needs a bit more testing to see if any urgent issues appear.</p>
<p>What's they've added recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved messaging when asking for camera permissions.</li>
<li>Fixed pull to refresh in the Library screen not refreshing everything.</li>
<li>Improved loading states in the Library screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when opening links externally.</li>
<li>Improved behavior of how the app attempts to open non-Steam links in your default device browser.</li>
<li>Fixed the ability to send multiple "Verify Code" actions when migrating / adding an authenticator, which would end up loading to failures.</li>
<li>Updated wishlist notifications to open up directly to the wishlisted app page rather than taking you to the wishlist.</li>
<li>Fix web content sometimes not refreshing properly when attempting to reload the same page multiple times.</li>
<li>Fixed some non-English languages not always correctly displaying numbers with decimal places.</li>
<li>Improved the reliability of sign in confirmation dialogs appearing.</li>
<li>Fixed case for certain users where approving a sign in confirmation would have no effect.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to try it out before release:</p>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<p>Open <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.valvesoftware.android.steam.community" target="_blank">this link</a> on your Android device. The Google Play store will offer you a link to join the beta and download the updated app.</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<p>Open <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/8BOPXsGz" target="_blank">this link</a> on your iOS device. You'll be prompted to install Apple's own TestFlight app. Once TestFlight is installed, it will automatically install the updated Steam Mobile App. Note: spaces on iOS are limited.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-37 is out now fixing up more games for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> (also known as Proton GE) as a community-built version of the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games, with a new release out now and FSR is back.</p>
<p>Versions 7-37 and 7-36 were released, initially removing AMD FSR being in it directly, but thankfully another community hacker sorted out the patches needed for it so it made a return.</p>
<p>Here's what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Import nvapi enablement list from proton upstream (<a class="commit-link" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/commit/9a708e02c18ea53386dddd13e7e1ae5c78615965" target="_blank">ValveSoftware@<tt>9a708e0</tt></a>)</li>
<li>Import media-converter changes from proton upstream (<a class="commit-link" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/commit/5339633f9b5e32eae24d43e4572792ba6791220d" target="_blank">ValveSoftware@<tt>5339633</tt></a>)</li>
<li>Update dxvk</li>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton</li>
<li>Update wine-bleeding edge</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Shatterline (thanks orowith2os)</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Halo Reach mod tools (thanks orowith2os)</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Ougon Musoukyoku (thanks namaenonaimumei)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This version is not included in Steam or Steam Deck, with you needing to add it yourself. It often includes fixes Valve hasn't yet done officially, and some things they can't (legally) do for videos. It does come with less quality assurance and testing though, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>How to use it? You can simply use the ProtonUp-Qt tool that we've covered here numerous times now. See the previous <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">GOL Guide on GE-Proton with ProtonUp</a>. </p>

      <title>There&#39;s now a dedicated website for Steam Deck boot videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Valve have made it official in the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steamos-332-and-a-stable-steam-deck-client-update-are-out-now-heres-whats-new/" target="_blank">Steam Deck stable update</a> to change your boot video, reddit user waylaidwanderer <a href="https://steamdeckrepo.com/" target="_blank">made a website</a> where you can easily upload and download these quick clips.</p>
<p>A nice idea, and certainly makes finding one you want a little easier. Useful too, since you can preview the video before you download to see if you will like them. It also includes dedicated instructions below each video, telling you exactly what you need to do to get it working which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Here's a look over some of the boot videos available and a reminder on how to do it:</p>

      <title>My current little wish-list for Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck has been out for a while, it's now easy to purchase <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">with no reservation queue</a>, and the long-delayed Steam Deck Docking Station is also here!  Valve has put out a lot of updates but there's plenty they could improve. Honestly, it's vastly different to how it felt at release.</p>
<p>After thinking on it for some time, plus gathering some inspiration from people in our <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">Discord</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, here's a current quick list of items I would like to see that i think would just make the Steam Deck better overall. All of these I think are perfectly doable. Obviously there's plenty i want from a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 2 which is basically confirmed</a> but what about for now through software updates?</p>
<p>Here's my little list:</p>
<p>A more customizable Home Screen. Let me put collections here, let me move things around and make it more "mine".</p>
<p>Customize the performance overlay. I already know it's possible because it uses MangoHud, which itself has plenty of things you can tweak on desktop Linux and it can be moved to different parts of the screen. The current monitor is great with the different levels you can switch to but let us move it to a different position at the very least, it covers up the UI on a lot of games in the top left.</p>
<p>Downloads with the <em>screen</em> off. The screen itself likely eats a fair amount of battery life, so it sure would be nice if we could have the screen off while downloads continue right? Maybe an option we can turn toggle for the power button to turn the screen off on one tap, with a double-tap being suspend? There's probably better ways to do it but it would be a real nice to have option. I know it's probably not possible to do downloads while suspended like other consoles do due to technical limitations, but that would be one for the Steam Deck 2 and so this feels like a nice small compromise.</p>
<p>More "official" apps that can be installed easily in Gaming Mode in the Non-Steam section of the Library. We know Valve can do it, they did it with Chrome. Let's get more in here! Netflix, Spotify and many more direct-apps. A proper music player would be great here too for your local collection.</p>
<p>Options to deal with the Shader Cache. Not only can it get rather large, being a problem for the 64GB model, it's also confusing for new users. There's posts on it constantly with people confused what's eating their drive space. Clean up the language on it, make it more visible for each game. Let people move it too.</p>
<p>Let us move the on-screen keyboard in Desktop Mode. A properly compact version would be great too, it just takes up far too much space.</p>
<p>More regular upgrades to the Plasma Desktop. It's pretty far behind right now, and likely will be again after the next major update drops. The KDE team put a huge amount of effort into upgrading the desktop experience, we should want in on that.</p>
<p>Steam Controller 2. I don't need to say any more do I? Well, the Docking Station is out now, there's many third-party docks and lots of people will be hooking up to a TV. Give us a good official controller!</p>
<p>Let us pick what the Deck boots into between Gaming Mode and Desktop Mode. I'm sure most people use it in Gaming Mode but the option for those of us using it often like a PC or keeping it docked, it could be really useful.</p>
<p>Even more attention on Deck Verified. It's good the system exists but it's far from perfect. Paladins, for example, is still listed as Steam Deck Playable, despite the anti-cheat breaking it quite a long time ago. How are things like this not picked up? Trust in Deck Verified is essential.</p>
<p>I'm sure you all have your own wishlist too. Let me know what you want to see in the comments.</p>

      <title>JSAUX wasted no time with a new Steam Deck Docking Station with DisplayPort</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Find the new official Steam Deck Docking Station too expensive? Perhaps you might like to take another look at JSAUX, as they've announced <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">another</a> upgraded Docking Station.</p>
<p>Blimey, they need to slow down a bit. I already have their previous normal Docking Stations, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">reviewed and found to be excellent</a>. Plus, I have the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/jsaux-announce-their-new-steam-deck-dock-with-an-m2-ssd-slot/" target="_blank">Docking Station with an M.2 SSD</a> slot here ready to review (delayed due to sickness on my end).</p>
<p>Now they've launched the Docking Station "HB0702", which brings with it DisplayPort 1.2 so it can more directly compete with Valve.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14719509131665223004gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>7-in-1 Docking Station for Steam Deck. Equipped with an HDMI 4K@60Hz output, a Gigabit LAN Ethernet input, a USB-C port for charging, three USB-A 3.1 ports, and a DP port, letting you explore a new way to play with Steam Deck.</li>
<li>It comes with a 4K@60Hz / 2K@120Hz HDMI 2.0 output When it's connected to an external 4K monitor, it provides a sharper and smoother visual experience, so you can enjoy the visual feast on your games.</li>
<li>Full charging speed for your Steam Deck. The JSAUX Steam Deck docking station supports 100W max. power delivery, which is enough power to charge your Steam Deck at full speed (45W) when paired with the original charger.</li>
<li>The JSAUX all-in-1 Steam Deck docking station blends hub and stands together perfectly, so you can keep your desktop neat and organized.</li>
<li>Support DP1.2, simultaneous connection of HDMI and DP port, two monitors can output 4K@60Hz at the same time, expand the screen and enjoy the ultimate gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The main difference here is the DisplayPort 1.2 addition and an extra $10 to the order price making it $59.99 (no charger included). You can <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">order it direct</a> but they also told me to expect it on Amazon in early to mid November like their previous dock.</p>
<p><em>I've been told one is being sent over to GOL for me to take a look.</em></p>

      <title>A few more picks from Steam Next Fest</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest</a> is in full swing, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-next-fest-october-2022-edition-is-live-now/" target="_blank">earlier this week</a> we put out some recommendations. Here are a few more games that run great via Proton on Linux to take a look at this month: Cosmoteer, Dredge, and Potionomics.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Cosmoteer</h5>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/799600/Cosmoteer_Starship_Architect__Commander/" target="_blank">Cosmoteer</a> is an open world spaceship constructor sandbox where you build a ship piece by piece then adventure about the galaxy to perform your usual slate of space jobs like mining, bounty hunting, and trading. This is my number one find from the Next Fest so far, and I've already had a lot of fun with it. It reminds me of playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies/" target="_blank">Space Pirates and Zombies</a> for the first time way back in 2011, but more relevant references for the gameplay would be <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/" target="_blank">Star Sector</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/335620/Star_Traders_Frontiers/" target="_blank">Star Trader: Frontiers</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/383840/Nimbatus__The_Space_Drone_Constructor/" target="_blank">Nimbatus</a>. The core mechanics for a fantastic game all are here without even touching on building a fleet or multiplayer, both of which will be included in the Early Access.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZwgC3-AeDOo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/517a2f2342c49a421728816976165745.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZwgC3-AeDOo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><small>A quick look at Cosmoteer</small></p>
<p>The demo does have a vicious performance bug on Proton but thankfully it's solved by changing your launch command to <code class="inline-code">%command% --cores 1</code>. Cosmoteer releases into Early Access at the end of October.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Dredge</h5>
<p>For you fishing minigame aficionados, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562430/DREDGE/" target="_blank">Dredge</a> is an exploration fishing game with a distinct style. I went in blind thinking it would be a cute time waster, so imagine my surprise in discovering Dredge appears instead to be a Lovecraftian horror game with fishing mechanics. The core loop is innocent enough: you undock from the village you start in and spend the day fishing and exploring the bay before selling your catch to upgrade your boat. It's not long, however, before the game reveals its horror aspirations - fishing in the dark raises your stress (think <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304650/SUNLESS_SEA/" target="_blank">Sunless Sea</a>), fish rot in your hold with unidentified disease, and pretty soon you start catching full-on Eldrich abominations in your fishing nets. It's also not clear what happened to the bay's previous fisherman. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><small><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9205836341665165604gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9205836341665165604gol1142.jpg"/></a>Dredge definitely sets a tone</small></p>
<p>Give this one bonus points if you enjoy 'inventory Tetris', as you can fiddle with your cargo to maximize the size of your haul. The deceptively cute graphics and simple gameplay paired with a darkening story and some grotesque 2D art made for an enjoyable state of discombobulation, and I'm curious how heavily the full game will lean into its horror elements.  Dredge ran flawlessly for me via Proton and there's a good couple hours of content in the demo. It's slated for a 2023 release.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Potionomics</h5>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874490/Potionomics/" target="_blank">Potionomics</a> you create and sell potions from a potion shop you inherit from your deceased uncle. Think the relationship-building <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a> meets the sales part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/" target="_blank">Moonlighter</a>. The game looks and performs fantastic via Proton, and there's a fun card game for the haggling process. The character design is, frankly, spectacular, and there's a fun mechanic whereby improving your relationship with characters via conversations/dates earns you new cards to use in the haggling minigame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><small><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19934541101665165833gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19934541101665165833gol1142.jpg"/></a>Selling a potion to Quinn, the village witch/hustler</small></p>
<p>There's far too much going on to call Potionomics a dating sim, but from the demo my guess is that building relationships will be the primary focus of the game rather than the shop simulation. One caveat here is that the demo is quite short (less than an hour) and has a lot of tutorialization, so it's hard to know how well the final product will come together. Potionomics releases on October 17, so we don't have long to wait before 'shipping for our protagonist and the the Public Relations Moth from the cover of this article.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's impossible to keep on top of everything with Steam Next Fest, so if anyone has dredged (sorry) the depths and come up with something special I'm curious to hear about it.</p>

      <title>The Undead are invading Prison Architect in the next expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prison Architect - Undead is the next expansion to the building and management sim, with things about to get spooky.</p>
<p>With it comes a new Graveyard Quick Room to make your compound a bit more spooky, however that comes with a legion of undead you need to deal with. Sounds like a bad idea to me. Prisoners can become infected, increasing the size of the horde and you need to find a way to deal with it all effectively. Call in bounty hunters, or turn everything into a weapon and deal with it yourself.</p>
<p>“Just in time for spooky season, Undead adds a mix of survival and horror to Prison Architect that will put Wardens’ management skills to the test,” says Gaz Wright, Game Director on Prison Architect at Double Eleven. “Grappling with the task of survival is no easy feat, as it introduces an extra layer of complexity and pressure to management gameplay. We hope our community will enjoy Undead just as much as we enjoyed creating it!”</p>

<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Welcome the Graveyard - This brand new Quick Room satisfies your inmates’ needs for Freedom and Comfort, making them feel calmer for 12 hours. Be mindful when you add gravestones though, as they will easily interrupt this peaceful atmosphere…</li>
<li>The Rise of the Dead - In Undead, no one is safe. And there are many ways to become Infected. One inmate can get sick, some others can be bitten by an unfriendly undead, or again a bunch of infected inmates can rise (aka spawn) directly from the Graveyard. Wardens have no power over the Infected units, they will move and act independently in the prison until stopped. Inmates and guards can try and fight them off, but if they fail, they will join the deadly bunch!</li>
<li>Who You Gonna Call? Bounty Hunters! When things go south (because they will) and your prison can’t hold off the outbreak, call the Bounty Hunter Emergency Service: tough, trained bounty hunters will join your fight against the undead.</li>
<li>New Traps, Techniques, and Weapons - Desperate Times Call for Desperate (and creative) measures. Use Zombie chum to lure the undead, build a walled-off area and lock them inside, or steal that glorious chainsaw you’ve been eyeing for a while: everything is allowed to fight off the horde.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
