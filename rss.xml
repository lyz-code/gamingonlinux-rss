      <title>Proton Experimental updated and Proton Next (7.0-6) out for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first Proton Experimental update of 2023 from Valve has landed for Linux desktop and Steam Deck, plus Proton Next is live again with the upcoming release of Proton 7.0-6.</p>
<p>Firstly the Proton Experimental update that landed January 6th: a newly playable title with this update is Gungrave G.O.R.E., a third-person action shooter by South-Korean Studio IGGYMOB. It also comes with these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Life is Strange Remastered crashing at the end of chapter 2.</li>
<li>Fix Alt+Tab not working on Gnome 43.</li>
<li>Improve force feedback compatibility for BeamNG and Forza Horizon 5.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bigger one of course is Proton Next. Valve had a Release Candidate for Proton 7.0-6 available in early December 2022, with it now moving to Proton Next. This makes it easier to test, as you can set games to use Proton Next to test, which won't mess with any on the current main Proton release which is 7.0-5.</p>
<p>With Proton Next (7.0-6) these are newly playable:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gotham Knights.</li>
<li>UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection.</li>
<li>Heroes of the Dark.</li>
<li>Super Arcade Racing.</li>
<li>Crazy Machines 3.</li>
<li>King under the Mountain.</li>
<li>NinNinDays2.</li>
<li>雀姬 (Mahjong ladies).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All the fixes in Proton Next (7.0-6):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Septerra Core hanging on redistributables installation.</li>
<li>Fix Persona 5 Royal crashing when creating game save data.</li>
<li>Fix Vampire Survivors intermittent error message.</li>
<li>Fix Super House of Dead Ninjas, Enemy Mind, and Out There Somewhere frame hitching every few seconds.</li>
<li>Fix Zeepkist freezing when using controller.</li>
<li>Fix Overcooked! All You Can Eat being unable to add a second controller-using player.</li>
<li>Fix Quake III: Arena and Quake III: Team Arena displaying weird texture over the menu.</li>
<li>Fix the new EA launcher displaying a blank window.</li>
<li>Fix Marvel Snap not being able connect to online services.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator crashing during longer flights.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator not displaying live traffic.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator not starting after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator crashing when starting next to big cities.</li>
<li>Fix Sackboy: A Big Adventure failing to start the first time it's launched.</li>
<li>Fix Spyro Reignited Trilogy playing intro video in a wrong language.</li>
<li>Fix Jurassic World Evolution 2 bad performance with recent Proton versions.</li>
<li>Fix multiple monitor support in Project Cars 2 and Project Cars 3.</li>
<li>Fix Korean not being rendered correctly in Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII launcher.</li>
<li>Fix multiple languages not rendering correctly in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.</li>
<li>Fix Lost Lands: Dark Overlord, Lost Lands: Dark Lord, Lost Lands: Redemption, and Haunted Hotel: Silent Waters Collector's Edition crashing when trying to set a wallpaper.</li>
<li>Fix video playback regression with Chronos: Before the Ashes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the other improvements in Proton Next (7.0-6):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve video playback with OUTRIDERS and ToGather: Island.</li>
<li>Update wine-mono to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-7.4.0" target="_blank">7.4.0</a>.</li>
<li>Update dxvk-nvapi to <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.6" target="_blank">v0.6</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>ASUS stick an OLED display into a controller, Dell want to reinvent it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new real controller from ASUS is on the way with the ROG Raikiri Pro that features an OLED display, plus Dell get weird with the Concept Nyx from CES 2023.</p>
<p>Let's start with the real stuff shall we? ASUS have made the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/controllers/rog-raikiri-pro-model/" target="_blank">ROG Raikiri Pro</a>, while it's for Xbox you know how it goes — Linux ends up supporting it anyway (and Steam Input no doubt will too). This has a built-in OLED display for some reason, with customizable animations, status indicators and more. It can also connect via USB-C, 2.4 GHz RF or Bluetooth, multiple buttons on the back and triggers that can have the triggers with short or full range modes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18168874211673020319gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18168874211673020319gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Could be quite interesting? Although all the special extras would no doubt need someone to come up with a way to do it all on Linux too.</p>
<p>Then we have the really weird with the <a href="https://dell.alienwarearena.com/leveling-up-concept-nyx-with-new-controller-concept-and-game-changing-enhancements/" target="_blank">Dell Concept Nyx</a>. It's not actually a real thing, although they have made and shown off some prototypes at CES. This is not really a controller you would use with a normal PC or even on another console, as it's designed to go along with the whole <a href="https://dell.alienwarearena.com/concept-nyx/" target="_blank">Concept Nyx system</a> which is sort-of like a shared server that does everything for multiple people across different screens.</p>
<p>With the Concept Nyx Game Controller they added a finger print sensor to the middle of it, added dual-thumb scroll wheels to the bottom of it, put some paddles on the back and replaced the D-pad with what they call an Omnipad.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2989209361673021098gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2989209361673021098gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4981465201673021111gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4981465201673021111gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the finger print reader, they suggest it's a way for it to quickly read your print and load everything up. Not exactly wild, since finger print readers exist for PC right now but on a controller to quickly get you into something when sharing the same controller with others? Interesting.</p>
<p>Dell also said they're experiment with "haptics and self-adjusting variable resistance thumb sticks" that can be adjusted to your liking, or be specific to each game. The touch pad sounds a little bit more like what we've seen on the Steam Deck, giving you access to a lot more options that can be configured.</p>
<p>The way they talk about it honestly makes it sound like something from a sci-fi film, with it being able to do entirely unique split-screen modes with each side having a different game and more. Sounds like something that in reality, will never become a real product, at least not any time soon.</p>

      <title>Google open sourced CDC File Transfer from the ashes of Stadia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Google hover over the nuke from orbit button on Stadia, they're at least releasing some of it as open source like CDC File Transfer.</p>
<p>Noted on their <a href="https://github.com/google/cdc-file-transfer" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>, it's a way for syncing and streaming files from Windows to Linux. The question is: why another way to sync files? There's tons of ways that already exist. Well, they explained that too.</p>
<p>Developers could use scp, but they noted it was "impractical" especially with more people working from home as it "always copies full files". So they made cdc_rsync and cdc_stream to help developers who quickly iterate on games. Something that could potentially be useful for developers checking out stuff on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>CDC RSync is designed for syncing files from Windows to Linux but optimized for existing files possibly being on the end machine. They go into detail on why and how it's different to rsync, including showing it performing better for this specific case because of how they split up files into chunks differently at variable sizes. While CDC Stream is for streaming files from Windows to Linux, they say it's "conceptually" similar to sshfs but "optimized for read speed".</p>
<p><em>For anyone interested in trying it out, they provide release builds for Ubuntu.</em></p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors dev poncle outlines 2023 plans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors, probably the most popular game on Steam Deck that keeps being top of the most played list, is set for a busy 2023.</p>
<p>In an overview post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3637250052875666496" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the developer goes on talk about why the big game engine port upgrade didn't happen last year. Part of that was due to the mobile release, with many full clones appearing "with stolen code, assets, data, progression" that forced their hand. They also struggled to find a partner for the release who liked their non-predatory monetization model for it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aS7JqyHdQQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b0d16ad23a843acd6bd4e927d422e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aS7JqyHdQQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One point they mentioned about the new upcoming game engine port, is that they need to develop a little launcher to let you pick what version to load with what options. Steam Deck was mentioned here as a potential challenge, as they naturally want to keep it working nicely. They <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/vampire-survivors-10-coming-october-20th-seems-a-linux-port-is-still-planned/" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a> this is where a proper new Native Linux port will happen too (it has one now although not advertised and not fully supported).</p>
<p><em>Side-note: if they just want a way to switch between the old and new, Steam has a built-in launch option feature for that.</em></p>
<p>Work continues on the port though, with plenty of things still needed to be done in the new version, and support for the existing game built on JavaScript will continue. Eventually they will fully move everything and everyone to the new version though. One of their big problems seems to be physics, where it behaved very differently so they had to start over on some parts of it.</p>
<p>They also plan to make more content DLC, given how the first had such a great reception and they're also working on things not related to Vampire Survivors now too.</p>

      <title>System Shock remake due to release in March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios have now set a launch window for System Shock, with it planned to release in March. That's if it doesn't see yet another delay.</p>
<p>Shared in an update on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/3699917" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, they said: "After our return from Gamescom we’ve been hesitant to share anything so as not to spoil any remaining surprises we have in store. However, we’ve picked a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March, 2023.".</p>
<p>Not the first time of course they've announced something, which they touched on and mentioned how the scope and scale of it has changed and with Prime Matter joining them as publisher it's helped them to focus on  "quality-of-life improvements, bug fixing, and localization support" which are the last steps towards the release. They also said they're "incredibly proud" of what they've done.</p>
<p>In the post they also shared a few more small clips and art.</p>
<p>This was the last full proper teaser from 6 months ago:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n2b1zQkYsyM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/88798b17fd085590a77bb652a5f02089.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n2b1zQkYsyM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As far as I can see, they've still been pretty silent about the Native Linux support that was mentioned on the original crowdfunding campaign. A lot has changed since then though. Hopefully it will work okay in Proton if they're no longer doing that.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shock" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/482400/System_Shock/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Batman Rogue City is a fun looking GZDoom fan game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun retro fan game for you! Batman Rogue City released in December for GZDoom and looks like a criminal-kicking good time. As a fan game, it of course has nothing to do with DC Comics but you know what these big companies can be like, they might get itchy fingers over someone using their names and designs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/batman-rogue-city" target="_blank">Mod DB page</a> doesn't really give it much of a description, but a nice touch is a full PDF manual included with the download that expands on the story and more.</p>
<p>It has over 30 villains and their henchmen, 8 action-packed levels, 8 weapons, and you even get to ride in the Batmobile.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PrRY1t1-6u0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70679834975be1daa5c666781c05cd56.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PrRY1t1-6u0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Think I'm going to have fun with this one…</p>
<p>Seems to work fine on Linux, with the Flatpak version of GZDoom and putting the .pk3 file in the right place running this command launched it just fine:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file /home/liam/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/BatmodRaycastRCv2.pk3</code></p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta update, plus easy Flatpak updates and more HDR teasing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three fun bits for you today including Steam desktop and Steam Deck Beta updates, an easy way to update third-party Flatpaks on Steam Deck in Gaming Mode and another HDR teaser from Valve.</p>
<p>Here's a video overview going over all of it, with the plain details below the video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZhtK92WNJZs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac462d68323d110bfeecee053d741557.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZhtK92WNJZs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Firstly, the Beta updates for Steam desktop and Steam Deck starting with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449571615797" target="_blank">Steam Deck Client Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>

</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Fix instances of Steam freezing or crashing in desktop mode.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The desktop Steam Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3653013849007354968" target="_blank">update</a> is largely the same, except for a note about it fixing an issue with "duplicate streaming dialogs appearing on Mac &amp; Linux".</p>
<p>For Steam Deck owners who have installed third-party software in desktop mode via the Discover app, there's an easy way to get Gaming Mode to run updates for those Flatpak packages using <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> thanks to the Flatpak Updates plugin. How to actually use Decky Loader and the Flatpak Updater plugin is noted in the above video, with the plain instructions on the Decky Loader link. I do love all these plugins — so useful!</p>

<p>Finally, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais gave another teaser on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1611149273894387715/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in regards to HDR support noting: "HDR working on a docked Deck connected to a current-gen LG OLED through HDMI! Again still needs a ton of work but making good progress.", with this shot included:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver v525.78.01 out fixing bugs and supports RTX 4070 Ti</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/198295/en-uk" target="_blank">525.78.01</a> for Linux which includes support for the new RTX 4070 Ti, along with a few select bug fixes. Not that you would want to buy an RTX 4070 Ti, since it's ridiculous for the price.</p>
<p>Apart from supporting the new GPU here's the fixes listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when using a newer control panel with an older driver.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented the G-SYNC/G-SYNC Compatible Visual Indicator from being displayed when running Vulkan X11 applications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where usage of VK_KHR_present_id could cause applications to crash with Xid 32 errors.</li>
<li>Fixed excess CPU usage in hybrid graphics configurations where an external display is connected to an NVIDIA discrete GPU and configured as a PRIME Display Offload sink (also known as "Reverse Prime").</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's listed as a stable driver, so you should be fine to upgrade to it. They don't specifically mention the 4070 Ti in the changelog but it's clearly listed in the Supported Products tab on the driver page.</p>
<p><em>Are you looking to get a new GPU soon? If so let me know in the comments what you're going for any why.</em></p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 hits a big milestone with all games now bootable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://rpcs3.net/" target="_blank">RPCS3</a> is a free and open source PlayStation 3 emulator, and they hit a huge milestone for compatibility recently.</p>
<p>While they don't have any recent blog posts, they did take to <a href="https://twitter.com/rpcs3/status/1607123433506177025" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to announce that the "Loadable" category has hit zero games. This means that all games can at least boot up now, although there's still a fair few that will display an image but don't make it past the menus although that list is short too at only 2.56% of the overall library they're tracking. They're also tracking 28.96% noted as only just able to get in-game but have issues preventing them being fully playable (performance, bugs etc).</p>
<p>A long road and emulator development is certainly challenging, great to see it continue on though.</p>
<p>Their latest video from a few months ago showed off MotorStorm Pacific Rift now being playable:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xUpw9bHmoac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a922ae5f9aac15b6a00a16ae4cd5b2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xUpw9bHmoac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Despite what the likes of Sony, Microsoft, and most notoriously Nintendo think of emulation outside of their own stores (which are often sorely lacking) — it's vital for preservation. </p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress hit nearly half a million sales in December 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress from developer Bay 12 Games and publisher Kitfox Games finally had the Steam release in December 2022, and it seems like it went very well. It's currently sat with an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating from over 15,000 Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>On their official forum where they give out monthly statements, they confirmed in the <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=181050.0" target="_blank">January Report</a> that "the game sold almost half a million copies in December, which is awesome" although they won't have all the specific on it until "mid-February" when all the processing is done.</p>
<p>They do plan to provide a Native Linux version at some point, although it works just fine with Proton right now. They also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3625992251197549466" target="_blank">announced</a> recently that they've hired a second programmer, which is a "historic moment" for the game for someone else to see the code and they're bringing in a long-time member of the DF community for this. In their January Report, they mentioned the newcomer will help towards "bug fixes, ports, and more".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>That's quite a lot to take in and those new desktop X3D have my mouth watering a bit. I only upgraded to a 5800X in the last year, I don't exactly need another upgrade but gosh they sound great. I need a PSU and GPU update next though…</p>
<p><em>Will you be looking to grab any of these? Do let me know in the comments.</em></p>
<p>You can see the full event video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OMxU4BDIm4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7fa64353193f6ade75b6704f39eb167e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OMxU4BDIm4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is also probably a good place to note that AMD have confirmed overheating and thermal throttling issues with their new Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which YouTuber <em>der8auer</em> has been detailing across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Lxydc-3K8" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxaDZ6n2MNo" target="_blank">videos</a>. The issue affects AMD's reference cards, not the ones designed by their partners. The statement AMD released:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are working to determine the root cause of the unexpected throttling experienced by some while using the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards made by AMD. Based on our observations to-date, we believe the issue relates to the thermal solution used in the AMD reference design and appears to be present in a limited number of the cards sold. We are committed to solving this issue for impacted cards.</p>

      <title>Indie game character filled platform-battler &#39;Fraymakers&#39; arrives January 18th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a successful Kickstarter back in 2020, Fraymakers is getting set to hit Early Access on January 18th. Developed by McLeodGaming, who also made Super Smash Flash 2, a very popular Smash Bros fangame.</p>
<p>It's going to be launching with 4 playable characters, 20 assists, 5 stages, rollback netcode and their "FrayTools" which will allow people to make extra content for the game like characters, stages and so on for mods. Naturally more will be added officially during Early Access as they plan to have a lot more of everything and they expect it to remain in development for at least two years.</p>
<p>They don't really have an up to date gameplay trailer, although they do have these two from a few months ago that announced certain characters appearing:</p>

      <title>Beyond All Reason is looking incredible for fans of Total Annihilation / Supreme Commander</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.beyondallreason.info/" target="_blank">Beyond All Reason</a> is an in-development free and open source RTS, based on the <a href="https://springrts.com/" target="_blank">SpringRTS</a> game engine and their latest update showcases just how great it looks.</p>
<p>As a primer: designed for fans of Total Annihilation (1997), Supreme Commander (2007) and Planetary Annihilation (2014). It takes on the legacy of Total Annihilation, being heavily based on Balanced Annihilation (which was originally a total conversion of the Uberhack TA mod) which is a SpringRTS engine game, and the Spring engine started off by just getting Total Annihilation into full 3D so there's a <em>lot</em> of history here. Everything about it has been remade from models to sounds to prevent any copyright issues while retaining the essence of Total Annihilation. Their plan is to <em>eventually</em> release it on Steam.</p>
<p>After a while of silence from the team working on it they've put up a new graphical showcase that includes a brand new lighting system, new textures for one of the factions, improved special effects, an improved ground scarring system to really show the destruction from battles, new death animations for units, a new fog system and the list goes on. Check it out in the video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GEQmm4UhLAg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/805b1c3dcdf8fa5ec521c864d23e840f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GEQmm4UhLAg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When it finally releases properly, this could end up being one of the greatest free and open source games ever made, it's certainly looking the part and for fans of huge RTS games it's certainly exciting.</p>
<p>After giving it a run today, I have to admit my excitement level of this has just gone through the roof. The level of polish compared to when I last tried it has come along immeasurably. It feels good and it looks pretty incredible too even with a bunch of settings nowhere near the maximum they could be and it runs very smoothly too. You know something is good, when you go to check it works and take a few screenshots and end up going through an entire skirmish battle. The pathfinding still needs some work, with some units just trying to push through others but just — wow.</p>
<p>Some screenshots taken by me today (click them to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14706931672840029gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14706931672840029gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2524979041672839970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2524979041672839970gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15795495551672839993gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15795495551672839993gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can try it right now too with their Alpha+ level downloads (Native Linux support) from either the <a href="https://www.beyondallreason.info/download#How-To-Install" target="_blank">official site</a> or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/info.beyondallreason.bar" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. They're really keeping the classic RTS dream alive here. Don't pass up on this, very playable even though it's not technically release-ready.</p>
<p><strong>Update 05/01/23</strong> - I’ve been enjoying it so much i decided to do a video on it myself on Fedora and a bit in Steam Deck at the end. Have a look:</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the winners of the 2022 Steam Awards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The voting is over and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards" target="_blank">The Steam Awards 2022</a> winners have been announced, so here's a run over each of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Game of the Year: <strong>Elden Ring</strong></li>
<li>VR Games of the Year: <strong>Hitman 3</strong></li>
<li>Labor of Love: <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></li>
<li>Better with Friends: <strong>Raft</strong></li>
<li>Outstanding Visual Style: <strong>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong></li>
<li>Most Innovative Gameplay: <strong>Stray</strong></li>
<li>Best game you Suck At: <strong>Elden Ring</strong></li>
<li>Best Soundtrack: <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></li>
<li>Outstanding Story-rich Game: <strong>God of War</strong></li>
<li>Sit back and Relax:<strong> LEGO STAR WARS: The Skywalker Saga</strong></li>
<li>Best game on the go: <strong>Death Stranding Director's Cut</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think of the winners of each category? It's a typical popularity contest, with those that have the biggest names and the most screen-time ending up winning. I definitely don't agree with some of them to be sure, although all the winners are arguably good games anyway.</p>
<p>The one that confuses me is Death Stranding Director's Cut for on the go, as the performance across two different Steam Decks for me is not great. Every BT encounter drops it way below 30, as does open world exploration repeatedly dropping it no matter the settings used.</p>
<p>The Steam Winter Sale 2022 is also still on right now too until January 5, 2023 at 10am PST / 6pm UTC. So you can pick up some of those above with a pretty nice discount.</p>

      <title>Classic 1990s series Catacomb lives on with the CatacombGL source port</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/ArnoAnsems/CatacombGL" target="_blank">CatacombGL</a> is an open source project to run Catacomb 3D (1991), The Catacomb Abyss (1992), The Catacomb Armageddon (1992) and The Catacomb Apocalypse (1993).</p>
<p>Just recently the project had a 0.5.4 Beta release, which is the first to have Native Linux support, along with using the CMake system. It has been tested across Ubuntu, Mint and even on a RaspberryPi.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Main features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Runs native on Windows 7/8/10/11 and Linux.</li>
<li>Hardware accelerated 3D rendering via OpenGL, supporting widescreen resolutions, a customizable field of view and an uncapped frame rate.</li>
<li>Player, projectile and monster movement with floating point precision.</li>
<li>Configurable mouse and keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Supports all four Catacomb 3D games as included in the Catacombs Pack from GOG.com.</li>
<li>Supports The Catacomb Abyss version 1.13 (shareware).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Current limitations as of version 0.5.4:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No support for game controllers.</li>
<li>No backwards compatibility with saved games from the original DOS game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does require the original games, like a lot of open source game engine re-implementations. You can buy the whole pack legally thanks to <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/catacombs_pack" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4132502901672834103gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Never heard of the series? According to the GOG description: "Catacombs Pack is a fantastic compilation of the classic fantasy FPS series. Step into the shoes of one Pelton Everhail, the greatest of the living wizards. Discover secret, long-forgotten treasure troves as you blast away the walls with your powerful magicks. Explore twisting mazes filled with deadly traps and even deadlier denizens. Face Nemesis and fight for your life and those that depend on you. Enter the Catacombs, if you dare and witness the true roots of the First Person Shooter genre on the PC!"</p>

      <title>Space sci-fi 4x city-builder &#39;Antimatter&#39; gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Antimatter is a crowdfunded upcoming space sci-fi game that mixes together 4x strategy elements with city-building, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure how you would accurately describe this one. The scope of it is just massive and it looks like it's coming together quite nicely. Rather than focusing on graphics, the developer is firmly focusing on the depth of the gameplay. A work of passion from a solo developer that gained only €11,765 on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geopi/antimatter-a-city-builder-and-4x-game" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> back in 2020.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v211Iv_D2dg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee92f918fcf88b35a580adfcdb63d3e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v211Iv_D2dg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what it will feature includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of systems and planets to explore in a gigantic instantiated galaxy.</li>
<li>A dynamic universe where dozens of factions struggle for power or survival.</li>
<li>Take command of a spaceship, trade, mine, harvest, scavenge, produce and participate in the simulated economy.</li>
<li>Manage an existing city or found a new colony on any planet.</li>
<li>Climb the political ladder of a commercial corporation or a sovereign organisation, or found a new one from scratch.</li>
<li>Interact with AI characters who are living independant and simulated life in the Antimatter universe.</li>
<li>Terraform entire planets by altering their atmospheric compositions.</li>
<li>Fulfil missions for corporations, factions or individuals, or unravel the secrets of this galaxy.</li>
<li>Get involved in the Antimatter Crisis and try to change yourself the course of history.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I just hope the ambition here doesn't end up a little too much for one developer. Even in the trailer it shows off a ridiculous amount of unique things to do in the game. Then again, tiny teams and solo developers have repeatedly managed some incredibly impressive games over the last few years.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1343010/Antimatter/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> and it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>AMD Ray Tracing on Linux gets closer with Mesa enabling specific games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work going into the open source Mesa graphics drivers continues on, with AMD Ray Tracing picking up speed and they're going to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20464" target="_blank">enable</a> Quake II RTX and Doom Eternal support by default now.</p>
<p>Currently you can turn it on manually, but now they're moving to add specific games known to work into a list. These two games are just the start. On the GitLab Merge Request, developer Bas Nieuwenhuizen <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20464#note_1700820" target="_blank">noted</a> in reply to a question on why just these and why not default for all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it is not ready, in particular we're missing Daniel's shader calling work and some more game debugging.<br/>
However, it feels worth it to start enabling some games we know to work, so that people can start playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work should be available in Mesa 23.0 due later this year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2343847381672832865gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - DOOM Eternal.</em></p>
<p>It's nice to see some more movement on this, as it's been a long time coming for those sticking with the open source Mesa drivers.</p>

      <title>Starbreeze Studios announce PAYDAY 3 for this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Confirmed to be releasing later this year, Starbreeze Studios recently put up a teaser for PAYDAY 3. I'm sure many fans of the previous game will be excited it's back and coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a> so even if it's not a Native release it should be easy enough to get going with Proton.</p>
<p>"Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement."</p>

<p>While they've not announced a date any clearer than "2023", we at least now know it takes place in New York and the developers confirmed it will use Unreal Engine, so the PC release should stay in sync with console versions they're also doing.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti launches January 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Very much as expected, NVIDIA at CES today announced the new NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti to launch on January 5th.</p>
<p>Technically, it's not really a new GPU is it? This is basically what the second model of the RTX 4080 was going to be with 7680 CUDA Cores and 12 GB of GDDR6X, before they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/nvidia-qunlaunchingq-the-rtx-4080-12gb-apparently-4090-ti-cancelled-due-to-melting/" target="_blank">unlaunched it</a>. At least this time it has a better name, and a lower price to match too at $799 / £799.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12171622781672765283gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12171622781672765283gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From what NVIDIA say, it will "max out" a 1440p monitor and it's apparently faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while also using less power. However, keep your pinch of salt at the ready until you see third-party benchmarks as this announcements are always cherry-picking data and NVIDIA don't even go into what settings where used and it's likely also making use of things like DLSS 3.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what they showed:</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1581245931672765180gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1581245931672765180gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>Intel announces 13th Gen mobile processors, plus 65-watt and 35-watt desktop processors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today Intel announced their new lineup on 13th Gen mobile processors including a 24-core beast and additionally some 65-watt and 35-watt desktop processors.</p>
<p>For the mobile processors they're split across three different series from top to bottom: Intel Core H-series focused on the high end, with the Intel Core P-series and U-series focused on thin and light laptops. Below you can see the overview of all the different models that have been announced split across each series, click the images to make them bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19178256401672763505gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19178256401672763505gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/134315291672763507gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/134315291672763507gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14628713201672763507gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14628713201672763507gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13595611291672763508gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13595611291672763508gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They also announced a bunch more desktop processors in 65w and 35w variants completing the lineup for the 13th Gen Intel Core. Below is the overview on each of those. Click the images to make them bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/132342001672763739gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/132342001672763739gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14568012331672763741gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14568012331672763741gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall it seems like a pretty solid lineup to compete with what AMD have been cooking up. Nice to see both sides continuing to push out decent processors, and the prices on them seem pretty reasonable too. At $196 for a 10 core CPU (6 P cores, 4 E cores) for the i5-13400F, seems like a good bet for those of you on a budget who don't need an integrated GPU.</p>
<p>Additionally they also announced the Intel Processor N-series aimed at entry-level mainstream uses where you don't need a whole lot of performance. These replace the Intel Pentium and Intel Celeron branding.</p>

      <title>Linux use overtakes macOS on the Stack Overflow Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is a fun statistic, it seems Linux has become a fair bit more popular than macOS on the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-operating-system" target="_blank">Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly for the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-op-sys" target="_blank">2021 data</a>, professional Linux use was at 25.17% and overall Linux use was 25.32%. At the time macOS was at 30.04% for professionals and 25.19% overall. This was from over 80,000 responses.</p>
<p>This year's survey had over 70,000 responses, and the results for 2022 show that 40.23% use Linux for personal use while 39.89% use it as a professional. Personal use for macOS was at 31.07% and professional use at 32.97%.</p>
<p>So it's worth pointing out that while yes Linux use has risen quite a bit above macOS, they also had seemingly less responses on the latest survey. Still interesting enough to highlight though especially with the total responses being a pretty great sample size overall. A fun point here as well though is that the survey also noted that 15% of the respondents use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) personally and 14.34% professionally.</p>
<p>Naturally Windows was on top both years but the gap is getting smaller overall for developers, meanwhile poor old BSD was noted to only have 1.47% personal use and 1.03% professional use.</p>

      <title>Valve dev teases HDR support for Linux Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of people noticed recently than a whole lot of working was going into the <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> project for HDR support, and now a Valve developer has teased trying it out. This has been a long time coming, with work needed to support it across multiple parts of the Linux stack but it's starting to get there now.</p>
<p>For those not aware, Gamescope is a micro-compositor that's used on the Steam Deck to display your games and it can also be used on desktop too. It gives you a whole lot of control over what games are doing, with lots of work from developer Joshua Ashton going in for HDR support.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1610200412854046720" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Linux gaming milestone: with the latest work from Josh Ashton, HDR can now be enabled for real games! Tested it tonight on my AMD desktop with Halo Infinite, Deep Rock Galactic, DEATH STRANDING DC. Very early and will still need some time to bake to be useful to most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griffais showed these shots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2085823411672742026gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2085823411672742026gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20673519671672742027gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20673519671672742027gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9633386491672742027gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9633386491672742027gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>An increasingly exciting time to be a Linux gaming fan and it looks like 2023 will be the year of HDR. As Griffais said though, there's a lot still to do and this is just the start of it actually working.</p>
<p>On their <a href="https://landofkittens.social/objects/822e33d8-8aad-4977-9f16-33611f27ed1a" target="_blank">Fediverse account</a> developer Joshua Ashton also showed off more of Death Stranding with a HDR Heatmap.</p>

      <title>Latest Steam Survey sees a minor dip for Linux &amp; Steam Deck, still trending nicely overall</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>December 2022 results are in for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> and overall the Linux share is down but the overall trend is still good. Initially the survey results released to some parts that looked off, but Valve seems to have now corrected it.</p>
<p>For December 2022 the Linux share was 1.38%, next to macOS at 2.48% and Windows at 96.15%.</p>
<p>From our own <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> you can see the current trend, which still puts the overall Linux share remaining at a multi-year high but just down from the peak last month. Unless something drastic changes, we're still trending towards possibly seeing 2% by the middle of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19203672791672740605gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19203672791672740605gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Valve are at least finally showing more distributions in their dedicated Linux list, when filtering it over to their Linux page you will now see all these shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 24.07% -1.70%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 11.12% +0.23%<img src="https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.16% -0.21%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.48% +0.66%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.40% -0.32%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.83% +0.12%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21 64 bit 3.67% -0.23%<img src="https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Other 35.28% +1.47%</li>
</ul>
<p>Going by the combined stats, the Steam Deck GPU shows up at 0.33% overall on Steam, so we can still tell that the vast majority of people on Steam Deck are sticking with SteamOS too.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 19: SiNsational</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-18-run-away-and-join-the-circus/" target="_blank">Part 18: Run Away and Join the Circus</a></strong></p>
<p>Given the the company's current focus, the name Hyperion Entertainment seems an odd fit for the modern maintainer of AmigaOS, betraying its earlier status as an Amiga focused video game porting house. Attracted by the apparent success of Loki Software, Hyperion Entertainment also decided to expand into the Linux market, porting three games to the platform. One of their ports, that of <em>SiN</em>, to this day remains from them an elusive Linux exclusive.</p>
<p>Being given only a limited physical release in Europe, the Linux version of <em>SiN</em> is almost impossible to find today, so I would like to thank Nickolas Grigoriadis for supplying me with a copy. First developed by Ritual Entertainment for release in 1998 <em>SiN</em> is an ambitious if adolescent first person shooter with pretensions towards being an immersive sim, with level design that allows for a number of branching paths and a great degree of interactivity.</p>
<p>Adolescent applying to both the content of <em>SiN</em>, with its ridiculous comic book plot carried by the bosom of its femme fatale antagonist, and to how well baked the final product is. Notorious for its bugs <em>SiN</em> can also just feel a bit of a mess, being a headache for completionists with its multiple conflicting objectives. <em>SiN</em> plays more as an overwrought <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> than something like <em>Deus Ex</em>, perhaps unsurprising given the input from the likes of Richard Grey and Charlie Wiederhold.</p>
<p>When the ingredients are fully cooked the game can be compelling, but you have to take the rough with the smooth. This also applies to the quality of the Linux port, with it being mercurial to get working. When I first installed the SiN demo on Red Hat Linux 7.3 it refused to recognize my libGL.so library, but in the year or so since it started working without a hitch. This carried over to when I installed the full version, but I still have no firm idea as to what changed.</p>
<p>SiN also has the most obnoxious retail key and disc checks of any Linux game I have encountered, with it just kicking you to the desktop with an stderr message when starting a new game if the CD-ROM is not mounted. Given how often the game crashed this did not fill me with confidence. In addition, I found that audio clips would cut each other off and would at times be distorted, with the worst offender for this being at the end of the optional "Missile Silo" level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9322435051670625057gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9322435051670625057gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11576918371670625283gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11576918371670625283gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>How much these problems had to do with the Linux port or the nature of <em>SiN</em> itself remains unclear, although I suspect it to be a combination of both. I found myself stuck for a time in that same level as it is the only instance in the whole campaign where the unadvertised inventory screen, accessible with the F11 key, is required in order to progress. <em>SiN</em> develops a habit of putting hurdles in your way, as an even more significant roadblock would arise from my going off the beaten path.</p>
<p>Since I had opted to destroy all the pumps in the optional "Geothermal Plant" level, this breaks the scripting when you are forced to go through the "Biomass Reclamation Center" later in the game, causing Darwin Chamber 3 in "Area 57" not to be accessible. Thankfully a fan patch exists to fix this specific issue, as otherwise I would have been forced to cheat, or load up a previous save and use the alternative path through the "Hidden Docks" instead.</p>
<p>This was followed by the next level "Xenomorphic Laboratory" producing broken save files, but once I got past this things proceeded fine up until the penultimate "Munt Phoenix" level. Here the scripting broke again, with the enemies standing stock still instead of attacking me, and mission critical items not spawning in. This I could resolve by just restarting the level, letting me go on to defeat the final boss, although the final MPEG cutscene aborted after a few seconds.</p>
<p>Performance wise Windows 98 averaged 40.7 FPS compared to 33.1 FPS under Linux using High settings, with both versions benefiting from turning Tessellation and Dynamic Lighting off. Doing so brought the Linux average up to 37.3 FPS, although this was still dwarfed by the 51.2 FPS seen on Windows 98 with the same settings. Windows benefits too by having access to the more polished <em>Wages of Sin</em> mission pack, which sadly was never ported over to Linux.</p>
<p>SiN would also later be adapted into an animated film, the inverse of what gave us the software I am to cover next. Plenty of games released for Linux could be considered adolescent or even childish, but software designed with actual children in mind can be few and far between, at least in the commercial or retail space. Time for some family friendly entertainment, even if I do come away from the experience questioning the sincerity of the publisher's intentions.</p>

      <title>What I want to see in 2023 for Linux, Gaming, Steam Deck and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The end of a year is a good time to sit, think and reflect on what a year it has been and what we hope 2023 will bring so here's some of what I want and what I think could happen.</p>
<p>I actually wrote a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">wishlist for the Steam Deck back in October</a>, and funnily enough pretty much every single point there is still valid right now. Some points have had minor work but most of it hasn't been touched. I hope Valve are reading, because all of those points are what I regularly see people moan and gripe about too.</p>
<p>What else though for the wider picture?</p>
<p>- <strong>Neon Prime</strong>. Come on Valve, we need a new game from you. A proper one, not another (while very cool) Aperture Desk Job. We had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/" target="_blank">trademark registration for Neon Prime</a> and leaker / data miner Tyler McVicker thinks it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/neon-prime-from-valve-is-reportedly-a-third-person-shooter-close-to-release/" target="_blank">close to release</a>. What the heck is it? I'm overly keen to find out. With good cross-platform support across Linux desktop, Steam Deck and Windows it could be an easy hit if it's a good multiplayer game like it's expected to be.</p>
<p>- For publishers to actually stop forcing <strong>Launchers</strong> on us. Don't make me beg. Have you ever met someone who said "heck yeah, the EA App!" or "oh lovely, the 2K launcher" in any kind of serious way? No you haven't — no one has. They almost always add <em>nothing</em> of value, break things constantly (not just on Linux / Steam Deck) and they're just a great big nuisance. I would like for them to just go away, forever. Throw them in the bin. Get them in the sea, just far away from me.</p>
<p>- <strong>Valve Deckard</strong>. We know from a lot of details going out, that Valve seem to be working <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/looks-like-valve-are-gearing-up-for-a-new-vr-headset/" target="_blank">on a new VR HMD</a>, one that should be both portable and able to connect up to a PC. It will likely run Linux for the portable mode, hence all their work on Linux (not just for Steam Deck). Gimme. Seriously. The Valve Index is great, but it's also overly bulky and really Valve haven't actually done all that much with it, especially on the Linux side where they've seemingly <em>ignored</em> Index support for some time now and the experience is less than stellar. I have high hopes that the Deckard will be a big improvement in many ways.</p>
<p>- <strong>Steam Deck Refresh</strong>. Look, the Steam Deck is fantastic overall but it could be better. It's not time yet for a Steam Deck 2, Valve said it themselves that they want to keep the main internals (CPU/GPU) the same to have a good point for developers and gamers but they want to focus on the screen and battery life. So do it. Towards the end of 2023, I would be surprised if we didn't have a confirmation that a nice refresh was on the way for this. The battery life being the biggest gripe people seem to talk about would hopefully get wiped off the table. Having it a bit lighter somehow would be another great bit to focus on, to prevent that hand / wrist strain from longer sessions. I hope Valve keep focusing on improving the Steam Deck, and not entertain the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-steam-deck-really-doesnt-need-exclusives/" target="_blank">ridiculous idea of exclusive games</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>Half-Life 3, Portal 3</strong>. I can dream can't I? Half-Life: Alyx was a true return to form for Valve games, and one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had but I want more! I need to find out what happens after [redacted]. Portal 3 would also be another great one, with the first two being some of my favourite puzzles games and even their own writers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/erik-wolpaw-to-valve-on-portal-3-we-should-just-do-it/" target="_blank">want to do a third</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>SteamOS 3</strong> public release. Perhaps another big turning point for Linux and Linux Gaming as a whole? I get comments asking me for info on this daily (no I really don't know). The Steam Deck has turned a great many heads to just how powerful and good Linux can be as a platform, and now it seems many more people want to try it but they're waiting for SteamOS 3 to be released. While I think people would be better off sticking to a proper desktop Linux distribution (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-best-linux-distribution-for-gaming-in-2023/" target="_blank">like Ubuntu</a>), SteamOS 3 on desktop could actually be quite interesting to see, and with it then being available to more hardware vendors, we could see a true explosion in gaming devices shipping with Linux. 2022 was the year of Linux Gaming thanks to the Steam Deck, perhaps 2023 will truly be the year of Linux on the desktop?</p>
<p>- More <strong>Linux Hardware Releases</strong>. The Steam Deck is great but we need <u>more</u>, and not just from Valve. More hardware shipping with Linux on it out of the box and properly supported. I've said time and time again, this is what we <em>need</em> to push Linux forward. You can have the best distributions around, the slickest desktop environments, it can truly send Windows packing but it's largely useless if it's not out there in the face of the masses on hardware. It needs to be an oven ready deal; people just need to get it and turn it on.</p>
<p>- For <strong>Linux to break 3%</strong> on the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey. I don't actually think this one is too big of an ask. It's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">trending towards</a> 2% by the middle of 2023, thanks to the Steam Deck shipping with SteamOS.</p>
<p>- <strong>Anti-cheat woes</strong>. We already have <em>Easy Anti-Cheat</em> and <em>BattlEye</em> supporting Linux and Proton (and so Steam Deck too), so it's largely down to game developers to hook up support and many just haven't bothered to do so. There's issues developers and publishers need to think on of course, like opening up a multiplayer game to more platforms that could <em>potentially</em> bring in more cheaters. Both Linux desktop and Steam Deck are a growing market (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/novembers-steam-survey-shows-another-uptick-for-linux-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">#2</a>) of players, that I truly hope the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-deck-now-shipping-across-asia-plus-a-new-steam-deck-stable-client-update/" target="_blank">Steam Deck's expansion into Asia</a> becomes a turning point on this so that it can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>- More open source from <strong>NVIDIA</strong>. In 2022 we had quite a surprise, with NVIDIA <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">opening up their kernel modules</a> and it would be great to see even more like this. They've made a good start and I hope to see them keep pushing. NVIDIA proprietary drivers are a constant nuisance and source of many annoyances for me over the past few years. I would already be on an AMD GPU by now, if <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1603073266364579842" target="_blank">OverclockersUK didn't oversell</a> at the 7900 XTX launch.</p>
<p>- <strong>GOG Galaxy</strong> and <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> on Linux — officially. Yeah yeah, Steam is great and all but options are better for consumers as a whole. Wine / Proton development has helped firmly bridge the gap of getting games working on Linux, now we need the other stores to follow along but this is the biggest ask, much more of a dream than any of the previous.</p>

      <title>Beware of scam Steam Deck and Steam Account stores (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It came to my attention recently that there's a website out there selling different models of the Steam Deck, at a discount, along with Steam Accounts. Don't fall for the trap like accessory maker <a href="https://jsaux.com/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> did.</p>
<p>This SteamDeck.info (it's not a link on purpose) website popped up on my feeds recently, and it was raising some clear red flags. Made even worse today, because accessory maker JSAUX partnered up with this "company" to authorise them to sell JSAUX products. JSAUX clearly not doing any basic background checks here before announcing anything.</p>
<p>Quite a number of issues appear even on a very basic 2 minute check of this Steam Deck and Steam game store. For starters, it's only existed since October. They sell Steam Accounts with games and Steam Gifts (where you need to add them as a friend on Steam) — both of which are expressly forbidden by Valve and can get you completely banned on Steam. It comes across as an official company store using the Steam Deck name (trademarked by Valve) but there's no company number, their registered address is incomplete pointing to a luxury apartment complex, they have a discount on the Steam Deck that Valve don't even have, they listed out of stock "Limited Edition" models (no such thing exists) and so on. How do they do it? If you read carefully, they claim they buy it all with their own Steam account — I don't think I need to explain how bad this is.</p>
<p>More in the video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wKZ3k2zutBo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d12ccf64e60e20ed16732dc398828353.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wKZ3k2zutBo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You might think this is obvious and no PSA (public service announcement) is needed, but other consoles can be easily purchased officially online from a great many places. It's easy to see why some might fall for this, especially with even a very small discount to entice people in. There's nothing wrong with reselling if it's clear, but everything else is incredibly shady.</p>
<p><strong>Update 31/12/2022</strong>: the steamdeck . info store sent a defamation complaint to YouTube, so my video on it is currently blocked in the UK (mirrored on <a href="https://tilvids.com/w/sx3oWxzUqQeHDe3pjmfH9k" target="_blank">TILVids</a>). I am currently fighting to get it restored. They've also begun wiping any trace of some of the more dubious things they were selling on the store like Steam Accounts as they're trying to hide it.</p>
<p><strong>Update 02/01/2023</strong>: YouTube denied the request to have it put back, so my video is staying blocked in the UK. The story on this store only gets weirder too and more suspect. In an email to me, the store claimed they purchased Steam Decks with local Gift Cards but on their own Reddit account they linked to screenshots (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2901008893" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2901008952" target="_blank">#2</a>) of their Steam purchase history showing they actually buy a bunch of USD gifts. According to <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/78E3-7431-1E88-AD59" target="_blank">Valve's</a> own details, accounts are supposed to be locked to the local currency. </p>

      <title>Some of the best Steam Deck games in 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's my own take on a top list of games to check out for <strong>Steam Deck</strong> that were released in some form in 2022, or had a <em>major</em> update to improve them.</p>
<p>These lists are highly subjective of course, and I'm not going to throw in anything I haven't actually personally played just because it's a "big" game. These are my picks, games I know work well and are enjoyable and I think you should absolutely pick them all up and play them through.</p>
<p><em>Consider this my 2022 year-ending list of Steam Deck essentials!</em></p>
<h3><strong>Brotato</strong></h3>
<p>You know the drill with Vampire Survivor-likes by now I'm sure, this surge of horde games is never ending but Brotato has many things that make it just fantastic. I can't sing its praises enough it's even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/my-game-of-the-year-2022-is-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">my own personal GOTY</a>. Technically it hasn't "released" but it's in Early Access and fully playable. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Brotato is a top-down arena shooter roguelite where you play a potato wielding up to 6 weapons at a time to fight off hordes of aliens. Choose from a variety of traits and items to create unique builds and survive until help arrives."</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Chained Echoes</strong></h3>
<p>Only just beaten by my love of Brotato is the retro-inspired RPG Chained Echoes, which is close to perfection when it comes to these sorts of games. Blending together a world where dragons are as common as piloted mechanical suits. This is a great one to cosy up with on a cold night. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Spider-Man Remastered &amp; Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong></h3>
<p>Two for one here. Both of them being some of the best Marvel super hero action you can find on any platform. I cannot overstate just how much fun it is swinging around, and beating up some bad guys like this in an open world while levelling up and unlocking new abilities. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/marvels-spiderman-remastered?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Spider-Man Remastered Humble Link</a> - <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/marvels-spiderman-miles-morales?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Miles Morales Humble Link</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h3>
<p>Not released during 2022 but it did have quite a massive update, one that helped performance on Steam Deck quite dramatically too with the inclusion of AMD FSR 2.1 that has a much clearer picture quality than the previous versions of FSR. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wvuDVGMPQNk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0f6152dd1ebf46b81bae8f7d13ad55b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wvuDVGMPQNk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Crysis Remastered Series</strong></h3>
<p>Ah but can it run Crysis? Yes, all three of them in fact. Gain a powerful super-suit and deal with an alien invasion. Starting off on an island, moving onto a world ravaged by climate disasters and then a transformed New York City.</p>
<p>Still one of the best shooter series to play through, and the performance on Steam Deck is a genuine surprise. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/28590/_Crysis_Remastered_Trilogy/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8MJ8vuwZWSA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/180bc99702807e9d0a37d9d7692e71a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8MJ8vuwZWSA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Boneraiser Minions</strong></h3>
<p>I got a little bit obsessed with this one when first discovering it. Much like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and others, it has that easy to get into feel that helps the hours just vanish in what feels like an instant. Technically not released since it's in Early Access but you get the idea. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944570/Boneraiser_Minions/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Amass an army of deamonic undead to fight endless waves of heroes intent to end your boneraising ways! In this gothic-horror auto-battle roguelite, use the bones of slain heroes to raise your minions, collect powerful relics and spells, and unlock meta upgrades, all to survive King Gigald's crusade!"</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Stray</strong></h3>
<p>Kitty! *ahem*, look it's a game about running around as a Cat where you can knock stuff off of things, scratch things and I'm sure for many of you the description doesn't need to go further than that. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Lost, alone and separated from family, a stray cat must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity and find their way home."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7TFpgCZbqsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e6c9f9ccbfd886cb2cd83d9b7d4af75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7TFpgCZbqsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE</strong></h3>
<p>Another previously exclusive PlayStation title. A remake of an absolute classic, with some truly gorgeous looking scenes and intense action. I can see why many of my friends were ranting and raving about it when it initially released, and it's a really surprising experience on Steam Deck, especially given the level of details in the graphics too. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Cloud Strife, an ex-SOLDIER operative, descends on the mako-powered city of Midgar. The world of the timeless classic FINAL FANTASY VII is reborn, using cutting-edge graphics technology, a new battle system and an additional adventure featuring Yuffie Kisaragi."</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>ELDEN RING</strong></h3>
<p>It's tough as hell and will keep you going for some time, with a world that needs you to do some very careful exploration. Die, die again, and again and — just me? Okay, I'm terrible at it, but the world and the creature design really is quite something. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/elden-ring?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between."</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection</strong></h3>
<p>Sony repeatedly smashing it through 2022 with multiple releases, who can forget UNCHARTED? <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Play as Nathan Drake and Chloe Frazer in their own standalone adventures as they confront their pasts and forge their own legacies. This game includes the critically acclaimed single-player stories from both UNCHARTED 4: A Thief’s End and UNCHARTED: The Lost Legacy."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rj2pyAbH8Ds"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/afa924b43513f0343ed0a70223cc5d78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rj2pyAbH8Ds" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>No Man's Sky</strong></h3>
<p>I am a space-nerd. If it's sci-fi and space involved, I'm there. No Man's Sky started off life pretty poorly but it's a good example of a developer who really loves their work, and wants to do right. It's repeatedly had HUGE updates, completely changing parts of the game to be bigger and better and they just haven't stopped. They also made multiple Steam Deck improvements directly. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/no-mans-sky?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L5zNBCgbfEA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8857c7276cd5b441449335db039af291.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L5zNBCgbfEA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>High On Life</strong></h3>
<p>Probably one of if not the single funniest game I played all year. The comedy of it is an acquired taste, you need to appreciate the voices of Justin Roiland, along with the incredibly crass dark humour of it as it really doesn't hold back on anything. <u>A big warning though</u>: no cloud saves, that almost stopped me including it because it's frankly ridiculous for a game release in 2022 not to have Steam Cloud saving but I enjoyed it too much not to include it. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/high-on-life?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Humanity is being threatened by an alien cartel who wants to use them as drugs. It’s up to you to rescue and partner with charismatic, talking guns, take down Garmantuous and his gang, and save the world!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YLts-HJt5Gk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b264eb1328e2e98471c7b4aed2e545e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YLts-HJt5Gk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong></h3>
<p>Another not released in 2022, but it had some pretty <u>huge</u> upgrades and for such an intense game, it can work very nicely on the Steam Deck and it's easily one of the <em>best</em> co-op shooters <em>ever</em> made. A game I will never get tired of playing with the GamingOnLinux community. With every mission giving a different map, aliens coming out of the god damn walls and plenty of laughs to be had. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/deep-rock-galactic?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Deep Rock Galactic is a 1-4 player co-op FPS featuring badass space Dwarves, 100% destructible environments, procedurally-generated caves, and endless hordes of alien monsters. Work together as a team to dig, explore, and fight your way through a massive cave system filled with hordes of deadly enemies and valuable resources. You will need to rely on your teammates if you want to survive the most hostile cave systems in the galaxy!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zeeVEvcSjAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7ffacc6441b97c259e82f5780f30f00c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zeeVEvcSjAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p>I'm going to give <strong>Death Stranding Director's Cut</strong> (<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/death-stranding-directors-cut?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>) an honourable mention too. If I didn't encounter weird frame-drops during BT encounters and exploring the open world (causing me to play it via Remote Play instead), it would be <em>very</em> high up on the list. Plenty of people seem to play it fine though, it's weird how for some games even on the same hardware they perform differently.</p>
<p>I'm also going to give the upgraded <strong>Selaco</strong> demo (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>) an honourable upcoming game mention, because it deserves to be mentioned whenever I possibly can. I have a feeling it could be very high up on my GOTY list for 2023. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS update fixes factory reset, Forza Horizon 5 OS update in Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released two small updates to the Steam Deck OS (SteamOS) and here's what's new and improved.</p>
<p>Firstly, they've released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449543514487" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4.4</a> which fixes an issue where a factory reset could cause the device to get stuck in an update loop. That's a bit of a woops, quite a huge one really, since that's supposed to be one of the last resorts to fix problems on Steam Deck.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449543530901" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4.5</a> is also now in Preview, which includes the above change and also fixes a focus issue with Forza Horizon 5. That was originally in 3.4.3 Preview, but re-released as 3.4.5 when 3.4.4 went out above for the emergency factory reset fix, so clearly they're not yet ready for the Forza Horizon 5 issue fix to be in stable (I assume because the fix might affect other games and needs more testing time).</p>
<p>Valve had quite a few problems with the roll-out of SteamOS 3.4, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steamos-34-is-out-now-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">was a pretty big update</a>, like SD Cards moving location with no real notice and HDMI / DisplayPort audio issues so hopefully they will take on some lessons from the release to make SteamOS 3.5 a bit smoother. </p>
<p>I did have a weird one recently with sleep / wake. One of my Steam Decks would wake up by itself, and it happened multiple times in a row. Had to fully shut it down for a while to make it stop doing it — annoying, and I'm <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/1/3727323242811082424/" target="_blank">not alone</a> with this bug. It somewhat reminds me of my PlayStation 4, which repeatedly woke up and spat discs out in the middle of the night, until I physically ripped out the eject button after Sony failed to fix the problem.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m now officially converted to the RGB LED religion and OpenRGB is amazing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this wasn't what you were expecting to read was it? After years laughing about people who go over the top with RGB lighting in their PCs I am now a convert.</p>
<p>I've never really been into the hardware customization side of PCs but I think that's about to change. All it took was a good PC case I wanted to do more with and now I want to see how far I can push things. I want people to walk into my office and be blinded by the power of my PC. <em>Something like that anyway.</em></p>
<p>You see, recently I picked up the <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/torrent/torrent/black-tg-dark-tint/" target="_blank">Fractal Design Torrent</a> PC case, and I did a successful transplant. The operation was a complete success, although touch and go for a moment with a few bits of sweat and some tears, IT LIVES! Two annoyances though: the first being the spacing between where you connect up the SSDs and the mass of wires coming down the back from the front panel, and needing some completely flat SATA power connectors for the HDDs (I have a lot of drives).</p>
<p>It truly is an absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> case, a recommendation from the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> and I couldn't be happier with the result.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16004977651672246039gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16004977651672246039gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now I have a nice case, and the inside looks pretty tidy with glass panels to see into both sides of the machine — I thought "why stop there?". So, doing something I never thought I would, I shopped around for some colourful additions to place inside the case. </p>
<p>I ended up going for the <a href="https://specluxs.com/collections/pc-strip-lights/products/led-argb-pc-strip-lights" target="_blank">Addressable Speclux LED Strip Light</a>. Cheap and cheerful for my intro into the world of RGB lighting. A great decision too as it turns out, because even though it's cheap and I only have two strips, I'm just a little bit more in love with my PC now. Thanks to this, my rather dull office has been lit up and I can suddenly see why people like RGB LEDs so much (and just RGB lighting in general), because it really does give you a little extra spark of happiness and that should never be underestimated. </p>
<p>Thanks to my motherboard having a connector for RGB lights, I plugged it in there and stuck the strips into my case and when powering on my case came to life. I'm all excited about it for another reason though, a fun bit of open source software called <a href="https://openrgb.org/" target="_blank">OpenRGB</a>. Regular readers have probably seen it, because I've written about it a few times now but never really used it properly myself — until now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18537085491672246602gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18537085491672246602gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>With OpenRGB you can control the lighting on many different devices, and it works very nicely. My surprise here again though is that directly from my Linux desktop with OpenRGB, I can change each individual LED to a different colour, set up profiles, effects and more. Gosh, I love open source developers doing amazing stuff like this.</p>
<p>So now I have a good case, and it looks awesome. Bring on the rainbow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12572794611672246940gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12572794611672246940gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p><em>I can happily recommend both the case and the lights.</em></p>
<p>I wonder what else I can do to make it even more ridiculous. What do you suggest? Have you set up your gaming rig with some cool lighting? Let me know all your thoughts in the comments. Show me your rig.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 7,000 games either Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Closing in nicely on the big 10K, the Steam Deck gaming handheld from Valve has hit over 7,000 games noted to be Playable or Verified. The figure was hit a few days ago.</p>
<p>As things stand at time of writing the numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 2,709</li>
<li>Playable - 4,409</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2,469</li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers taken from <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which also includes unlisted titles that had their store page and purchasing removed from Steam, but players will still have in their library and be able to play.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that these are only what has been tested. The real number of playable games is much much higher. Valve don't limit what you can install; that's entirely up to you. Deck Verified is simply a case of "these were actually tested somehow".</p>
<p>While Valve's Deck Verified system isn't perfect, and I have my own gripes with it, the vast majority of games do actually have the correct rating and it's a good measure to go on.</p>
<p>Some of the notable games that became either Playable or Verified during December include:</p>

</ul>
<p>Lots of really great games keep getting released on Steam, the hardest part is actually picking something to play and clearly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-steam-deck-really-doesnt-need-exclusives/" target="_blank">we don't need exclusives</a>.</p>

      <title>The Steam Deck really doesn&#39;t need exclusives</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now and then the exclusive game discussion pops up, because someone thinks it would be a good idea to lock games to a platform. Here we go again.</p>
<p>This time the culprit is PCGamesN in <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-deck/needs-exclusives" target="_blank">an article</a> titled "The Steam Deck is missing an important element – exclusives". Respectfully, I thoroughly disagree and think exclusive games are ludicrous and anti-consumer due to the very nature of them being exclusionary.</p>
<p>While their article touches on an important bit: games taking better advantage of the Steam Deck uniqueness directly, and personally I do think developers should spend a little more time ensuring gamepad support is top-quality at release, along with text and UI scaling at a minimum — exclusives are just <u>bad</u> and I don't want them on Steam Deck. Valve developers clearly <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1607837890981302277" target="_blank">feel similarly</a>.</p>
<p>Here's my full reply on the subject:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iEl36P7Wn6o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa304391b010cb816d2507470e74b3d8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iEl36P7Wn6o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>If you can't currently watch the video above here's the gist of it:</em></p>
<p>The Steam Deck is built on an open platform, with tons of open source and Valve pays a ton of open source developers. It’s not locked to anything, has a full desktop mode and you can install stuff from other stores. Heck you can even throw Windows on it if you really want to.</p>
<p>The only reason for exclusives is to pull people away from other platforms and try to lock them in, exclusives are anti-consumer. Look at what Epic games do, it’s to pull people directly away from Steam. Sony does it with their exclusives to pull people away from Xbox, Microsoft is going to do it with Bethesda and Activision Blizzard to pull people away from PlayStation and you get the idea.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck presents some of the best elements of a PC as a platform being so open, in handheld form. Why the hell would we want to bring over some of the worst parts of traditional consoles to it?</p>
<p>Exclusives aren’t good for gamers, by their very nature they’re exclusionary. No one should want them or celebrate them. Games are a form of art, we should want <em>more</em> people to be able to appreciate them. Oh, you don’t have a Steam Deck or can’t afford one? Well that’s a shame you can’t play exclusive game X or Y ya a <em>loser</em>. Can you imagine that? Oh I can, fanboys can be really terrible and I don’t want to hear that about it.</p>
<p>What we should do is <strong>celebrate</strong> things like Microsoft, Sony and more being on Steam and putting previously exclusive games up for more people that way, not the opposite.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is doing well too. We know from a good while ago it hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">over a million</a> shipped, and that’s well before the expansion into Asia. It doesn’t need exclusives. It already has a decent amount of power at an affordable price, along with a well established company backing it. Reviews are still flowing in from all angles across web articles and YouTube of more people getting it and singing its praises.</p>
<p>I can’t help but laugh in a way. Valve presents an open platform, and some come along and want something locked to it. Seems so senseless. It feels like console fanboy zealot level thinking.</p>
<p>Even crazier still is what the Steam Deck represents: an extension of the PC platform. Why would we want a Steam Deck exclusive game? Part of the point is a portable library that you can swap between your PC and your Steam Deck for. It kills such a wonderful part of what makes it great. While that aspect of it is not something everyone will make use of as not everyone has a gaming PC, it is a selling point still and a good one, it would ruin a whole lot of goodwill I imagine for Valve too. Even their little example game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/" target="_blank">Aperture Desk Job</a> works outside of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So no, the Steam Deck doesn’t need exclusives or any special games. I’ll disagree until the end of time with anyone trying to get others to entertain such an absurd idea.</p>
<p>What it <strong>does</strong> need is different: A little more attention from developers would be welcome for the uniqueness it offers but let’s not go down the exclusive road. Ensuring gamepad controls on PC work properly at release, testing on smaller screen sizes and resolutions for text clarity, along with text and UI scaling controls at minimum is what we should want and what reviewers need to look at — the kinds of things that make a game go from rough to great on Steam Deck and improve them for everyone on PC too regardless of Linux or Windows there. I’ve lost count of the amount of times I found text on a PC game too small with no way to scale it up, it’s worse again for the Steam Deck. I want to see a lot more attention there.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck and the open nature of it helped me fall in love with gaming all over again. I have games from Steam, Epic, GOG, emulators, cloud gaming and more on mine. Let’s not try and break apart the very foundation it’s been built upon.</p>
<p><em>Anyway that’s what I think, what do you think?</em></p>

<p>For the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/3090835/view/3644006649705636592" target="_blank">third time</a>, Xbox Game Studios have talked up about their games on the Steam Deck and what compatibility to expect for it.</p>
<p>It's nice to see, especially for people who aren't constantly following Steam Deck compatibility news for publishers to do their own little round-up like this. The Steam Winter Sale is ongoing too, so perhaps you'll see something you might like to grab during the sale.</p>
<p>Here's what they listed along with the current discounts:</p>

</ul>
<p>Something I will point out though, that other news sites seem to get confused on: this is <u>not</u> Xbox Game Studios noting any kind of official support for Steam Deck. The compatibility reports are run by Valve, and most developers don't actually make any changes for Steam Deck with the majority of games running through the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> compatibility layer.</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt v2.7.7 adds support for NorthstarProton to play modded Titanfall 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, the very useful installer app to get different compatibility layers on Steam Deck and Linux desktop, has version 2.7.7 up adding in new tools. This is one of those applications that just keeps on getting better all the time, something to keep in the toolbox ready for when you need it.</p>
<p>It allows you to install the likes of GE-Proton, Wine-GE, Luxtorpeda and much more inside Steam, Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and so on.</p>
<p>Version 2.7.7 adds in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the <a href="https://github.com/cyrv6737/NorthstarProton" target="_blank">NorthstarProton</a> compatibility tool.</li>
<li>Added the <a href="https://github.com/Scrumplex/Steam-Play-None" target="_blank">Steam-Play-None</a> compatibility tool.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://github.com/AlpyneDreams/d8vk" target="_blank">D8VK</a> for Lutris.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton" target="_blank">VKD3D</a> for Lutris.</li>
<li>Added <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> ratings to the game list.</li>
<li>Added an indicator if ProtonUp-Qt can't connect to the internet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And it also fixes these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the game list support for Steam Flatpak.</li>
<li>Fixed the game list not working since a Steam update (see <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt/issues/155" target="_blank">#155</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Bots Are Stupid is an ultra-precise programming-platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for a challenge and love programming? Well it seems that Bots Are Stupid might be a good fit for you. An ultra-precise platformer where you don't directly control things — what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>The developer said to think of it a bit like Mario Maker meets coding. I must admit, it sounds pretty fun. With 40 challenging ready-made levels, plus the ability to make and share your own levels to twist the brains of others. It's not just a case of making them move around, you also have to deal with grappling hooks, speed boosters and all sorts of obstacles that will crush your little bots into tiny pieces.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cwvtE_-uYBk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63470fca35c7137d2db251cdafefbac7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cwvtE_-uYBk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 40 uniquely challenging platformer levels.</li>
<li>Endless challenges and puzzles thanks to the game’s inbuilt level editor and level sharing.</li>
<li>Levels feature additional mechanics such as grappling hook, speed boosters, conveyor belts and more.</li>
<li>The bots follow your orders to the letter, no matter how stupid they are.</li>
<li>Infinite supply of bots!</li>
</ul>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1578160/Bots_Are_Stupid/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with Native Linux support and there's even a demo.</p>

      <title>Steam Replay gives you an overview of your 2022 gaming habits</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/" target="_blank">Steam Replay</a> is Valve's new highlight page going over a bunch of fun stats about your gaming year, something made popular by the likes of Spotify Wrapped and similar events from numerous other places.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7195598241672076962gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It's actually quite a fun bit of info and you can set your own page public to send it to others too. I'm not going to because mine is a little embarrassing in some ways. It gives you a look over how many new games you played, what platforms your played on, the games you put the most time into, the biggest genres you played, how much time you used keyboard + mouse or gamepad, your top VR games, your longest gaming streak and so on. So you can find out fun details like 9% of your total playtime being in Deep Rock Galactic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3101348871672076754gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Steam Replay takes data between January 1st and December 14th 2022, and does <em>not</em> include any offline mode play, which explains why some of mine are a lot lower than I expected. I put myself in offline mode a lot, otherwise I end up getting spammed with messages a bit <em>too</em> much about new games.</p>
<p>The page certainly needs some work to view on the desktop though, it's clearly a mobile-first design and looks a little bit too massive on desktop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18612200281672076308gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'm actually surprised my plain "Linux" (desktop) time was still so big, then again it probably shouldn't surprise me since I test a lot of games for GamingOnLinux directly across my desktop and Steam Deck. Plus I use Remote Play too so there's that.</p>
<p>You even get a nice collage of all the games you played too. No surprise to see Vampire Survivors in my top list there, that game was very difficult to put down after initially getting into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17698610581672077400gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Feel free to share yours in the comments.</p>
<p>Valve also sent out a press email about it and made another silly trailer:</p>

      <title>Happy Holidays &amp; Merry Christmas from GamingOnLinux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some of you might have noticed over December our little friendly Penguin logo gained a fancy hat to keep warm, it's that time of the year again.</p>
<p>Time for GamingOnLinux to slow right down to a crawl, so that I can get some personal time off too. So don't be alarmed if you see <em>nothing</em> or just very few here and there (outside of bigger stuff — if any) for a week+ or so, as we all deserve a little time off for the holidays right? Time to blow off some steam and get refreshed ready for another year of news and exciting developments for Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck, gaming, industry news, open source and everything else that is covered here.</p>
<p>2022 has been quite a year hasn't it? This has probably been the most interesting and busiest year by every measure on record. Mostly thanks to all the work Valve is doing in Proton (and related projects), Steam Deck and SteamOS which benefits everyone trying to game on Linux. You can see my end of year <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">article on the Steam Deck over here</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/my-game-of-the-year-2022-is-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">read about my GOTY here</a>.</p>
<p>For GamingOnLinux, it's been a <em>huge</em> year too with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> hitting close to 30K followers now. I'm genuinely shocked at how that has just <em>rocketed</em> <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18027455831671795578gol1.png" target="_blank">upwards</a> in subscribers and continues at a nice pace. Be sure to also follow along on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, or for <em>just</em> the news without my extra spicy takes and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux/109559833585150695" target="_blank">glorious memes</a> there's the main <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/article_rss.php" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> (and every article tag also has a feed too!).</p>
<p>Just a reminder, that I would appreciate any and all support you can give and you can find out all the ways how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" target="_blank">on the Support Us page</a>.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas and I hope you all have a wonderful New Year. Here's to a fun 2023! <em>Now where did I put that Steam Deck…?</em></p>

      <title>Intel working on new Xe graphics driver for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice little bonus before the holidays, Intel have <a href="https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/112188/" target="_blank">made public</a> work on their brand new Xe driver for the future of Intel graphics on Linux. Found via Collabora developer Jason Ekstrand on <a href="https://toot.io/@gfxstrand@mastodon.gamedev.place/109561465470881471" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, who previously started off this work, this is quite exciting.</p>
<p>The idea is to have a fresh set of code that doesn't have to deal with the legacy the current i915 driver does, which supports a lot of older chips. The Xe driver support starts from Tiger Lake, which was the first with Intel Xe, and the code is already at a stage where it can actually be used. Going by what they said it is built to support multiple platforms with initial support in Mesa for Iris and ANV (the OpenGL and Vulkan drivers).</p>
<p>In the Mesa <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20418" target="_blank">merge request</a> draft, they also mentioned it's good enough already for running GNOME plus some OpenGL and Vulkan games but plenty of issues are expected and it's not optimized yet.</p>
<p>Their plan is to keep working on it, and merge it into Mesa in smaller parts but their main draft for the whole thing will stay up as it goes to allow for easier testing.</p>
<p>Looks like 2023 and beyond for Intel drivers on Linux is going to be quite exciting. Hopefully they will keep putting out new Xe cards too, so that we can have more competition in the GPU space.</p>

      <title>Steam Winter Sale 2022 is live now, plus vote for the Steam Awards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Big open ocean adventure Sail Forth is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sail Forth looks like a wonderful ocean adventure on the more chilled side of things (in a way), and if it's anything like the earlier versions I tried a while back, it would be an easy recommendation. Has quite a mixture of things from peaceful exploration and building up a fleet to various combat encounters too. </p>
<p>More about it: "After waking in the middle of the ocean with no memories, tie together debris to create a makeshift sailboat and figure out what the heck happened. Master semi-realistic wind sailing physics to chart unknown waters, welcome aboard stat-enhancing crewmates, and grow your flimsy dingy into a fully-fledged fleet throughout a charming heartfelt journey to save the world. Discover island environments and challenge landlubbers to a variety of mini games including boat racing, target shooting, card games, fishing, or photo collecting."</p>

<p><em>I absolutely adore the style!</em></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p><strong>Explore the Deepblue!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put the wind to your back and cast out into High Adventure over a vast ocean spanning dozens of eccentric regions.</li>
<li>Discover countless isles bursting with their own flora, fauna, friendly folk, and fearsome foes.</li>
<li>Playfully pursue a pod of curious dolphins, admire the beauty of the sun sinking into an icy horizon, or run down a clutch of cowardly criminals only to accept their apologies to the tune of wild cannonry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Command a Sailing Fleet!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build and manage a custom cadre of specialized vessels to match any personality and play style.</li>
<li>Buy, equip, upgrade, and modify your ships’ armaments to face off against the toughest privateers this side of the Eclipside.</li>

</ul>

      <title>JSAUX now selling a transparent Steam Deck backplate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 27/12/22</strong>: they've <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1606648199598727170" target="_blank">removed</a> the logo from it now — good! They said shipping is delayed now though for 1 week.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Chinese accessory brand JSAUX have officially put up their <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/transparent-back-plate-for-steam-deck-pc0106" target="_blank">transparent backplate</a> for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I know a fair few people love the whole retro transparent tech style, I sure do, reminds me of my original Game Boy Pocket that was transparent so perhaps a late Christmas present for someone? JSAUX say it comes equipped with  thermal grease and a heat dissipation aluminium sheet they claim "enhances the heat dissipation performance through their joint action". Along with the backplate they also have back buttons to go along with it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11983314711671727015gol1.png"/></p>
<p>I actually like it a lot, wouldn't mind one myself but I have bad memories of snapping my SD Card when forgetting to take it out after taking off a back cover quite some time ago. I just know I would forget to remove it again.</p>
<p>When I previously talked to JSAUX about doing this after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/jsaux-teasing-a-clear-back-plate-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">their original teaser</a>, and mentioning to them that Valve's Steam Deck shell designs were under a non-commercial license, they made it clear they did not have permission and were trying to get in touch with Valve. They didn't update me on if they did ever hear from Valve on it and now they're selling it so either they have permission or they're doing it anyway. Or, they simply didn't use any design work from Valve at all, and made it entirely themselves.</p>
<p><em>I also have various <a href="https://youtu.be/IEgra6esLsc" target="_blank">privacy issues</a> with JSAUX, which remain unsolved and JSAUX denied all allegations. After pointing out other issues and being notified that Shopify (who they use for their orders) were investigating them — JSAUX simply stopped replying to me.</em></p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-6 now in testing for Steam Deck &amp; Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one missed from a week ago, Valve are testing another update to the stable version of Proton with Proton 7.0-6 needing some more eyes on it for testing. I don't imagine it to be released soon, given it's about to be holiday time.</p>
<p>To test it out, you need to opt into a Beta on Proton 7.0-5. You can do that by searching for Proton in Steam, and selecting it from the Betas section in the Properties. You can give feedback on the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6385" target="_blank">GitHub post</a>, they're after issues only present in this build compared with the current version.</p>
<p>As usual, here's a quick run over what to expect from it:</p>

      <title>Gorgeous 3D adventure platformer New Super Lucky&#39;s Tale is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>New Super Lucky's Tale appears to be one that somewhat flew under the radar. Originally released in 2020, it looks quite wonderful and after an update it became Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Back in early December, the developer noted they made an "updated controller user interface for Steam Deck" and then a few days ago it was bumped up to Deck Verified — nice. It goes to show that even just a little attention from a developer can get a game into a really nice state for the Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-tVULwjePHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7248d14c3352f0023327eec8fc24c1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-tVULwjePHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's actually a complete total revamp of their earlier game Super Lucky's Tale from 2018, with both games having a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Featuring a huge variety of gameplay, from expansive 3D hubs, to story-based adventure levels, 2D side-scrolling challenges, rewarding mini-games, mind-bending puzzles, and thrilling boss battles.</li>
<li>Thousands of collectibles to gather, tons of rewarding secrets to discover, a cast of memorable characters, and an entire wardrobe of costumes for the stylish adventurer.</li>
<li>Designed to delight and challenge players of all ages and skill levels.</li>
<li>A complete re-imagining of the original Super Lucky's Tale, featuring redesigned and new levels, a fully rotatable camera, tighter movement control, and major overhauls to nearly every other aspect, including the story, cinematics, music, and more.</li>
<li>Jump, burrow, and tail swipe your way to victory in this love letter to classic 3D platformers!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer clearly loves the Steam Deck too, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1038300/view/5949849119402458142" target="_blank">mentioning</a> on Steam "We've been glued to our Steam Deck ever since it arrived a couple months ago and wholeheartedly recommend it.".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1038300/New_Super_Luckys_Tale/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>X-Plane 12 from Laminar Research is a realistic and powerful flight simulator with real-world physics, accurate aircraft systems / behaviour and an immersive simulation of the world.</p>
<p>It was previously in Early Access but the release is out now proper. Seems it still has a little way to go with winning people over, as it has a Mostly Positive rating on Steam so far with many noting it's not quite at the level of X-Plane 11 yet but no doubt in time it will become nicely polished so people can properly appreciate all the fancy new bits.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in X-Plane 12 includes:</p>
<p><strong>New Engine Features in X-Plane 12</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volumetric 3D Clouds</li>
<li>Physics-Based Photometric Lighting Model</li>
<li>Worldwide 3D Water</li>
<li>Rewritten AI-Air Traffic Control System</li>
<li>Global 3D Forests</li>
<li>Seasonal Textures and Weather Effects</li>
<li>Revamped Real Weather Data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Aircraft in X-Plane 12</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Airbus A330</li>
<li>Cessna Citation X</li>
<li>Lancair Evolution</li>
<li>Cirrus SR22</li>
<li>Piper PA-18 Super Cub</li>
<li>Van's RV-10</li>
<li>F-14 Tomcat</li>
<li>Robinson R22 (plus a floats version)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trailer of the new version is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N05KBMKuXXU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2414b410862b2b34f06d6fb3b39f31f1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N05KBMKuXXU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to share X-Plane 12 with the world after years of hard work to take our flight simulator to the next level. Preparing this release has involved re-writing almost every aspect of the application to implement first-principles physics and rendering in the tireless pursuit of ultimate realism“ said Thomson Meeks – Director of Operations.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2014780/XPlane_12/" target="_blank">Steam</a> or directly on their <a href="https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/buy-it/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

<p>Valve also didn’t mention it but KDE Connect is now also included for easy file syncing.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It was released with some issues with SD Cards, as the mount point (folder) changed, which would break a lot of non-Steam stuff and shortcuts so they've <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1605710534199988225" target="_blank">rolled that back</a> as a very quick 3.4.1 update too. That change wasn't well communicated by Valve, so glad to see it rolled back promptly. Additionally 3.4.2 rolled out to fix an issue with HDMI/DisplayPort audio going to sleep after being idle on external displays.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Valve also released a Stable Steam Deck Client <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449520586132" target="_blank">update</a> with the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing games to crash due to missing dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing Switch controllers to not be detected properly</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.1 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Smelling fresh and ready to invite you in, <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a> 21.1 is officially out now so here's what's new and improved. I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/linux-mint-21-1-now-in-beta-with-full-flatpak-support/" target="_blank">covered the Beta release</a> and so of course not a whole lot apart from some bug fixes has happened since then. Now is the time to jump in though, as it's better than ever.</p>
<p>Built on top of Ubuntu 22.04 you get everything that has, minus Snaps. There's Cinnamon 5.6, Linux kernel 5.15 and it will receive security updates until 2027. It's sporting a bit of a new look too, with plenty of style changes including the removal of unneeded items from the desktop, more vibrant colouring for accents, a change to Aqua by default so say goodbye to Linux Mint being green out of the box and a new mouse pointer theme.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8085205001671652292gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8085205001671652292gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As a reminder on some of what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driver Manager no longer needd a password to launch, plus improved offline support and fixes for NVIDIA.</li>
<li>Full Flatpak integration in the Update Manager.</li>
<li>More places needing a password prompt were removed that don't need administrative permissions.</li>
<li>Right click on desktop now has a Display Settings option.</li>
<li>A refreshed interface for the Software Manager, that makes it easier to tell the difference between Flatpak and normal packages. Plus you can switch between them if an app has both.</li>
<li>A Verify ISO tool was added.</li>
<li>Other visual changes include a seperator next to the Mint Menu button, a corner bar applet on the far right of the panel inspired by Windows 10, selecting an item in the file manager Nemo only highlights the name now and not the icon as well.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Whisker Squadron: Survivor blends Vampire Survivors with a Star Fox-like shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new on-rails survival rogue-lite shooter? Sign me up. Whisker Squadron: Survivor is from the same team as Race the Sun, and the first in the Whisker Squadron series. There's also a demo right now.</p>
<p>The actual Whisker Squadron game is still coming, but this is less about story and a smaller tighter game for fans of the survival genre that wish to keep on going as long as they can, while upgrading into a unique build. Think of it like a mashup between the classic Star Fox and Vampire Survivors. </p>
<p>With my love of anything resembling Vampire Survivors, and some very fond memories of Star Fox 64 I nearly dropped my Steam Deck in excitement to try this one. It feels really good, looks really good and it seems to work perfectly out of the box both on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Here's a little Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OgqLLTvIoeA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e214ef70e399f5494463f9af19a9a66a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OgqLLTvIoeA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I discovered this thanks to my own excitement over the other Whisker Squadron game they're making, since I personally pledged to their Kickstarter some time ago where they announced this game before the Steam page went up.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140100/Whisker_Squadron_Survivor/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. The demo has a Native Linux version and so will the full release planned for 2023.</p>

      <title>GameMaker makes a few more open source moves with extensions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, I have to admit I am surprised that the takeover of YoYo Games (who develop GameMaker) by Opera has been largely positive with them making more moves towards open source.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/yoyo-games-open-source-the-gamemaker-html5-runtime/" target="_blank">Back in November</a>, they open sourced the HTML5 runtime for GameMaker, which was quite a nice step for developers building web games. They also made big improvements to their Linux support <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gamemaker-on-linux-gets-big-improvements-and-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">back in April</a>.</p>
<p>Now they're back again<a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/open-source-extensions" target="_blank"> with a fresh announcement</a>, as they're open sourcing a whole bunch of extensions and they have more on the way. It's still baby steps in terms of the <em>overall</em> project being open but still a lot better than certain other companies. Some of what they've opened up includes the Google H5 Games Ads extension, Steamworks, Epic Online Services, Microsoft GDK, Google Play Services, GOG, Firebase, WebView, GameJolt etc and they have plans to do more.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages they list with them being open source include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>It lets you look behind the curtain, and understand how the code you’re using works. This allows you to use a library in a more efficient manner as you understand its inner workings.</li>
<li>The team at GameMaker is always working to improve extensions. In addition to that, having access to the source allows you to make your own fixes and updates to an extension.</li>
<li>You can build your own version of an extension with custom changes to suit your project’s needs. Later, you can submit these changes as pull requests, so other developers can benefit from your work.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>A bunch of them were actually open sourced earlier this year pretty quietly on their <a href="https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php?threads/open-sourcing-extensions.98439/" target="_blank">forum</a>, with the full announcement only being made today.</p>
<p>Hopefully this trend over at YoYo Games will continue, and eventually we might see the GameMaker editor as open source too. They're clearly becoming more friendly to the idea of open source so I wouldn't rule it out. It's a very popular game engine for developers and would be amazing to see happen.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck shipping update for Asia notes a few issues but plenty get it this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve and Komodo have given an <a href="https://komodo.jp/news/steamdeck-shipment-update-dec21.html" target="_blank">update</a> on the shipping of the Steam Deck through Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>It seems quite a lot of people will get their Steam Deck in those areas this year, with the announcement noting that anyone there who reserved a Steam Deck before December 1st will get them by the end of the year. They said that all pre-December 1st reservations they expect to have shipped across Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan by December 26th.</p>
<p>The odd one out here is South Korea, where it was mentioned that "unanticipated transport and customs issues" held things up and caused delays, but they've already solved the issues and so shipments there will resume on December 26th, with all South Korean reservations expected to be shipped by December 30th.</p>
<p>On top of that, it seems they messed up the reservation queue at some point, with Steam Decks going out in an incorrect order. Once again, they say this issue has been solved and now they should be going out again based on the reservation date.</p>
<p>Sounds like it has once again been a success though, as they mentioned the "overwhelming interest in Steam Deck". So we really are about to get a big surge of people gaming on Linux with Steam Deck. Exciting.</p>

      <title>Retro fuelled FPS &#39;Selaco&#39; has easily one of the best demos I&#39;ve ever played</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco, an upcoming GZDoom-based shooter from Altered Orbit Studios has been featured before and I'm bringing it back again here because of the huge upgrade to the demo. It's simply fantastic.</p>
<p>This first-person shooter features some pretty incredible looking work and it's still hard to believe this is at all GZDoom under the hood. So much going on all the time, with lots of things to interact with. Taking inspiration from F.E.A.R. for the set pieces and clever AI, along with a healthy dose of Quake and Doom with plenty of modern tricks thrown in. The original demo was already awesome but this update just really showcases what a great game I believe it will be at release.</p>
<p>Some of the updates in the demo includes: Steam Deck support, Gamepad support, lots of Quality of Life improvements, big changes to the level design, a new particle system for smoother performance, a new gore system, improvements to the Vulkan renderer, improved AI and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/3616983854462063568" target="_blank">much more</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it on Steam Deck:</p>

<p>If you love shooters, even if not usually on the retro-styled side of things, go give it a run.</p>
<p>Find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>My game of the year 2022 is the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You think I'm joking? I'm not. Okay, okay. It's <em>not</em> a game but I'll get to that in a moment. The Steam Deck has transformed everything about gaming for me.</p>
<p>At the risk of people pointing out how I'm repeating myself, and how I've likely said all this before in various places: yes I probably have but I'm going to bore you with it again because I can.</p>
<p>The freedom the Steam Deck affords is just a constant reminder of how I <em>hate</em> being sat at my desk for most of the day, the feeling of being shackled to it sets in quite quickly if I start up a game on my actual desktop PC now. I would much rather unhook my Steam Deck from the charger, and go be a potato on the sofa with it. There's just something about the feeling of being that much more connected to the gaming experience too when you have it all there in your hands. I'm certain I'm not alone in that feeling either.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5448560371671552339gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5448560371671552339gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">had a great year with it too</a> and I'm ridiculously excited for what 2023 brings.</em></p>
<p>What's my actual game of the year for 2022 though? Well, this might surprise and even shock you but it's Vampire Su…just kidding. It's actually <em>not</em> the very good Vampire Survivors. While it has sucked away many hours from me, and again it is very good, it's not my game of the year.</p>
<p>Despite many good games released across this year, and a lot of high profile releases too, I ended up being sucked in by something small. The majority of my time actually gaming now being on a Steam Deck either handheld or docked in various rooms, can easily be part of the why on this too.</p>
<p>My GOTY for 2022 is: <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">Brotato</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Similar in many ways to Vampire Survivors, but I honestly like Brotato so much more. Brotato is a frantic top-down arena shooter roguelite set in a small arena (although certain characters can change the arena size). You pick a character from a growing list, each with their own pros and cons, and run around as a potato shooting at everything else that moves. </p>
<p>When you level up you choose from various power-ups and pick from multiple weapon types that you also get to upgrade. It becomes absolute madness once you get a good few waves into it and that's also what I love about it, the timed waves let you know clearly how long you've got left until you get a breather again. Your characters changing visually based on your weapons is a thoroughly nice touch too, some of them really make me laugh.</p>
<p>Here's a previous video I did on it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="727NFQkdMBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf4ed8ef1d3451cd2081130c14178320.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/727NFQkdMBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Love it. Madness.</em></p>
<p>Over to you: what's your GOTY 2022?</p>

Moments later, you're sent flying, violently thrown through the air by the force of a massive explosion, right into a sinister, global intrigue. The coveted contents of that briefcase? A fiercely guarded manuscript penned by a clandestine medieval order - the Knights Templar. Reveal the truth behind a secret conspiracy and save the world from the Templars' evil plan." — Broken Sword: Director's Cut.</p>

      <title>Star Wars Dark Forces lives on again with The Force Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A dedicated Star Wars fan and code hacker has created something awesome: <a href="https://theforceengine.github.io/" target="_blank">The Force Engine</a>. A brand new free and open source modern game engine for Star Wars Dark Forces.</p>
<p>Their plan for it was to rebuild the old Jedi Engine for modern systems, so people don't have to keep using things like DOSBox, plus add in plenty of modern enhancements just to make it feel that little bit nicer. There's many open source projects like it for other games and now after 3 years of development The Force Engine 1.0 is out. Before getting too excited, the Native Linux version is due later.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sn179mQOeBw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3cdc51d2fa28ec612ae92a8e2b86ff1f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sn179mQOeBw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Dark Forces support, including mods. Outlaws support is coming in version 2.0.</li>
<li>Mod Loader - simply place your mods in the Mods/ directory as zip files or directories.</li>
<li>High Resolution and Widescreen support - when using 320x200 you get the original software renderer. TFE also includes a floating-point software renderer which supports widescreen, including ultrawide, and much higher resolutions.</li>
<li>GPU Renderer with perspective correct pitch - play at much higher resolutions with improved performance.</li>
<li>Extended Limits - TFE, by default, will support much higher limits than the original game which removes most of the HOM (Hall of Mirrors) issues in advanced mods.</li>
<li>Full input binding, mouse sensitivity adjustment, and controller support. Note, however, that menus currently require the mouse.</li>
<li>Optional Quality of Life improvements, such as full mouselook, aiming reticle, improved Boba Fett AI, autorun, and more.</li>
<li>A new save system that works seamlessly with the exiting checkpoint and lives system. You can ignore it entirely, use it just as an exit save so you don't have to play long user levels in one sitting, or full save and load with quicksaves like Doom or Duke Nukem 3D.</li>
<li>Optional and quality of life features, even mouselook, can be disabled if you want the original experience. Play in 320x200, turn the mouse mode (Input menu) to Menus only or horizontal, and enable the Classic (software) renderer - and it will look and play just like DOS, but with a higher framerate and without needing to adjust cycles in DosBox.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vulkan Video 1.0 released with the Vulkan 1.3.238 spec update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group has <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-decode" target="_blank">announced</a> that Vulkan Video is done and ready, the 1.0 release is out with the Vulkan 1.3.238 spec update and no longer considered provisional.</p>
<p>It's been a while coming, with the provisional extensions going out back in April 2021. It's used for proper hardware-accelerated video compression and decompression using the Vulkan API and could be quite exciting for lots of different uses. Sure would be great if game developers went for it, instead of using various proprietary video tech.</p>
<p>The release today includes the finalised extensions after gathering industry feedback and provides functionality to provide fully accelerated H.264 and H.265 decode.</p>
<p>More codecs are coming though, this is just the start. The announcement mentioned they will release more extensions to provide additional codecs and accelerated encode as well as decode.</p>
<p>These extensions are final:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_queue</a>: common APIs for all video coding operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_queue</a>: common APIs for all video decode operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h264.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_h264</a>: H.264 decode-specific capabilities and parameters (promoted from EXT to KHR in this final release).</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h265.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_h265</a>: H.265 decode-specific capabilities and parameters (promoted from EXT to KHR in this final release).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas these are still provisional:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_encode_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_encode_queue</a>: common APIs for all video encode operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_video_encode_h264.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_video_encode_h264</a>: H.264 encode-specific capabilities and parameters.</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_video_encode_h265.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_video_encode_h265</a>: H.265 encode-specific capabilities and parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/events/vulkanised-2023" target="_blank">Vulkanised 2023</a> event (February 7-9 in Munich), they will also do a presentation and live demo on Vulkan Video.</p>

The new Beta update added in quite a lot like a thrifty personality type, goofy and confident emotional traits, a "perfect painter" life goal, an accessibility menu, the ability to cheat on a partner (ouch) with mess that comes after, the addition of more emotional feedback being added for different things, a festive tree for those of you getting into the holiday spirit and much more.</p>
<p>See the original trailer below, it's a little older and it's added a lot since then but it gives you a good overall idea:</p>

      <title>Duke Nukem Forever Restoration Project gets a trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm all outta gum. The Duke Nukem Forever Restoration Project is coming along nicely and a fresh trailer is out to show it off.</p>
<p>This is not an official project of course but a bunch of modders working together to restore some of what could have been the original vision, before it went in a different direction. Specifically they're noting it's tailored more towards the leaks of the early versions of the game from 2001.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d3nSSCNDFds"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4c0364fa08a39efe5a6070d4d260417.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d3nSSCNDFds" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm honestly surprised no one has tried to stop them. Then again, why bother? It's not like the original is worth protecting and this might even help surge interest in Duke again for a new proper game done right.</p>
<p>"Current progress has been focused on finishing the polish for the first chapter of the game, 'High Stakes, Lady Killer' and working on a plethora of render and engine fixes alike; with many major and small fixes already developed, such as a proper 'hair fix' and progress on an entirely new renderer for the game in DirectX® 9. Much of the content seen in the E3 trailers and promotional material for the game have been restored, with an all-new story being developed by a story team to bridge the gaps between what we know about the game and what we don't." — Mighty Foot Productions</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/dnf2001-restoration-project" target="_blank">Mod DB</a>. It likely won't have a Native Linux version but it's DirectX 9 so no doubt it will work quite well with Wine and Proton. A slice of it will release tomorrow, December 21st for people to try.</p>

      <title>Epic Games to pay $520 million for privacy violations and unwanted charges</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/12/fortnite-video-game-maker-epic-games-pay-more-half-billion-dollars-over-ftc-allegations" target="_blank">FTC announced</a> that Epic Games has agreed to pay $520 million, due to "violating children's privacy laws" and "tricking users into making unwanted charges".</p>
<p>Quite a large fine overall split between:</p>
<ul>
<li>$275 million penalty for violating children's privacy law.</li>
<li>$245 million in refunds for tricking users into making unwanted charges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, Epic Games made a change to their account system for younger players (that caused the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/epic-games-needs-your-birthday-to-keep-your-account-working-in-heroic-games-launcher/" target="_blank">Heroic Games problems</a>) and changed a bunch of privacy settings which they did as a result of this.</p>
<p>Some record-breaking fines there, as the FTC said in the announcement. The $275 million is a traditional fine, but the $245 million appears to be going towards refunds to customers.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children," said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. "Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.”</p>
<p>“The Justice Department takes very seriously its mission to protect consumers’ data privacy rights,” said Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. “This proposed order sends a message to all online providers that collecting children’s personal information without parental consent will not be tolerated.”</p>
<p>Epic also released their own <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-ftc-settlement-and-moving-beyond-long-standing-industry-practices" target="_blank">statement here</a>.</p>
<p><em>In other news: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/epic-games-are-killing-off-a-bunch-of-classics-like-unreal-tournament/" target="_blank">Epic Games are killing off a bunch of classics like Unreal Tournament</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Neon Prime from Valve is reportedly a third-person shooter close to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Neon Prime isn't here yet, and there's nothing actually confirmed about it, but data miner and leaker Tyler McVicker gave a fresh overview on what to expect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/" target="_blank">Back in October</a>, we found out about the Neon Prime trademark about something new coming from Valve but it wasn't clear at the time exactly what it would be. Valve has stayed completely silent on it of course as well. While Valve of today is far more open than it once was, they're not going to comment on anything not yet announced.</p>
<p>From data mining in Dota 2 updates and other sources, Tyler McVicker mentions it's going to be a third-person shooter with various humanoid characters and has some form of tower defence involved too. You'll even be able to run around and gather resources and it's close to release apart from various bits of polishing work.</p>
<p>You can hear Tyler McVicker's thoughts in the below video. Again though, until it's confirmed by Valve, it's all subject to change and nothing is actually confirmed. It's all just <em>rumours</em> and McVicker has been wrong a number of times in the past <em>but</em> has also been right on the mark a great many times too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OQsmEP2V7m8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30c312bc63cd239538fcf1660487a9c9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OQsmEP2V7m8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Being a third-person shooter is actually smart. It's part of why the likes of Fortnite are so popular. It's one thing to give you skins like CS:GO, it's another for people to actually see their own skin while running around — and people who buy their skins love that. I wouldn't be surprised if a skin shop would be part of the plan for it with a free to play release. </p>

      <title>Paradox Interactive will be increasing game prices across a bunch of currencies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive have announced that they're going to be increasing their prices. Some countries will get a huge bump and others only a little bit but some will actually be decreased.</p>
<p>Their new head of sales wrote on the Paradox forum about the changes in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/price-changes-in-selected-territories-updated-december-2022.1424549/page-4#post-28680500" target="_blank">wordy post</a> but I'll outline the main changes for you to make it easy at a glance. Going forward, they expect to adjust prices every year at the start of a year and here's what to expect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Argentinian Peso and Turkish Lira will see "more than a 300% increase".</li>
<li>Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, Indian Rupee, Indonesian Rupiah, Kazakhstani Tenge and Russian Ruble to get "moderate increases".</li>
<li>British Pound, Norwegian Krone, Polish Zloty and Swiss Franc to get "smaller increases".</li>
<li>Peruvian Sol, Costa Rican Colon and Singapore Dollar to see "moderate price <em>decreases</em>"</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Victoria 3 launched with their updated pricing, so no changes are expected on that title.</em></p>
<p>Currencies not mentioned are likely to see no changes at all.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma gets Wayland Fractional Scaling, Fixing Multi-Screen and a Steam Deck updater</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I continue to be truly amazed by all the work going into KDE Plasma. Not only is it my desktop environment of choice on Linux, it's Valve's too as it powered the desktop mode on Steam Deck. It's about to get some juicy upgrades too.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2022/12/16/this-week-in-kde-wayland-fractional-scaling-oh-and-we-also-fixed-multi-screen/" target="_blank">blog post</a> developer Nate Graham gives an overview of some big improvements coming along to a future version of the Plasma desktop.</p>
<p>The first is you'll finally see fractional scaling on Wayland which was merged in and it should result in scaling having "better performance, less visual blurriness, and lower power usage". Sounds like all of it might not be ready until Plasma 6.0 though due after Plasma 5.27 that releases in February 2023 but it might get backported so we're not waiting so long.</p>
<p>Another issue is the mess that is using multiple screens. They've finally fixed the root cause of the problems with a whole new system of identifying screens that should result in better stability and reliability. Some pretty notorious bugs like desktops randomly losing wallpapers, widgets and various other settings. It won't be perfect but it's not "broken by design" like the old system seemingly was.</p>
<p>There's various other bug fixes, UI updates and more.</p>
<p>One more exciting one I wanted to point out is their new Steam Deck OS (SteamOS) update system. Discover, the software store, now has a backend system to handle SteamOS updates so in future you'll be able to update a Steam Deck from within desktop mode. That sounds mighty useful.</p>

      <title>Multiplayer sandbox building game Brickadia heads to Steam next year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://brickadia.com/" target="_blank">Brickadia</a> could be a good one for gamers both young and old, giving you a game that looks a little bit like a cross between LEGO, Minecraft and Roblox. It's been in Alpha for quite some time and the developers just announced the plan to release in Early Access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199420/Brickadia/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in April 2023.</p>
<p>It will have Native Linux support too! I can see this being very popular if done right.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-IvAuZgZLgw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b1bccfdb2fdb09ff525245778fdb3463.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-IvAuZgZLgw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I haven't tried it since a very early Alpha build, but even then the idea was a good one and it looks like it's come ridiculously far since then.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build anything you can imagine - Using our constantly growing collection of bricks and intuitive, powerful tools, you can build towering skyscrapers, fun vehicles, islands, spaceships, cities, anything you can dream of. The only limit is your imagination.</li>

<li>Be anyone or anything - Mix and match from several hundred pieces to build your own entirely unique avatar. Replace any body part, attach accessories like belts and vests, put on a hat or even some fresh hair? Create an unlimited number of avatars to use in the game however you like!</li>
<li>Make your creations interactive - Create interactive builds with buttons, switches, doors, lights and so much more with wire logic.

      <title>Epic Games needs your birthday to keep your account working in Heroic Games Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, Epic Games rolled out a change to their account system aimed at protecting the younger people on their store and it has caused issues for the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>
<p>Epic announced a change in a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/how-epic-games-cabined-accounts-work-in-fortnite" target="_blank">blog post</a> recently, for their new "Cabined Accounts" that provide "a tailored experience that is safe and inclusive for younger players while maintaining access to the gameplay you love in Fortnite".</p>
<p>A side-effect, is that the cross-platform free and open source Heroic Games Launcher can seemingly no longer download games unless you do this, leading to people believing that the issue is Heroic breaking. What you'll need to do, if you use it for Steam Deck or Linux desktop, is to either log out of Epic on Heroic and log back in which should bring up the prompt to add your date of birth, or add it on the Epic Games website to your account there.</p>
<p>That should get you back into working order if you didn't have it there already.</p>

      <title>Moving on from Twitter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 19/12/22</strong>: Twitter has now completely removed the new rules, including removing all posts about it from the official Twitter Support account. It's a small step in the right direction. Mastodon links are still completely blocked though. For now, I will still be pointing you to follow us in other places.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In light of everything going on with Twitter right now, GamingOnLinux will no longer be sharing any news to the platform, as it has become incredibly hostile.</p>
<p>Repeatedly banning journalists critical of Elon Musk (the new owner of Twitter), banning the Mastodon Twitter account, then banning links to Mastodon and it just keeps on getting worse. Add into that their plans to keep expanding the paid version, which will begin to silence people who don't pay and become a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603985491505795072" target="_blank">worse version of Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>On top of that, they're now going to be <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/social-platforms-policy" target="_blank">forcefully banning</a> links to other social networking platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Truth Social, Tribel, Post and Nostr and 3rd-party social media link aggregators such as linktr.ee, lnk.bio. There's many other problems with Twitter, this is hardly even scratching the surface.</p>
<p>Twitter has become an openly hostile platform under Musk. It's no longer a social network. It's a play-thing for Musk to silence anyone critical, and repeatedly ban anything he doesn't personally like.</p>
<p>I'm done with it.</p>
<p>You can follow and join in on these other places:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Mastodon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">Discord</a></li>
<li><a href="https://t.me/linuxgaming" target="_blank">Telegram</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/irc/" target="_blank">IRC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">YouTube</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As always, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/article_rss.php" target="_blank">RSS</a> is an option for people who just want the plain news. Every single article tag on here also has a dedicated RSS feed.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck now shipping across Asia, plus a new Steam Deck Stable Client update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're about to see a whole lot more people gaming on Linux, with a shiny Steam Deck arriving at the door of many people across Asia. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">Valve hit a home run with the first year of Steam Deck</a>.</em></p>
<p>On the official OnDeck Twitter account, Valve <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1603947358550921217" target="_blank">announced</a> "The wait is over! Steam Decks are now shipping out to customers who reserved units in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan!" so it will be thoroughly interesting to see what happens from now.</p>
<p>That really will be a ridiculously large bump for the amount of Steam Deck gamers, and will no doubt from January / February onwards show some movement on the Steam Hardware Survey, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/novembers-steam-survey-shows-another-uptick-for-linux-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">keeps showing</a> a new high for the Linux user share since it uses SteamOS 3 Linux.</p>
<p>Additionally, Valve just recently bumped all the recent Beta changes to Stable for the Steam Deck Client (not the OS). In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5201125680687903832" target="_blank">announcement</a> Valve said "We have just shipped an updated Steam Client to the Stable (default) channel. This update includes all the changes and improvements that have been undergoing testing in the Beta and Preview channels." and also noted these additional fixes added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed gamepad focus issues in Steam store.</li>
<li>Fixed footer buttons sometimes not appearing in Steam store.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Klei continuing to do great work here to expand the excellent Oxygen Not Included, along with a fancy new animated short that I always enjoy from them. This update is for both the base game and the Spaced Out expansion.</p>
<p>This update adds in new buildings and rooms including a Conduction Panel that exchanges heat with buildings that it overlaps with, Mission Control Station broadcasts guidance data that ramps up a rocket’s speed during flight, Geotuner to get a little extra juice from a geyser and your Duplicants gain a morale boost when given a private bedroom.</p>
<p>Also added is a new story trait with Mysterious Hermit that they said "The Mysterious Hermit is the star of our latest story trait. Convince him to join your colony (and let you repurpose his old haunt) by completing some tasks, like delivering tasty, tasty food to his curious domicile.".</p>
<p>Here's their wonderful new animated short:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FhTbZOZpEdg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/598fcf6676126b7a255aa56e4a40f3c0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FhTbZOZpEdg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<li>Geysers are now renamable. They start with a unique name identifier so it’s easier to tell them apart.</li>
<li>Reveal the asteroid's surface when you launch a rocket after it reaches space.</li>

      <title>RazerGenie, a Qt app for configuring your Razer devices version 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Needing a good UI for managing Razer hardware on Linux? <a href="https://github.com/z3ntu/RazerGenie" target="_blank">RazerGenie</a> is one (of a few) choice, and a big 1.0 release just went out. It can work with Razer devices thanks to the excellent <a href="https://openrazer.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenRazer</a> project, which bundles a ton of drivers together to get loads of devices working nicely with all the added extras.</p>
<p>This release came with a "Major backend rewrite with vastly improved support for devices" and these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All devices can now open the Custom Editor, even if there's no specific layout available.</li>
<li>Add various specific layouts to the custom editor (incl. Firefly and some mice).</li>
<li>Support all LEDs available on newer devices (side LEDs, etc.)</li>
<li>Support non-standard polling rates.</li>
<li>Restore current effect and colors on open.</li>
<li>New translations: Dutch and Russian.</li>
<li>Various other smaller changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always nice to see the open source community building apps like this, especially as most hardware vendors like Razer basically ignore Linux.</p>

      <title>Valve just gave away another bunch of Steam Decks so check your email</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During The Game Awards 2022, Valve were giving away a Steam Deck every minute and it seems they loved throwing hardware at people so much they just did it again.</p>
<p>As the show aired on Steam, below the video (if you didn't have it full screen), it was showing the usernames people set. This — caused some hilarity, with a certain "Milf Hunter" becoming the source of much amusement during the event. No doubt <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1601023351262150656" target="_blank">this image</a> and memory will reach some sort of legendary status among Steam users. Where were you when Valve announced Milf Hunter won a Steam Deck on their store huh?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5376521241671150787gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Anyway, the official OnDeck Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1603547367747497984" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! The team was so blown away by the overwhelming response to the <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/" target="_blank">@thegameawards</a> event that we've decided to give away another round of Steam Decks! We just drew 171 more names from all the registrants who tuned in (over 980,000 of you!). Check your email to see if you won!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you might want to have a quick look to see if you just got a shiny present from Valve.</p>

      <title>Immortals Fenyx Rising now on Steam but quite messy on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Immortals Fenyx Rising is another from Ubisoft as they continue putting their games back on Steam, and sadly this release seems a bit messy on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's no annoying launcher issues here. While it does have Ubisoft Connect, much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-impressive-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Assassins Creed Valhalla</a>, it worked out of the box. Although sometimes the Ubisoft Connect pop-up wouldn't go away, needing SHIFT+F2 set in Steam Input to load the overlay and disable notifications from it completely. The overlay itself also doesn't go away when you load it, so you need to then restart if it happens.</p>
<p>Sadly, there's a number of issues with the actual game directly. Firstly, they didn't even give it a controller configuration. So before starting, you need to go into Steam Input and set it to a gamepad as it defaults to mouse and keyboard. After that, you then get greeted by an intro cut-scene that will either have completely broken audio or go repeatedly badly out of sync. The audio issues persist in the game itself directly too. Side-note: even on desktop Linux the audio issues happen too.</p>
<p>Another problem is the grass rendering, it has a load of black line flickering across multiple testing graphics configurations. So right now, it's not something I'm going to suggest anyone pick up.</p>

      <title>Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translator VKD3D-Proton version 2.8 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve and their open source contractors sure are a busy bunch. VKD3D-Proton, which translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.8" target="_blank">version 2.8</a> is out now.</p>
<p>An exciting sounding improvement for lowering the CPU overhead is the addition of support for the VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer extension. On Steam Deck "most of it" was already used but now this release will allow for others to benefit too. With a note that "GPU bound performance increases slightly".</p>
<p>Two new extensions are now required but both should be readily available in drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_buffer_device_address</li>
<li>VK_KHR_push_descriptor</li>
</ul>
<p>They have also rewritten support for host accessible images, no longer needing a bunch of per-application hacks and workarounds with Guardians of the Galaxy "finally" able to run well on NVIDIA.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a rewritten swap chain, which should be transparent to users but has many benefits like more precise latency control and frame pacing, reduced CPU overhead, fixes a hang in Hitman III and allows for native Linux use of VKD3D-Proton too.</p>
<p>Plus there's also various fixes and specific workarounds for titles like: Spiderman Miles Morales, Borderlands 3, Age of Empires IV, Resident Evil Village, Witcher 3, Gears 5 and some more minor D3D12 features were added.</p>

      <title>Xfce 4.18 desktop is finally here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just shy of two years since Xfce 4.16 the latest release has landed with Xfce 4.18 that comes with tons of new features and a "gazillion" bug fixes. It's still one of the most popular desktop environments for Linux, that offers up a lightweight experience without a lot of the fancy shiny stuff found in GNOME and KDE.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5390436941671126806gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5390436941671126806gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A lot of this release went into the Thunar file manager, some of the improvements noted include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image preview in the file manager, with two different modes available. You can have the preview pop over the left panel, or have it so its own panel appears on the right.</li>
<li>Undo and Redo support for various file operations like moving, renaming, sending to trash.</li>
<li>File highlighting accent colour support. You can adjust the background and filename to different colours.</li>
<li>A customizable toolbar.</li>
<li>A new split view.</li>
<li>Recursive searching.</li>
<li>A new Recent file view.</li>
<li>Bookmarks moved to their own menu.</li>
<li>+ more</li>
</ul>
<p>There's plenty of improvement elsewhere like the Application Finder having support for systems with hybrid graphics, the compositor now supports adaptive vsync with GLX, better support for UI scaling, you can now decide what to do when a new display is connected and much much more.</p>
<p>More can be seen on a developer <a href="https://alexxcons.github.io/blogpost_8.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> and full <a href="https://www.xfce.org/download/changelogs/4.18/" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>We may get a Steam Controller 2, plus fun updates coming to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022" target="_blank">The Verge</a> managed to speak to a couple of developers at Valve on the Steam Deck, and while most of it was already known and largely covered here on GOL already (go through our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck tag</a>) there's a couple of interesting bits to pick out. ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">see my end of year Steam Deck article</a>.</p>
<p><em>It's quite a nice read overall and a very good article from Sean Hollister, especially for people not constantly reading up on everything Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>One of the first points is that Valve said the Steam Deck may never be "Stable" in the way that traditional consoles are, since Valve are "always going to be pushing updates as long as there’s people playing". So expect them to keep on pushing out new features and new fixes for bugs as they come in. Any regular Steam user will know: Valve like to keep on iterating on things constantly, and their Beta branch for the Steam client likes to break things quite often.</p>
<p>While it's not out yet, Valve are still working towards a SteamOS 3 release for everyone, and Valve are "excited to see other manufacturers making their own handheld PC gaming devices, we’re excited to see people make their own SteamOS machines which could include small PCs that they put next to their TV".</p>
<p>A Steam Controller 2 is something I've been asking for <em>years</em>, I even wrote a bit about the original in 2019 about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/confessing-my-continued-love-of-the-steam-controller-a-few-years-after-release/" target="_blank">how much I loved it</a>, and Valve want to see a second happen too, they said "we want to make it happen" but naturally they're heavily focused on the Deck directly right now.</p>
<p>Another feature Valve are working on is a built-in audio mixer for the Gaming Mode UI, so you can easily adjust levels between different applications, games and friends chat to make it all easier. No doubt this will be leveraging the newer Pipewire audio stack that makes this sort of thing easier than ever on Linux.</p>
<p>Something people have been asking for, a lot, is being able to share performance profiles. Valve are also looking into that. They don't plan to let you share graphics settings, but a profile of the options you change in the Quick Access performance menu sounds likely.</p>
<p>Finally, while they've repeatedly confirmed a Steam Deck 2 is planned, it doesn't seem like a "Pro" model will come as they like the idea of keeping everything at a set configuration for performance to make it easier for everyone and plan to keep that a while longer until it will really make a difference.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix from Valve gets The Witcher 3 next-gen DX12 working on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that certainly didn't take long did it? Valve have already put up an update to Proton Hotfix, that works around the crashing issue in DirectX 12 in The Witcher 3 next-gen on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Now it will work out of the box without the need for any workarounds. You can simply uncheck any forced compatibility option you had set on it, as Valve set it to Proton Hotfix by default now for the Steam Deck. You can also install Proton Hotfix yourself in your Steam Library, and set it on the game manually in the compatibility menu if you have any issues.</p>
<p><em>Just imagine if CD Projekt gave Valve a bit of early notice and testing on this, it could've worked right away.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m-msjdUyGl0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/558f3d11ce6e28ccada232baa2ae1d32.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m-msjdUyGl0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's still numerous issues with the new update though across all platforms, with masses of complaints about it. CD Projekt have <a href="https://twitter.com/witchergame/status/1603046409619513345" target="_blank">announced</a> that they're looking into it. Hopefully it won't be too long before it gets properly stable once again. Nice that it was a free update but they really need to do some more QA testing before pushing things out.</p>

      <title>Valve hit a home run with the first year of Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What an absolutely exceptional first year Valve had with the Steam Deck, and it continues to be my main way to play games now. From playing lots of indie games, to plenty of AA / AAA that work surprisingly well on it even right at release, the Steam Deck has opened up PC gaming to many new ways to play.</p>
<p>How far it has come since <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">the original release</a> huh? Valve's original release date in December last year was clearly overly optimistic, and in a lot of ways the February release this year was too. Supplies were constantly an issue and people were waiting months for a possible purchase email to come from Valve for their reservation, whereas now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">you can get it in 1-2 weeks</a> with no reservation needed. There's even the official <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/thoughts-on-the-official-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">Steam Deck Docking Station</a> to use it on your big TV (and many other cheaper docks too). We also found out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">it shipped over a million</a> back in October.</p>
<p>Currently, at time of writing, Deck Verified is doing pretty great on the numbers too. Looking at the stats on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which also includes unlisted games (but you still have access to them) there's now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 2651</li>
<li>Playable - 4286</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2431</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's not forget though, the vast majority of games on Steam Deck weren't even designed for it. Most still don't have even a single change done to make it work on it, or work any better. Valve clearly had a plan when they released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, the Windows translation layer based on Wine, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" target="_blank">back in 2018</a>. Without Proton, the Steam Deck would have been pretty much dead on arrival like the original Steam Machines were. You don't pull people in without the games they want to play, and for the most part, Proton has solved that problem. Whoever at Valve actually made the decision to push forward with Proton is clearly a genius.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Steam Deck using Linux, it has successfully continued to push up the Linux user statistics on Steam too overall. It's hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/novembers-steam-survey-shows-another-uptick-for-linux-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">multiple all-time new-highs</a> of Linux users, and while the majority pushing those numbers up are from SteamOS Linux on the Steam Deck, the numbers of desktop Linux users on it are going up too.</p>
<p>It's hard to think of a gaming hardware release that's felt this fresh and exciting, and I've been through quite a lot of launches myself over the years including being an early adopter of the PS3, PS4, Switch, XBX and many other earlier systems. The Steam Deck is just different.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the KDE Plasma desktop mode was a fantastic touch too of course, ensuring that out of the box the Steam Deck could function as a full PC. This also enables tons of extras to be installed and allows you to work around all sorts of things you can't do in the Steam Deck Gaming Mode UI, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-desktop-mode-plus-other-stores-like-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank">my second article</a> at the original release that went along with my main review talking about the likes of Discord and the Epic Games Store (although I would recommend the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/heroic-games-launcher-v250-is-out-with-downloads-manager-app-sideloading/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> for Epic / GOG now). It has limits due to the locked down file-system (that you can unlock at your own peril) but for the most part, it works great. So great in fact, that the likes of <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-gaming-2022-review-vampire-survivor-1849892099" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> <em>forgot</em> the original Steam Machines ever had a desktop mode (it used GNOME instead of KDE).</p>
<p>With a vibrant community building up around it, there's clearly no stopping it at this point. People are creating all sorts of things for it, like the excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">Deckmate attachment system</a>. There's also multiple software plugin systems like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/decky-loader-for-steam-deck-plugin-loader-gets-fixed-up-for-newer-steamos/" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>, and remember all the hype over boot videos? Not many vendors allow such wild customisation and even end up making it easier for you. Love emulation? There's now dedicated launchers for that too like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/emudeck-20-makes-emulation-on-steam-deck-easier-than-ever/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> that brings them all under one roof.</p>
<p>While there's a lot of positives, it's not perfection and I do have a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">wishlist of items</a> I hope Valve look into that I put up in October. I also won't sugarcoat that there's numerous other issues. There's constant problems with game launchers like the EA App breaking completely, then Valve fixed it loading and then it needed another fix because updates were breaking it. Some popular games stop working completely with new updates too. Anti-cheat is another ongoing issue, although largely out of Valve's hands as developers need to support it directly (Hi Bungie). Deck Verified is also a weird one too, with games sneaking into Verified that actually don't work well, which brings up constant questions on how they're testing them, and Unsupported games that actually are flawless. Valve ended up putting in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/looks-like-valve-are-adding-a-feedback-system-for-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">feedback system</a> to hopefully point them towards titles with problems.</p>
<p>Overall though: I can't wait to see what Valve are cooking up in 2023 for Steam Deck. I plan to keep putting a ton of hours into it, including streaming games from my PC it can't handle (now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-has-finally-fixed-the-steam-remote-play-audio-loss-bug-on-linux/" target="_blank">Remote Play is finally fixed for Linux hosts</a>) while comfortably curled up on my sofa to get away from the chains of my desk.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is the most accessible and affordable all-rounder handheld gaming PC, and I sure do hope there's a lot more to come from it. Now I just need a Steam Controller 2 (please Valve), and eventually a Steam Deck 2 that's a little lighter and has a better battery along with the next-generation AMD APU and it'll be another guaranteed home run. I'm not asking for much right? We <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-teams-with-komodo-to-bring-the-steam-deck-to-asia/" target="_blank">still have Asia</a> to go for the Steam Deck yet, so plenty more to come.</p>
<p>Be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow GamingOnLinux on YouTube</a> where I do lots of Steam Deck content.</p>
<p><em>What do you think of the first year of the Steam Deck?</em></p>

      <title>Epic Games are killing off a bunch of classics like Unreal Tournament</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-is-turning-off-online-services-and-servers-for-some-older-games" target="_blank">announced</a> today they're killing off a bunch of classic games removing them from stores and turning off their online services for retro delights like Unreal Tournament.</p>
<p>Why are they doing this? They're consolidating their services directly into their modern all-in-one Epic Online Services, so they don't want anything not using that to stick around that they have to maintain.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of titles being removed from stores (some are already gone like Unreal Tournament), and having their online play turned off on January 24 - 2023:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1000 Tiny Claws</li>
<li>Dance Central 1-3 
<ul>
<li>Note: Dance Central VR online multiplayer will remain available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Green Day: Rock Band</li>
<li>Monsters (Probably) Stole My Princess</li>
<li>Rock Band 1-3 
<ul>
<li>Note: Rock Band 4 online multiplayer will remain available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Beatles: Rock Band</li>
<li>Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars</li>
<li>Unreal Gold</li>
<li>Unreal II: The Awakening</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament 2003</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament 2004</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament 3
<ul>
<li>Note: We have plans to bring back online features via Epic Online Services in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully the community (like perhaps <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a>), will find a way to get online going again for some of the classic Unreal Tournament games. Otherwise, that's a whole lot of FPS history being lost.</p>
<p>For Unreal Tournament 3, it looks like they're re-branding it as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13210/Unreal_Tournament_3_X/" target="_blank">Unreal Tournament 3 X</a> and making it free to play, as you can see they already did it on the Steam page and you can see all the changes on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/13210/history/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> history but it's not actually live they're just re-purposing the Steam page.</p>
<p>On top of that they also said they're removing Linux and macOS versions of Hatoful Boyfriend and Hatoful Boyfriend: Holiday Star today. No reason given for either.</p>
<p>If you do want to stock up, the old Unreal games are still on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?query=unreal&amp;order=desc:score" target="_blank">GOG</a> but probably won't be for long.</p>

      <title>Steam with Linux now available in Tesla cars (Beta)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here come a bunch more gamers using Linux, as Tesla have rolled out a software update that enables Steam in Beta.</p>
<p>Announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1602789357156536321" target="_blank">Twitter</a> with a video to show it off, you get access to many thousands of games. This is largely thanks to all the Linux work Valve has been doing through the Steam client, graphics drivers, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> and more. Accessing Steam has been enabled on Model S &amp; X (2022+) and requires "Premium Connectivity". From the <a href="https://teslascope.com/teslapedia/software/2022.44.25.1" target="_blank">changelog</a>, it mentions specifically people can play anything that is Steam Deck Verified, although it's not clear if they're blocking games that aren't from working. So, it's basically a really expensive Steam Deck with wheels now.</p>
<p>Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais also put up a <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1602826674957332480/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post on it, showing off a nice clear picture too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12398269471671021348gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12398269471671021348gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image Credit - Pierre-Loup Griffais on Twitter.</em></p>
<p>Previously, Tesla got <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21023-9605.PDF" target="_blank">investigated</a> for the Passenger Play feature as the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration thought it would cause a distraction and was a safety issue. To counter it, Tesla disabled it while the vehicle is moving.</p>

      <title>Valve fix the New Big Picture Mode on NVIDIA for Linux gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3627116953544957770" target="_blank">the latest</a> Steam Client Beta for Desktop released December 13th, Valve has now fixed the New Big Picture Mode not working for those with NVIDIA GPUs along with plenty of other fixes.</p>
<p>Previously, it would try to launch and get stuck and not actually display anything but you would hear the intro video playing. Now it seems to launch just fine, although it feels a little sluggish overall with all the animations and fading effects that it does. Still, nice to have it actually work now though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12153459871671018367gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12153459871671018367gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They also still haven't yet fixed the issue of it showing what's behind the window when you bring up the Steam menu</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20068066251671018463gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20068066251671018463gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all the changes noted by Valve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several issues related to popup dialogs being sized incorrectly</li>
<li>Fixed issue where game hover UI would sometimes get stuck in the upper left corner of the UI</li>
<li>Fixed sizing of app details DLC hover</li>
<li>Fixed regression where clicking on DLC &amp; "view all" in the dlc rollup not navigate to the store</li>
<li>Fixed "Move" and "Uninstall" not working in content management UI.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where a browser opened by a game was sticking around after closing the overlay</li>
<li>Fixed launch options dialog not closing when cancelling game launch</li>
<li>Various fixes to make the UI scale better in higher resolutions</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the virtual keyboard would continuously be made visible after exiting a game</li>
<li>Added option to start in windowed mode under Settings =&gt; Display =&gt; Big Picture Mode =&gt; Windowed</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added direct navigation to controller inputs and modes from the preview screen</li>
<li>Fixed the XBox layout preview page layout having some incorrect items and missing others</li>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4 gets a Death Stranding fix, plus new Client Beta and Firmware update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three different bits of news to cover for Steam Deck updates today, as Valve pushed out three different upgrades. Here's all that's new.</p>
<p>Firstly, for players of Death Stranding Director's Cut, Valve has put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3637250052887652007" target="_blank">fix</a> into SteamOS 3.4 Preview to work around it crashing when you move the right thumbstick on the map to tilt it. Always nice to see Valve fix up things <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/death-stranding-directors-cut-has-an-annoying-issue-that-can-reboot-your-steam-deck/" target="_blank">I highlighted previously</a>.</p>
<p>The next one is an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3637250052890759226" target="_blank">update</a> for the Stable version of the Steam Deck OS (SteamOS 3.3.3), which has a "hotfix to enable compatibility with future input firmware". You'll see an update but there's no user-visible changes included right now.</p>
<p>Finally the Steam Deck Client Beta was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3605725422746687645" target="_blank">updated</a> for December 13th to include these changes:</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to get The Witcher 3 working on Steam Deck after the next-gen update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The massive free next-gen <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/292030/view/3642879552277333733" target="_blank">update</a> for The Witcher 3 is here, and out of the box now on Steam Deck it will just crash when you try to load into the game. Here's how to sort it out.</p>
<p><em>Thankfully, it's actually quite easy.</em></p>
<p>Currently the problem seems to be all the updates to the DirectX 12 mode, it will just crash to an error screen after loading and it will do this every time.</p>
<p>To get around that in the new update: in the launcher, next to the play button is a drop-down box where you can select DirectX 11 and that will get it working again. Another option for those that want it, is in the game Properties -&gt; Betas, you can select the Classic option to get the pre-patch version of the game. You can select that Beta even before you download it, so you don't end up wasting time with an extra download too.</p>

      <title>Wine on Wayland sounds like it&#39;s coming along nicely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Collabora have given an <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/wine-on-wayland-2022-updatye-more-games-more-apps-more-fun.html" target="_blank">end of year update</a> on how the work towards running the Windows compatibility layer on Wayland is coming along and it sounds good.</p>
<p>Their focus has been to keep up with upstream Wine development, which involved "splitting the driver into a PE and Unix part, updating it for the latest internal driver APIs, and making preparations to support WoW64". A big improvement is that it now supports cross-process rendering, something required for Chromium/CEF applications. On top of that they've also worked on improved support for the linux-dmabuf v4 Wayland protocol (aka dmabuf-feedback), that "allows compositors to dynamically send information about optimal formats and modifiers, e.g., depending on the surface presentation mode (fullscreen vs windowed)" plus many other ehancements.</p>
<p>On the Wine Development <a href="https://www.winehq.org/mailman3/hyperkitty/list/wine-devel@winehq.org/thread/5GQWFP7MC6GQTL2KLAV6F6RUMOE3QULI/" target="_blank">mailing list</a>, developer Alexandros Frantzis also touched on when to expect the code in upstream Wine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last year, due to the extensive ongoing internal rework in Wine (e.g., win32u), the decision was made to postpone the upstreaming of the Wayland driver until some amount of internal stability had been reached. My impression is that things are a lot more stable now, from the drivers' point of view at least. Is there any upcoming work that people feel would be severely hindered by the upstreaming of the Wayland driver?</p>
<p>Ideally, I would like to start the upstreaming effort (which I expect will take some time) at some point early next year, after the codebase has been unfrozen. Does this sound reasonable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also provided a video to show off the latest work that shows:  Chrome with accelerated cross-process rendering, LibreOffice, Call of Duty 2 (Demo), Crayon Physics Deluxe, Dagon, Factorio, The Last Express and Phoning Home.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lZ-MK72Kyp8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e85fb7de59a5ee2595b40fab75689758.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lZ-MK72Kyp8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Why is this important? It's because Wayland is gradually replacing X11, and having Wine run on it natively without another compatibility layer in between like XWayland will hopefully improve performance and reduce another layer of complexities to go through for both users and developers.</p>

      <title>AMD Radeon RX 7000 launched today for the select few able to beat the crowds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD has today released the Radeon RX 7000 series GPUs starting with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX and Radeon RX 7900 XT.</p>
<p>Stock was, as expected, very limited. I won't go over every single bit again, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/amd-announce-rx-7900-xtx-and-rx-7900-xt-plus-fsr3-teased/" target="_blank">covered previously</a> but to reiterate some of what to expect from these cards:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMD RDNA 3 Architecture</strong> – Featuring an advanced chiplet design, rearchitected compute units and second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology, RDNA 3 architecture delivers up to 54% more performance per watt than RDNA 2.</li>
<li><strong>Chiplet Design</strong> – The world’s first gaming GPU with a chiplet design delivers up to 15% higher frequencies at up to 54% better power efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Generational Uplift – </strong>The flagship AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX delivers considerably higher 4K performance than the Radeon RX 6950 XT.</li>
<li><strong>DisplayPort 2.1 Support –</strong> The industry’s only high-end gaming graphics cards to support DisplayPort 2.1 technology with UHBR 13.5, enabling high-refresh 4K (up to 480Hz) or 8K (up to 165Hz) gaming on next-gen displays.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by some Linux benchmarks <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/rx7900xt-rx7900xtx-linux" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> did, it seems like a pretty nice set of cards. Although, they didn't have the NVIDIA 4000 series to test against, but at least it shows AMD is a clear winner against even the 3090, which is good news for me as I have an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and I was lucky enough to beat the crowds at Overclockers to bag a Radeon RX 7900 XTX as a personal purchase (I rarely get sent any hardware). <strong>Update</strong>: correction, no 7900 XTX for me as <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1603073266364579842" target="_blank">Overclockers UK over-sold on it</a>.</p>
<p>You can find some other reviews by the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq6Yp2Zxnkk" target="_blank">JayzTwoCents</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBJ-vo6Ri9c" target="_blank">LinusTT</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UFiG7CwpHk" target="_blank">Hardware Unboxed</a>.</p>
<p>Want to find where to possibly by one when they're back in stock? Check the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/where-to-buy/radeon-rx-graphics" target="_blank">AMD website</a>, although they weirdly don't list the UK, apparently we no longer exist. For people in the UK you can try the likes of <a href="https://www.scan.co.uk/search?q=Radeon+RX+7900+XTX" target="_blank">Scan</a>, <a href="https://www.ebuyer.com/search?q=Radeon+RX+7900+XTX" target="_blank">Ebuyer</a>, <a href="https://www.overclockers.co.uk/?query=Radeon%2520RX%25207900%2520XTX" target="_blank">Overclockers</a>.</p>
<p>For me it's especially exciting, as I haven't had an AMD card for a good 10+ years so it's going to be a whole different world. I'm looking forward to seeing what open source graphics drivers can do.</p>

      <title>Valve has finally fixed the Steam Remote Play audio loss bug on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally, after years of waiting, Valve has now fixed the Steam Remote Play bug that basically made the feature useless for a Linux host.</p>
<p>Steam Remote Play is a great feature, allowing you to stream your Steam Library from a powerful PC to something smaller like a Steam Deck or anything that can run Steam Link. Especially nice for games the Steam Deck can't run directly, if you have the hardware elsewhere streaming it is a good solution to let you relax on the sofa or in bed with it.</p>
<p>The problem is that since 2019 there's been <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/6749" target="_blank">a bug</a> where after a while, like clockwork, every single time the audio would crackle and then just vanish completely on the system receiving the stream. This bug caused me to seriously consider sitting at my PC one evening recently, just to continue my Death Stranding Director's Cut play-through which runs poorly for me across two different Steam Decks (even with multiple "fixes" tested).</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3627116953542043543" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> for December 12th has now <u>solved</u> this! I cannot even begin to tell you how happy I am about this. I much prefer chilling on my sofa in the evening with a Steam Deck, so this pleases me.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for switching the primary monitor on Windows. See Settings -&gt; Display -&gt; Preferred Display.</li>
<li>Fixed overlay scaling when resizing game window</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the Armor-X Pro gamepad in PS4 mode</li>
<li>Fixed long delay at startup when the Razer Huntsman Elite keyboard is plugged in</li>
<li>Fixed the Logitech G29 controller showing up as a gamepad instead of a wheel</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed eventual audio crackling and loss when streaming from Linux</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash when taking screenshots through the overlay</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NnisYGZv9QY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/181aa8cd8e1b2c2718e45aa6595ad78c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NnisYGZv9QY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now they just need to fix up the New Big Picture Mode being completely <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8916" target="_blank">broken</a> on NVIDIA and I'll have even less to moan about.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive v0.6 out with a day and night cycle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive just continues to impress. It's a free and open source evolution sim built with Godot Engine and version 0.6 is out now with big new helpful features.</p>
<p>One of the most immediately visible changes is the day and night cycle, so the game as a whole feels a lot more alive in a way. Although it's disabled by default, as it can make it more difficult. There's also now a Thriveopedia, giving you an easy way in-game to read up on all things Thrive. Fossilization is in allowing players to save species in a museum that can be viewed in the Thriveopedia too. Om top of that they also rewrote their launcher to provide "enhanced processing and loading speeds, a sleeker design, and greater versatility".</p>
<p>More:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Thrive now has a new intro video when you start the game. Make sure you have it enabled in the settings so you can appreciate the exciting view!</li>
<li>The main menu now features social media icons so that you can easily find a community outlet of your choice.</li>
<li>Thrive now has a safe-mode triggered crashing, which disables all mods and video playing before restarting.</li>
<li>Pili now feature a slight damage delay, preventing them from rapidly inflicting a large amount of damage at once.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Core Devourer is another for fans of Vampire Survivors and Soulstone Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love over-the top repeatable action horde games like Soulstone Survivors, Vampire Survivors and all the others? You'll never guess what, another developer is making one that sounds and looks quite good.</p>
<p>Core Devourer is the name and it's a "sci-fi action-packed roguelite where you hunt down huge hordes of droids and absorb their cores to become the strongest cybernetic being on the planet". The developer emailed it over, and mentioned it's coming to Linux. The boss fights in this one could be fun, as the developer said they each have a unique pattern to learn and overcome, that's on top of the many hordes you're blasting away too.</p>
<p>You can see their first trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Wm_6xgth2KE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2a62a4fb8c268e570634f77f807f6e5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Wm_6xgth2KE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>10+ weapons with special effects.</li>
<li>7+ procedural maps to explore.</li>
<li>Hundreds of unique power-ups for your character.</li>
<li>Many character upgrades.</li>
<li>Craftable gear.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game is due to launch sometime in Q2 2023.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2199060/Core_Devourer/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The rather great LEGO Bricktales switches to Vulkan on Linux, adds UI scaling options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEGO Bricktales was already a lot of fun and now perhaps it's even better with some new options and improvements for their Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1898290/view/3615857706245766322" target="_blank">update</a> went out on December 5th, it should enable it to be even smoother on Linux and thanks to the new UI scaling options, it should work better for people who need things a little big bigger — something I truly wish every modern game release had but for some reason some developers just don't even think about it.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added UI scaling options.</li>
<li>Reworked UI for build mode.</li>
<li>Tutorial improvements.</li>
<li>Bricks can be nudged horizontally with arrow keys on keyboard when selected.</li>
<li>Added achievements button to main menu.</li>
<li>Improved mix of two City music tracks (removed troublesome frequencies).</li>
<li>Set Vulkan as default graphics API on Linux.</li>
<li>Minor diorama changes that ensure playability when players use the "Help, I'm stuck" teleport feature.</li>
<li>Improved controls for touch devices.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Plus a few bug fixes I won't note here due to spoilers.</em></p>
