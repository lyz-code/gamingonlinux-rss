      <title>Steam Deck Beta update tweaks notifications, boot video length upped to 30 seconds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fresh out the oven, Valve has put up a new Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6186282400389030369" target="_blank">Client Beta</a> that tweaks how some notifications are accessed. This update is available in the Beta and Preview channels: you can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Quick Access Menu will now open to the notifications tab when you have new friend chat messages, game invites, or voice chat invites</li>
<li>Notifications for Game Invites in the Quick Access Menu now have an option in the footer to accept them without having to navigate to the chat window</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Steam group chats with long names or descriptions could cause break the layout of the chat screen</li>
<li>Increase boot animation max length from 10 seconds to 30 seconds</li>
<li>Added controller-specific glyphs on the Lock screen</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the Lock screen where you'd have to dismiss the On-Screen Keyboard manually if you slept the device while it was up</li>
<li>Fixed invoking the On-Screen-Keyboard while already in a fullscreen keyboard input scenario causing bad behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with editing command settings from inside the virtual menu screen</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've no doubt many will appreciate the max length change to boot animations, considering there's so many great videos being showcased. Now there's even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-deck-boot-videos-get-an-easy-app-plus-videos-coming-to-the-points-shop/" target="_blank">an easy to use app</a> to download and install them.</p>

      <title>Steam Mobile App gets a huge revamp out now for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some time being in Beta, Valve has officially released the new shiny new Steam Mobile App for all.</p>
<p>This really is a big upgrade, and one we've all been waiting for. Valve let Steam Mobile die a slow death until this revamp, so let's hope they keep up with it this time. It has a new design, along with it being built on a whole new framework. Major new additions like QR code sign-in, making it easier than ever to jump into Steam on new devices.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8YhYPGltHyI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d36cd3615129a622c9fc78f7bda355a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8YhYPGltHyI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>App Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two-factor authentication to ensure you’re the only one with access to your account</li>
<li>QR code sign in - Scan a QR code to sign into Steam instead of entering a password or…</li>
<li>Sign in confirmation - Confirm your regular Steam sign ins with simple “approve” or “deny”</li>
<li>Authorized Devices - Manage access to the devices your account has signed in</li>
<li>Easy access to the Store, Community, News, etc from wherever you are</li>
<li>Your Library with access to your game content, discussions, guides, support, and more</li>
<li>Remote download of games and updates on your PC, managed from your phone</li>
<li>Customizable Steam notifications: wishlist, sales, comments, trades, discussions, friend requests, and more</li>
<li>Trade and Market confirmations – to ensure items don’t leave your account without your approval</li>
<li>An improved Store browsing experience for mobile screens</li>
<li>Support for using multiple Steam accounts in the app</li>
<li>Customizable tabs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve makes it clear that Steam Chat will remain a separate app, for some reason. It will also be getting some major upgrades today on Android and iOS "soon".</p>
<p>As for what's next. Valve are bringing the QR sign-in to Steam Deck, adding in new notification types and adding the Authorized Devices list to the Steam Client and browser.</p>
<p>The app is available in the <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-mobile/id495369748" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>, the <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.android.steam.community" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>, and as a <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://store.steampowered.com/mobile?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_" target="_blank">standalone APK</a>.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Factorio and RimWorld, space colony building sim Stardeus out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking plenty of inspiration from Factorio and RimWorld (including a very RimWorld style), Kodo Linija and Paradox Arc have released Stardeus into Early Access. It comes with Native Linux support, along with it being Steam Deck Verified. <em>Note: the developer provided me a key months ago for early testing.</em></p>
<p>Set on a broken spaceship long after Earth was destroyed, your take in Stardeus is to build it back up with the help of various drones to make it habitable once again for your hibernating human survivors. Build up and travel the stars in a procedurally generated universe, with a lot of heavy simulation going on in the background.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zDeQ3FX3nyQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6afbdfb9ec01f84cf46c9791a62a736a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zDeQ3FX3nyQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it is a pretty huge game, with lots to learn, it's also surprisingly accessible. The developer has kept it in a closed-beta for some months now, and the introduction has been smoothed-over quite nicely with a tutorial that nicely walks you through various parts of the game as you go. Thanks to that, it's quite easy to get into it.</p>
<p>Unlike certain other similar games, Stardeus does have an end-game win condition. The whole point of what you're doing here is not to aimlessly wander the stars. Instead, the idea is that you build up enough and explore to find a suitable planet for colonization. It can take many tens of hours to get there though, and with it being in Early Access no doubt it will change and expand over time.</p>
<p>Even though it's unfinished, there's a lot to enjoy with this one already and tons of content available to play through with a few different scenarios. Kido Linija expect it to be in Early Access for 2-3 years where they will add in more scenarios, story events and various other features. It will still sprinkle in some quests though, so you're not entirely alone right away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9513253371665590916gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9513253371665590916gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since there's a huge amount to the game, the tutorial only covers so much and it does get to a point where you're on your own. It's there that Stardeus thrives, letting you click around and discover everything it has to offer as you research new buildings, and attempt to revive more of the population you have sitting in stasis.</p>
<p>It has some fantastic ambiance to it too. The music is soft and blends nicely into the background, while you're listening to all your little robots and people get to work. Honestly, I've been really sucked in by this one and the hours really do just fade away into space.</p>
<p>There are some niggling issues with it though, and some things just need to be made clearer, which no doubt the developer will get a ton of feedback on now that anyone can buy it and play it. Not a huge amount though, just a lot of little things that need a better even small explanation of why they won't work. Sometimes your actual people will take a bit too long to make a decision to do something too, leaving you waiting around even when the exact facilities they need are available.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>With only a handful of drones at your disposal, salvage, repair and rebuild your destroyed ship and restore life support before the crew suffocates in the vacuum of space.</li>
<li>Design and rebuild your ship according to your own needs and desires. Balance the onboard systems of oxygen, heat and power to ensure long-term survival.</li>
<li>Process resources into useful components to maintain and expand your ship’s facilities. Grow crops and turn the harvest into food for your awakening colonists. Generate energy to power your ship and create a robust interconnected system.</li>
<li>Use and expand your massive computing power to research alien technologies. Discover new ways to survive the harsh universe and take care of or exploit your human crew.</li>
<li>Once powered and crewed by skilled colonists, take your ship on an odyssey to explore and mine the procedurally generated planets and systems of a vast universe.</li>
<li>Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. Live through an endless number of events and encounters introduced by the story-generating AI. Be it alien face huggers, benevolent traders or pirates: always be vigilant and deal with whatever happens the way you chose.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the smooth gameplay, and backing from Paradox, I've no doubt this will be a hit. I'll happily recommend it even in this early stage. I can see myself spending many weeks playing this.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stardeus" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for $29.99 / £26.99 / €29.99.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 520.56.06 driver adds easier NVIDIA NGX updates for Wine / Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/193764/en-us/" target="_blank">520.56.06</a>, adding support for NVIDIA RTX 40 series and adding a bunch of new features and fixes for Linux gamers.</p>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implemented support for over-the-air updates in the Proton and Wine NVIDIA NGX build. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Updated the Vulkan driver so that the following extensions no longer depend on nvidia-uvm.ko being loaded at runtime:
	<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_acceleration_structure</li>
<li>VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations</li>
<li>VK_KHR_ray_query</li>
<li>VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline</li>
<li>VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch</li>
<li>VK_NV_ray_tracing</li>
<li>VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur</li>
<li>VK_NVX_binary_import</li>
<li>VK_NVX_image_view_handle</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow use of the "--add-this-kernel" feature by non-root users.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a more accurate progress bar when building the kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a warning message if a Vulkan ICD loader is not detected.</li>
<li>Reworked nvidia-installer's support for DKMS: the kernel modules will now be optionally registered with DKMS after the installer has already built and installed them on its own. nvidia-installer will now register the kernel modules with DKMS by default when the dkms(8) utility is detected on the system.</li>
<li>Added a new CUDA Debugger implementation for Pascal and newer architectures as a part of the driver package: libcudadebugger.so (previously released separately as "CUDA GDB Developer Preview").</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption in geometry and tessellation control shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs when starting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crash with Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Roguelike tactical auto-battler Despot&#39;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despot's Game: Dystopian Army Builder has now left Early Access along with Native Linux support, this roguelike tactical auto-battler is certainly unique.</p>
<p>It sees you run through various rooms in different levels of a dungeon, commanding an army of little pink fleshy people you equip with all sorts of random items. Turn your people into swordsman, wizards, healers, give them damage-soaking refrigerators, yoga pants, stale pretzels and more.</p>
<p>As you go through the dungeons you will come up against hordes of aliens, robots, demons and other monstrosities. Thankfully you have a lot of people and weapons at your disposal. Not only are you building up an army, but you also want to build up combinations by equipping people with a similar class to unlock special ability levels too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hM6USMrRFAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/179336d350032d4ed46a0d1b6d4f34fd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hM6USMrRFAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You're also picking special mutations for your team as you progress too that you collect from certain rooms, allowing you to have special buffs like special abilities being more likely to trigger, or returning a certain percentage of damage back to enemies and lots more. You also get a list of mutations you can buy and level up as you progress too, allowing you truly create a ridiculously powerful team.</p>
<p>It's an auto-battler, so while you're the one building up a team and moving your people around, you don't control them during battle. You get to pick their positions, or you can get the game to position them for you, but when the battles start it's a hands-off approach as you watch to see who wins.</p>
<p>There's different game modes too. The traditional mode has you go from room to room until you reach the end, while the King of the Hill mode sees you take on other players. Although, lots of the mini-modes available need you to play more of the game to unlock them.</p>
<p>“Despot’s Game is a culmination of all our team's hard work, shared experiences, and dedication,” said Nikolay Kuznetsov, Game Creator, Konfa Games. “We are extremely excited to share our unique idea fully realized, especially after garnering so much positive feedback.”</p>
<p>Overall, I like it a lot. Doesn't need fast reflexes, allows you to sit back and relax with it as you come up with a good strategy moving your people around and equipping them weird some really weird combinations. Easy to pick up and learn, while difficult later on to build up a good team that needs some thought put into it. If you want a game the blends dungeon crawling, strategy and auto-battles it's a good choice.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/despots-game?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227280/Despots_Game_Dystopian_Battle_Simulator/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/despots_game_dystopian_army_builder" target="_blank">GOG</a> version is not released.</p>

      <title>A Robot Named Fight! source code released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of a nicely reviewed metroidvania called A Robot Named Fight! has released the source code, hoping that others can learn from it.</p>
<p>Currently though, it's not fully open source as they have it under their own license but they made it clear they're <a href="https://github.com/BartMartner/OpenARNF/issues/1#issuecomment-1268745170" target="_blank">considering</a> putting it under something like the GPL if they can. It also uses the Unity game engine, so it still relies on a proprietary game engine but it's still a good step and nice to see more developers consider open source.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iLN4k2GBS9w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca32cac299e85a107dc0c434b84f05f1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iLN4k2GBS9w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

Explore procedurally-generated labyrinths, uncover randomized power-ups and artifacts, find secrets, and blast meaty creatures in this deliciously gory Metroidvania."</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore a procedurally-generated labyrinth with more than 4 billion unique runs.</li>
<li>Prove your worth with true permadeath.</li>
<li>Take on over 60 menacing enemies solo or with a friend via local co-op.</li>

      <title>A lot of people were clearly waiting on the official Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that the Steam Deck is available <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">without reservation</a>, and the official Steam Deck Docking Station has released, it appears a lot of people were waiting on Valve for docking.</p>
<p>As of writing this, on the Global Top Sellers list, the Steam Deck Docking Station is currently at number 5, showing that quite a lot of people are buying it when you take into account that it's up against big hitters like FIFA 23 (and the price difference there is reasonably small too).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3185217981665573809gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3185217981665573809gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Only a few days ago, it was sat at the number 2 spot so while it's not selling as much a few days later, it's clearly holding some ground so a lot of people are buying it.</p>
<p>My own official Steam Deck Docking Station should arrive Friday, so I'll be letting you know when I think about it during next week after I've had some quality time with it.</p>
<p>Have you picked one up or are you going with something like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler</a>?</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Boot Videos get an easy app, plus videos coming to the Points Shop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/theres-now-a-dedicated-website-for-steam-deck-boot-videos/" target="_blank">Recently I mentioned</a> the new Steam Deck Repo website, allowing people to upload and download custom Steam Deck Boot Videos, well now there's an <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.steamdeckrepo.manager" target="_blank">easy to use app</a> (<a href="https://github.com/CapitaineJSparrow/steam-repo-manager" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) to go along with it.</p>
<p>This makes grabbing videos quicker and easier than ever. It's only just released so the Steam Deck Repo Manager app is limited but a perfect start to stop users having to make folders, and move files around manually. It also goes to show how fun and exciting the Steam Deck modding scene is, with new things appearing all the time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D-cl72fhfZk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee6c64a41f00bf69c7085b5116dacc7f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D-cl72fhfZk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, according to xpaw from SteamDB on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1580102765531258880/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Steam Deck Boot Videos will be coming to the Steam Points Shop. They track lots of changes happening to the Steam Client, with new language strings appearing in an update clearly showing it's in Valve's plans. Looking on <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/commit/aafcb45f7dfec2b149817974fa3f972f899558d7" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, you can clearly see what they're doing. Some of the new strings include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Redeem_Equip_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "You can select your Startup Movie by going to Settings =&gt; Customization on your Steam Deck."</li>
<li>"ShopPageTitle_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "Steam Deck Startup Movies"</li>
<li>"Redeem_UsePoints_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "Use your Steam Points to get this Steam Deck Startup Movie. You can set this movie to play when your Steam Deck starts up."</li>
</ul>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.26 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team have done it again! Giving us a fresh new Plasma desktop with plenty of upgrades and <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.26.0/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.26</a> is out now.</p>
<p>KDE say it's "All About the Widgets" and they're not wrong. When it comes to Widgets, they're referring to almost everything you see around the main Plasma desktop from what you add directly to the desktop, to the various icons and features on the bottom Plasma panel. With this release, you can now even resize those from the Plasma panel too which is quite a useful change.</p>
<p>Lots of Widgets saw upgrades too like the Dictionary allowing more than one dictionary definition or translation, the Sticky notes, User switcher and Media Player were all given new features too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mRNe8llSQ1g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b409588905a58805aeb64e6f19b32a7e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mRNe8llSQ1g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The 5.26 release also brings in officially the Plasma Big Screen mode, designed for use as the name suggests, on a big screen like a TV giving you a much better interface to use.</p>
<p>This also comes with it's own media player just for it called Plank Player. It even supports navigation with a remote, perfect for use on the sofa.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7659544191665494008gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7659544191665494008gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of focus on spit and polish with this release too. Their support of Wayland continues to improve, wallpapers change between light and dark themes to match, an option for changing the screen colouring for both night and day, a lot of bugs are also being fixed up as part of their "15-minute bugs" project so expect a more stable experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5/5.25.5-5.26.0/" target="_blank">list of improvements</a> goes a very long way down and it seems the Discover software store saw a rather large amount of fixes and improvements like multiple Flatpak updates, and actually inhibiting suspend while doing updates so you're not left with a broken system — quite an important one that. There's even a share button to properly direct people to apps inside Discover, nice! The numerous Flatpak upgrades will be very welcome for Steam Deck users, whenever Valve decides to upgrade it in SteamOS.</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">KDE devs talk Steam Deck</a> and their work for it at Akademy 2022.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kona II: Brume is the follow-up to 2017's Kona from Parabole / Ravenscourt bringing another cold and mysterious adventure to walk through.</p>
<p><em>"Northern Québec, 1970. A bizarre mist - the Brume - is disconnecting a rural mining village from its quiet reality and disrupting the balance of nature. But where is it coming from? Step back into the role of Detective Carl Faubert and dive deeper into the surreal mysteries of Kona. Make your trek through the snowy landscapes of Northern Canada and discover that you are not entirely alone. Find other stranded people - both victims and survivors of a devastating avalanche - and uncover the hidden dark truth of the Brume."</em></p>

      <title>VirtualBox 7.0 is out with their DirectX 11 support using DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this was an interesting one entering the GOL inbox recently. VirtualBox, the general-purpose full virtualizer has a big new release out and even they are now using DXVK.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> is the Vulkan-based implementation of D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11 for Linux / Wine that's used in Proton. There's also <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>, designed for running apps and games that have Linux Native builds (like VirtualBox itself in this case). It's quite incredible to see how this amazing open source tech is being used in more places, just goes to show how essential and performant it has become.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in VirtualBox 7.0 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Virtual machines can be fully encrypted now, including the VM config logs and saved states (CLI only for now).</li>
<li>GUI: Added a new utility similar to "top" or "resource monitor" which lists peformance statistics (CPU usage, RAM usage, disk I/O rate, etc.) of running guests.</li>
<li>GUI: Improved theme support on all platforms. Linux and macOS use native engine while for Windows host it is separately implemented.</li>
<li>Audio: Added "default" host driver type to make it possible to move VMs (appliances) between different platforms without the need of changing the audio driver explicitly. When the "default" driver is selected, the best audio backend option for a platform will be used. This is the default for newly created VMs.</li>

      <title>Fanatical running an awesome &#39;Dollar Collections&#39; sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to get some more really cheap games, as Fanatical have launched their <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100721639-13797872?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fcollections%2Fdollar-collections" target="_blank">Dollar Collections sale</a> and there's plenty of good choices in there to get you through the upcoming cold winter nights.</p>
<p>As the name suggests it means you can grab game bundles for $1 / £1 and plenty of them work on Linux and Steam Deck quite nicely too with a number of Steam Deck Verified / Playable games. The majority of them in this case would be run with Proton.</p>
<p>Here's what they have to pick from:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Walking Dead Season 1 &amp; 2 Complete Pack</li>
<li>Deponia Full Scrap Collection</li>
<li>Leisure Suit Larry Wet Dreams Double Pack</li>
<li>Commandos Collection Pack</li>
<li>Dungeons 2 - Complete Edition</li>
<li>Men of War: Collector Pack</li>
<li>Tropico 4 Collectors Bundle</li>
<li>POSTAL Paradise Pack</li>
<li>Sudden Strike Trilogy</li>
<li>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 1 &amp; 2!! Double Pack</li>
<li>Tropico 3: Gold Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly that The Walking Dead Season 1 &amp; 2 Complete Pack is a complete ridiculous steal for such a price. Don't miss out on that one. It even pushed me to finally pick it up to see what all the fuss is about as a fan of the TV series.</p>

      <title>The upgraded ivoler Steam Deck Docking Station is another good choice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't fancy buying from JSAUX and don't need the charger + extra expense of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">official Steam Deck Docking Station</a>? ivoler are another good choice.</p>
<p>They sent over their newer refreshed model, which has an aluminum casing compared with their original plastic one. It also now has gigabit ethernet, with the previous model not having ethernet at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15992466731665482944gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>The upgraded <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX Docking Station is great</a>, however the ethernet sticking out of the side really does annoy me. Here with ivoler, that's not a problem since it sits nicely at the back so I can position it around my desk or TV unit a lot easier. Honestly, that one change alone makes me like it ever so slightly more than the JSAUX offering. ivoler's choice design here just helps keep all the wires out of sight and out of mind.</p>
<p>Not the only major difference though. In terms of bulk, the ivoler version is slimmer and honestly just looks better but it is <em>slightly</em> longer but not by an amount that really makes any difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12942880241665483071gol1.jpeg"/><em>ivoler bottom, JSAUX top.</em></p>
<p>One other difference here and another improvement, is that the ivoler dock blocks none of the air intake on the back of the Steam Deck which JSAUX do. It's never been a problem for me with JSAUX as the intake pulls air in just fine but having the entire thing uncovered is obviously best and so ivoler wins again here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20396630201665483382gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>From the official specs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[One is Enough] ivoler 6-in-1 aluminum docking station for Steam Deck, equipped with 1000M Ethernet, an HDMI 4K@60Hz output, a PD 3.0 fast chargering port, and triple USB 3.0 port. USB-C power delivery port support 90W, which supports fast charging for steam deck and most mobile devices, also compatible with iPads and Android phones with USB-C ports. [❗Note: Charger, HDMI cable, not included.]</li>
<li>[4K@60Hz HDMI Output] The Steam Deck dock stand comes with a 4K@60Hz HDMI 2.0 output. Advanced built-in chips, plug and play, supports HDCP 1.4 to play protected content from iTunes / Netflix / DirectTV etc. When you connect an external 4K monitor (1080P), it can provide you sharper and smoother visual experience, so you can enjoy the visual feast on your games.</li>
<li>[Full Charging Speed for Steam Deck] ivoler Steam Deck docking station supports 100W Max power input and 90W Max power delivery, which is sufficient to charge your Steam Deck at full speed when paired with the original charger. [❗Note: the MAX charging speed of Steam Deck is 45W.]</li>
<li>[Portable &amp; Lightweight] This is A Perfect Combination for the Steam Deck. ivoler all-in-1 Steam Deck docking station blends Hub and stand together perfectly. You don't have to buy a regular hub and a stand base for your Steam Deck, which is not only easier for you to use, but also keeps your desktop neat and organized.</li>
<li>[Safe &amp; Reliable] ivoler USB C Hub block built-in safeguards protect your devices against excessive current, overheating, and overcharging. ivoler is a brand dedicated to providing customers with high quality product. When you encounter failure in use, please contact us, our customer service team will reply you and provide support within 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to say a whole lot about it without needlessly padding the article here. It's a Steam Deck Docking Station with a good price, good features and it just works.</p>
<p>I can happily recommend this one if you're after a Steam Deck Dock that works well, doesn't cost a fortune and has a good design as well. A no-frills Docking Station that just gets the job done and stays out of your way, what more could you want? You really can't go wrong with this and it quickly replaced the JSAUX dock on my own desk.</p>
<p>On pricing without discounts, it's the same as the upgraded JSAUX version at £49.99 / $49.99.</p>
<p>You can buy it easily on Amazon:</p>

      <title>Decky Loader, get easy Steam Deck Plugins and make colours POP!</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Did you know you can extend the Steam Deck with various plugins? I’m going to show you how to do it, and some of what’s available using <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>. This was mentioned by me <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steamos-plugin-manager-should-enable-lots-of-fun-on-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">some time ago</a> but it has come a very long way since then.</p>
<p>This allows you to browse, download and install plugins for the Steam Deck with an interface built into the Quick Access Menu (the three dot button on Steam Deck). In my video below, I'll show how to install it and demo a few of the plugins, with vibrantDeck being something quite amazing, at least to my eyes but it is not something everyone will like. The screen on the Deck really does look quite dull without using it now.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YQhvNiI3hKI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd93ae009c399252cc75e9e90d568082.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YQhvNiI3hKI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text Guide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the Steam Deck Settings.</li>
<li>Under System -&gt; System Settings toggle <code class="inline-code">Enable Developer Mode</code></li>
<li>Scroll the sidebar all the way down and click on <code class="inline-code">Developer</code></li>
<li>Under Miscellaneous, enable <code class="inline-code">CEF Remote Debugging</code></li>
<li>Confirm dialog and wait for system reboot</li>
<li>Click on the <code class="inline-code">STEAM</code> button and select <code class="inline-code">Power</code> -&gt; <code class="inline-code">Switch to Desktop</code></li>
<li>Make sure you have a password set with the "passwd" command in terminal to install it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vOMYGj22rQ" target="_blank">YouTube Guide</a>).<br/>
<em>It won't show a password being entered as a security measure but it is working.</em></li>
<li>Open a terminal ("Konsole" is the pre-installed terminal application) and paste the following command into it:
	<ul>
<li>For the latest release (recommended for all users):
		<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">curl -L https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/raw/main/dist/install_release.sh | sh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After that you can just boot into Gaming Mode, and the plugin menu will be available in the Quick Access Menu as shown in the video above. You can also turn off Developer Mode once it's installed, as I tested it working just fine.</p>

      <title>The new Steam Mobile App is getting close to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few updates later while in Beta and Valve has put out the first Release Candidate for their completely overhauled <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamMobileApp" target="_blank">Steam Mobile App</a>. Having a Release Candidate means they're very close to releasing it for everyone, it just needs a bit more testing to see if any urgent issues appear.</p>
<p>What's they've added recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved messaging when asking for camera permissions.</li>
<li>Fixed pull to refresh in the Library screen not refreshing everything.</li>
<li>Improved loading states in the Library screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when opening links externally.</li>
<li>Improved behavior of how the app attempts to open non-Steam links in your default device browser.</li>
<li>Fixed the ability to send multiple "Verify Code" actions when migrating / adding an authenticator, which would end up loading to failures.</li>
<li>Updated wishlist notifications to open up directly to the wishlisted app page rather than taking you to the wishlist.</li>
<li>Fix web content sometimes not refreshing properly when attempting to reload the same page multiple times.</li>
<li>Fixed some non-English languages not always correctly displaying numbers with decimal places.</li>
<li>Improved the reliability of sign in confirmation dialogs appearing.</li>
<li>Fixed case for certain users where approving a sign in confirmation would have no effect.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to try it out before release:</p>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<p>Open <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.valvesoftware.android.steam.community" target="_blank">this link</a> on your Android device. The Google Play store will offer you a link to join the beta and download the updated app.</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<p>Open <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/8BOPXsGz" target="_blank">this link</a> on your iOS device. You'll be prompted to install Apple's own TestFlight app. Once TestFlight is installed, it will automatically install the updated Steam Mobile App. Note: spaces on iOS are limited.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-37 is out now fixing up more games for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> (also known as Proton GE) as a community-built version of the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games, with a new release out now and FSR is back.</p>
<p>Versions 7-37 and 7-36 were released, initially removing AMD FSR being in it directly, but thankfully another community hacker sorted out the patches needed for it so it made a return.</p>
<p>Here's what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Import nvapi enablement list from proton upstream (<a class="commit-link" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/commit/9a708e02c18ea53386dddd13e7e1ae5c78615965" target="_blank">ValveSoftware@<tt>9a708e0</tt></a>)</li>
<li>Import media-converter changes from proton upstream (<a class="commit-link" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/commit/5339633f9b5e32eae24d43e4572792ba6791220d" target="_blank">ValveSoftware@<tt>5339633</tt></a>)</li>
<li>Update dxvk</li>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton</li>
<li>Update wine-bleeding edge</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Shatterline (thanks orowith2os)</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Halo Reach mod tools (thanks orowith2os)</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Ougon Musoukyoku (thanks namaenonaimumei)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This version is not included in Steam or Steam Deck, with you needing to add it yourself. It often includes fixes Valve hasn't yet done officially, and some things they can't (legally) do for videos. It does come with less quality assurance and testing though, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>How to use it? You can simply use the ProtonUp-Qt tool that we've covered here numerous times now. See the previous <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">GOL Guide on GE-Proton with ProtonUp</a>. </p>

      <title>There&#39;s now a dedicated website for Steam Deck boot videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Valve have made it official in the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steamos-332-and-a-stable-steam-deck-client-update-are-out-now-heres-whats-new/" target="_blank">Steam Deck stable update</a> to change your boot video, reddit user waylaidwanderer <a href="https://steamdeckrepo.com/" target="_blank">made a website</a> where you can easily upload and download these quick clips.</p>
<p>A nice idea, and certainly makes finding one you want a little easier. Useful too, since you can preview the video before you download to see if you will like them. It also includes dedicated instructions below each video, telling you exactly what you need to do to get it working which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Here's a look over some of the boot videos available and a reminder on how to do it:</p>

      <title>My current little wish-list for Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck has been out for a while, it's now easy to purchase <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">with no reservation queue</a>, and the long-delayed Steam Deck Docking Station is also here!  Valve has put out a lot of updates but there's plenty they could improve. Honestly, it's vastly different to how it felt at release.</p>
<p>After thinking on it for some time, plus gathering some inspiration from people in our <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">Discord</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, here's a current quick list of items I would like to see that i think would just make the Steam Deck better overall. All of these I think are perfectly doable. Obviously there's plenty i want from a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 2 which is basically confirmed</a> but what about for now through software updates?</p>
<p>Here's my little list:</p>
<p>A more customizable Home Screen. Let me put collections here, let me move things around and make it more "mine".</p>
<p>Customize the performance overlay. I already know it's possible because it uses MangoHud, which itself has plenty of things you can tweak on desktop Linux and it can be moved to different parts of the screen. The current monitor is great with the different levels you can switch to but let us move it to a different position at the very least, it covers up the UI on a lot of games in the top left.</p>
<p>Downloads with the <em>screen</em> off. The screen itself likely eats a fair amount of battery life, so it sure would be nice if we could have the screen off while downloads continue right? Maybe an option we can turn toggle for the power button to turn the screen off on one tap, with a double-tap being suspend? There's probably better ways to do it but it would be a real nice to have option. I know it's probably not possible to do downloads while suspended like other consoles do due to technical limitations, but that would be one for the Steam Deck 2 and so this feels like a nice small compromise.</p>
<p>More "official" apps that can be installed easily in Gaming Mode in the Non-Steam section of the Library. We know Valve can do it, they did it with Chrome. Let's get more in here! Netflix, Spotify and many more direct-apps. A proper music player would be great here too for your local collection.</p>
<p>Options to deal with the Shader Cache. Not only can it get rather large, being a problem for the 64GB model, it's also confusing for new users. There's posts on it constantly with people confused what's eating their drive space. Clean up the language on it, make it more visible for each game. Let people move it too.</p>
<p>Let us move the on-screen keyboard in Desktop Mode. A properly compact version would be great too, it just takes up far too much space.</p>
<p>More regular upgrades to the Plasma Desktop. It's pretty far behind right now, and likely will be again after the next major update drops. The KDE team put a huge amount of effort into upgrading the desktop experience, we should want in on that.</p>
<p>Steam Controller 2. I don't need to say any more do I? Well, the Docking Station is out now, there's many third-party docks and lots of people will be hooking up to a TV. Give us a good official controller!</p>
<p>Let us pick what the Deck boots into between Gaming Mode and Desktop Mode. I'm sure most people use it in Gaming Mode but the option for those of us using it often like a PC or keeping it docked, it could be really useful.</p>
<p>Even more attention on Deck Verified. It's good the system exists but it's far from perfect. Paladins, for example, is still listed as Steam Deck Playable, despite the anti-cheat breaking it quite a long time ago. How are things like this not picked up? Trust in Deck Verified is essential.</p>
<p>I'm sure you all have your own wishlist too. Let me know what you want to see in the comments.</p>

      <title>JSAUX wasted no time with a new Steam Deck Docking Station with DisplayPort</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Find the new official Steam Deck Docking Station too expensive? Perhaps you might like to take another look at JSAUX, as they've announced <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">another</a> upgraded Docking Station.</p>
<p>Blimey, they need to slow down a bit. I already have their previous normal Docking Stations, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">reviewed and found to be excellent</a>. Plus, I have the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/jsaux-announce-their-new-steam-deck-dock-with-an-m2-ssd-slot/" target="_blank">Docking Station with an M.2 SSD</a> slot here ready to review (delayed due to sickness on my end).</p>
<p>Now they've launched the Docking Station "HB0702", which brings with it DisplayPort 1.2 so it can more directly compete with Valve.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14719509131665223004gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>7-in-1 Docking Station for Steam Deck. Equipped with an HDMI 4K@60Hz output, a Gigabit LAN Ethernet input, a USB-C port for charging, three USB-A 3.1 ports, and a DP port, letting you explore a new way to play with Steam Deck.</li>
<li>It comes with a 4K@60Hz / 2K@120Hz HDMI 2.0 output When it's connected to an external 4K monitor, it provides a sharper and smoother visual experience, so you can enjoy the visual feast on your games.</li>
<li>Full charging speed for your Steam Deck. The JSAUX Steam Deck docking station supports 100W max. power delivery, which is enough power to charge your Steam Deck at full speed (45W) when paired with the original charger.</li>
<li>The JSAUX all-in-1 Steam Deck docking station blends hub and stands together perfectly, so you can keep your desktop neat and organized.</li>
<li>Support DP1.2, simultaneous connection of HDMI and DP port, two monitors can output 4K@60Hz at the same time, expand the screen and enjoy the ultimate gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The main difference here is the DisplayPort 1.2 addition and an extra $10 to the order price making it $59.99 (no charger included). You can <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">order it direct</a> but they also told me to expect it on Amazon in early to mid November like their previous dock.</p>
<p><em>I've been told one is being sent over to GOL for me to take a look.</em></p>

      <title>A few more picks from Steam Next Fest</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest</a> is in full swing, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-next-fest-october-2022-edition-is-live-now/" target="_blank">earlier this week</a> we put out some recommendations. Here are a few more games that run great via Proton on Linux to take a look at this month: Cosmoteer, Dredge, and Potionomics.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Cosmoteer</h5>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/799600/Cosmoteer_Starship_Architect__Commander/" target="_blank">Cosmoteer</a> is an open world spaceship constructor sandbox where you build a ship piece by piece then adventure about the galaxy to perform your usual slate of space jobs like mining, bounty hunting, and trading. This is my number one find from the Next Fest so far, and I've already had a lot of fun with it. It reminds me of playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies/" target="_blank">Space Pirates and Zombies</a> for the first time way back in 2011, but more relevant references for the gameplay would be <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/" target="_blank">Star Sector</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/335620/Star_Traders_Frontiers/" target="_blank">Star Trader: Frontiers</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/383840/Nimbatus__The_Space_Drone_Constructor/" target="_blank">Nimbatus</a>. The core mechanics for a fantastic game all are here without even touching on building a fleet or multiplayer, both of which will be included in the Early Access.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZwgC3-AeDOo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/517a2f2342c49a421728816976165745.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZwgC3-AeDOo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><small>A quick look at Cosmoteer</small></p>
<p>The demo does have a vicious performance bug on Proton but thankfully it's solved by changing your launch command to <code class="inline-code">%command% --cores 1</code>. Cosmoteer releases into Early Access at the end of October.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Dredge</h5>
<p>For you fishing minigame aficionados, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562430/DREDGE/" target="_blank">Dredge</a> is an exploration fishing game with a distinct style. I went in blind thinking it would be a cute time waster, so imagine my surprise in discovering Dredge appears instead to be a Lovecraftian horror game with fishing mechanics. The core loop is innocent enough: you undock from the village you start in and spend the day fishing and exploring the bay before selling your catch to upgrade your boat. It's not long, however, before the game reveals its horror aspirations - fishing in the dark raises your stress (think <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304650/SUNLESS_SEA/" target="_blank">Sunless Sea</a>), fish rot in your hold with unidentified disease, and pretty soon you start catching full-on Eldrich abominations in your fishing nets. It's also not clear what happened to the bay's previous fisherman. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><small><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9205836341665165604gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9205836341665165604gol1142.jpg"/></a>Dredge definitely sets a tone</small></p>
<p>Give this one bonus points if you enjoy 'inventory Tetris', as you can fiddle with your cargo to maximize the size of your haul. The deceptively cute graphics and simple gameplay paired with a darkening story and some grotesque 2D art made for an enjoyable state of discombobulation, and I'm curious how heavily the full game will lean into its horror elements.  Dredge ran flawlessly for me via Proton and there's a good couple hours of content in the demo. It's slated for a 2023 release.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Potionomics</h5>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874490/Potionomics/" target="_blank">Potionomics</a> you create and sell potions from a potion shop you inherit from your deceased uncle. Think the relationship-building <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a> meets the sales part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/" target="_blank">Moonlighter</a>. The game looks and performs fantastic via Proton, and there's a fun card game for the haggling process. The character design is, frankly, spectacular, and there's a fun mechanic whereby improving your relationship with characters via conversations/dates earns you new cards to use in the haggling minigame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><small><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19934541101665165833gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19934541101665165833gol1142.jpg"/></a>Selling a potion to Quinn, the village witch/hustler</small></p>
<p>There's far too much going on to call Potionomics a dating sim, but from the demo my guess is that building relationships will be the primary focus of the game rather than the shop simulation. One caveat here is that the demo is quite short (less than an hour) and has a lot of tutorialization, so it's hard to know how well the final product will come together. Potionomics releases on October 17, so we don't have long to wait before 'shipping for our protagonist and the the Public Relations Moth from the cover of this article.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's impossible to keep on top of everything with Steam Next Fest, so if anyone has dredged (sorry) the depths and come up with something special I'm curious to hear about it.</p>

      <title>The Undead are invading Prison Architect in the next expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prison Architect - Undead is the next expansion to the building and management sim, with things about to get spooky.</p>
<p>With it comes a new Graveyard Quick Room to make your compound a bit more spooky, however that comes with a legion of undead you need to deal with. Sounds like a bad idea to me. Prisoners can become infected, increasing the size of the horde and you need to find a way to deal with it all effectively. Call in bounty hunters, or turn everything into a weapon and deal with it yourself.</p>
<p>“Just in time for spooky season, Undead adds a mix of survival and horror to Prison Architect that will put Wardens’ management skills to the test,” says Gaz Wright, Game Director on Prison Architect at Double Eleven. “Grappling with the task of survival is no easy feat, as it introduces an extra layer of complexity and pressure to management gameplay. We hope our community will enjoy Undead just as much as we enjoyed creating it!”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Fm329o8wYtU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e5c395d51e156e2786fa174320bcde6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Fm329o8wYtU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Welcome the Graveyard - This brand new Quick Room satisfies your inmates’ needs for Freedom and Comfort, making them feel calmer for 12 hours. Be mindful when you add gravestones though, as they will easily interrupt this peaceful atmosphere…</li>
<li>The Rise of the Dead - In Undead, no one is safe. And there are many ways to become Infected. One inmate can get sick, some others can be bitten by an unfriendly undead, or again a bunch of infected inmates can rise (aka spawn) directly from the Graveyard. Wardens have no power over the Infected units, they will move and act independently in the prison until stopped. Inmates and guards can try and fight them off, but if they fail, they will join the deadly bunch!</li>
<li>Who You Gonna Call? Bounty Hunters! When things go south (because they will) and your prison can’t hold off the outbreak, call the Bounty Hunter Emergency Service: tough, trained bounty hunters will join your fight against the undead.</li>
<li>New Traps, Techniques, and Weapons - Desperate Times Call for Desperate (and creative) measures. Use Zombie chum to lure the undead, build a walled-off area and lock them inside, or steal that glorious chainsaw you’ve been eyeing for a while: everything is allowed to fight off the horde.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Prison Architect - Undead releases on October 11th.</p>

      <title>Facepunch put out a fresh statement on Rust for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/rust-for-steam-deck-linux-still-some-time-away/" target="_blank">I recently wrote</a> about how it's looking pretty unlikely that Rust will actually be supported on Steam Deck / Linux with Proton, and it's not looking any better right now.</p>
<p>Previously it was just comments from Facepunch Studios' Garry Newman on Twitter, with Newman trying to explain their thoughts on why it hasn't happened yet. Now, we have another and perhaps a bit more public / official answer with their latest official <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/the-lumberjack#EACandProton" target="_blank">news post</a> on the Rust website including a note at the bottom about it from Alistair McFarlane, the Producer at Facepunch, that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, we switched to EAC's new platform with the intention of providing support for the Steam Deck, and so far we haven't done that. So when is it coming?</p>
<p>Well, short answer is we don't know. We don't know if it is. When we discontinued linux support in 2019, one of the core reasons was how the cheating community was exploiting the Linux platform. That's not to say that cheating was super widespread on Linux, but it was safer for cheat developers. And that's not good in a game like Rust where a cheater can ruin weeks of hard work.</p>
<p>Enabling proton support would mean we're asking the EAC team to provide support for a whole other platform, which we fear would reduce their ability to support Windows - our main platform. We don't know whether we should enable one platform at the disadvantage of another.</p>
<p>The one thing we don't want to do is to enable Proton support to only discontinue it six months later. We don't want to encourage players to spend their money on a Deck to play Rust and then be in a position where we want to take that ability away.</p>
<p>For now, we're still weighing up the risks and will continue to explore options with EAC. Don't expect to see Proton support in the near future, but we hope to have it enabled someday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's basically the same story as what Newman explained. They don't wish to potentially open up Rust to more cheat developers again, where they don't seem to feel confident that EAC would be able to keep up with it on top of preventing the cheats on Windows too (which is obviously the main platform).</p>
<p>It is a genuine shame, since Rust is (while quite brutal) a great survival game and very popular. It's also interesting, because clearly they think that EAC don't provide all that great protection on Linux if they're that worried about what would happen again. While again, other games like Apex have it, they're very different games.</p>

      <title>The latest Godot Engine showreel is an impressive look at upcoming games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Every now and then the developers of <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, a cross-platform free and open source game engine, put together a showreel of what's made with it.</p>
<p>A new one is out now, and it really shows a nice diverse selection of games being created with it. Not only is it a great look at some existing and upcoming games but it's also a nice advert for what Godot can do. Hopefully over time even more developers will use it since it has fantastic Linux support, and no fees.</p>
<p>Here's the desktop / console Godot Engine showreel:</p>

      <title>No more Steam Deck reservation queue — buy it now, plus Docking Station available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is finally here. Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3276955672625890260" target="_blank">removed</a> the reservation queue for the Steam Deck, so you can buy it right now. Additionally, the Steam Deck Docking Station is also now available.</p>
<p>We've been seeing reports a lot recently about people being able to reserve a Steam Deck, and get an email within a week or even a few days. So the end of the reservation queue was very much expected. This is great news though, as hopefully people who were sitting on the fence will now just jump right in and order. Some might perhaps jump back to a queue, if they do get overwhelmed by orders though.</p>
<p>Along with the news, Valve revamped the <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/" target="_blank">Steam Deck website</a> as well, with a little celebration video of a Steam Deck with fireworks along with the prominent note on the Docking Station too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1647789851665078062gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1647789851665078062gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As a reminder, the Steam Deck comes in three editions: 64GB, 256GB and 512GB. The two bigger storage models have faster SSDs, and the top-end model has an anti-glare etched glass screen.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aRnZrSBK3R4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d10c59c6ff21ef778905b157099f3807.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aRnZrSBK3R4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: the original copy of the above video, featured the Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu in an apparent woops by Valve. They re-uploaded to remove it.</em></p>
<p>Since it's now much more readily available. Do you think there will be another surge in purchases? It's quite likely — I think there will be. We also had news recently from a KDE developer, that Valve had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">crossed the one million mark</a> in Steam Deck shipments. So things are going very well for Valve's latest hardware entry.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" target="_blank">Docking Station</a>, it also has a brand new flashy looking official page, which mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck™ Docking Station is designed to add extensibility to your gaming setup. Whether connecting your Steam Deck to your living room TV, setting up on your work desk, or charging on your night stand, the Dock is perfect for extending the places and ways you can use your Steam Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Not too big or too small, Docking Station is exactly the right size and shape to hold Steam Deck securely. From the right angle USB-C connector at exactly the right length, to the molded rubber seat to ensure there’s no scratching, the Dock was made for Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priced at £79 / $89 / €99, it's perhaps a little steep when compared with a number of readily available high-quality third-party docks on the market, however you can't really beat the first-party support we've come to see from Valve. Here's the main Steam Deck Docking Station Specifications: 3 x USB-A 3.1 Gen1 Ports, Gigabit Ethernet, 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x  HDMI 2.0, USB-C Power Delivery passthrough input (power supply included) and a 6" USB-C captive cable with low profile 90° connector to connect to the Deck.</p>
<p>Valve also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1578117908445933568" target="_blank">Tweet</a> to clarify some details in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>MST (multi-stream transport), enabling multi-monitor support.</li>
<li>DisplayPort 1.4 + HDMI, supports up to 1440p 120 hz, or 4k 60 hz.</li>
<li>FreeSync support • Easy firmware updates via Steam Deck.</li>
<li>45W Type C power supply.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5221147841665079324gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5221147841665079324gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image Credit - Valve</em></p>
<p>Their Docking Station will get upgrades too, and they said it might need a firmware update out of the box but updates will happen as easily as plugging your Deck in and following the instructions. When it comes to compatibility, Valve do include a note in the Docking Station FAQ you should be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Italic_3PSCE BB_Italic">Note: There is a known compatibility bug that we're still chasing down. With some LG displays, when the Docking Station is connected via HDMI, sleep / wake can result in visual noise. Another sleep/wake cycle or unplug/plug of the dock cable solves it. We're actively working on fixing this bug and there will be a software update once it's resolved.</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I've got the official Docking Station ordered now, so I'll let you know what I think when it arrives.</em></p>
<p>All good news for Linux Gaming as a whole too, since so much of what goes into the Steam Deck helps Linux as a platform. It's also my own personal choice on where to play my games now, because it's just so convenient.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, another big SteamOS and Steam Deck Stable Client update went live as well. Here's a look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gv2-9Kah_Ig"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0186ef8852930f57071acee2c046d52b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gv2-9Kah_Ig" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Finally, I’ll end this with a plea to Valve. Please make a new Steam Controller. Don’t make me beg. You've clearly learned a lot with the Deck, I bet a Steam Controller 2 would be awesome. Do it.</p>

      <title>Cassette Beasts is a wonderful take on monster catching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It needs to hurry up and be 2023 so I can play the full game of Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster catching / creature collection game from Bytten Studio and RawFury. Coming with full Native Linux support built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's easily one of my biggest highlights from the ongoing Steam Next Fest, where it has a rather great demo available to play right now.</p>
<p>Playing this, I felt a little like a kid again, bringing back some really fond memories of the early Pokemon games. The great twist here is that you're pretty much making a bootleg copy of the creatures you encounter, using retro cassette tapes. Ah, memories coming flashing back of recording off the radio onto tape when I was younger. Heck, the game even has special bootleg creatures to find too!</p>
<p>Here's a little footage for you:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nvFFfKUJhTo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/875254250d2595ad25f9e5bc00ba08da.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nvFFfKUJhTo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really quite fantastic. Can't wait to see more of this and fuse various creatures together to form some kind of completely unholy thing that can take down anyone. You really don't want to miss out on trying this.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?!</strong><br/>
	Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li><strong>Fuse monster forms!</strong><br/>
	Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li><strong>Explore a rich open world</strong><br/>
	Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li><strong>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions</strong><br/>
	Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li><strong>Master a deep battle system</strong><br/>
	Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dead Cells now has a Boss Rush mode if you like pain</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love pain? Want to make your life difficult? Good news for you then as Dead Cells now has a fresh upgrade out with a Boss Rush mode so you can sweat against the toughest.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, it lets you fight the various bigger creatures in the game. To access it there's a basement door in the Prisoner's Quarters, where you can also access the Training Room and the Tailor. Just keep going until the third door with the red boss head and go inside. This will give you another 4 doors for 4 different stages split across:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>3 bosses back-to-back</li>
<li>3 enhanced bosses back-to-back</li>
<li>5 bosses back-to-back</li>
<li>5 enhanced bosses back-to-back</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The "enhanced" bosses have been given "even more ways to kick your ass" the developer said, so "extra limbs, healing powers, buddies to help them kill you - all the good stuff!". Oh goodie.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bAEt_uWf5Es"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6b623583b3013f1ac72c05f17eb44c9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bAEt_uWf5Es" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You even get a fancy statue, which you unlock parts for as you progress through the Boss Rush. There's also these new bits added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Ranged Weapon: Glyphs of Peril</strong> - The lower your health, the more attacks this weapon has in its combo (up to 7 hits). Crits from the third hit onwards.</li>
<li><strong>New Skill: Taunt</strong> - Enrage the enemy right in front of you, causing them to attack and move quicker, but also take more melee damage.</li>
<li><strong>New Mutation: Wish</strong>- Wish for a great item and you'll get it! The next one you pick will be upgraded to Legendary quality. Only one use, and this mutation get locked in your loadout once it triggers, though.</li>
<li><strong>8 new Outfits</strong>, unlocked through the <strong>Boss Rush.</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Formula Retro Racing - World Tour is a fresh upcoming low-poly racer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your classic racing games with low-poly visuals? Keep an eye on Formula Retro Racing - World Tour which releases next year and has a demo available along with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>"A retro racer updated for the modern age, Formula Retro Racing: World Tour fuses the pick-up-and-play simplicity of 90s-style arcade racing with realistic physics, split-screen multiplayer, and 60fps performance.

You'll race through iconic global locations, compete against other drivers, and try to beat your own lap times. Do you have what it takes to master each racing line, hug every apex, and cross the checkered flag to victory?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Jz4K2Q_fMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/097f830a6869459040a9a1afd52a0f96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Jz4K2Q_fMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>We don't actually get too many quality racers like this. Only really Horizon Chase Turbo jumps out from recent memory, as a properly good one. Nice to see more!</p>

      <title>RimWorld - Biotech expansion announced and a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld is set to get even bigger with the upcoming Biotech expansion that releases in a few weeks, along with a major free update for all players.</p>
<p>The expansion <a href="https://ludeon.com/blog/2022/10/biotech-expansion-announced-update-1-4-on-unstable-branch/" target="_blank">sounds pretty wild</a>, mixing in some huge new features that will change the way you play the game and grow your colonies. For starters, you will now be able to have babies. People can do it naturally, or have a baby via technological means. Naturally, it will come with a set of challenges with keeping them safe and happy and as they develop you will get to pick which traits and passions a child will develop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17694511641665053276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17694511641665053276gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21115759251665053274gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21115759251665053274gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another big addition is The Mechanitor, allow you to turn your colonists into people with special brain implants letting them command semi-living machines. Sounds pretty wild. You'll grow them and command various types and be able to grow a whole swarm of them or turn them into "fearsome squadron of massive ultratech war machines and industrial behemoths".</p>
<p>This new tech comes with its own price attached of course including pollution, that seems to twist the creatures and environment if left unchecked.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4644073151665053578gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4644073151665053578gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7157385771665053580gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7157385771665053580gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that the Biotech expansion will also let you do some gene-editing, so you can modify your people and turn them into xenohumans with special exotic traits. These range from "subtle personality traits and eye color to hulking furry bodies, glands for fire-breathing, rapid regeneration, and even immortality". Sounds like you're going to need to watch out for new factions using it too.</p>
<p>A big free update with version 1.4 will be releasing as well containing lots of big improvements like</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup performance improvements.</li>
<li>Painting and color customization for walls, floors, furniture, and lights.</li>
<li>Actually useful shelves that store lots of stuff.</li>
<li>Two new turret types.</li>
<li>Starting possessions for some colonists.</li>
<li>Rot stink from corpses.</li>
<li>New mod manager UI.</li>
<li>New options menu.</li>
<li>Heat overlay.</li>
<li>Quest search bar.</li>
<li>Tile inspector.</li>
<li>+ More</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy RimWorld for Linux from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rimworld?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/rimworld?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamOS 3.3.2 and a Steam Deck Client Update are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014486703380" target="_blank">out now</a>, pulling together all the recent Beta / Preview updates and putting them out for everyone. Here's what's new.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's a video going over the changes with a little look at some of them individually and below will be the full changelog:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gv2-9Kah_Ig"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0186ef8852930f57071acee2c046d52b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gv2-9Kah_Ig" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the main SteamOS 3.3.2 changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>Docked Mode</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Added external display output resolution and refresh rate selection UI in Display Settings</li>
<li>Automatically avoid problematic resolutions like 4096x2160 or 30Hz modes on external displays</li>
<li>Improved external display hot-plug detection</li>
<li>Fixed in-game camera control issues when using a physical mouse</li>
<li>Fixed aspect ratio and resolution not properly switching in the Steam UI after reconnecting an external monitor</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where frames could drop on external displays at lower refresh rates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>General</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
<li>Improved frame pacing when compositing (such as when FSR is enabled)</li>
<li>Improved touch / de-touch detection speeds</li>
<li>Modified USB descriptors to support controller navigation in EFI menu at boot</li>
<li>Fixed controller firmware update applying on every boot</li>
<li>Fixed a scenario where an SD Card format operation could fail</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where small touches would be ignored on edges of some trackpads</li>
<li>Fixed unsolicited random haptic events</li>
<li>Fixed boot tone volume to be equalized across models</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the Steam Client changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>General</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Performance improvements when rendering the homescreen</li>
<li>Chat textboxes are now auto-focused when opening the chat tab</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where cloud sync would be attempted while offline</li>
<li>Fixed issue with startup haptics</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>Docked Mode</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Added a toggle allowing Steam Deck to automatically control the display resolution for external displays. When toggled on, Steam Deck will automatically adjust the resolution for best performance on higher resolution displays.</li>
<li>Steam Deck now keeps track of refresh rate and FPS limit settings independently for internal and external displays</li>
<li>Disabled refresh rate switching via the quick access menu for external displays by default. Alternative refresh rates are still accessible via the resolution dropdown in Settings-&gt;Display.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to developer settings to re-enable refresh rate switching in the quick access menu for external displays. (Please note that the Steam Deck’s built-in display was validated to support the full range of refresh rates available in the slider, but for arbitrary external displays we can't provide a guarantee that the resolution + refresh rate combination will be functional. This can lead to a scenario where the external display doesn’t display an image, so there isn’t an easy way to undo the change. Here be dragons, we don't recommend turning this setting on.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Controller configurations now automatically switch to be per-device when multiple of the same controller are connected at once</li>
<li>Virtual menu previews in the Configurator now highlight the appropriate button when navigating to its associated command in the command list</li>
<li>Reduced occurrence of double-activations on Soft Press on Touch Pads and Sticks.</li>
<li>Fixed scaling of the virtual hotbar menu preview in the Configurator</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where "Disabled" would be listed multiple times the dropdown options for modes</li>
<li>Fix an issue where booting into offline mode in desktop would result in unresponsive controller inputs until the "stay offline" dialog was clicked.</li>
<li>Fix an issue with setting command settings inside a modeshift</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where switching the active controller in the configurator could lose unsaved changes</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with editing the mode settings for an input (e.g. joystick)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when setting a trigger input to "Disabled" in an action set layer</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when loading some Steam Input configs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>Steam Input: FlickStick</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Reduced update rate from 240hz to 120hz to reduce instances of maxed out mouse movement between game frames</li>
<li>Added a "Slap Back" check so that the stick does not accidentally invoke an opposite-side turn when snapping home aggressively</li>
<li>Any remaining Snap Angle is doled as the stick returns to zero. This further reduces "mouse movement spikes"</li>
<li>Tweaked Inner Radius Default to be lower</li>
<li>Fixed Dampening Value not being used with the correct ranges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>Custom boot videos</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck will now look for a custom boot video and/or a suspend animation in ~/.steam/root/config/uioverrides/movies/</li>
<li>Please note that you'll need to create this folder first</li>
<li>You’ll need webm file format, no need to truncate the video, no need to mess with css</li>
<li>Play custom boot animations in full screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Go tell Bungie you want Destiny 2 on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Destiny 2 is one of the biggest and most popular shooters around and sadly it doesn't work on Steam Deck / Linux. Now is your chance to give your say and <em>maybe</em> Bungie will listen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/bungie-say-a-big-fat-no-to-proton-and-steam-deck-for-destiny-2/" target="_blank">A little while ago</a> I wrote about how Bungie had given Steam Deck a pretty firm nope, and sadly the situation simply hasn't changed since then. They took notice of people requesting it, and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/bungie-has-more-to-say-on-destiny-2-for-steam-deck-and-its-still-a-no/" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> where they once again gave us a pretty firm nope.</p>
<p>Now, there's a dedicated place on the Destiny 2 Reddit where you can give your feedback on it. This comes in the form of what they call a <em>Focused Feedback</em> post titled "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/xuonok/focused_feedback_linux_and_alternative_platform/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Focused Feedback: Linux and Alternative Platform Support</a>". Writing about why the post was made, a Destiny 2 Reddit moderator noted in a comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some additional context on why this was selected as a Focused Feedback topic, despite lack of recent popular threads about it, posts discussing official support for Destiny 2 on Proton (read: Steam Deck) have been automodded to Bungie's official stance on the matter (listed below) for a while now because - until very recently - there was nothing to discuss besides people expressing that they wanted Proton support and/or whether or not Bungie's rationale for the Proton prohibition is valid.</p>
<p>Given that, in the past week, we've had the announcement of Stadia's planned demise AND a Destiny 2 team lead expressing their love for Steam Deck as a <strong>hardware</strong> choice for playing Destiny 2 (they were playing D2 on Steam Deck in a manner which is allowed by Terms of Service), there is renewed public interest in the discussion and the decision was made to make it this week's Focused Feedback topic. This way, the discussion can be had and Bungie is provided with fresh, organized feedback on this issue from the DestinyReddit community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their comment about the Destiny 2 developer enjoying the Steam Deck is probably <a href="https://twitter.com/tomfromtheweb/status/1576790234200649728" target="_blank">this post</a> from Tom Farnsworth, the Senior Design Lead at Bungie, who had to use Moonlight to stream it from a PC to their Steam Deck. <em>Sure would be nice if we didn't have to do things like that huh?</em></p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck is doing so well (like apparently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">shipping over a million now</a>), players shouldn't need to resort to installing a different operating system or streaming from a PC to play their favourite games. Hopefully more developers, like Bungie, will start to take notice if the player base on Steam Deck continues growing.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/xuonok/focused_feedback_linux_and_alternative_platform/" target="_blank">the Reddit Post</a> to give your say.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to play Overwatch 2 on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While you might struggle to get in due to ongoing server issues, Overwatch 2 is out now free to play and it can run quite nicely on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Here's how to get Overwatch 2 installed and running. Since it's not available officially for Linux, we're going to be using the Wine compatibility layer for this, along with help from the <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> app.</p>
<p>First up is the video guide which walks through each step, plus some gameplay:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QsWL0mqFxgE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a51491de3e7ec26d14dae9481aecaa8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QsWL0mqFxgE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text Guide:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>. On Steam Deck be in Desktop Mode where it's found in the Discover app.</li>
<li>Load it up and create a new Bottle for Gaming.</li>
<li>In the main Bottles settings, go to Runners and download Caffe.</li>
<li>Go inside the Bottle you created (click it).</li>
<li>Head to preferences, scroll down to System and change the Runner to Caffe.</li>
<li>Go to the Installers section, install Battle.net.</li>
<li>For Steam Deck: when finished installing Battle.net and Overwatch, you can add Bottles to Steam to launch in Gaming Mode via the big "Add A Game" button on the bottom left of the Steam window. <em>Bottles has it's own add to Steam ability, but for me it didn't work.</em></li>
<li>It can then be found in the Non-Steam section of your Library in Gaming Mode.</li>
<li>After launching Bottles when in Gaming Mode, you can hold down the Steam button and use the right thumbpad / right thumbstick to move the mouse and right trigger for left mouse button by default so you can leave Steam Input as a gamepad. Makes it easy to click buttons in launchers while keeping gamepad for in-game.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>That's pretty much all there is to it. Performance will be really quite bad until the shaders compile though, just be patient with it and after a good while it will sort itself out quite nicely. I wouldn't recommend doing any Ranked gameplay until you've put a good few hours into each map so a lot of the shaders will be sorted.</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included has a new animated short, plus a &#39;Story Trait System&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Klei are back with a brand new big update to Oxygen Not Included, after they decided <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-more-dlc-for-oxygen-not-included-devs-decide-to-do-free-updates-instead/" target="_blank">not to do</a> any more paid DLC so this is the first of many free updates to come. Plus a fancy new animated short.</p>
<p>With the new release they added in a "Story Trait System", which gives you a collection of interactive POIs (point of interest) burief inside the asteroids to find. The first two are: the Somnium Synthesizer harnesses the power of Duplicants’ subconscious minds by unlocking their ability to dream for the very first time, while the Critter Flux-O-Matic offers a new way to roll the dice on critter morph outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally there's a new Kitchen room, with a Spice Grinder to enhance food. Plus some additions for people who own the Spaced Out DLC.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7cK5oB3CM1k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9649fbb338da6ddea7744ba45960b2b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7cK5oB3CM1k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>All versions</div>
<ul>
<li>Added Story Traits system and UI
	<ul>
<li>Added Somnium Synthesizer story trait</li>
<li>Added Critter Flux-O-Matic story trait</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Kitchen room type</li>
<li>Added Spice Grinder building (Freshener Spice recipe, Brawny Spice recipe, Machinist Spice recipe)</li>
<li>Enabled renaming rockets</li>
<li>Fixed a number of Transit Tube bugs</li>
</ul>
<div>Spaced Out! only</div>
<ul>
<li>Added Smog Slug and Spong Slug critter morphs</li>
<li>Added Rocketeer Spice recipe to Spice Grinder</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently they also put up a roadmap which sounds quite exciting. Klei are planning to add in expanded surface gameplay tools and content, various quality of life updates to make playing it smoother, various new room types like "Laboratory, Mission Control Room, better bedrooms" along with bigger additions like new biomes, expanded world generation options and more. A cosmetic system like in Don't Starve Together is also in the works, which they hope will help fund more free updates instead of DLC.</p>
<p>You can buy Oxygen Not Included on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta updates fix Red Dead Redemption 2 and external screen changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Beta updates have landed for the Steam Deck with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014484230244" target="_blank">Client</a> and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014483383230" target="_blank">OS</a> update available, with some pretty big changes to how external screens are handled.</p>
<p>Available in the Beta and Preview channels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>External display settings</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of refresh rate and FPS limit settings independently for internal and external displays.</li>
<li>Disable refresh rate switching via the quick access menu for external displays by default. Alternative refresh rates are still accessible via the resolution dropdown in Settings-&gt;Display.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to developer settings to re-enable refresh rate switching in the quick access menu for external displays. Please note that the Steam Deck’s built-in display was validated to support the full range of refresh rates available in the slider, but for arbitrary external displays we can't provide a guarantee that the resolution + refresh rate combination will be functional. This can lead to a scenario where the external display doesn’t display an image, so there isn’t an easy way to undo the change. Here be dragons, we don't recommend turning this setting on.</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance improvements when rendering the homescreen.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when loading some SteamInput configs.</li>
<li>Reduced occurrence of double-activations on Soft Press on Touch Pads and Sticks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also available only in the Preview channel as it's an OS upgrade:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
<li>Improved external display hot-plug detection</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a run over the changes and a quick look in a video. For this I tested a good while of Red Dead Redemption 2 to ensure it really was fixed and not only does it run smoothly, there's no crashing now either.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2938304481664901868gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2938304481664901868gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17432124941664901867gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17432124941664901867gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>"Streets of Rogue 2 is a procedurally generated open-world game about player choice, freedom, and anarchic fun. The game takes inspiration from open-world and crafting/survival titles ranging from Skyrim to GTA to Valheim to Stardew Valley, with an emphasis on streamlined and fast-paced gameplay. It also adds the free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent elements of RPGs like Deus Ex to create a true sandbox experience."</p>

      <title>NVK is a new open source Mesa Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jason Ekstrand of Collabora just <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-nvk.html" target="_blank">announced</a> NVK, a brand new open source Mesa Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs. No you're not dreaming but it's also not from NVIDIA directly — as usual the open source community is doing the work.</p>
<p>It's still early-ish days for NVK but what they've been able to do with it so far sounds reasonably promising. The current nouveau drivers for NVIDIA in Mesa aren't going to be removed but they don't exactly work well, and a lot of it was done coding in the dark with reverse engineering.</p>
<p>Things have come a long way though, with NVIDIA gradually releasing more documentation and recently their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">open source Linux GPU kernel modules</a>.</p>
<p>NVK itself was written "almost entirely from scratch using the new official headers from NVIDIA" over the last several months targeting Turing+. Ekstrand has some pretty high goals for it, like wanting it to become "the new reference Vulkan driver within Mesa" and so they're "building NVK with all the best practices we've developed for Vulkan drivers over the last 7.5 years and trying to keep the code-base clean and well-organized".</p>
<p>This is a serious effort to get a good open source driver for NVIDIA GPUs and that sounds awesome. Eventually it could become "what RADV is to AMD hardware" but there's a lot of work to get there.</p>
<p>As for OpenGL support, they might even end up using the Zink driver (an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan), instead of writing a whole new OpenGL driver to go along with it. Zink has come a long way too so it could be a pretty good plan.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-nvk.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> for all the info.</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper is a nice twist on base / tower defense</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together elements of survival, mining, exploration and tower defense — Dome Keeper is worth your attention. Note: key provided by the developer to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Here you're defending your little Dome against an onslaught of monsters. Mixing between tower defense with waves of enemies, with your time in between waves dedicated to mining down below the surface for resources so you can upgrade everything you possibly can to survive just a little longer. Do you rush to get back before the monsters arrive, as you keep your watchful eye on the timer or do you let it get a small beating because you've struck gold with resources or something special?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WOYP2luxudY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b65583ab5ad4170643255cf0f774f7c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WOYP2luxudY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even though you're constantly facing off against the timer, it doesn't feel frantic. It's a surprisingly chilled game half the time and i think that's a big part of why I like it. Action where it needs to be but a nice mixture of gameplay with the exploration mining below the surface.</p>
<p>Perhaps a little bit light on content overall, with the vast majority of your time spent digging or just shooting monsters from your dome but for what it is — a lot of fun. The basic idea they have is perfectly formed here and for those who just like to chill out with their games, it's an easy pick up and play experience. The developer seems to have plans to keep expanding it too so I'm genuinely quite excited to see what else they add into it.</p>
<p>According to the publisher, RawFury (<a href="https://twitter.com/jantonsson/status/1575863051085090819" target="_blank">Twitter</a>), it's done well too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dome Keeper became profitable a few hours after launch &amp; grossed $1 mil soon after! With over 7K games launched on Steam this yr, this result is far from given, but shows what can happen when an amazing game, made by a world class developer gets the support to make full impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A happy recommendation for desktop Linux and Steam Deck as it plays fantastically on both.</p>
<p>You can pick it up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dome_keeper" target="_blank">GOG</a> ("soon") and right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Wine manager app Bottles gets some drag and drop fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> is the awesome free and open source app to help you manage the Windows compatibility layer Wine. A fresh release is out now with version 2022.9.28 (yes I'm a few days late).</p>
<p>With Bottles, you can easily install the likes of Battle.net, EA Launcher, Origin, GOG Galaxy and more with a growing list of easy installers. Plus you can just throw in whatever Windows apps / games you need. It's just a nice tidy way to keep it all together.</p>
<p>My favourite new feature is easily their new drag and drop implementation for running things, allowing you to throw a file on top of the window when you have a configured Bottle open to then run it inside it. In other words, you have a Wine Bottle created, then you drag and drop a Windows game / app installer inside — neat!</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16485691741664898563gol1.mp4"> </video>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Video Credit - Bottles Team</em></p>
<p>Display Settings also now have their own dedicated dialog, which looks a bit cleaner and keeps things a bit more focused for when you're tweaking various options. Like virtual desktop resolution not appearing unless the setting is actually turned on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1494547201664898712gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1494547201664898712gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Their work on the UI is great and they've continued cleaning it up in other places too, along with their continued work to have Bottles use the full power of the latest generation of GTK4 and libadwaita for designing interfaces. When tweaking your Gamescope settings, they've also adjusted the dialog to "be more intuitive and self-introducing". Plus lots more.</p>
<p>The main highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia-specific settings are now hidden on other setups.</li>
<li>Run executables by dropping them on the bottle.</li>
<li>Move from XML to Blueprints for UI.</li>
<li>Mobile improvements.</li>
<li>The Gamescope dialog is now more polished and intuitive.</li>
<li>Display settings has now a dedicated dialog.</li>
<li>All selectors are ported to the libadwaita.</li>
<li>Support for ja_JP,zh_TW,ko_KR languages.</li>
<li>Dependencies with an incompatible architecture are now hidden.</li>
<li>Support for the bundled gstreamer version if provided by the runner.</li>
<li>Adding a new program will be immediately available, without having to update the whole list.</li>
<li>Removed the ability to install multiple dependencies in one go.</li>
<li>Improve wording for Components section.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Gamepad driver and app &#39;SC Controller&#39; gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller" target="_blank">SC Controller</a>, what originally started as an application to control the Steam Controller outside of Steam and expanded to cover more gamepads now has a <a href="https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller/releases/tag/v0.4.10-pre" target="_blank">pre-release</a> up with Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>This means you can control the Steam Deck gamepad, Steam Controller, PlayStation, 8bitdo and many others without the need for Steam Input — for whatever reason you can think of.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1287182001664881388gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1287182001664881388gol1.png"/></a>I enjoy that classic Steam skin a bit too much.</em></p>
<p>While it's a pre-release meaning it needs more testing, it does appear to work quite nicely including flawless switching between SC Controller handling inputs and turning it off to see Steam Input then take over again. I've no doubt plenty of people will make use of this.</p>
<p>The app features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allows to setup, configure and use Steam Controller(s) (and others) without ever launching Steam</li>
<li>Supports profiles switchable in GUI or with controller button</li>
<li>Stick, Pads and Gyroscope input</li>
<li>Haptic Feedback and in-game Rumble support</li>
<li>OSD, Menus, On-Screen Keyboard for desktop <em>and</em> in games.</li>
<li>Automatic profile switching based on active window.</li>
<li>Macros, button cycling, rapid fire, modeshift, mouse regions...</li>
<li>Emulates Xbox360 controller, mouse, trackball and keyboard.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve makes Steam Deck custom boot screens easier (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 5/10/22</strong>: in a later <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014486735948" target="_blank">Beta update</a>, Valve <em>changed</em> the folders for custom videos so it's now:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.steam/root/config/uioverrides/movies/ </code></p>
<p>If you don't have .steam for whatever reason it's:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.local/share/Steam/config/uioverrides/movies/</code></p>
<p>You still need to make the extra folders yourself.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Valve just released a fresh Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014480099879" target="_blank">update</a> for the Steam Deck, as they loved seeing all the custom boot screens so much they've now made it officially supported. This is currently available in the Beta and Preview channels you can swap over to by going into Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Yes, that's right, a hardware vendor just changed their software to let you officially override their bootup and suspend animations. What a time to be alive. Covered by me <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/custom-boot-animations-for-the-steam-deck-are-pretty-sweet/" target="_blank">with a guide before</a>, it's now easier than ever and with less steps needed.</p>
<p>From their changelog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been great to see all the community activity around custom boot videos, so we made a couple updates to make this a bit easier to do. The new folder location below will be a safer place to save your video files, and they won't be wiped with every Steam update.</p>
<p>Custom boot videos</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck will now look for custom boot and suspend animations in steamui/overrides/movies/. Please note that you'll need to create this folder first.</li>
<li>Play custom boot animations in full screen</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with startup haptics</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolution: applies to Preview Channel only</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a toggle allowing Steam Deck to automatically control the display resolution for external displays. When toggled on, Steam Deck will automatically adjust the resolution for best performance on higher resolution displays.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So really all you need to do is make the folder "overrides" and inside it a folder "movies" so it ends up as:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.local/share/Steam/steamui/overrides/movies</code></p>
<p>Then put your custom movie files in that match the names of what Valve use. Then it's done and in my own testing it does work. I especially like the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xs3jzn/my_handheld_history_ultimate_edition_boot_video/" target="_blank">handheld history</a> animation from Redditor TareXmd shown in the below quick video:</p>

      <title>KDE devs talk Steam Deck and their work for it at Akademy 2022, over a million shipped</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently at the <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2022/" target="_blank">Akademy 2022</a> conference, KDE's David Edmundson gave a talk on the Steam Deck and the ongoing work in KDE to improve things.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, the Steam Deck is a full Linux PC and includes a full KDE Plasma desktop mode you can use for whatever you want as well. Thanks to that, the KDE team have been working on improvements (with plenty already done) to make it a better experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://conf.kde.org/event/4/contributions/94/" target="_blank">talk description</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Steamdeck is one of the most interesting and excitement big deployments of KDE in recent times.</p>
<p>In this talk I will share how Plasma fits into the Steamdeck and what aspects of KDE made us the right choice for their new userbase. I will then share some of the projects that contractors Blue Systems have been doing for Valve and how the work there benefits not just the Steamdeck but improves the ecosystem for all Plasma users.</p>
<p>Finally we look at what this could mean for KDE on the whole as more vendors gain the same confidence in Plasma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always interesting to hear what's being done and it seems quite a lot. Various changes were done for Valve including startup performance improvements, a robust systemd managed boot, microphone volume indicators, improving resource visualization and system monitors, big improvements to system settings, firewall configuration and much more.</p>
<p>Here's the full clip:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a0gEIeFgDX0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3cbb54553096fa977869f6732f23336d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a0gEIeFgDX0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Perhaps the biggest bit of info coming out of this is that according to Edmundson, Valve has shipped over a <strong>million</strong>.  At about 29:45 in the above video in response to a question on it Edmundson said "They have crossed over a million, and they're still processing back orders". Valve haven't actually given out any numbers in public on it yet and Edmundson was not speaking for Valve but still, the answer was pretty confident and clear.</p>

      <title>AMD driver update gets Red Dead Redemption 2 working better on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you having issues with Red Dead Redemption 2 on either the Steam Deck or a Linux desktop with an AMD GPU? Well, upcoming driver updates should improve it. While there was an update in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/proton-experimental-fixes-up-red-dead-redemption-2-gets-more-games-working/" target="_blank">Proton Experimental recently</a> that fixed the game not actually running after the FSR2 upgrade, it seems there's still problems with it <em>crashing</em> after a little while.</p>
<p>Looks like it's possible that will be solved as well soon though! <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/18884" target="_blank">An update</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/RADV-RDR2-APU-Fix" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>) was recently merged into the Mesa drivers for RADV (the AMD Vulkan Driver) that enabled a "unified heap on APUs for Red Dead Redemption 2". This came from developer Samuel Pitoiset (Valve) and inside the request it mentioned how it "Fixes memory explosion with RDR2 without hurting performance as my previous attempt did.".</p>
<p>So with Mesa 22.3 that's due in November it should be a much nicer experience. However, for Steam Deck specifically, Valve might just pull in the change and have it up in a Beta update as I imagine they want a high profile game like this to be sorted quickly.</p>

      <title>SteamOS and Steam Deck on top for Linux in the Steam Hardware Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">September 2022</a>, with it showing that clearly the Steam Deck with SteamOS is the most popular way now to game on Linux.</p>
<p>With the latest numbers though, there is a dip in the overall Linux user share with it now at <strong>1.23%</strong>. A drop overall of 0.04 percentage points which some may attribute to just noise but that's what the survey says. Historical data can be found on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a> like the below graph snapshot:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10291899971664799503gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10291899971664799503gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As for the most popular Linux distributions, it's now pretty clear that SteamOS is on top:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 17.04% +3.35%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 12.48% +4.28%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.57% -0.32%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 7.80% -1.13%</li>
<li>Flatpak runtime 64 bit (multi-distro) 4.81% +4.81%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.31% -0.15%</li>
<li>Other 42.99% +5.10%</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure some will argue about <em>combining</em> distributions together, like Arch and Manjaro that would put them on top but really they're quite different. Just like how SteamOS has its own update schedule, so does Manjaro they're just based-on Arch. A bit different for Pop and Ubuntu, which share the same base directly.</p>
<p>As for devices, Steam Deck is clearly top for Linux with it's GPU being used by 17.07% putting it at the top for Linux players. That's an +3.35% increase compared with last month too, so the lead is only continuing to grow. Once again though, it's still not even showing up in the Windows stats meaning very few overall people are using Windows on the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updates fix up Indiana Jones, Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has recently put up a fresh update for Proton Experimental, bringing more game compatibility and some fixes. The update was released on September 30th.</p>
<p>Here's what games are newly supported with Proton Experimental:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pico Park Classic Edition.</li>
<li>Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind.</li>
<li>Darkstar One.</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Emperor Tomb.</li>
<li>Crazy Machines 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus some dedicated fixes landed including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) having no audio.</li>
<li>Fix Return to Monkey Island not reacting to mouse clicks after a recent game update.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly, Valve set Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) as Steam Deck Verified in February and remained so up until the end of August, where they finally noticed some long-standing audio problems that required a really old version of Proton 4 but that still had some issues. At least now they've dropped the rating down to Playable. Nice to see it getting some attention here.</p>
<p>Changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how to actually use Proton Experimental and a run over the above in video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ocBSyslp3q4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54e48a631c1ac191c04f81636c2cef65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ocBSyslp3q4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility menu on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't have Proton Experimental installed, it's available in your Steam Library the same as any other game and app.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver 515.49.19 is out now, driver 515.76 causing problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have done another new release to their developer-focused Vulkan Beta driver with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">515.49.19</a> out now. <em>This is completely separate to their main driver series.</em></p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3</a> support for the following dynamic states:

		<ul>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_CLAMP_ENABLE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_POLYGON_MODE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LOGIC_OP_ENABLE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_BLEND_ENABLE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_BLEND_EQUATION_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_WRITE_MASK_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_CLIP_ENABLE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_BLEND_ADVANCED_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_PROVOKING_VERTEX_MODE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_RASTERIZATION_MODE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_STIPPLE_ENABLE_EXT</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What does VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 do? This extension adds almost all of the remaining pipeline state as dynamic state to help applications further reduce the number of monolithic pipelines they need to create and bind.</p>
<p>More changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Provisional Vulkan video extension updates:
		<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_video_queue: 6 -&gt; 7</li>
<li>Note: these changes are not backwards compatible with the old revisions so applications using the old revisions will need to be updated to continue working</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed regression with mesh shader queries</li>
<li>Updated OpEmitMeshTasksEXT to be interpreted as a terminator instruction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open-gpu-kernel-modules release:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.19" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.19</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Unless you actually need the extra Vulkan extensions, you should probably just stick to their mainline drivers. However, they seem to be having a few issues there. Stable driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/193095/en-us/" target="_blank">515.76</a> was released back on September 20th, and it appears to be causing lots of people to <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/bug-report-black-x11-screen-and-partial-lockup-when-upgraded-to-515-76-and-dual-rtx3060/228912" target="_blank">get a black screen</a> so you may want to stick with the previous version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/190425/en-uk" target="_blank">515.57</a>. Hopefully NVIDIA will find the issue and fix it up soon.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest and great version of the Linux kernel has been released with Linux 6.0 out now. From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/10/2/255" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<p><em>"So, as is hopefully clear to everybody, the major version number change is more about me running out of fingers and toes than it is about any big fundamental changes. But of course there's a lot of various changes in 6.0 - we've got over 15k non-merge commits in there in total, after all, and as such 6.0 is one of the bigger releases at least in numbers of commits in a while."</em></p>
<p>Naturally it comes with a huge amount of new features, fixes, performance improvements and the list goes on. Some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Arc Graphics support for the new dedicated chips. Still experimental and needs up to date Mesa too.</li>
<li>Work towards supporting AMD RDNA3.</li>
<li>Support for NVMe in-band authentication.</li>
<li>Better CPU energy efficiency.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi V3D kernel driver.</li>
</ul>
<p>A whole lot more that you can see over at <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-60-features" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Linux creator Linus Torvalds was recently awarded the first-ever Intel Innovation Award for his lifetime's worth of technical achievement from Intel's Pat Gelsinger.</p>

      <title>The &#39;Heavy Machinery&#39; update for survival game Volcanoids looks awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh wow, I really need to check out Volcanoids again. The survival game that has you build and upgrade a big moving drill now has a lot more in it with some other big machinery.</p>
<p>The newly released Heavy Machinery update has expanded the world with lots of different tanks, each of them having weak points you can destroy and it looks thoroughly satisfying! There's also various types of drones that will now be flying around being a total menace, 3 new weapons for players, new anti-air turrets for players and there's even now full controller support which means it might even be a lot more playable on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QwPn2CuxxOc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7743d857793ce4a63c90e7ce73b2ef4d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QwPn2CuxxOc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/951440/Volcanoids/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Volcanoids on Steam</a>. It's 30% off until October 6th and it has Native Linux support</p>

      <title>Brotato is going to be my next horde-survival arena-shooter obsession</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you don't hear from me much over the next week it's because I've discovered Brotato. Another in the list of wave-based <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde survival games</a> and it's honestly great. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Released into Early Access on September 27th, it works great out of the box on desktop and Steam Deck with Proton 7. The developer "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1942280/discussions/0/4555968543727029680/#c3363649883734796651" target="_blank">might</a>" also do a Native release later on, which shouldn't be too much trouble as it was made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> which has excellent Linux support.</p>
<p>Much like other horde games (including Vampire Survivors), you run around an arena taking down enemies while powering up your character the longer you survive. At least here though, it's brought back proper timed waves and so you get a breather in between each set of the action to level up your character, get new weapons and items and get ready for the next wave. You can create some pretty insane character builds with this one, and my favourite feature is probably that you can actually sell weapons if you want something better. You can also combine the same weapon to make it more powerful, and free up another slot for something else.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="727NFQkdMBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf4ed8ef1d3451cd2081130c14178320.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/727NFQkdMBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Auto-firing weapons by default with a manual aiming option.</li>
<li>Fast runs (under 30 minutes).</li>
<li>Dozens of characters available to customize your runs (one-handed, crazy, lucky, mage and many more).</li>
<li>Hundreds of items and weapons to choose from (flamethrowers, SMGs, rocket launchers or sticks and stones).</li>
<li>Survive waves lasting 20 to 90 seconds each and kill off as many aliens as you can during that time.</li>
<li>Collect materials to gain experience and get items from the shop between waves of enemies.</li>
<li>Accessibility options: tweak the health, damage and speed of enemies so the difficulty is right for you.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Already an easy recommendation. A lot of fun.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors 1.0 coming October 20th, seems a Linux port is still planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer poncle has now confirmed that Vampire Survivors will hit the 1.0 on October 20th. The sad news is their big game engine upgrade is not landing yet.</p>
<p>Coming with the 1.0 release will be new language support including: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Turkish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. The rest of the actual content upgrades seem to be a surprise though.</p>
<p>The thing is, they've been porting their Electron-based game over to Unity. An exciting idea that should help solve various performance problems and open them up to more platforms. They're now aiming to release that by the end of the year, and they're on the "last pass at optimization and polish (plus adding the final bits of content that still have to be seen on the current version too)".</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3370402903772184201" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the new engine will bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Work on machines that get the webGL not supported error, get a white screen of death, get a black screen with a sad face, or have the game installed on a non-standard path.</li>
<li>Fix input issues or the game straight up crashing when multiple controllers are attached to the machine.</li>
<li>Remapping input.</li>
<li>Cloud Save conflicts due to non-useful files.</li>
<li>Use more than 1 CPU core :) Let those FPS fly high.</li>
<li>Native support for Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see they're still firmly planning a Native Linux port, although it does work well enough on desktop and Steam Deck with Proton but some people are unable to run it due to various issues with Electron. So a proper port should solve that too.</p>
<p>You can see some of my own gameplay of Vampire Survivors in a video I did back in April, where I told you not to buy a Steam Deck if you value your free time:</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Google gives up on Stadia, will offer refunds on games and hardware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As expected for some time now, Google has decided to call it quits on their cloud gaming service Stadia. This was announced in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today.</p>
<p>Written up by Phil Harrison, the Vice President and General Manager at Stadia, the post mentions how "it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service".</p>
<p>The wildest part about this, is that they're going to be refunding all Stadia hardware purchases made through the main Google Store and they will also be refunding all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store. Harrison said they expect to have finished up the majority of refunds by Mid-January, 2023. They will not be refunding any Stadia Pro subscriptions though, only the full purchases. More info on the <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/12790109" target="_blank">process here</a> but it seems like it's not ready yet.</p>
<p>Players will still be able to access and play games on Stadia through until January 18, 2023.</p>
<p>In the post Harrison mention how the "underlying technology platform that powers Stadia has been proven at scale and transcends gaming" and they see "opportunities to apply this technology across other parts of Google like YouTube, Google Play, and our Augmented Reality (AR) efforts — as well as make it available to our industry partners" so it seems they will continue to offer it to others to use.</p>
<p>This is a pretty huge defeat for Google to give up and refund wholly like this. With the likes of GeForce NOW, Xbox Cloud and Amazon Luna — the business model that Google had with you needing to buy full-price games was pretty much doomed.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> are celebrating 14 years of existing with a big sale on lots of games, plus you can get a free copy of Master of Magic Classic.</p>
<p>For the giveaway, simply be logged in to <a href="https://www.gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> and scroll down to find the giveaway banner.

<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has also now landed on GOG with the <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition" target="_blank">Anniversary Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_special_edition" target="_blank">Special Edition</a>. GOG said in their email that their version has been tweaked so you can get the Anniversary Edition content without the need for Creation Club access and naturally it's fully playable offline.</p>
<p>As for modding it GOG said:</p>

<p>As the game is recognized as one of the most modded titles in the history of video games, support for community-created content in Skyrim was one of our top priorities. The GOG version is compatible out of the box with most modifications mods via Nexus Mods Vortex v1.6.12 and newer. Support for mods requiring Skyrim Script Extender will be added later today. Additionally, GOG is preparing something special to provide an even smoother modding experience – expect more details soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game has long worked in Wine / Proton so it's another option for you and good news for GOG fans.</p>

      <title>Transferring files from PC to Steam Deck with FileZilla FTP</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want another way to transfer files from a PC (Linux / Windows) over to a Steam Deck? Here's how to do it using the FileZilla FTP application. I've already covered the use of tools like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heres-how-to-transfer-files-from-your-pc-to-a-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Warpinator</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/syncthing-is-a-great-way-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Syncthing</a> and both are great, however not everyone gets along with them and this way is pretty much bulletproof with a tiny bit of a setup.</p>
<p>First up here's the video and below will be the text guide as usual:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VfsSCMiZVf4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b0c9515c7169c7098a162ef05296d15.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VfsSCMiZVf4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>. On Linux you can grab it from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.filezillaproject.Filezilla" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li>In Steam Deck Desktop Mode, set up a password by using "passwd" in terminal.</li>
<li>Next enable and start SSH with these commands in terminal:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo systemctl enable sshd</code><br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo systemctl start sshd</code></li>
<li>Find the IP address of your Steam Deck. Click the WiFi / Networking icon, then go into details and it will be at the top of the list and may start something like 192. Make a note of this IP.</li>
<li>Load up FileZilla, entering the details into the top bar. The username will be "deck" and the port is "22".</li>
<li>Click Quickconnect.</li>
</ol>
<p>Done, you're ready to get transferring files.</p>

      <title>Point and click mystery adventure The Excavation of Hob&#39;s Barrow is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arriving with Native Linux support, the new mysterious point and click adventure game The Excavation of Hob's Barrow from Cloak and Dagger Games / Wadjet Eye Games is out now.</p>
<p>"Antiquarian Thomasina Bateman is writing a book on the barrows of England, documenting the treasures she finds buried within. When an intriguing letter summons her to the small village of Bewlay, tucked away in the remote countryside, she sets off by train with her assistant a day behind. Upon her arrival, however, the mysterious man who summoned her is nowhere to be found. Her assistant never arrives. A stubborn landowner refuses access to the barrow, and the locals are wary of this woman who is traveling alone and (gasp!) wears trousers. The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is off to a rocky start. And then Thomasina starts having strange dreams... "</p>

      <title>The free Indonesia update for art of rally is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to expand to some gorgeous locations to race through, the free Indonesia update for art of rally is out now.</p>
<p>Their release announcement was short and to the point noting that the new update features 6 new tracks, 2 new songs and a whole new free-roam area for you to practice in too. This has bumped up the content since release to a rather impressive 78 stages across the likes of Finland, Sardinia, Norway, Japan, Germany, Kenya and Indonesia. With over 50 cars too, there's plenty to keep you entertained in this one now.</p>

<p>Back at release in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/art-of-rally-strips-down-the-furious-sport-into-a-serene-top-down-experience/" target="_blank">my article</a> I mentioned it is "a racing experience that pulls away all the fluff, puts it back to the basics of you and the car wrapped up in a visually striking look that I can easily and quite happily recommend" and I still happily stick by that. Great little racing game and perfect for the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Open-world turn-based RPG &#39;Of Blades &amp; Tails&#39; arrives October 19th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by classic hack and slashers like Diablo and turn-based RPGs like Tales of Maj'Eyal or Stoneshard, we have the new open-world RPG coming Of Blades &amp; Tails. Planned to enter Early Access on October 19th, this will feature Native Linux support and it looks great.</p>
<p>"A turn-based RPG that is action-oriented but rewards a thoughtful approach. Discover a fantastic land populated by different animal tribes. You play Reik, a clever member of the tribe of foxes.

You will have to leave your home village and explore the world to become strong enough to stand up to evil. (In other words: There will be a main storyline but it's still in the making!)"</p>

      <title>Project Killswitch sales suspended as the kickstand messed with the Steam Deck fan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like dbrand are not having a great time with <a href="https://dbrand.com/killswitch" target="_blank">Project Killswitch</a>, their bundle of accessories as they had to pull it from sale shortly after going up for reservations due to it causing problems.</p>
<p>It was a little confusing, as a reservation holder myself the link in the email to buy it just ended up going to a Twitter post. Confused, I reached out to dbrand but didn't hear back until their public announcement about what happened. Sent in an email and posted in public on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/xqsj59/our_milliondollar_mistake/#" target="_blank">Reddit</a> too, they made a "Million-Dollar Mistake".</p>
<p>They shipped out a bunch of them to various content creators and news websites (not to us though…) which they said had people whose knowledge "ranged from 'casual' to 'built their own Linux distro'" and all seemed fine. Then they shipped some out to The Verge, who emailed back to note there were problems with the magnetic kickstand and the Steam Deck fan. It was <em>slowing</em> down their Steam Deck fan! After more testing, another unit saw their fan <em>speed-up</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19801540021664445040gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19801540021664445040gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In short, the whiney Delta fan was the one affected, the Huaying was not and according to dbrand they've heard that Valve are apparently no longer using the Delta fan. So this is why they pulled the launch, as their magnets screwed with any Steam Deck with a Delta fan and obviously they can't just let that happen. To be clear, everything else is fine, just the kickstand causes issues.</p>
<p>So now they're going back and changing the kickstand to a "mechanical interlock system", which will probably end up a little like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">the fantastic DeckMate</a>. Everyone who purchased it with the magnetic version will get a "free replacement of both their case and kickstand" which is great to see.</p>
<p>It's going to take a while though, with any new orders now not shipping until sometime Q1 2023, but they will still be shipping out orders of those reservation holders who did manage to get through initially.</p>

      <title>System76 gives the Oryx Pro a big refresh with an OLED 4k display</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux flagship NVIDIA laptop from <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a> has been given a major overhaul, making it something of a beast. Pricey though, with you needing to dig deep into your wallets with a base price of $2,199.</p>
<p><em>If you're after a powerful system with a proven Linux vendor, this is one of the best possible machines you can buy.</em></p>
<p>System76 are keen to note the difference in available performance between this and their older model, noting in their press material that the CPU is "+35% faster", the memory is "+92% faster" and the graphics are "+40% faster" thanks to all the changes. You're now getting a 12th Gen Intel® Core i7-12700H, DDR5 RAM and a choice between an NVIDIA 3070 Ti or 3080 Ti. No matter what you're doing, it seems like the new System76 Oryx Pro will probably handle it quite nicely.</p>

<p>It's also interesting to see how all the marketing around Linux machines has evolved. System76 have now begun noting in their releases about gaming noting things like Steam Play Proton, ProtonDB, ProtonUp-Qt and Lutris. What a different world it is not Linux now to have hardware vendors repeatedly talking up gaming.</p>

      <title>Terraria: Labor of Love update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terraria: Labor of Love, another major update for the popular crafting and survival game is officially out now. There's a ridiculous amount (as usual) that's new, here's the biggest stuff to look out for.</p>
<p>Developer Re-Logic sure does love doing just one more update huh? Will this one be the last? Probably not. I'm sure they'll find something more they want to add again at some point.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Hpq5i80Fqr4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0de526d32027d1a737afe14a230fea78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Hpq5i80Fqr4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>

      <title>Free evolution sim &#39;Thrive&#39; adds a new part to let organisms spew mucilage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What I can only describe as some form of microscopic fart-cannon, the free and open source evolution sim Thrive has added what they call a Mucilage Jet for your creatures in version 0.5.10.</p>
<p>Yes, it's basically a way for you to add a way for your tiny little creatures to fart out a substance that gives you a burst of speed, and slows down other organisms caught in the mucilage. Thrive definitely sounds like it's starting to add more fun gameplay elements to it, while still being based on real science.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15445252521664372093gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15445252521664372093gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another big new feature is time-based reproduction. Making the game a little more flexible, you don't need to constantly gather compounds as now all cells will passively acquire the necessary compounds over a period of time. This means even bigger slower creatures will always be able to do something and you spend less time mindlessly hunting for resources. To go along with this, you cannot just instantly reproduce when you have the right amount of resources, as it now takes time for it to be used.</p>
<p>They've also added a fancy new "Auto-Evo Exploration Tool", letting you run various auto-evolution generations with defined metrics and then you can dive into it directly to explore. Pretty cool. See more in the trailer:</p>

      <title>Manage games and people in Roller Drama with full Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roller Drama is an upcoming hybrid of a sports team management sim, along with visual novel elements too and it sounds like a great idea for a game. Just recently, the developer also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1293420/view/3267948473375698907" target="_blank">noted</a> it will have full Native Linux support along with controls nicely tweaked and set ready for the Steam Deck directly.</p>
<p>In the game you assume the role of team coach, and you all live together so you're managing drama on and off the field. So on top of dealing with everyone's emotions as they navigate rivalries, friendships, and love you're also trying to keep them together in the real-time contact sporting events.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interactive narrative with meaningful choices (almost 100!) and multiple endings.</li>
<li>Vivid, explorable universe.</li>
<li>Replayable narrative and matches: every championship is unique, several different endings.</li>
<li>Replay a specific chapter.</li>
<li>Real-time roller derby matches.</li>
<li>Coach a team of five athletes with wildly different personalities.</li>
<li>Hand drawn character art by award winning illustrator Vic Macioci.</li>
<li>Play with controller or mouse + keyboard.</li>
<li>Cloud saves.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Valve give update on official Steam Deck Dock, Valve excited for SteamOS on more devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-interview-valve-seven-months" target="_blank">new interview</a> with IGN, Valve has given a few more little details about their thoughts on how things with the Steam Deck are going along with notes on the official Steam Deck Dock and SteamOS on more devices. The full interview is worth a read but here's a few choice notes for you.</p>
<p>Firstly, when it comes to the long-delayed official Docking Station, Valve mentioned they're facing a lot of the same supply issues as they did with the Steam Deck directly, however the Docking Station is being made elsewhere so it has its own set of issues and they are "going to hopefully announce something soon". A lot of work is also going into ensuring the Steam Deck works with "as many peripherals as possible" and that work they put in for the official Docking Station "works on every dock – so every USB dock is benefiting from all of the work that we do on SteamOS".</p>
<p>The response in Japan has been "incredibly positive" and they have been spending time talking to Japanese developers about it and the reaction from Japanese developers and publishers "has been immensely, immensely positive".</p>
<p>Valve reiterated, again, that work is ongoing in SteamOS for the upcoming official installer for more devices. When that happens, there will also be an official way to dual-boot with Windows. They're also "excited to bring SteamOS to other manufacturers that might want to put it on their handheld gaming PC".</p>
<p>In terms of Deck Verified and the overall experience, they're working with developers to encourage them to change their default configurations for the Steam Deck and other similar devices and they continue to iterate on the Deck Verified program. They do keep having developers reach out to them for help on getting from Unsupported or Playable to Verified.</p>
<p>They're also keeping an eye on the modding community, to see what people really want but they're trying to balance not having too many settings out of the box.</p>
<p>Don't expect to a see a slimmer Steam Deck in future as Valve mentioned the trade-offs like smaller screens, less battery life and they seem to be very happy with the current ergonomics of it that the size affords like the proper grips on the side noting "We really wanted there to be something that your hands could grip and hold onto for a really long play session.".</p>

      <title>Steam drops the Lunar New Year Sale, we&#39;re getting a big Spring sale instead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has announced some changes to their major seasonal sales, along with the Lunar New Year Sale being dropped.</p>
<p>In their announcement to developers, they noted that they will now be doing a major Spring Sale instead as part of their four major season sales. Valve said that this was a popular request from developers and publishers, and it allows them to space them out a little more enabling developers to "expand and execute their discounting calendar".</p>
<p>Here's the main upcoming events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Autumn Sale: Nov 22nd to Nov 29th</li>
<li>Winter Sale: Dec 22nd to Jan 5th</li>
<li>Spring Sale: March 16th to 23rd</li>
</ul>
<p>Explaining a little more on why the Lunar sale is being dropped, Valve mentioned that it originally began in 2016 "to celebrate the influx of game developers and customers from territories like Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, and South Korea". Over the years though, more developers seem to have been complaining to Valve that it's too close to their December holiday sale period and so they expect "customers will be better served by a little bit more time between the big Steam-wide seasonal sales".</p>
<p>It does make plenty of sense when you think about it. Too many big sales like it was a bit overloading.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck got another Beta update focused on Steam Input and FlickStick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems Valve snuck out <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/news" target="_blank">another</a> Steam Deck Beta update while I was asleep, this time focused on improvements to Steam Input after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/steam-deck-gets-a-small-bug-fix-client-beta-out-now/" target="_blank">smaller bug fix earlier</a>.</p>
<p>What's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now automatically switch controller configurations to be per-device when multiple of the same controller are connected at once.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with editing the mode settings for an input (e.g. joystick).</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when setting a trigger input to "Disabled" in an action set layer.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where "Disabled" would be listed multiple times the dropdown options for modes.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where switching the active controller in the configurator could lose unsaved changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input: FlickStick</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced update rate from 240hz to 120hz to reduce instances of maxed out mouse movement between game frames.</li>
<li>Added a "Slap Back" check so that the stick does not accidentally invoke an opposite-side turn when snapping home aggressively.</li>
<li>Any remaining Snap Angle is doled as the stick returns to zero. This further reduces "mouse movement spikes".</li>
<li>Fix for Dampening Value not being used with the correct ranges.</li>
<li>Tweaked Inner Radius Default to be lower.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Intel Arc A770 GPU releases October 12th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Along with announcing their new Raptor Lake desktop CPUs, Intel has also finally announced the release date of their Arc A770 GPU for October 12th. This is their top-end GPU, that they claim "delivers 65% better peak performance versus competition on ray tracing".</p>
<p>Coming in at $329, putting it in line with the RTX 3060 which they previously compared it against. They're facing some fierce competition with NVIDIA and AMD already well established in the market although given the insane price on<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/nvidia-announces-ada-lovelace-their-3rd-generation-rtx-dlss-3-and-portal-rtx/" target="_blank"> NVIDIA Ada Lovelace</a>, perhaps more will be looking at alternatives?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/108796751664305625gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/108796751664305625gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Very little else was really said about it that I can find, other than what they've previously revealed about it which is pretty much everything with all the specifications already available on their website. As a refresher, their Limited Edition version is mainly the card with the 16GB GDDR6 and they said previously most of their partners will do it in 8GB.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10002567851664306213gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10002567851664306213gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can find out more on the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/arc-discrete-graphics/7.html" target="_blank">Intel website</a>. The XeSS SDK is also now available on <a href="https://github.com/intel/xess" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see how Intel do with their first lot out properly, as a third vendor has been needed like this in the GPU space. With open source drivers too, there's a lot for Linux users to like about it.</p>

      <title>Intel reveals 13th Gen &#39;Raptor Lake&#39; desktop CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel has today formally revealed their brand new line of desktop CPUs, just as AMD are launching <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/amd-announced-qzen-4q-with-ryzen-7000-series-rdna3-teased/" target="_blank">Ryzen 7000 processors</a>. I don't think we need any guessing on why it was revealed today, nothing like trying to step on your competitor's toes eh?</p>
<p>Continuing to be built on their "Intel 7" process node, they're claiming their new flagship with the Core i9-13900K once again offers up the "world's best gaming experience". It is a pretty powerful chip with 24 cores (8 P-cores, 16 E-cores) and 32 threads.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of what's been announced:</p>

      <title>Silence of the Siren is a gorgeous new strategy game from the Project Hospital devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxymoron Games, developers of the Project Hospital game have announced their second title with Silence of the Siren and it's looking quite impressive.</p>
<p>Writing over email, they mentioned how Project Hospital was a great success for their team, enabling the production on this new game which has been in development for "several years". They also confirmed it will have Native Linux support just like the previous game.</p>
<p>Taking place in a chaotic universe in their own original setting, where several space-faring civilizations are fighting over control of a distant star system and trying to discover its dark history. Check out the first teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IcFyILv3tWE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a33aec5dd0b30df5cc3bb12a7c2aba3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IcFyILv3tWE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Siren star system, birthplace of a galactic alliance, and the homeworld of a lost Primals civilization, has been cut from the rest of the galaxy. As a result, the carefully built alliance split into bickering factions and secluded colonies. These days, hardly anyone pays attention to the ruins scattered all over the few habitable planets of a freshly isolated system. The deeper you venture into the uncharted regions, the stronger the feeling of endangerment grows. There is something else. An entity, a shade, an echo of whispers from below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a rich sci-fi world and discover secrets of a lost civilization.</li>
<li>Collect powerful artifacts, secure important resources, upgrade your bases and hire the strongest units.</li>
<li>Level-up your commanders and crush your opponents in exciting turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Take control over several different species and factions.</li>
<li>Old-school strategy game with modern controls and intuitive UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2147380/Silence_of_the_Siren/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>JSAUX released a firmware update for their Steam Deck Docking Stations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX (pronounced Jay-Socks), <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/blogs/steam-deck/were-upgrading-our-steam-deckss-docking-stations-firmware" target="_blank">announced</a> recently that they've made available a new firmware update for their first two models of the Steam Deck Docking Station.</p>
<p>This concerns the original <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-docking-station" target="_blank">Docking Station</a> and the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Upgraded Docking Station</a> (which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">reviewed</a>) and not the newest version that features an M.2 SSD slot that I'll be reviewing sometime soon.</p>
<p>What's new? JSAUX say they worked to improve the compatibility with televisions and monitors from LG. While small on changes, any increase in compatibility is great and shows they don't just forget about old models when moving onto the next. In their own words they said "With this new firmware we want to show our customers that we are focused and committed to improving our lineup of Docking Stations. To us, every client matters and that’s why we thrive to give you the best possible experience.".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a catch. Their firmware update is only designed for Windows. However, I have mentioned the <a href="https://fwupd.org/" target="_blank">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a> to them, so hopefully they can put it up on there giving Linux users an easy way to update too.</p>

      <title>Mellow indie adventure One Dreamer is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One Dreamer is a point and click programming adventure game about a burned-out indie developer making games. It's officially out with Native Linux support. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>While the programming in it is quite basic and based on small puzzles, it's part of the overall experience of going through the motions of what it's like to work on games and do work on the side too. It's quite an interesting mellow experience, great to play through on a weekend. If you like chilled story-based adventures with a little puzzling, along with meta about the games industry, it's pretty great.</p>
<p>"Help Frank, a burnt out indie game developer, rediscover his love for video games while struggling to release his debut title. Reprogram objects, fix bugs and solve coding puzzles as you journey through the story of One Dreamer."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ciD0p3h72KM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a1ad4ab7d2f8e581a90d6aa2cd9adef4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ciD0p3h72KM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With some blocky but still good pixel-art blending with nice lighting, and a soundtrack that really helps you relax it's quite an experience. As someone else who works alone, it certainly hit home in a few places. Some of the little messages you get about the world, the people and the developer can hit pretty hard if you're paying attention to all the conversations you pass when running through the world. Lots to appreciate about this one including some good voice acting too.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A narrative-driven, emotional story about the gruelling development process behind making an indie game.</li>
<li>Realistic, but easy to understand pseudocode puzzles based on C#. Edit over 350 snippets of code from Frank’s toaster to playable mini-games.</li>
<li>Meet an extensive cast of charming characters, complete with full English voice acting.</li>
<li>Explore a wide range of atmospheric, pixel by pixel drawn environments.</li>
<li>A beautiful original soundtrack composed over a period of 7 years.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rust for Steam Deck / Linux still some time away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you wanting to play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/" target="_blank">Rust</a> again on Linux desktop or Steam Deck, it sounds like it's still some time away as Facepunch continues thinking on Easy Anti-Cheat support.</p>
<p>While for some developers it may just be a case of ticking a box, or putting things in the right place, we know that's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/anti-cheat-work-on-warhammer-vermintide-2-for-steam-deck-a-linux-on-hold/" target="_blank">not always</a> the case. Outside of the technical implementation, developers also need to think on EAC's effectiveness and about opening their games to another platform to protect against cheating.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6267965841664278852gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In the case of Rust, it seems the biggest issue is the protection that Easy Anti-Cheat can offer and if it's worth the time involved in setting it up and supporting it in a public environment.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Facepunch's Garry Newman <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1574466250167787520" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in reply to a user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're working through some issues, trying to justify it. It would be a lot of extra work to put on EAC, we can't do it if it's detrimental to the main Windows player base..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I replied asking about Steam Deck, Newman replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well that's what we're evaluating. Steam Deck compatibility is the only reason to do it at all..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a follow-up when asked what the issues are Newman said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's not one issue. I worry that by opening another platform we're forcing EAC to spread themselves too thin. I don't want to put that pressure on them if it's going to reduce effectiveness of their team on Windows. When we had a Linux version before we...</p>
<p>... noticed that while the majority of cheaters were on Windows, a good chunk of actual cheat makers used Linux and stayed undetected for a long long time. Trying to persuade EAC to hunt these handful of people down wouldn't be a great use of their time considering their impact..</p>
<p>.. on the overall population of the game. So internally we're talking about whether this is a door worth opening. This isn't a linux thing, it's a "another platform" thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to argue such a clear explanation of the issue at hand. Developers of games that are primarily multiplayer will always be thinking hard on opening them up to another platform.</p>
<p>That said, Easy Anti-Cheat must be somewhat effective even on Linux / Steam Deck as it seems it's good enough for EA / Respawn with Apex Legends which has a player base multiple times larger on Steam compared with Rust. But, one size does not fit all of course. Newman <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1574720935130808322" target="_blank">mentioned</a> this too in a reply to a user asking about it and it's another fair point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't know too much about the cheating situation in Apex to talk about it. Rust is really sensitive to cheating. A cheater doesn't ruin a single 10 minute match, they ruin 3 weeks of hard work and grind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something to make you think, not something specific I had actually considered before either about the vastly different use-case for a game like Rust.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Shit On My #!$@&amp; Roof is the latest 2D horde shooter out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You know me by now, I'm going to play everything I can that in some way resembles Vampire Survivors and this new influx of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde games</a> and Don't Shit On My #!$@&amp; Roof is the latest. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>While not the true evil (hello Seagulls), Pigeons can be quite a nuisance too and this game has you deal with them. Like most other similar horde survival shooters you're tasked with surviving as long as possible, while continually levelling up and becoming more powerful as more and bigger enemies come flying in. Here though, you're protecting your house from bird poop on top of watching our for yourself.</p>

<p>Right now in Early Access it's somewhat basic, but a good platform for the developer to continue building on it. I would honestly wait on this one until they've pushed it along some more, as it's a little too flat and simple than I would personally like. It has a fun setting idea but it needs to do a little more with it to pull me away from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/void-scrappers-is-my-new-favourite-coffee-break-game-m-try-the-free-prologue/" target="_blank">Void Scrappers</a>.</p>

      <title>Custom boot animations for the Steam Deck are pretty sweet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Did you know you can change the boot animation on the Steam Deck? Well you can and the community has naturally gone and done some pretty amazing things with it.</p>
<p>After messing around for a little while, I've come up with a full and hopefully easy enough guide to follow both in video and text form for anyone interested in doing it themselves. This was directly inspired by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xi3vno/comment/ip196e6/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Reddit post</a> on it where the user changed their Steam Deck bootup to a Futurama animation with the Steam Deck wording which is pretty <em>fantastic</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a4mctgqWM8o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7a0afa51019489d66717faf32bda086d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a4mctgqWM8o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you need a .webm video file of an animation, whatever you want. You can easily convert videos to webm using services like <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/" target="_blank">CloudConvert</a>, your favourite <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/" target="_blank">video editor</a> or even ffmpeg scripts.</li>
<li>In your Home folder in a file manager, unhide the files. <em>CTRL+H or via the options menu in the top right.</em></li>
<li>Head to .local/share/Steam/steamui/movies/ and make a backup of deck_startup.webm if you wish.</li>
<li>Get the filesize of the deck_startup.webm by right click -&gt; properties and make a note of the one in brackets.</li>
<li>Replace the original deck_startup.webm with your chosen video file, using the same name.</li>
<li>Open a terminal window inside this folder (right click -&gt; open terminal) and run this command (with the correct filesize you noted):<br/>
<code class="inline-code">truncate -s 1840847 deck_startup.webm</code></li>
<li>Go into .local/share/Steam/steamui/css/ and make a backup of library.css and again make a note of the filesize. This file tends to change filesize between Steam Deck updates.</li>
<li>Open the library.css file, go to the line that has "video" and edit just after it to read like this:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">video{flex-grow:1;width:100%; height:100%; z-index:10}</code></li>
<li>Now open a terminal inside this folder as you did before, then run this (with the correct filesize you noted):<br/>
<code class="inline-code">truncate -s 38492 library.css</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now you're done. You can reboot and watch your new boot video! Enjoy.</p>

      <title>Caesar III game engine Augustus has a new releases up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Keriew/augustus" target="_blank">Augustus</a> is a game engine reimplementation for the classic Caesar III, enabling you to play on modern platforms (like Linux / Steam Deck). It's a fork of another called Julius that focuses on accuracy, with Augustus aiming to improve the game with a number of changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17415989431664196447gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17415989431664196447gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Version 3.2.0 was released and here's some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A warning is displayed when the game can't be saved.</li>
<li>Added a yearly autosave option.</li>
<li>Fulfilling the emperor's requests will now spawn cartpushers heading to Rome with the resources.</li>
<li>Added walkers who deliver food from the supply post to forts.</li>
<li>Added inverse direction option to right mouse click dragging.</li>
<li>Added relevant advisor buttons to many message types.</li>
<li>Added hotkeys for setting the map orientation to north.</li>
<li>Added the option to display messages as alerts on top of the screen.</li>
<li>Added the option to display the building grid.</li>
<li>Farms, raw materials buildings, workshops and wharves now display the efficiency of the building.</li>
<li>Added support for MPG video files. Create a “mpg” folder in your Caesar 3 install directory and place the MPG video files inside, to use them in-game instead of the SMK video files.</li>
<li>Added play/pause button to sidebar.</li>
<li>Added hedge/palisade gates. They are created by building hedges/palisades over the roads.</li>
<li>Added purple variants of columns and pavilions.</li>
<li>Added watchtower variants.</li>
<li>Added medium statue rotation.</li>
<li>Added gladiator statue.</li>
<li>Added support for assets relative path to the executable.</li>
<li>Added a support for saving high-res screenshots of the minimap.</li>
<li>+ a lot more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You need the original game assets which you can grab easily with a DRM-free copy of Caesar III on<a href="https://af.gog.com/game/caesar_3?as=1636858786" target="_blank"> GOG.com</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/517790/Caesar_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you wish to play it directly from Steam, you can use the Luxtorpeda project to run it which I've covered before in various articles <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">like this guide</a>.</p>

      <title>Trombone Champ is my new favourite rhythm game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Discover the mysterious of the Trombiverse in Trombone Champ, a new hilarious rhythm game and absolutely now a clear favourite of mine. Come listen to me destroy it. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059990/Trombone_Champ/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 16th, the developer says it's "the world's first trombone-based rhythm music game. Unlike most music games, you can freely play any note at any time. You're not just following along with the music, you're actually playing the music".</p>
<p>I came across a lot of noise about it on Twitter, including a Valve developer giving it a go on Steam Deck. I thought it looked and sounded hilarious and so I just had to give this one a go myself with the gyro controls on Steam Deck and it's as completely ridiculous as you might think but it wouldn't take all that much practice to get really good at it I think.</p>
<p>Here's a video of me committing musical murder:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3YeJhPzRqTk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cad9601292e7c2e22a8581797f4a6436.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3YeJhPzRqTk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Toot your way through <strong>over 20 tracks.</strong> The better you play, the more toots you earn!</li>
<li>Collect all <strong>50 Tromboner Cards!</strong></li>
<li>Baboons on nearly every screen!</li>
<li>Improvise and play whatever you want in <strong>Freeplay Mode!</strong></li>
<li>Uncover the secrets of the Trombiverse and become the True Trombone Champ!</li>
<li>Absolutely zero microtransactions!</li>
<li>Playable with mouse and keyboard (recommended) or USB controllers (coming after launch)!</li>
<li>Appropriate for all ages!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It works great on Steam Deck out of the box and on my Fedora Linux desktop it worked just as well there with Proton 7 using mouse controls. Although for mouse controls, they're inverted by default which felt pretty terrible but thankfully in the settings they do let you put it normal which felt better. Overall though, I had far more fun with it on Steam Deck with gyro than I did on desktop.</p>

      <title>Blizzard don&#39;t officially support Steam Deck / Linux but they still fix issues for it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, there were was an upgrade to the Battle.net client that caused it to break on Linux desktop / Steam Deck but it seems the issue is thankfully solved now.</p>
<p>The thing is, Blizzard don't support Linux as a platform at all for the client or their games. However, they do have a bit of history of now and then fixing up major issues preventing people playing with the Wine compatibility layer. Seems that level of support is still ongoing after the latest incident.</p>
<p>Around <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/last-update-completely-breaks-wine-compatibility/33122" target="_blank">9 days ago</a>, it seems an update just broke it entirely and the app wouldn't install and update properly resulting in some sort of loop. While it's a shame no testing is done for Linux and Steam Deck before updates are rolled out, at least we're not stuck forever as they've now <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/t/fix-for-linuxlutris-users-stuck-in-battlenet-update-loop/33340/9" target="_blank">solved it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="cooked">
<p>Howdy Everyone!</p>
<p>I do apologies we didn’t post here sooner but the development teams was aware that a recent change did cause havoc with Wine and the software used for Steam Deck. This wasn’t intended.</p>
<p>A fix was deployed and it appears it’s working. If you are still having issues please try a reinstall of the app so it fully updates to the 8020 build.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Check on it today and it seems all good on my end now too.</p>
<p>Good news, since Overwatch 2 releases next month and I'm sure plenty will want to play it.</p>

      <title>Canadian customers seeing a temporary delay for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has been able to repeatedly speed up production of the Steam Deck smashing expectations, they've hit a snag when it comes to Canada.</p>
<p>Due to the issues, if you're awaiting an order email for the Steam Deck you're going to have to wait a little bit longer due issues out of Valve's hands.</p>
<p>As the official OnDeck Twitter account said across a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1573001930515050502" target="_blank">tweets</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck production is faster than ever, and we're on track to fulfill all reservations before the end of the year! There's temporary snag for our Canadian customers that we wanted to address – please see the follow up tweet for more details:</p>
<p>Our distributor has hit a processing backlog for orders to Canada, so folks in this region will see a (very) temporary pause on order emails. We're working on it, and are optimistic we can resume emails to Canada soon. This doesn't impact emails or shipments to other regions.</p>
<p>To clarify, the reason for this pause is so our distributor can make it through the backlog of paid orders (in Canada), before we resume sending emails to folks in this region.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4095198751663917915gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4095198751663917915gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The FSR fix is also a welcome one, as it was causing frame spikes quite regularly so things should be a bit smoother now.</p>

      <title>Valve launches Steam Charts giving us better details on games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" target="_blank">Steam Charts</a>, the name of the new system Valve just launched gives us a better look behind the curtain on how games are doing on Steam overall. This replaces the basic stats page that showed the online count for Steam and the Top 100 most played games with a lot more information.</p>
<p>We still have the Most Played games list, although it's a bit more real-time as it's updated every 5 minutes now and it gives you a little more info like the price and any current discount making it a lot more useful:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14317083321663916311gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14317083321663916311gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The brand new Top Sellers system is also pretty slick. Giving a real-time look at what is the most popular on Steam, with you being able to filter it to various countries. This includes the number of weeks in the top sellers, the weekly change in rank and it accounts for the <u>total</u> revenue (DLC, various different editions etc). If a DLC for a game is what bumped it up the list, that will be noted too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8726266911663916532gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8726266911663916532gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Interestingly though, it doesn't list the Steam Deck here but they are listing that in their Weekly Charts still. Probably makes some sense, given that it's not a real-time thing you can just purchase at any time since it's still in the reservation system. So once there's no queue, it may end up in the real-time list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20315961521663916579gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20315961521663916579gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once again, it's great to see Valve continue to give more information to users and continue upgrading their store.</p>
<p>Given how the industry is often rather secretive about any form of stats on their games, it's thoroughly refreshing to see Valve actually make this a more prominent and useful feature.</p>

      <title>Paradox Arc to publish sci-fi base builder Stardeus, entering Early Access in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardeus from developer Kodo Linija (Bloody Rally Show) has found a publisher with Paradox Arc (Paradox Interactive's new publishing arm). It's also set to enter Early Access on October 12th with Native Linux support and it is already Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Stardeus is a sci-fi colony management simulator with aspects of automation, base building and space exploration. You're a new AI that gets tasked with building up a starship so you must supervise various robots, drones and humans too as you build a new life but of course it's in space so it's thoroughly unpredictable and accidents will happen as will violent raids from various space forces.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E9RSZnVvuTw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9316c6b61428cb88f8fe0b2e95effb53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E9RSZnVvuTw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by the likes of Factorio and Rimworld, you can clearly see the inspiration when you play it but it's also very much a unique game too with plenty to appreciate. The developer sent me early access to this one quite some time ago, and I had quite an interesting time with it and did some of the early Steam Deck testing for it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GNOME 43 is out now with Quick Settings, refreshed Files app and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 43 is officially out now, bringing with it some pretty wonderful sounding changes to one of the most popular Linux desktop environments.</p>
<p>One of the new highlights is a Quick Settings feature. This is a redesign of the status menu in the top right, giving you more settings that are easy to change like the UI style, a screenshot button, the ability to switch between sound devices and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13692573401663852975gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13692573401663852975gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>More apps are switching over to GTK 4, the next-generation GNOME user interface toolkit and as of GNOME 43 these apps have newly moved over: Files, Maps, Logs, Builder, Console, Initial Setup and Parental Controls.</p>
<p>The Files app also went through a refresh with a new modern design for the file and folder properties window, the layout adjusts itself to various widths automatically, reorganized menus, a new layout for search results, recent, and starred files, there's a new Open With dialog and in the list view opening the context menu for the current directory is now much easier.</p>
<p>You will also find a new Device Security section in the privacy settings, a new and improved Web Apps feature to install websites to the desktop as apps and more.</p>
<p>Lots of other improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The screen keyboard now shows suggestions as you type. It will also show Ctrl, Alt, and Tab keys when typing in a terminal.</li>
<li>Web’s screenshot feature is now easier to use: it can now be found in the web page context menu, or triggered with the Shift+Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut.</li>
<li>Also in Web, the style of interface elements in web pages has also been updated, to match modern GNOME applications.</li>
<li>The Characters app now includes a much wider selection of emoji, including people with different skin tones, genders, and hair styles, and more regional flags.</li>
<li>Some of the animations in the Activities Overview have been optimized, so that they are smoother.</li>
<li>The “about windows” of GNOME apps, which show details about each app, have been revamped.</li>
<li>In Software, application pages have an improved switcher for selecting the source and format.</li>
<li>The dark UI style used by GTK 4 apps has been polished, so the appearance of bars and lists is more harmonious.</li>
<li>When connecting to GNOME with a remote desktop app (using RDP), it is now possible to receive audio from the host.</li>
<li>GNOME’s range of alert sounds has been updated, and includes a new default alert sound.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5541252511663852280gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5541252511663852280gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>See the <a href="https://release.gnome.org/43/" target="_blank">release notes</a> for more.</p>
<p>As for when you'll get it? You'll need to refer to the update cycle of your Linux distribution as they're all different. You can try it out right now though, using the <a href="https://os.gnome.org/" target="_blank">GNOME OS Nightly</a> image.</p>

      <title>DOSBox Staging 0.79.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DOSBox Staging is a fork of the original DOSBox aimed at getting new features in faster, along with a better overall experience for users.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10277191101663851253gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A new release with version 0.79.0 is out adding in lots of audio improvements like the ultra-rare AdLib Gold surround sound daughterboard is now emulated, DOSBox Staging can now accurately emulate the low-pass filter (and sometimes a high-pass filter too) that most DOS-era sound cards feature, filtering for small-speaker audio systems (PC Speaker, PS/1 Audio, Tandy, and the various LPT DAC options) to give a better experience and a new crossfeed option to mix the channels for some audio that might only play on one ear. There's even more like a chorus effect, adding stereo movement and increases the perceived stereo width, which is especially noticeable on purely mono signals on headphones.</p>
<p>There's also various graphical improvements like a shader reload shortcut, it is possible to override the default, canonical interpretation of the 16-colour CGA/EGA RGBI palette, improved scaling, window transparency support, a new Constant Frame Rate (CFR) presentation mode, which presents a constant frame rate defined by the emulated DOS rate and more.</p>
<p>The ability to mount physical CDs is now (re-)implemented in DOSBox Staging for better compatibility with games like Under a Killing Moon, System Shock, and The Pandora Directive. There's a huge amount more to it that you can <a href="https://dosbox-staging.github.io/v0-79-0/" target="_blank">read about here</a>.</p>
<p>For Linux users, <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> also has support for this new release so you can easily use it with Steam games. You can install it via ProtonUp-Qt two tools I've covered numerous times now like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/try-out-luxtorpeda-a-steam-play-tool-to-run-games-in-native-game-engines/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper and Terraria are getting cross-over updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two rather great sandbox mining games are set for an official cross-over. Terraria and the new kid on the block Core Keeper will both be getting free updates for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21034521681663845606gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Announced by the Core Keeper developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/3371525557392086619" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, their update will land on September 26th and will allow players to summon the King Slime from Terraria:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can now reveal that, from the 26th of September, you’ll be able to summon a creature you’ll recognise as one of Terraria’s (pre-hardmode) heavy-damage dealers. That’s right, say hello to King Slime.<br/>
<br/>
This giant, royal blob doesn’t just spawn randomly, however. In fact, he’s a little bit like Omoroth in that you’ll need to summon him forth when you want to battle. “How do we summon him?” you ask. Well, that’s for us to know, and you to find out!<br/>
<br/>
Battling King Slime may be a challenge, but it could definitely be worth your while. Rumour has it that defeating King Slime will score you some pretty interesting loot that will make you the envy of your fellow explorers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, it seems like Terraria will be getting an update on September 28th (<a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1572612243115724802" target="_blank">source</a>) which sounds like another big one, and seems like the cross-over update will be bundled into it. For the Terraria side it will be this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cavelings are usually very hostile creatures, especially towards adventurers. That being said, there are one or two Cavelings that have proven friendly in the past (like the Caveling Merchants). It’s safe to say that Cavelings can be good company, in the right conditions, and it looks like you’re going to be able to make friends with one in Terraria.<br/>
<br/>
Introducing the Caveling Pet, a friendly Caveling Farmer that’ll follow your character around looking cute and offering a little moral support wherever you go. You’ll be able to summon this uncharacteristically docile Caveling in Terraria using a special item that you’ll also recognise from Core Keeper. We think it’ll be more fun for you to figure this one out yourselves, so we’ll say no more on the matter!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not a timed-event either, with the cross-over update being permanent additions to both games.</p>

      <title>HYPER DEMON is a vision-bending FPS from the creator of Devil Daggers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Devil Daggers was a great time-survival FPS and now the creator is back with HYPER DEMON, which will blow your tiny little mind. Well, it might blow your eyes wide open at least. It's nuts. Note: this was a personal purchase.</p>
<p>While Devil Daggers had you survive as long as possible, this one is a little different. Very similar in the basic idea but the entire style of it has been mangled and warped to be a thoroughly strange experience. Here you're chasing a score rather than a time too. It's ridiculously fast too and just hurt my poor brain. Check out the insane trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ScglDSi9KUs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6974c7424e4c37e75ea250801b04ab5c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ScglDSi9KUs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Much like the previous game the controls are simple, giving you only a few movement and weapon mechanics to master. However, it's easier said than done. The visuals become pretty overloading too, with what developer Sorath describes as "Groundbreaking spherical projection gives the player wide peripheral vision without pinching and shrinking the center of the screen like a traditional linear perspective, allowing fields of view up to 180 degrees" and you have to play it to really appreciate just how absolutely wild it is.</p>
<p>It really is Devil Daggers II with a different name, complete with what looks like re-used assets from it and a tweaked gameplay scoring mechanic but it's also a lot more than that and I'm thoroughly terrible at it. Watching some of the top replays just makes me sweat and wonder how the hell are some people that fast to react to, well, anything? Most of my runs end up with a minus score because I'm just too slow at it.</p>
<p>While there's no Native Linux release this time around, it does work just fine on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck with Proton 7. Performance in both cases seems just fine too. For Steam Deck though, there's no controller support so you're likely going to need to tweak the thumbpad and gyro to be any good at it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8N5ZAQpxqIw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a9e02d075a62c65421d5bfc6b02d27a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8N5ZAQpxqIw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1743850/HYPER_DEMON/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta lets you create a collection filtered by games you and friends own</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a rather useful feature Valve just added to a recent release of the Steam Beta Client. You can now filter your Steam Library based on what you and your Steam Friends own.</p>
<p>So you can create a collection, let's say to match up games that offer co-op with a certain friend so you can easily pick things to play together. Honestly, that's pretty fantastic. Here's an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10538352721663775435gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10538352721663775435gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I'm for sure going to be making great use of this. Since you can use it with dynamic collections, you'll always be up to date with people you pick to keep track of what to play.</p>
<p>Full <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6074815775741130447" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Games to Play Together</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now add Friends as a filter under Advanced Filtering in your Library. It will show games you have in common.</li>
<li>Right-click on any user in Chat or your Friends List to Find Games to Play Together and it will auto-populate your filter while also applying the Multiplayer tag.</li>
<li>Right-click a Group Chat header to do the same with smaller group chats or voice channels (8 members or less).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed web browser crash when loading certain blank URL's.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect placement of "Restore Window" button when client window is maximized.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sign In Dialog</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect icon placement when signing in using a QR code.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Some of what's new in version 1.2.0 / 1.2.1 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Split game information and properties into different windows.</li>
<li>Add list view.</li>
<li>Allow DLC to be queued up for downloading.</li>
<li>Always use cached DLC icons and thumbnails.</li>
<li>Cache information covers.</li>
<li>Allow setting wine executable per game.</li>
<li>Add GameMode support.</li>
<li>Add MangoHud support.</li>

<li>Show percentage when hovering over download progress bar.</li>
<li>Add option to disable update check per game.</li>
<li>Add forum, GOG Database and PCGamingWiki URLs to game information.</li>
<li>List genre as unknown in game information when none is found.</li>
<li>Improve error handling upon API errors.</li>
<li>Add Greek, Spanish, Norwegian Bokmål, Czech and Romanian translations.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a pretty great release!</p>

      <title>Isometric fantasy RPG Zoria: Age of Shattering gets a new demo and Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zoria: Age of Shattering from Tiny Trinket Games is not a name I've mentioned for a while but the developer is back with an updated demo and a Kickstarter campaign to finish it up.</p>
<p>"A squad-based tactical RPG with fluid turn-based combat, outpost, and follower management, set in the expansive Fantasy world of Zoria. Lead a team of four heroes with their unique skills and perks. Every team member contributes to undertaken battles."</p>
<p>It's been in development since 2018 and the team say they've finished about 80% of the content now. They've also teamed up with Anshar Publishing to help and now there's a crowdfunding campaign where they're hoping to raise at least €35,000 to finish it and add in new classes, locations, and mechanics and make the world more complex.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a1WlTf7dIvM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/548fd90312814a73b660b30be1fad8ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a1WlTf7dIvM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fluid and fast-paced turn-based combat in a dynamically changing environment. Keep a close eye on your surroundings, as an enemy walking by may unexpectedly join the fray to support their comrade in need.</li>
<li>The rich world of Zoria, with its dungeons, ruins, necropolises, and fortifications, is waiting to be explored.</li>
<li>Your outpost will be your base. From here, you can plan your next expedition, send selected party members on a mission, replenish resources, and make changes to your squad so that the skills of individual members match the task ahead of you.</li>
<li>Each duel you fight affects your team's fatigue level and depletes resources. Set up camp to craft potions, upgrade weapons, heal wounds and remove curses, and take a nap when you're done.</li>
<li>During the quests, you will often find yourself in seemingly inaccessible places. Use the unique abilities of each team member, and you will discover new, previously inaccessible areas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full release will be up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/zoria_age_of_shattering" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1159090/Zoria_Age_of_Shattering/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with a new demo available to try now. The demo and full release will have Native Linux support too.</p>
