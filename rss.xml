      <title>Nearly 40% of Linux gamers on Steam are on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out for June 2023, and it shows just how much the Linux share is now influenced by the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Overall the Steam Deck has kind of taken over Linux gaming and June 2023's statistic are pretty <em>striking</em>. For the last few months SteamOS was sitting in the low to mid 20% but it seems there's been a big uptick over the last month because it's jumped rather a lot.</p>
<p>According to Valve's stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 39.33% +14.01%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 8.33% -1.66%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 7.87% -1.85%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.02% -1.25%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 4.55% -0.91%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 4.37% -1.42%</li>
<li>Other 29.54% -3.38% </li>
</ul>
<p>We can expect that SteamOS Holo count to increase again, considering <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-deck-now-the-global-1-top-seller-on-steam/" target="_blank">how well the Steam Deck is selling</a> during the Steam Summer Sale 2023. Something to keep in mind though, is that for a lot of people the Steam Deck will be an additional system, not their only one used by Steam but you usually only get the survey on one machine.</p>
<p>The overall stats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.77% +0.63%</li>
<li>OSX 1.79% -0.60%</li>
<li>Linux 1.44% -0.03%</li>
</ul>
<p>Going by what Valve list that puts Linux use almost as high as the remaining Windows 7 and 8 machines noted in the survey results. </p>
<p>Latest details of the Linux user share over time can be seen on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a>.</p>

      <title>Evolution sim Thrive v0.6.3 gives a glimpse of the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free, open source and scientific! Thrive is an in-development evolution sim, with a new release out now adding in some more big prototypes for later-life stages.</p>
<p>After the last release adding in a prototype for being on land and seeing a civilization start to appear, this release goes even further. Now there's a prototypes for going from a single cell all the way into space. Sounds exciting but the keyword is <em>prototype</em>, don't expect anything fancy-looking. Thrive as a whole is still under heavy development. It's more the developers just showing off a bit and laying the groundwork for what's to come, to give you a sneaky peek at their wider plans.</p>
<p>On top of the new prototypes there's a few other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a new toxin damage sound (instead of reusing the emit sound).</li>
<li>Improved the placeholder tree and rocket graphics for the prototypes.</li>
<li>Added a system for window panels to reorder this makes draggable windows go on top of other such windows when they are moved around or opened.</li>
<li>Added a new feature to the museum screen to delete fossils.</li>
<li>Added miscellaneous fun screen filter shaders.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="V6qKN8F5I1M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/671fe51743be12532a264bad880b89e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/V6qKN8F5I1M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said that now all the main prototypes are in, they'll be going back to once again expand the microbe stage which is currently the most complete.</p>
<p>I love watching this game grow, it's already really fascinating in the early game and what they're doing with it is showing a lot of promise. Mechanically very interesting but they just need to keep iterating on the design to find more of the fun.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development or download it <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/" target="_blank">direct</a> or via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.revolutionarygamesstudio.ThriveLauncher" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>BattleBit Remastered is good fun but anti-cheat for Steam Deck &amp; Linux is concerning</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BattleBit Remastered is the current game climbing the ranks on Steam, made by a tiny team of only 3 people it has regularly seen tens of thousands of players. It works on Steam Deck and desktop Linux but the anti-cheat may turn into a big problem.</p>
<p>It's been seeing somewhere between 60 to 80 thousand people playing it each day at the same time, making it <em>constantly</em> in the top 5 most played games on Steam. Clearly people were after a Battlefield-like that isn't from EA and with the graphical style, it can run on pretty much anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18732598381688397217gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18732598381688397217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently it uses Easy Anti-Cheat, but they previously announced plans to switch to FACEIT, which would break it on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton. On the Steam forum, one of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/671860/discussions/4/6717729816414777432/?ctp=34#c3814034622527114302" target="_blank">their team noted</a> that's not quite the plan now, as they're going to look for something "in between EAC and FACEIT Anti Cheat in terms of requirements" - so it could still end up being something that doesn't work on Linux.</p>
<p>To make things more confusing, I spoke to the developer today and they said "Despite we have intentions to switch to FACEIT, we will keep the EAC as an option and still have servers that support EAC." — so they actually <em>are</em> still looking at FACEIT which will be a problem. Although keeping EAC will be good for Steam Deck / Linux, it may cause other problems. Using multiple anti-cheat may not be an easy thing to keep up for a tiny team.</p>
<p><em>So if you're looking at picking it up, just something to keep in mind.</em></p>
<p>See my video talking about it below:</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-6 is out now fixing up more games for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> has another release available (two actually) so here's a run over what's new for this community-maintained translation layer. This is the version of Proton <em>not</em> supported by Valve, so it may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do.</p>
<p><em>To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea.</em></p>
<p>Just recently both GE-Proton 8-5 and 8-6 were released. Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fixed FFXIV Hydaelyn new player intro video not playing (again)</li>
<li>Gears 5 now works with EAC without any workarounds needed. If you previously used proton-ge to play, go into the game folder and remove these folders:<br/>
/GearGame/Binaries/Steam/EasyAntiCheat-backup/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/GFSDK_Aftermath</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Then verify the integrity of the game files so that it re-downloads the originals.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>protonfix added for Two Worlds audio (thanks marciocr)</li>
<li>protonfix added for APB Reloaded (thanks telqor)</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>staging patches rebased</li>
<li>steam_helper updates imported from upstream</li>
<li>imported kaldi, openfst, vosk-api modules from upstream</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't actually need GE-Proton for Gears 5 though to be clear. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/gears-5-gets-updated-to-improve-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">game was updated</a> and it works with Proton 7.</p>
<p><strong>Text Guide to install GE-Proton:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: simply download ProtonUp-Qt from Discover in Desktop Mode (Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Make sure it's set to Steam at the top and select to install GE-Proton.</li>
<li>Reload Steam to update the compatibility layer list.</li>
<li>In Steam:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: right click a game and go to Properties.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: find the game in your library, go to the little cog on the right and then select Properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; Tick the box, select GE-Proton from the drop-down</li>
</ul>

      <title>Reminder: Update your PC info for our statistics page</title>
      <author>gamingonlinux</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is the public once a month reminder to make sure your PC information is correct on your user profiles. A fresh batch of statistics is generated around the start of each month. Also a good reminder of our stats system for people who don't know about it. There's now a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/5707/" target="_blank">dedicated Forum Topic</a> for <em>ongoing</em> discussions and you can <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/users/statistics" target="_blank">view the statistics on this page.</a></p>
<p><em>You need to be logged in to see when you last updated your PC info!</em></p>
<p>PC Info is automatically purged if it hasn't been updated, or if you don't click the link to remain in for 5 years. This way we prevent too much stale data and don't hold onto your data for longer than required. If this is still correct and it has been a long time since you updated, you can simply <strong><a href="#" id="pc_info_update" target="_self">click here to continue</a> to be included</strong>. If this isn't correct, <a href="/usercp.php?module=pcinfo" target="_blank">click here to go to your User Control Panel to update it!</a></p>
<div class="all-ok" id="pc_info_done"></div>
<p>This is now going out at the start of each month, to give people a chance to talk over the stats from a fresh month where it makes a bit more sense. And gives more time to adjust anything based on feedback for the next one.</p>
<p>Recently a few newer GPUs were added and some incomplete GPU naming was corrected based on feedback.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck now the global #1 top seller on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Summer Sale 2023 now in full swing, and with a big discount on the Steam Deck, it has risen back up the Steam charts. It's not a big surprise really, especially the top end model at a 20% discount marking the price down from £569 to £455.20. That's a pretty huge saving on one of the best PC handhelds around.</p>
<p>Looking over the stats today that Valve publishes, globally the Steam Deck has moved from fifth to first place. In the UK all models are currently listed as out of stock too, although they were all in stock yesterday when the sale went live. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4098533281688130326gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4098533281688130326gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Check stock in your own country <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">here</a>, or on <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp" target="_blank">Komodo</a> for certain regions in Asia.</p>
<p>For the UK, this likely stings a little for people who were about to purchase, as the 64GB and 256GB model have been constantly out of stock for some time now. Valve did not reply to my previous email asking about plans for increasing stock on those models in the UK.</p>
<p>Good news for Valve though as it shows how ridiculously popular the Steam Deck remains. Even before the sale, it has been consistently in the Top 5 on the global sales list. The list is by <em>revenue </em>though, not units sold, but when you note that it's up against games that sell multiple hundreds of thousands (and millions at times) — they're shifting a lot for what is still quite a niche device overall.</p>
<p>Did you pick one up? </p>

      <title>Part 4 of the Wine work for Wayland is now merged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/2944" target="_blank">fourth part</a> of an ongoing series of submission to Wine to get full Wayland support has been merged in. The merge request was opened 4 weeks ago, and it was merged into the Wine project on June 29th.</p>
<p>With the focus of this most recent work to give the "minimum necessary infrastructure to display the contents of some simple, software rendered windows" as detailed by the developer it involved two major steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Associate a window with a Wayland surface and give it the <code class="inline-code">xdg_toplevel</code> role, so that the compositor can display it. We also have to implement the required initial <code class="inline-code">xdg_surface</code> configuration sequence to be able to safely (i.e., without the compositor disconnecting us with an error) attach buffers to the surface in step (2).</li>
<li>Implement the <code class="inline-code">window_surface</code> interface for the Wayland driver. For now we provide a simple (and suboptimal) <code class="inline-code">window_surface_flush</code> implementation: for each flush we create a new <code class="inline-code">wl_shm</code> buffer, copy the whole window contents (ignoring damaged bounds for now) into it and attach it to the target Wayland surface. In the next MR I will optimize this implementation in multiple ways: a. implement a buffer queue to avoid constantly allocating new buffers b. respect the damaged bounds of the <code class="inline-code">window_surface</code> to minimize copying of data from the <code class="inline-code">window_surface</code> to the SHM buffer (and also for correctness) c. communicate damaged surface regions to the compositor to (potentially) allow more efficient texture uploads.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to this work many software rendered applications can now actually display dynamic content on screen with Wayland but you can't interacct with them just yet. Small steps but it's a pretty big project to get moving from X11 to Wayland.</p>
<p>For those of you not clear on why it's needed: Wine currently needs X11 and so if you're on Wayland you'll be running things through XWayland (basically X running under Wayland like a compatibility layer). This adds more complexity to it and more ways performance could be reduced. Obviously the ideal situation is to just have Wine and Wayland talk directly with no extra middle layer.</p>
<p>The end result will mean Wine will work on Wayland without needing XWayland. This work should be in the next release with Wine 8.12 due out next weekend with their usual bi-weekly development releases.</p>

      <title>Valve appear to be banning games with AI art on Steam (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 01/07/2023</strong> - Valve sent over a statement here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are continuing to learn about AI, the ways it can be used in game development, and how to factor it in to our process for reviewing games submitted for distribution on Steam. Our priority, as always, is to try to ship as many of the titles we receive as we can. The introduction of AI can sometimes make it harder to show a developer has sufficient rights in using AI to create assets, including images, text, and music. In particular, there is some legal uncertainty relating to data used to train AI models. It is the developer's responsibility to make sure they have the appropriate rights to ship their game.</p>
<p>We know it is a constantly evolving tech, and our goal is not to discourage the use of it on Steam; instead, we're working through how to integrate it into our already-existing review policies. Stated plainly, our review process is a reflection of current copyright law and policies, not an added layer of our opinion.  As these laws and policies evolve over time, so will our process.</p>
<p>We welcome and encourage innovation, and AI technology is bound to create new and exciting experiences in gaming. While developers can use these AI technologies in their work with appropriate commercial licenses, they can not infringe on existing copyrights.</p>
<p>Lastly, while App-submission credits are usually non-refundable, we're more than happy to offer them in these cases as we continue to work on our review process.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Here's an interesting one on Steam publishing for you. Valve appear to be clamping down on AI art used in games due to the murky legal waters. AI art is such a huge topic of discussion everywhere right now, as is other forms of "AI" like ChatGPT and it's just — everywhere. I can't seem to get away from talk on it from people for and against it.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/142j3yt/valve_is_not_willing_to_publish_games_with_ai/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, a developer who tried to release their game on Steam got word back from Valve that they have denied listing it. Here's what they sent the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all of the necessary rights.</p>
<p>After reviewing, we have identified intellectual property in [Game Name Here] which appears to belongs to one or more third parties. In particular, [Game Name Here] contains art assets generated by artificial intelligence that appears to be relying on copyrighted material owned by third parties. As the legal ownership of such AI-generated art is unclear, we cannot ship your game while it contains these AI-generated assets, unless you can affirmatively confirm that you own the rights to all of the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create the assets in your game.</p>
<p>We are failing your build and will give you one (1) opportunity to remove all content that you do not have the rights to from your build.</p>
<p>If you fail to remove all such content, we will not be able to ship your game on Steam, and this app will be banned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That developer mentioned they tweaked the artwork, so it wasn't so obviously AI generated and spoke to Valve again but Valve once again rejected it noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience as we reviewed [Game Name Here] and took our time to better understand the AI tech used to create it. Again, while we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all of the necessary rights. At this time, we are declining to distribute your game since it’s unclear if the underlying AI tech used to create the assets has sufficient rights to the training data.</p>
<p>App credits are usually non-refundable, but we’d like to make an exception here and offer you a refund. Please confirm and we’ll proceed.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the current issues with AI art and how it's generated, this really seems like a no-brainer for Valve to deny publishing games that have AI art unless the developers of the games can prove fully they own the full rights. Their own <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect" target="_blank">guidelines</a> are pretty clear on it, developers cannot publish games on Steam they don't have "adequate rights" to.</p>
<p>That said, this is a difficult topic to fully address. With the tools Valve will be using to flag these games, how will they be dealing with false positives? It's not likely Valve will be individually personally going over every game with a human checking it, and algorithms can be problematic. It's going to be interesting to see how this develops over time. Seems like more developers will need to have everything they need ready to ensure they can prove ownership of all artwork.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve to see if they have any comments on it to share.</p>
<p><em>What do you think about this? Let me know in the comments.</em></p>

      <title>AMD RADV gets feature to help emulation and translation layers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Some fun news for AMD GPU owners with the open source RADV (Vulkan) Mesa driver, as it recently gained support for fragment shader interlock. This will be useful for emulation and translation layers.</p>
<p>The merge request for this work was opened <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22250" target="_blank">back in April</a>, with it being merged into Mesa a few days ago so it should hopefully be available in the Mesa 23.2 release due out in August. From the developer: "This merge request adds an implementation of <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock</a> (Primitive Ordered Pixel Shading — POPS — in AMD hardware terms), a <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK/issues/108" target="_blank">highly demanded</a> feature in the emulation community (including for the Xbox 360 emulator I'm working on, Xenia), and one of the requirements of Direct3D feature level 12_1."</p>
<p>Where is it actually used? According to the dev various translation layers, emulators and games have support for it including: DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, the Zink driver, the Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx, the Xbox 360 emulator Xenia, the PlayStation 2 emulator Play!, a few games need it too like A Plague Tale: Requiem, GRID 2, Just Cause 3 and so on.</p>
<p>Overall it clearly seems rather useful to have and should make the gaming experience on AMD GPUs with RADV even better</p>

      <title>Steam Summer Sale 2023 is live with the Steam Deck up to 20% off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today the Steam Summer Sale 2023 is live once again, where a great many developers put up big discounts for their games. You know the drill right? Your wallet is already hiding from you.</p>
<p>Not only are lots and lots of games on sale but the Steam Deck is as well. You can pick up the 64GB model with 10% off, the 256GB model with 15% off and the 512GB model with 20% off right now. Interestingly, the two lower models have been out of stock in the UK for a while but now they're back in stock - I wonder if Valve were hoarding a bunch ready for the sale expecting many to get sold at once.</p>
<p>Valve also put up a special <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/decktop100" target="_blank">Top 100 page for the Steam Deck</a> so you can easily scroll down through a nice list with discounts and expected compatibility with Deck Verified ratings. You can also get the Steam Deck on sale on <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">Komodo</a> for select regions.</p>
<p>Valve made a trailer for the event too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sWevbtmmTVk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/af6bb83415c5625fd70e497c84072947.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sWevbtmmTVk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As always - if you find a particularly good deal for a game that works on Linux or Steam Deck be sure to comment and give over your own recommendations. I'm currently going over my own wishlist but my pile of shame is already rather long at this point.</p>
<p>For a few quick picks I can recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/" target="_blank">Valheim</a> (40% off, highest discount yet), I will also never not recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a> (67% off) both great co-op games. Now that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank">Dead by Daylight</a> (60% off) works great I can also suggest that as great fun.</p>
<p>Valve also has a few little treats with a free sticker to claim each day, a new seasonal badge in the Points Shop, two new Artist Profiles and some chances to earn Summer Sale trading cards to level up your Summer Sale Badge.</p>
<p>Check out the sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>. The Steam Summer Sale 2023 lasts until July 13th at 10am PT / 5pm UTC.</p>

      <title>System76 reveal the &#39;Nebula&#39; a new PC case for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After building up their in-house manufacturing capabilities with their custom Thelio desktop and their Launch keyboards, System76 are now expanding into PC cases for everyone.</p>
<p>I always loved the look of the Thelio, as did many others, and people have been asking System76 for quite some time to provide <em>just</em> the case and so the Nebula is their answer. Available across three different sizes based on their Thelio, Thelio Mira and Thelio Major desktops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nebula 19: $199 - 12.87′′ × 8.15′′ × 11.46′′ (327 × 207 × 291mm) - Mini ITX</li>
<li>Nebula 36: $269 - 17.18′′ × 9.96′′ × 12.56′′ (436 × 253 × 319mm) - Mini ITX, MicroATX, and ATX</li>
<li>Nebula 49: $329 - 18.15′′ × 10.28′′ × 16.06′′ (461 × 261 × 408mm) - ATX and EATX</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of them has a customizable accent stripe too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17115642621688027946gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2998397271688027932gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>System76 say they were designed for easy access to all components, with a removable lid giving you easy access from multiple angles. "Nebula’s a pleasure to work in," says Thomas Zimmerman, System76 Happiness Team Manager and experienced PC builder. He added that often when working with cases from other brands, he’d come away with cuts on his hands. Not the case with System76, who sees repairability as an important consideration for a final product.</p>
<p>Plenty of room for GPUs too with the <em>19</em> fitting up to 272.3mm, <em>36</em> up to 312mm and <em>49</em> up to 390.5mm. So the top end model should be big enough for practically any GPU with room for future-proofing.</p>
<p>With this being a specially designed case, there's some extras you can get for it too. System76 offers an upgrade where you get their CPU coolers, additional GPU intake fans and a SARA backplane for drive hot-swapping.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18028826311688028426gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20359580931688028393gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Click to enlarge - nebula36.</em></p>
<p>Talking about thermals, here's what System76 had to say: "Thermal engineering plays a role in power yield, too. As your system heats up, components become throttled and reduce performance. To get the most out of the components you have, System76 offers an upgrade for Nebula which includes the tested and recommended CPU coolers and additional GPU intake fans used in THELIO desktops. Nebula features separate CPU and GPU cooling systems. The CPU is cooled with a dedicated intake vent and duct with a series of fans pulling cool air across the CPU cooler and pushing hot air out of the exhaust. Vents at the end of the CPU duct allow GPU heat to radiate into the hot air portion of the duct for additional GPU exhaust. GPUs are cooled with a large 140MM bottom intake fan and an optional 120MM side intake fan. A guide on recommended fan placement will be available upon setup."</p>
<p>Max size of the air cooler it will fit when using their CPU duct:</p>
<ul>
<li>nebula19: 125mm H (148mm H w/o duct) × 95mm W × 68mm D</li>
<li>nebula36: 160mm H (190mm H w/o duct) × 137mm W × 80mm D</li>
<li>nebula49: 160mm H (200mm H w/o duct) × 137mm W × 120mm D</li>
</ul>
<p>Liquid cooler support:</p>
<ul>
<li>nebula19: not supported</li>
<li>nebula36: 120mm radiator</li>
<li>nebula49: 120mm radiator</li>
</ul>
<p>At the top of the system you'll also get a few easy-access ports including USB-C, USB-A, mic-in, and headphone-out.</p>
<p>Really great to see System76 continue to expand their hardware. I look forward to more from them! What do you think to this case, would you be interested in picking one up? If so what size would you be going for?</p>

      <title>The SHARGE Disk could be a useful Steam Deck storage sidekick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm currently keeping an eye on the SHARGE Disk, a really small M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure that can plug directly into the Steam Deck (and many other devices). Mentioned briefly in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/a-round-up-of-recent-steam-deck-news-for-you/" target="_blank">recent news round-up</a>, this device looks like it could be really useful.</p>
<p>There's many different types of SSD enclosures and it's not a new idea <em>but</em> it does look good. The compact size and portability, plus the cooling fan and drop-proof casing all add up to a device that I feel like I need to carry around with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SHARGE Disk is an ultra-lightweight and small portable M.2 NVMe SSD with Active Heat Dissipation System, with 2TB (Maximum) capacity and high read/write speeds of up to 1000 MB/s. It features an aluminum shell and a silicone case for any unpredictable circumstances. SHARGE Disk is the perfect choice for those who often carry EDC devices, such as phones, cameras, and laptops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it's being funded via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shargetech/sharge-disk-the-ultimate-storage-solution-for-edc-device" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with around £327,682 in pledges from 3,603 backers so there's a fair bit of interest in this little device. Their trailer even shows it with a Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lPNTY9ZWClA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f74461e7cf98798c059c6aa532a8bb40.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lPNTY9ZWClA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full kit with the drop-proof case and wrap-around cable costs around £42 but just the enclosure will be about £32. Seems like quite a reasonable price. Check it out on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shargetech/sharge-disk-the-ultimate-storage-solution-for-edc-device" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you find it useful? One thing I seem to always been running out of is drive space, so this could prove very useful in a pinch to get some more games with me.</p>

      <title>Cassette Beasts adds new monsters, plus multiplayer and DLC coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is easily one of the best releases this year, and possibly one of the best creature / monster collecting games in modern times too. It's also about to get bigger!</p>
<p>Not only have they just release the free 1.2 Catacombs Update which gives players a new hidden location to find with eight new monsters including: 3 alternate remastered forms of existing monsters, 4 new monsters to discover in the world and 1 secret unique monster. There's also 10 new moves that include: a new attack, several around status effects and 4 new passives. Update trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_HR4rkbXNpE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44714f99bd27e3031d44ae8a910a90a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_HR4rkbXNpE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even more exciting though, is that big things are coming to the game including multiplayer! You'll be able to explore, trade and do raids together with up to 8 people. There's no exact date yet for it, because implementing multiplayer is quite a big thing for a small team. Not just that, an expansion has been teased with Pier of the Unknown.</p>
<p>This was announced during their Cassette Beasts Showcase that you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QOMkvnoCCe0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e214a5c3eed33c7868f3a7870b50551.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QOMkvnoCCe0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Quite a nice tune at the end of the above video…</em></p>
<p>Cassette Beasts has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. You can buy it on:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you own a Corsair keyboard or mouse? Well you should take a look at ckb-next, which just had a new release bringing support for even more new hardware. Created by the community, this is not an official Corsair app. Like a lot of hardware vendors, they don't have direct hardware support.</p>
<p>This app lets you customise pretty much everything you need from mouse DPI to individual keyboard key RGB lighting. Newly supported devices in v0.6.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>K55 RGB PRO.</li>
<li>K55 RGB PRO XT.</li>
<li>K60 PRO (Monochrome).</li>
<li>K60 PRO TKL RGB.</li>
<li>Dark Core RGB Pro (experimental).</li>
<li>Dark Core RGB Pro SE (experimental).</li>
<li>Slipstream wireless dongle (when paired with a single supported device).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/886347921688030596gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/886347921688030596gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The device previews are now rendered using the GPU.</li>
<li>Horizontal scrolling is now available for binding.</li>
<li>The mute indicator can now indicate either the default output or input audio device.</li>
<li>The music visualizer now supports automatic gain control, automatically adapting to volume changes.</li>
<li>It is now possible to pair wireless devices with dongles (not in GUI yet).</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code class="inline-code"><kbd>Fn</kbd></code> key now behaves as expected on the K65.</li>
<li>The GUI now accepts macros containing the ISO backslash key.</li>
<li>A workaround is now implemented to prevent the media keys on the Strafe from getting stuck pressed.</li>
<li>The daemon no longer crashes with a <code class="inline-code">buffer overflow detected</code> message on start under certain conditions.</li>
<li>The WinLock LED now functions on the K55 RGB and K55 RGB Pro XT.</li>
<li>The GUI no longer crashes under certain conditions when the sound server is being restarted.</li>
<li>The battery states are now reported correctly in the GUI.</li>
<li>The brightness is now correctly set for newer devices (and the lights now turn off instantly).</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see another very useful open source project continuing to improve. Version 0.6.0 was release last week on June 22nd. See <a href="https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next" target="_blank">more about it on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress getting close to a Linux release on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress from Bay 12 Games and Kitfox Games just had a big tech upgrade, and it sounds like their Native Linux release is coming quite soon.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3655282771707693473" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they mentioned the game has now been upgraded from the ancient SDL to SDL 2, along with many optimisations. SDL 2 being a good "stepping stone to ports" and they have "Linux compiling and playable; it just needs some testing" — so we're getting close.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15606391901688029090gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15606391901688029090gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not only that they've also added in experimental multithreading to make the game faster and smoother. Additionally some new tree graphics and grass ramps were added as well. While all this is going on they're also working on the adventure mode, the "long work" of updating various menus and adding in more audio has begun.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not just generated geometry -- a whole simulated world. Generated rise and fall of civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures, etc. Infinite hours of gameplay.</li>
<li>Now with beautiful pixel graphics!</li>
<li>Learn the basics with in-game tutorials.</li>
<li>A lifetime “living” project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight.</li>
<li>Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise.</li>
<li>A new endless hobby, just for you!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall the Steam release has gone well for them, as they made over <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/dwarf-fortress-made-over-7-million-in-january/" target="_blank">$7 million in January</a>. Sales fall off pretty rapidly though but according to their <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=181715.0" target="_blank">June 2023</a> report they're still seeing around 200-300 sales per day. Considering how much they've made this year, they'll be able to work on it for a very very long time.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress on Steam</a>. It currently has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating from over 19,000 players.</p>

      <title>Blender v3.6 is out now as a new long-term support release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing many companies how open source can be seriously successful, <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> version 3.6 is out now and it's a long-term support release so it would be good to upgrade and stick with it for a while.</p>
<p>With some of the new features including: hardware ray-tracing acceleration for AMD and Intel graphics cards, although the AMD side is not supported on Linux yet. There's now an asset bundle with a collection of human base meshes ready for people to sculpt, animate, texture and so on. You'll also find UI improvements, much improved text editing, multi-threading for Cycles' Light Tree and lots more</p>
<p>Not only is it crammed full of new features but the developers also improved performance, and in some cases quite dramatically so. It will use 25% less memory with large geometries, better performance when exiting edit mode, 75% faster mesh conversion with multiple UV maps, extracting UV map data is up to 3x faster, you can see up to 44% better performance in mashes with custom split normal data and the list of performance upgrades goes on.</p>
<p>Check out their fancy release video below:</p>

      <title>Aliens: Dark Descent is very real-time XCOM and I love it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally, another Aliens game to sink my teeth into. I've been playing Aliens: Dark Descent and overall I'm pretty damn happy with the experience. Played on Linux desktop (Fedora KDE) and Steam Deck with Proton Experimental, overall it's scratched an itch I've had since blasting through XCOM 2.</p>
<p>It is very much in the spirit of XCOM, there's clearly plenty inspired by it, but Aliens: Dark Descent is a very different violent beast that knows how to cut the power. While XCOM is turn-based, this is a real-time tactical-action game. You're constantly thinking on your toes, often while running for cover to prevent being spotted or just generally running away while your marines get stressed out and get dragged away by aliens.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5554234141687887413gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5554234141687887413gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here stealth is much more the point rather than going in guns blazing. You may control a squad of absolute bad-asses with sharp sticks and pulse rifles, but getting swarmed by aliens is likely to go pretty badly. Here you want to actively try and avoid them with the help of your motion tracker, that gives the all too familiar and terrifying beep when it gets a signal. The more you're spotted and you engage the aliens, the worse the mission will get over time as they will eventually get very aggravated and swarm you.</p>
<p>An interesting mechanic you have here is that missions aren't a one-and-done thing. You can enter a mission, do a bit and extract if it went a bit badly. To then come back to it with a refreshed squad to finish it off. It's a nice touch and quite necessary actually, since it's a <em>tough</em> game. However, each day that passes will make the missions progressively more difficult to do as the alien infestation grows - so you'll still want to try and do as much as you can in one go. However, once you've started a mission, going back to it later allows you to even select your entry point.</p>
<p><em>Thankfully the somewhat lengthy prologue eases you firmly into it, showcasing the controls and character abilities, while setting up the story of the main campaign.</em></p>
<p>The open feel of the campaign is the highlight though. Not only can you bug-out and come back later, but the order in which you do various parts of the missions is up to you. Since the mission areas can be quite large, you're also given an APC to ferry your marines to various points across the map. Not only does it speed some of the travel time up, but it also has a great big turret on it and will smash through any aliens that come near it during travel and when it's parked up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20204851751687887418gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20204851751687887418gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it is a real-time action game, you do get a little bit of time to breathe. Your marines have various skills, and when you bring up the skills menu it will slow down time. Not only that, but in the options you can swap that over to a complete pause if you prefer it. Speaking of skills, it also has the individual marine level ups found in other squad-based games, so you can level them all up and give them special abilities - which will come in handy as the game goes on.</p>
<p>In between missions at your base you'll also be able to do various things like unlock new weapons, assign medics to treat your marines a little quicker and there's even some special events that appear. The problem with the events is that there's always a downside. Some might give you an extra person but you'll skip a day of deploying your marines - resulting in a bigger infestation. Others might present you with marines that have issues, and you have to pick who you deal with. There's always something to consider even outside of the real-time action.</p>
<p>You can see some previous thoughts on playing it on Steam Deck in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BrsKAvKRDP0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0492ad78c3461e905e1fd466ab3d7089.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BrsKAvKRDP0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Steam Deck, in short, it's not quite there yet. I wouldn't recommend it but I also wouldn't completely tell you not to get it. While it has some performance issues, a lot of it can stick to 30FPS. Valve have it officially rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck due to performance, so I truly hope Tindalos Interactive can get some optimizations in to get it to properly stick to 30FPS on Steam Deck. That, plus some text size scaling and it would be golden.</p>
<p>Since the above video, the developer has already solved one of the most annoying issues - the marines shouting the same voice lines while moving constantly. They've toned it down a bit now and it's <em>much</em> nicer. More patches are also confirmed to be on the way.</p>
<p>It's a pretty ambitious game and while enjoyable, I do wish there were slightly more tactical options. Your squad is always together, so there's no chance of splitting them to do any kind of special manoeuvre. It's all about their abilities together as a whole which often ends up as placing down a turret, setting one to throw a flare and another to suppress the enemies with bullets as they come running at you. Atmospherically fantastic but mechanically quite streamlined.</p>
<p>During some fights you'll be frantically clicking around, as various types of alien creatures are coming at you. Some will knock your marines down, destroy your turrets, pick them up and eat them and plenty more ways to die. Thankfully, at least at the default difficulty I was playing at, the game tends to warn you when a major encounter is going to happen so you get a little bit of time to prepare.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/408767611687961256gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/408767611687961256gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The script is another issue, it falls pretty flat quite often. Some of what they say just feels…stupid. It's a relatively minor point overall, but it at times feels like a sci-fi B movie script where they're just so dumb. The action at least makes up for that most of the time. Although it commits a bit of a sin here where the aliens are the most interesting thing, and yet at one point you end up fighting off a bunch of idiotic cult-like humans that are basically useless. I want aliens!</p>
<p>On desktop Linux with my NVIDIA 2080 Ti and Ryzen 5800X, with the graphical preset set to High at 2560x1440 resolution I've been seeing around 60FPS generally. Mostly above it but it does dip below now and then. Which for this type of game is absolutely fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15549811041687887474gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15549811041687887474gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot to like about this one. Overall I'm very happy with the experience. Tindalos Interactive are clear fans of the source material, with Aliens being one of the greatest sci-fi action films ever made (I'll fight anyone on that) and I hope there's more to come for this game and from the developer in other games.</p>
<p>I will recommend playing it with Proton Experimental, as Proton 8 gave me a few Unreal Engine crash screens which I haven't seen with Proton Experimental.</p>

      <title>One Lonely Outpost to get Linux support around the full release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bit of a development hiccup changing developers after the crowdfunding campaign, One Lonely Outpost has hit Early Access with Linux support planned later. Originally being developed by Aurorian Studios, they announced their publisher Freedom Games was taking over development back in September 2022.</p>
<p>More about it: "You're the first pioneer to hit the surface of a barren, alien world - a desolate expanse as far as the eye can see. Your job is simple: Take your Space-RV, power up your multipurpose tech gauntlet, and use whatever seeds found in the cargo to start a new life on this world. Over time, you'll make the planet life-sustaining for yourself and dozens of future colonists. But until then, it's going to be one lonely outpost..."</p>
<p>It arrived in Early Access on June 26th, you can see the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x0JifkPKl-M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce01146dd6503b8f410a1c888dac0388.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x0JifkPKl-M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Linux support was a goal during the Kickstarter campaign, and it appears they will be sticking with it. However it's not likely until the full 1.0 release as their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1465550/discussions/0/5188758291789345817/" target="_blank">FAQ</a> mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Early Access will only be available for PC, but we plan to bring the game to all major consoles (Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation) with or shortly after the 1.0 release along with Mac and Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your colonist’s farming adventures. Will you explore? Plant? Craft? FIsh? Build a close-knit community? Or all of them at once?</li>
<li>Fill out the Omninac by experiencing life on the new planet. Categorize crops, minerals, seasons, animals, and more!</li>
<li>Terraform the desert with a trusty robotic pet. Fertilize the ground, secure water sources, and make the air breathable.</li>
<li>Farm, mine, explore, and carve out a habitat for humanity.</li>
<li>Build your colony from the ground up. Your loneliness will be over once you can attract some colonists - but that is just the beginning!</li>
<li>Discover a robust menu of meals to cook - you can't explore a new world on an empty stomach!</li>
<li>A plethora of fish and bugs also inhabit the planet - go uncover them to fill out your collection!</li>
<li>Usher in a new dawn for humanity, building a genuine off-world utopia for your colonists.</li>
<li>Connect with your newfound community, cultivate relationships, and who knows, maybe even find love among the pioneers?</li>
<li>And just as important as the future, delve into the past of the old world. Just what lies hidden beneath this ancient planet's surface...?</li>
</ul>

      <title>Planetary Life is a neat looking indie sandbox evolution sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Sotenbox recently put up a trailer for Planetary Life, a pretty neat looking entry into the evolution simulation genre. Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it should have no problems running nicely on Linux machines.</p>
<p>Starting off from an uninhabited planet in place, you'll progress through to a full ecosystem full of life. You'll get to shape everything as you mess with mountains, seas, the climate and add in various forms of life. These creatures will even eventually form their own civilisations. It looks and sound pretty ambitious but when you check out the trailer, you'll see clearly what the developer is going for.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="psa5dbRt8v8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aeadf9f6b2439eae7cbeee870317d627.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/psa5dbRt8v8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Love the little creature creator, seems like a game full of charm - can't wait to give it a go once it's out. Indie developers keep coming up with little gems like this. Mixing together the creature simulation with the ways you can change the atmosphere sounds like it could make for some interesting and possibly hilarious gameplay. Reminds me of World Box but on a bigger scale.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2471970/Planetary_Life/" target="_blank">follow it along on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh goodie, goodbye again free time. Remember the classic Theme Hospital? CorsixTH is a free, open source and cross-platform game engine to keep it looking good on modern systems and a new release is getting close.</p>

</ul>
<p>Find out more about CorsixTH on the <a href="https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It requires that you provide the original data files which you can buy on <a href="https://gog.com/game/theme_hospital" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>Projects like this really make me love the open source community. There's so many classic games that have some sort of game engine reimplementation, to make sure they keep working on modern platforms. Theme Hospital is an absolute classic too, fully deserves to be enjoyed by more players.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck compatibility with Starfield to be discussed &#34;later down the road&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starfield is set to release on September 6th and there's obviously a lot of excitement around it but will it work on Valve's Steam Deck? That's not currently clear.</p>
<p>In a chat with Kinda Funny Games in a video released on June 22nd, one of the hosts Mike brings up the issue of accessibility with Todd Howard of Bethesda. Howard mentions that Starfield will have a "large font mode" which really helps readability due to all the text and specifically mentioned it works better for <em>handhelds</em>.</p>
<p>So after this the same host popped the question about whether Starfield will be "Steam Deck compatible", to which Howard replies "We'll talk about that later down the road". It's clear it won't support Linux <em>directly</em> but the real questions are: how well will it work with Valve's Proton? Will it scale down enough to the Steam Deck to at least be a smooth 30FPS? Obviously right now they're not going to be confirming anything.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AIbnDyv6g1c?rel=0&amp;start=684"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/827513a7bc5bb8dbf03c9ac859c3bf8c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AIbnDyv6g1c?rel=0&amp;start=684" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What we can hope is that it has enough options to scale down the settings, and have the latest AMD FSR to really help keep the performance level. I'm excited, so I will no doubt take a look at release.</p>
<p>You can pre-order on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starfield?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1716740/STARFIELD/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: turns out AMD are the official partner, and so it will be optimized for AMD and FSR 2 which is potentially good news for Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Valve pulls in another graphics driver developer for Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve clearly still have plenty of big ambitions for Linux gaming and Steam Deck, and as it turns out recently they pulled in yet another developer to work on open source graphics drivers.</p>
<p>As pointed out in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> today, Alyssa Rosenzweig updated their <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> to note the latest work being "Valve (May 2023 - Present; contractor): Develop upstream graphics drivers to improve Linux gaming".</p>
<p>For those who don't know the name, Rosenzweig works on Asahi Linux for the reverse-engineering of the Apple Silicon GPU. Rosenzweig also previously worked for the open source consulting firm Collabora on Panfrost, the reverse-engineered open-source Linux drivers for Arm Mali GPUs.</p>
<p>Rosenzweig joins many others contracted by Valve to work on many different parts of Linux for gaming from the kernel to graphics drivers, Proton, Gamescope and multiple other projects. A lot of the work from Valve contractors has really helped improve both desktop Linux gaming and set the stage for the Steam Deck. </p>
<p><em>Valve are clearly in it for the long run.</em></p>

      <title>The open source NVIDIA NVK driver is coming along well</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A project I have a very keen eye on is NVK, the open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver developed by the community (not NVIDIA), and it seems like progress on it is going rather well. Developer Faith Ekstrand <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-update-enabling-new-extensions-conformance-status-more.html" target="_blank">wrote a bit</a> on the Collabora blog, detailing work that has been done since the original introduction post back in October last year.</p>
<p>Some highlighted feature improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for Maxwell and Kepler GPUs. Karol Herbst posted a merge request adding handling various state setup bits needed for shaders on older hardware back in August. However, even though Karol's branch existed for a while, it stopped working when I added a hard dependency the MME (Macro Method Expander) for draws and clears. Pre-Turing hardware support was finally unblocked by Mary and her work enabling the MME on older hardware. I also spent a week or two in December on Maxwell bug-fixing and it's not too far off Turing these days in terms of CTS pass rates.</li>
<li>Geometry, Tessellation, and transform feedback. While not required for Vulkan 1.0, these are pretty important features for running modern games. The codegen compiler back-end already supports them so that part was done. In November or so, George Ouzounoudis did the work to plumb them through NVK and enable the corresponding Vulkan features.</li>
<li>Thomas Anderson implemented VK_KHR_draw_indirect_count as well as flipping on a bunch of smaller extensions.</li>
<li>Echo has been playing around with NVK+DXVK a bit and has succeeded in getting some games playing. It's still early days and requires some hacks. However, there are a few titles working and I was able to demo Hollow Knight and F1 2017 at the Collabora meet-up in May.</li>
<li>Mohamed Ahmed is currently working on VK_KHR_sampler_ycbcr_conversion as his <a href="https://mohamexiety.github.io/posts/hello_world/" target="_blank">GSoC internship project</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also support for a great many more extensions, which means they're close to bumping up the version of Vulkan supported from 1.0 to potentially 1.3.</p>
<p>A lot of work is still to go, as it's not yet passing the conformance tests but all the work that has gone into the driver has meant "60% more" tests actually run compared with last year. No current timeline on when to expect NVK to be upstreamed into Mesa directly though, as it's coming along with a needed new kernel API.</p>
<p>As for the current performance? That's still to be worked on, as most of the work is just going into getting it all working with multiple problematic performance areas noted in the blog post. Work is also ongoing on a new back-end compiler for NVIDIA hardware, code-named NAK or Nvidia Awesome Kompiler.</p>
<p>There's a lot more in the post that's worth a <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-update-enabling-new-extensions-conformance-status-more.html" target="_blank">full read</a>.</p>
<p><em>Fun to see especially for me, as today is another day of booting up the GamingOnLinux work machine to be greeted by NVIDIA proprietary driver <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux/110615237707080232" target="_blank">problems</a>. Although it's not alone in <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux/110615291788911361" target="_blank">problems</a>. Today is just bug day apparently.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 10,000 verified and playable games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big milestone has just been hit for the Steam Deck, as there's now over 10,000 titles rated to be either Verified or Playable. This comes nearly two months <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/steam-deck-hits-over-9000-games-rated-verified-and-playable/" target="_blank">after it hit 9,000</a>.</p>
<p>The current lists are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Verified</strong> - 3472</li>
<li><strong>Playable</strong> - 6533</li>
<li><strong>Unsupported</strong> - 3110</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see this thanks to the <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> list. This includes titles that are unlisted on the Steam store but still downloadable for people who own the games so it's the best list to use.</p>
<p>Quite amazing to see such progress, for a device that has only been out for little over a year. A lot of this is thanks to Valve's work with Proton, since that enables a ridiculously huge amount of Windows games to be playable on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Proton is closing in on its 5 year anniversary soon too! Not to discount those developers fully supporting Native Linux builds too as it all adds up to the experience.</p>
<p>To be fully Steam Deck Verified, this is what developers need to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Input</strong> - The title should have full controller support, use appropriate controller input icons, and automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - The game should support the default resolution of Steam Deck (1280x800 or 1280x720), have good default settings, and text should be legible.</li>
<li><strong>Seamlessness</strong> - The title shouldn’t display any compatibility warnings, and if there’s a launcher it should be navigable with a controller.</li>
<li><strong>System Support</strong> - If running through Proton, the game and all its middleware should be supported by Proton. This includes anti-cheat support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the interesting games that recently gained a Playable or Verified status include:</p>

      <title>Top-down paper-folding puzzle adventure Paper Trail talks up Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more games for your Steam Deck or desktop Linux with Proton? Paper Trail looks very sweet and the developers are clearly big Steam Deck fans.</p>
<p>About it: "Paper Trail is a top-down puzzle adventure about leaving home, set in a foldable, paper world. You play as Paige, a budding academic, leaving home for the first time to pursue her studies. On the journey, you learn to fold the world, merging two sides to solve puzzles, explore new areas and uncover long-lost secrets."</p>
<p>In a post on Steam the developer mentioned how they "fell head over heels" for the Steam Deck so they've worked to ensure it plays perfectly with its controls. It now fully supports both the trackpads, touchscreen and the thumbsticks too. They said the trackpads were "just perfect for folding paper in the game". They've also worked on native 16:10 resolution support and it should run at a "silky smooth" 60FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1229172071687785887gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1229172071687785887gol1.gif"/></a><br/>
<em>Picture credit - Newfangled Games</em></p>
<p>Considering how well they said it runs on Steam Deck, there should be no reason it's not perfection with Proton on desktop Linux too!</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1889740/Paper_Trail/" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>. It releases in 2024 and there's a demo available.</p>

      <title>The King&#39;s Campaign will be playable on Steam Deck and Linux desktop at release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The King's Campaign from Reverie World Studios and Bad Logic Studios is releasing July 13th, and they've recently detailed work to improve it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What is it? An updated stand alone version of the Royal Blood DLC campaign for Reverie World Studios' top-selling game, Medieval Kingdom Wars, and includes the expanded map from the game's Greater World DLC and the optional Zombie Mode from the DLC of the same name. It's a mixture of grand-strategy and real-time strategy together.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2374280/announcements/detail/5729189223737346527" target="_blank">post on Steam</a> the developers noted they worked to ensure it looks good on Steam Deck after dealing with the issues Valve noted in a review. This includes better text sizing (along with the ability to make it even bigger), not showing the cursor until it's moved manually (say from a Steam Input config using a mouse on a trackpad) and removing the need to enter some text. This should solve the issues Valve highlighted to bump it to Verified at release.</p>
<p>The developer also noted how it should run on desktop Linux with Proton too, since it runs just fine on Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YHvudGsaTC8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de9a747ae76bfb6cdecf41db99826fc0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YHvudGsaTC8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Always good to see developer putting in the effort <em>before</em> a game is released!</p>

      <title>Micro-strategy and base building game Kingdom Eighties is out now </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kingdom Eighties is at least the 4th game in the series and it's a bit of a standalone spin-off, with a rather different setting compared with previous entries. While the previous games were all set hundreds of years ago, this brings things up a bit more recent since it's set in the 80s.</p>
<p>"You play as The Leader, a young camp counselor who will have to defend their town and family from the relentless attack of the mysterious Greed. What are these monsters, and why are they trying to steal their family legacy, the Crown of Creation?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CyRava_eWX8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7f40cfaa95e79a382101a2d1cbc83dbb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CyRava_eWX8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building upon the well-known mechanics from the previous Kingdom games, Kingdom Eighties will deep dive into the lore and worldbuilding of the series. And if you're new to it, the story elements will fluently guide you through the gameplay mechanics.</li>
<li>You will meet three supporting characters along the way: The Champ, The Tinkerer, and The Wiz. Each one has different abilities that you can combine to solve puzzles and find the solution to each level.</li>
<li>The summer camp is just the beginning! You will travel through different locations never seen before in the Kingdom series. Find some fresh wheels at the skateboard park, visit the shops on Main Street, and free the New Lands Mall from the Greed.</li>
<li>Kingdom's iconic, handcrafted art style is back, now with a neon touch coming directly from the eighties aesthetics. Chill and vibe with the synthwave OST from Andreas Hald, and travel back to the wonder days of bike riding and summer camps, when everything seemed possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1956040/Kingdom_Eighties/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Gears 5 gets updated to improve Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gears 5 from The Coalition and Xbox Game Studios recently had an update that should make it work better on Steam Deck with Proton. Really nice to see another Xbox published title look to improve things!</p>
<p>The update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1097840/view/3660911636356230751" target="_blank">notes</a> were short and sweet noting "Updates to provide access to Steam Deck" and no other information. It was also recently rated as Steam Deck Playable by Valve using Proton 8. Without any issues now, you should be able to just load up into the campaign.</p>
<p>However, the multiplayer won't work out of the box <em>but</em> simply switching to Proton 7 should fix that. Seems like this may be a regression in Proton 8. So for now, for the best experience, just go into the compatibility settings and set Proton 7. There is a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/3042#issuecomment-1605227848" target="_blank">bug report</a> with various info noted already confirming Proton 7 works so hopefully Valve will be looking into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13319580531687771642gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13319580531687771642gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not unusual to see newer versions of Proton have issues, which Valve eventually fix up. We've seen a few Proton Experimental releases recently (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/proton-experimental-fixes-up-ea-app-grounded-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank">like from June 24th</a>) that continue fixing up regressions. This happens because when Proton jumps a major version like 7 - 8, there's just thousands of changes in the Wine version it's based on and it would be impossible to find all issues. So no doubt sometime soon it will be fixed up for the latest Proton too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097840/Gears_5/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The latest Volcanoids update looks electrifying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Volcanoids is pretty great and a game I keep going back to with each major update, and it looks like they're going to sucker me right in again. A co-op survival game that replaces a static base with a big moving drill-ship - what's not to love?</p>
<p>The latest "Tesla Update" looks rather electrifying giving you access to a Tesla Cannon. This new weapon will fire an electric beam that hits multiple targets at once dealing constant damage. It can even be used to shoot down incoming projectiles and it has a secondary-fire that puts up a shield for you. On top of that there's also a Tesla Rifle, which shoots lots of quick zaps to stun various enemies.</p>
<p>Even more was added like Tesla Turrets for your drill-ship, Tesla Turret Drones you can build to fortify an area, Mini Tesla Turrets for inside your drill-ship and they also added EMP Grenades and Mortars. However, you're not the only one with all this electrical tech — the enemy robots cogs have it too. Just take a look at the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UPBS3oKbdm8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e3ac48c7f9d3f5140d6a5bd4fdb59cb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UPBS3oKbdm8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/volcanoids?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/951440/Volcanoids/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Brotato 1.0 is out now and it&#39;s a damn good time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Brotato is something just a little bit special isn't it? Blobfish have managed to craft something that really stands out in a sea of twin-stick bullet-hell vampire survivor-likes that keep flowing. <em>Note: this was a personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>What we have here is a timed wave-based survival bullet-hell where you pick your potato and have at it. Saying it's anything like Vampire Survivors just isn't doing it any real justice though. There are plenty of similarities here of course but it's still very much its own game. Mechanically simple with you picking a character (and there's quite a few), each with their own buffs and debuffs, and then just lasting as long as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18064744201687726462gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18064744201687726462gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Very much a game to zone-out with. It doesn't take a lot of brain power, it's a perfect game for when you have a few minutes spare and perfect on the go with a Steam Deck too. Officially only available for Windows, it works perfectly with Proton on desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You might think it doesn't take a long of brain power, and you could even say such a game is "turn your brain off fun" but actually — it's the opposite. Once you get a few waves in, it's tough and pure unhinged chaos. As you power up through the level-up system giving you buffs and new weapons, it trickles in many different types of enemies that will be constantly making you move. Brotato will make you sweat where there should be no sweat, your thumbs will ache like mad but there will be a big smile on your face. That is, until you die when you've really got a sweet setup.</p>
<p>Just today I fired it up for another "quick" run to double-check the release build was all good and ended up getting sucked into a full run again. I had such an awesome weapon set too with turrets everywhere, more turrets spawning constantly, and I thought I was close to immortality. But, it doesn't take long for a few stray enemy bullets and a couple of speedy creatures to end you if you're not careful.</p>
<p>It's hard to find a fault with it. The developer took a simple idea and kept on building on it and it's about as close to perfection as you can get for the simple mechanics it offers. So it's no surprise that it has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam and it's currently the 99th best user-reviewed game on Steam of all time.</p>
<p>In the 1.0 release they added in 5 new elite enemies, 6 new characters, 7 new weapons, 6 new items and 12 new challenges. So even if you're one of the people who've already spent a good 100+ hours in it, you're going to find something new and fun in your next few runs.</p>
<p>Priced at only £3.99 it's an absolute steal at full price. An absolute gem and one of my favourites. I highly recommend checking it out so go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up EA App, Grounded, The Witcher 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A rather nice looking Proton Experimental update went live on June 24th, so here's a run over what to expect on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. This is the version of Proton that Valve update regularly, before rolling out changes to the main versions of Proton. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">more about Proton here</a>.</p>
<p>For the June 24th update they list these as newly playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>21st Century Basketball.</li>
<li>Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus these bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with EA Desktop sometimes not launching after an update.</li>
<li>Fixed scrollbar in Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher.</li>
<li>Fixed Grounded not being playable on desktop.</li>
<li>Fixed The Witcher 3 showing the task bar after Alt+Tab on xfce with certain resolutions.</li>
<li>Fixed Dwarf Fortress SDL2 beta crashing on launch.</li>
<li>Fixed periodic stuttering in Street Fighter 6 when playing without internet for a longer time.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Proton 8.0 regression was solved for the debug console in Scrap Mechanic that should work again.</p>
<p>On top of that for desktop Linux users with NVIDIA GPUs the NVAPI was enabled for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic Heart.</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3.</li>
<li>Demonologist.</li>
<li>Icarus.</li>
<li>Layers of Fear.</li>
<li>Severed Steel.</li>
<li>Showgunners.</li>

<li>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Full changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<p>Good to see more desktop Linux improvements continue to land. Checking back on Grounded, I can confirm there's no longer a manual fix needed. With Proton Experimental up to date it will now launch fully and work, including the Xbox login as well. Screenshot below of it tested on Fedora KDE:</p>

      <title>Dros offers a captivating steampunk adventure with puzzles and quirky characters</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to jump on into a decaying steampunk world full of puzzles, platform challenges, and quirky characters? Then Dros might be something for you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uyL_ZoRYhf0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67376d17f83d230da8e8a250bc3c4c07.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uyL_ZoRYhf0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed by emergeWorlds, Dros takes us through a decaying steampunk world filled with puzzles, platform challenges, and quirky characters.</p>
<p>In Dros, we embark on an exciting little adventure, assuming the roles of two different characters in a fantasy world. Our goal in Dros is to reach the top of a tower controlled by an evil alchemist. This alchemist has amassed an army of small slimy helpers, called Dros, thanks to his flute. However, for the Dros to act outside of glass and vials, they need a vessel, usually pots, pans, or special armor-like objects.</p>
<p>In the case of our two protagonists, the symbiosis consists of a slimy little creature named Little Dros and their human vessel, the bounty hunter Captain. Together, we navigate through a decaying steampunk universe where our survival depends on solving various puzzles, engaging in small combat encounters, and exploration.</p>
<p>The game revolves around the adventures of the two main characters, who possess different abilities that must be combined effectively. While Little Dros excels in agility and exploration, Captain is better at combat and handling larger objects.</p>
<p>With their complementary abilities, we must cleverly switch between the two characters to progress through the tower and overcome its many challenges. Neither the puzzles nor the battles are particularly difficult, but they sometimes require a good idea or some skill. Forgetting the tricks that Little Dros is capable of can make a puzzle quite tricky. Similarly, battles can quickly become intense if we completely ignore blocking with Captain or engage with multiple enemies simultaneously.</p>
<p>Since each character possesses unique strengths and weaknesses, we must skillfully utilize their abilities to overcome obstacles and uncover the secrets within the tower. Dros offers an intertwined narrative and introduces a diverse cast of strange and interesting characters. As we climb the tower, we engage in many conversations and discover the personal struggles and backstories of these quirky beings controlled and ruled by the alchemist.</p>
<p>The tower itself is a treasure trove of alchemical curiosities, with 40 levels filled with peculiar artifacts waiting to be discovered by us. We unravel the secrets of the tower, unlock diary entries, and expand our understanding of Dros' background story.</p>
<p>Visually, Dros is well-executed. The cute polygonal style and character designs are delightful to watch. This is particularly noticeable during conversations, where the characters are depicted in adorable 2D graphics. However, I find that the overall game graphics and character portraits don't quite match, but that's more a matter of personal taste, I guess. Taken individually, both styles are really appealing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3437328651687690297gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3437328651687690297gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The game starts with a highly accessible tutorial that quickly familiarizes you with the basic controls and mechanics. It is easy to understand and serves as an introduction to the story as well.</p>
<p>The game gradually introduces some strategic elements. For example, Little Dros is capable of detecting wires and secret paths. Thanks to Little Dros, Captain can also heal using Prima, a kind of currency.</p>
<p>One nice feature of Dros is the compendium. It provides information about enemies and other elements of the game. The graphical presentation of this feature is visually appealing, with cute illustrations that enhance the game’s charm.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/498236881687690332gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/498236881687690332gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>At the end of each level, there is a summary of your performance, including the collected Prima, found red gemstones, and the time taken. The game is designed so that each level can be completed in just a few minutes, guaranteeing an entertaining experience and allowing for short sessions.</p>
<p>However, I can't help but feel that Dros missed an opportunity by not including a co-op mode. Considering the different abilities of Little Dros and Captain, this seems like a natural addition for a fun and engaging multiplayer experience. So, it's a bit of a letdown that it's strictly a single-player game, given that the game mechanics lend themselves well to cooperative play.</p>
<p>In the version I played, which included the tutorial and the first chapter, I had flawless performance on Linux Mint 21.1 with Proton Experimental, without requiring any additional adjustments. There were a few minor bugs, which I'll address shortly, but overall, the game ran smoothly.</p>
<p>Although Dros is an enchanting experience overall, there were a few minor issues I encountered. For instance, I accidentally got stuck behind a bucket once and had to restart the game. Likewise, I was also once stuck in the middle of a room. However, aside from those two bugs, there were no significant technical problems, and I’m confident those two can be resolved.</p>
<p>However, there was one small logical issue: in Dros, all the elevators seem to only go downward, despite our mission being to ascend the tower. This peculiar design decision raises some questions, but it doesn't detract from the overall fun of the game.</p>
<p>Dros will initially be released for PC, and the developer also plans to release the game for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox. The game will be available in multiple languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish (European), Japanese, Korean, and Simplified Chinese.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors is getting a co-op mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thought you were over your Vampire Survivors fix? Think again, they're <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3680050666264999366" target="_blank">adding</a> in a whole new local co-op mode for the entire game.</p>
<p>Releasing August 17th as a free update it will let 4 people play together either through your current game or you can start a new adventure for it. It will also let you easily swap between playing alone or with others between stages. So you will be able to play through all of the content with others if you choose. They also said clearly it will work on Steam Deck, so for people docking it to a TV or monitor it could be a whole lot of fun.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-j2budq0Qpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f6c3fac23889a68c971fddc53dabb366.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-j2budq0Qpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In their FAQ post on Steam they made it clear that it's not split-screen, you'll all be there together on one screen and there will be a few gameplay adjustments. You will share the level ups, so you will take it in turns to level up and there's also going to be "a few ways to sabotage each other". It's local co-op only but they did say Steam Remote Play Together will work with it. You won't be able to pick the same character either, each player has to be a different one.</p>
<p>More updates are planned after this too, they're not done with it yet.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors was already chaos enough with one person, I can't imagine what it's like with others, going to have to try it out for myself.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It is Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with Proton too. It does have a Native Linux version in Beta but it's not really clear what they plan to do with it there.</p>

      <title>Classic LucasArts games emulator DREAMM adds early Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a way to play classic LucasArts games on Linux? While some ways already exist like ScummVM, another is <a href="https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/" target="_blank">DREAMM</a> and it now has early Linux support.</p>
<p>In the new 2.1b3 version currently in Beta it adds support for Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures, Mortimer and the Riddles of the Medallion, Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, Star Wars: Yoda Stories, Outlaws, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith, Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, Star Wars: X-Wing, Star Wars: TIE Fighter and Afterlife. That's all on top of adding initial Linux support.</p>
<p>Why use it over ScummVM? The developer explains in their <a href="https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/docs/#faq" target="_blank">FAQ</a> a number of reasons including a bigger scope to include more games and it runs the original SPUTM game engine code in an x86 emulator and so it's supposed to be more accurate to the original games - it's all about that classic feel.</p>
<p>It's not open source though unlike other similar projects, and the developer currently has no plans to open source it either. Also explained in their FAQ that currently they wish to work alone on it and they may use it somehow commercially in future.</p>
<p>You can read the latest release notes <a href="https://aarongiles.com/dreamm/beta/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <title>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 confirmed for a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have to admit I am a little bit excited by this. Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 is now confirmed to be coming to Steam. So we could be playing classic Metal Gear on Linux desktop and Steam Deck with Proton very soon.</p>
<p>The collection will release on October 24th and include Metal Gear Solid (including VR / Special Missions), MGS 2: Sons of Liberty (HD Collection version) and MGS 3: Snake Eater (HD Collection version)) as the main games. Plus extras of Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, Metal Gear (NES/FC version) and Snake's Revenge.</p>
<p>This was confirmed in an official video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mo_QG9_NXUc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e93623763fb4c5944400400601caca4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mo_QG9_NXUc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I have such fond memories of playing Metal Gear Solid on the original PlayStation. Being able to play them easily (hopefully) thanks to Proton on my desktop or on the go with my Steam Deck is going to be pretty great.</p>
<p>Will you be picking it up?</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.2 gets a Beta release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 21.2 is getting close to release now with a Beta available for testing across their Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce desktop environments. Probably one of my favourite Linux distributions, because they've been going a long time now and have a real focus on the normal desktop user experience. </p>
<p>Linux Mint 21.2 comes with Cinnamon 5.8 / MATE 1.26 / Xfce 4.18, a Linux kernel 5.15 and an Ubuntu 22.04 package base with a plan to receive security updates until 2027. Until 2024 they will continue to use the same Ubuntu package base, so upgrades will be "trivial" to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21318270191687427845gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21318270191687427845gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new includes the login screen supporting multiple keyboard layouts, touchpad support on the login screen, keyboard navigation improvements for the login screen, support for Wayland sessions and more general improvements to their login greeter.</p>
<p>Elsewhere you'll see a UI refresh for the Software Manager, along with it now able to feature Flatpaks. Their Pix photo viewer got a big upgrade based on a newer version of gThumb giving better performance, improved zoom controls, it supports more image formats, improved video playback and much more.</p>
<p>There's a few visual differences too with slight tweaks to their styling like new colour variants, two-tone icons, improved tooltips that look more consistent, titlebar buttons were realigned and changes to icons in icons in various apps.</p>
<p>Some other changes include the addition of XDG Desktop Portal support to XApp to provide better compatibility with Flatpaks and GNOME apps, a global Dark Mode setting, Cinnamon desktop got a new "styles" concept to let you better adjust the look and feel of the desktop, gesture support for window management / workspace management / tiling etc supported on touchpads, touchscreens and tablets, upgrades to their Warpinator file-sharing tool and various upgrades to all the included software.</p>
<p>You can read the full details for each here:</p>

      <title>Classic open source FPS Xonotic 0.8.6 released with new game modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://xonotic.org/" target="_blank">Xonotic</a> 0.8.6 is an essential upgrade for anyone playing this classic free and open source arena shooter, due to a security issue but there's also plenty of new features and additions.</p>
<p>If you've never played it Xonotic is an arena-style first person shooter, with fast-paced movement and gameplay plus a wide array of weapons. It's completely free and has full Native Linux support. Developed as a fork of a previous game called Nexuiz.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10481503721687426438gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10481503721687426438gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new release brings in two new official maps, a few tweaks to existing maps, performance optimizations, lots of bug fixes (and security fixes), a new "superbots" AI that are really tough to fight against, new moderation systems, upgrades to various visual effects and some new game modes that sound like a lot of fun.</p>
<p>New game modes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mayhem - Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch where players spawn with all weapons and full health / armour. Score is given 75% based on damage and 25% based on frags.</li>
<li>Survival - A few randomly selected players must frag all survivors, without being identified.</li>
<li>Team Keepaway - A team variant of the free for all, where points are awarded to the team in possession of a ball for each kill.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SDL 2.28.0 released and goes into maintenance mode, now focusing on SDL 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a> (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware used by a great many companies and SDL 2 is now pretty much finished.</p>
<p>This software is used by Valve with Steam and Source 2, Unity game engine, tons of games, emulators and much more to provide easy cross-platform support for features noted above. It's a rather important thing for Linux gaming.</p>
<p>With the release of version <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.0" target="_blank">2.28.0</a>, there's plenty of bug fixes and these additional features added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added SDL_HasWindowSurface() and SDL_DestroyWindowSurface() to switch between the window surface and rendering APIs</li>
<li>Added a display event SDL_DISPLAYEVENT_MOVED which is sent when the primary monitor changes or displays change position relative to each other</li>
<li>Added the hint SDL_HINT_ENABLE_SCREEN_KEYBOARD to control whether the on-screen keyboard should be shown when text input is active</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's it for SDL 2 now though, as it's moving into maintenance mode since their focus has moved onto SDL 3. With the major new version in the works they're going to be making some huge changes like adding in a 3D GPU API, full support for high DPI displays and much more.</p>

      <title>Valve moving away from the Battle Pass in Dota 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" target="_blank">Dota 2</a> comes up to the 10 year anniversary, Valve developers have put up a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/dota2/announcements/detail/6252732681186068105" target="_blank">blog post</a> going over some of their thoughts on the future.</p>
<p>The main point they're making in this self-reflection is how the Battle Pass has swallowed up so much of their time, and so much that could have been updates to the game was put into the Battle Pass instead in some form. This means they've had less time for other features for everyone and that "Most Dota players never buy a Battle Pass and never get any rewards from it" - which is <em>really</em> interesting to see them be so honest about it.</p>
<p>So what they ended up doing was taking away some developer resources from the Battle Pass, towards more main updates to the game which is what gave us the recent New Frontiers and patch 7.33 which they say wouldn't have happened if they were still going so hard on the Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Valve said they're going to now continue on this path, building a "wide variety of features and content for the game, delivered in different ways" but they will still ship various cosmetics over the year but they're aiming for bigger stuff for all Dota players to get.</p>
<p>Sounds like a sane idea overall. As they said "By freeing Dota's update and content cycle from the timing and structural constraints of the Battle Pass, we can go back to making content in the way we know best: by coming up with fun ideas of all scales and shapes, and exploring them with you".</p>
<hr/>
<p>I actually played a couple of games with a friend on the new map recently, and it was surprisingly a really great time. The map definitely feels a whole lot better now and the game works really great on Linux too.</p>

      <title>Pixel art RTS TFC: The Fertile Crescent adds in factions and dynamic music</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a great fast-paced pixel-art take on an RTS, a little in the spirit of Age of Empires and similar games. The latest update is the biggest yet adding in a faction system.</p>
<p>Previously you always played as one single side but now you choose between The Assyrians, Babylonians and Egyptians. They have a unique look, unique technologies and each have a unique Wonder bonus too. It's a little different here as you pick your civilization <em>during</em> a game, not before it too, as you need to reach a certain level of progress. Not only that the developers also added in a new soundtrack, with each faction having their own and there's multiple tracks. The audio now reacts to the gameplay too so it's all a bit more dynamic.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rX0YOZw4G7A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cabf0eeda41d0314eae5eadac64dd16.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rX0YOZw4G7A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a redesigned technology tree with space for more as they expand through Early Access, Wonders are now more important, with each having different levels of construction with different bonuses, there's an influence range circle for buildings, the start of adding in Steam Achievements and much <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1674820/view/3680043874849126394" target="_blank">more</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's 40% off until June 27th.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crusader Kings III is expanding again with a new event pack in Crusader Kings III: Wards &amp; Wardens releasing on August 22nd that will focus on your children. <em>Time to carefully steer your heir.</em></p>
<p>This was actually voted for by players from a community vote last Winter, so hopefully players like what Paradox did with the idea. This event pack focuses on the perils and potentials of being a child ruler, educating the children at court and furthering your learning in adulthood.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2460297851687261323gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2460297851687261323gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Highlights of what this event pack will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Childhood Education Events.</li>
<li>Visiting Universities for adult characters.</li>
<li>More Childhood Personality Events.</li>
<li>Hostage Events for foreign children placed at your court.</li>
<li>Child-rearing events with courtiers, including a new court position, the Wet-Nurse.</li>
<li>Child Regency Events for the training or usurping of rulers who have not reached adulthood.</li>
<li>Four New Music Tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>A free update will release at the same time that includes the new hostage system, a new eccentric character trait, new event art and new animations for all players. The DLC will be priced at $4.99 / £4.29 / €4.99.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>RetroDECK got a lot bigger and better for emulation on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://retrodeck.net/" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a> is just one of the ways you can set up your Steam Deck for emulation and their team recently put up a rather great sounding upgrade in v0.7.0b. During the Beta period their focus is on the Steam Deck but it will eventually expand fully onto desktop Linux too. Technically it works on desktop Linux but they say "the user experience might not be that great it could contain desktop specific bugs and other issues".</p>
<p>Giving you one of the easiest ways to get going it integrates with <a href="https://es-de.org/" target="_blank">EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE)</a>, so you get a nice beginner-friendly and pretty good looking interface with everything all in one.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12861535221687260276gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12861535221687260276gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Just some of what's new inside RetroDECK v0.7.0b include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New controller layout, that unifies hotkeys for all emulators where possible.</li>
<li>New system folder layout to make handing modding easier.</li>
<li>Their own configurator is now integrated inside ES-DE. Plus lots of upgrades to their configurator.</li>
<li>Updates ES-DE to the latest version.</li>
<li>Updates RetroArch and their emulator cores to latest versions.</li>
<li>Updates various other standalone emulators to their latest versions.</li>
<li>Adds Wii U support from CEMU.</li>
<li>Experimental multi-user support.</li>
<li>RetroDECK auto updates on launch (can be turned off).</li>
</ul>
<p>Full <a href="https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/Version-history%3A-Patch-Notes" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>You can install it directly from the Discover software centre in desktop mode, since it's available as a Flatpak on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>Save your owner as a space-pup in shoot &#39;em up ProtoCorgi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtoCorgi is a shoot 'em up with a difference. You're not a spaceship, you're not even a person, you're a dog on a quest to save their owner.</p>
<p>Here you play as Bullet, a cybernetic dog, off to save their owner who was kidnapped by a strange alien race that seems to want to rule the galaxy. As you fly through space you face off against various aliens, collect the usual power-ups and something about eating space-fruit to get a higher score. With 27 different weapon combinations, there's a fair amount of replay value there and it looks pretty sweet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8n8OENUB-TQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/08931bbfee19c49490b9ee162a5c1535.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8n8OENUB-TQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Family friendly too, so perhaps a nice shoot 'em up for a slightly younger audience who are interested in gaming. Not everything is about those of us with greying hair huh? There's also a built in level editor, so you can make your own missions for you and others to play through.</p>
<p>One for retro fans too, looks like something that could have fit right at home on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis.</p>
<p>Available with Linux support <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1039280/ProtoCorgi/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Get a free copy of Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition with Prime Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Subscribe to Amazon Prime? Well you can get a free copy of Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition thanks to their partnership with <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>A good time to pick it up too considering Beamdog are many years later still upgrading the game. Just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/many-years-later-neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition-is-still-getting-better/" target="_blank">recently</a> it had an update adding in a new cartoon shader and lots of optimizations. It's still going strong! It has a Native Linux version available, that Beamdog have supported well too.</p>
<p>How to claim it? Go to <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a>, login with your Amazon account and you'll see it in the list. You'll also need a GOG account as well of course. You have until July 19th to claim it. Since you'll be getting a copy on GOG, you don't need to keep your Prime subscription active - it's yours to keep.</p>
<p>If you also want an easy way to install GOG games on Linux, check out <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic</a> or <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a>. Both work great on desktop Linux and Steam Deck and just make setting up games from GOG much simpler overall.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1647730/view/6488045762499366518?l=english" target="_blank">official update</a> posted on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1647730/Zool_Redimensioned/" target="_blank">Zool Redimensioned</a>, the 2021 reimagining of the 1992 platformer Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension, has now been granted Steam Deck Verified status.</p>

<p>The game already had <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1647730" target="_blank">a Gold rating on ProtonDB</a> and runs well on desktop Linux, but it's nice to see that extra bit of assurance that it works as it should on the Deck.</p>
<p>There was also an update in May which added three local multiplayer mini-games, which should be a good fit for the Steam Deck Dock!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here in Beta! A big upgrade for Valheim to let you change how you can play it, so here's a run over what's new and improved. This was teased recently and comes after a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/valheim-gets-upgraded-to-improve-performance-and-fix-major-bugs/" target="_blank">stable update that improved performance</a>.</p>
<p>When you go to start a game, you now have access to World Modifiers where you can change various difficulty options. This includes no-cost building, passive enemies, amount of raids, death penalty, combat difficulty and more. So for people who want it much easier and close to a creative mode - you can now do it. Want it to be even more difficult? You can do that too.</p>

<p>This should make the game a whole lot more accessible for many different types of players, great to see. Hopefully it won't be too long before it's rolled out for everyone.</p>

      <title>Steam UI scaling should work even better in the latest Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having Steam UI scaling issues? You may want to have a look at the Steam Client Beta that was released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6627657351330751106" target="_blank">June 15th</a> and see how you get on. Valve are constantly updating the Beta, and they only just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-overhauled-new-overlay-steam-deck-big-stable-update/" target="_blank">launched a major update</a> with the new Steam Overlay but they're right back to it on the Beta with fresh upgrades and fixes.</p>
<p>For the Linux client here's what they've added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved scaling for users running gnome.</li>
<li>Added an env var based override for scaling settings STEAM_FORCE_DESKTOPUI_SCALING=.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash when rendering an invalid texture.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented multiple DualShock 4 controllers from being connected at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So to use the env var, you could just run <code class="inline-code">STEAM_FORCE_DESKTOPUI_SCALING=1.5 steam</code> and have it bigger. Set it to whatever you want. As example here's how it would normally look on my 1440p monitor:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11588336111686912928gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11588336111686912928gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then with 1.5 scaling forced:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4488011631686912947gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4488011631686912947gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then with 2.0 forced scaling:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20842370191686912977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20842370191686912977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Seems to work really nicely, and you can set it to exactly what you want. Nice to see Valve put some more attention into this, as it can really help at different resolutions and for people with vision issues.</p>

      <title>Soulstone Survivors a great Vampire Survivor-like has a huge skill tree upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soulstone Survivors is one of my favourite games in the spirit of Vampire Survivors, and it just got a lot bigger with the new Path of Ascension upgrade. While similar to VS in basic gameplay mechanics and the loop, it expanded on the idea in a few ways with more skill-based gameplay.</p>
<p>More about it: "Soulstone Survivors is an action roguelite where you slay hordes of foes and face titanic bosses while learning powerful skills to enhance your character. Play as a Void Hunter, and with the spoils of every match craft weapons, unlock new characters, upgrade your skill tree and equip new runes, all in your quest for godlike powers. With deep RPG mechanics intertwined with Roguelite elements, Soulstone Survivors offers a condensed, yet deep Action RPG experience"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17081913591686911933gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17081913591686911933gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The latest upgrade to the game in Path of Ascension gives you a massively expanded skill tree with character-specific nodes to unlock, with lots of new types of effects and over 200 new nodes to progress through for the Barbarian, Pyromancer, Hound Master, Spellblade, Arcane Weaver, Sentinel, and Paladin. Other characters will get the same treatment in a future update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6378639671686911988gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6378639671686911988gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>With this there's also 7 new weapons, 14 new active skills, 21 new runes to customize character runs, new enemies to face and a new auto-aim feature to save your thumbs a bit. The auto-aim might be my favourite new addition to be honest, I love these style of games but when the action gets ridiculously heated, having to manually aim various skills ends up killing me…and my thumb.</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2066020/Soulstone_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">on Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>
<p>You can see my previous Steam Deck gameplay below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_CCubu42vF0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7bd364dca0eb2987bea5f47355831f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_CCubu42vF0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It runs great on desktop Linux too, no complaints there! It has Native Linux support and it seems to be supported well overall so one not to miss.</p>
<p><em>While you're here: has the industry actually settled on a term for these games yet?</em></p>

      <title>Factorio adds controller support in experimental update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Steam Deck and gamepad fans, as official controller support is coming to Factorio and you can try it out right now. Released in <a href="https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=106660" target="_blank">experimental v1.1.83</a> they note you just need to change over the input method in the settings -&gt; controls menu. Then you will get proper gamepad controls and glyphs telling you what to do.</p>
<p>To access it on Steam simply go into the Properties -&gt; Betas menu and select at least version 1.1.83. You can also select to keep on the latest 1.1 experimental version if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4143860971686907984gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4143860971686907984gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042827981686908066gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17042827981686908066gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Looking forward to kicking-back and relaxing some more with this. It's been a while since playing Factorio properly but gamepad support always makes me look at games again, it's so much nicer to relax with rather than feeling forced to sit at a desk after a long day.</p>
<p>Checking it today on Steam Deck the controls do seem to work quite well, although no doubt they'll be making improvements over time since this is only in the experimental build. Sometimes selecting the right building can be difficult when they're right next to each other but that's what testing is for right? Still getting used to it but after only a few minutes you can get pretty quick with the various binds.</p>
<p>Time to get started then…</p>

      <title>Removing non-Steam apps now cleans up on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A change that Valve missed in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-overhauled-new-overlay-steam-deck-big-stable-update/" target="_blank">big recent upgrade</a> of the Steam client, is that on Linux systems either desktop or Steam Deck, removing non-Steam apps should now be cleaner.</p>
<p>Previously, if you added something into Steam that ended up making a shader cache and compatibility data, like running something with Proton, when you removed the shortcut from Steam it would leave everything behind. That should no longer be the case, as Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1669489661507682305" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux change we forgot to call out in the new client: removing non-Steam apps now properly removes all related files like shader caches and compatibility data (which would previously be left as 'other' storage space)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So people can eventually stop asking "What's taking up all my "Other" storage?!", which has been an ongoing problem since the Steam Deck's release and especially a problem on the 64GB Steam Deck model.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/906223661686906148gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/906223661686906148gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Even though Valve don't actually support non-Steam apps directly, it's nice to see them make steps to make the experience better.</p>

      <title>SNES JRPG inspired game Alterium Shift arrives July 6th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by SNES classics, the JRPG styled Alterium Shift plans to have an Early Access release land on July 6th and it's looking good.</p>
<p>More about it: "Embark on a retro-inspired adventure with Alterium Shift, a classic JRPG featuring immersive 2.5D graphics and pixel art combined with modern gameplay. Choose from three unique characters, each with their own skills and elemental powers to explore the living world of Alteria. Engage in turn-based combat and fun mini-games like fishing as you uncover the secrets of this magical land and shape the outcome of the story with your choices."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VkgBn6x6n0s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59a6ff633afba23c2304d1c39534b665.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VkgBn6x6n0s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the Early Access release they said it's about 50% done. With a full release expected up until the end of 2023, or into 2024 if some parts like localisation and porting to other platforms take longer. The full version will have configurable controls, full world maps to walk across, a bestiary, more settings (like CRT effects), battle enhancements and just general gameplay improvements.</p>
<p>Looks quite fantastic, excited for this one.</p>
<p>You can try a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586990/Alterium_Shift/" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD reveals initial open source openSIL code to replace AGESA Firmware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD is moving even further into open source, with their plans to have openSIL replace AGESA for their processors and they've now put up the initial open source code on <a href="https://github.com/openSIL/openSIL" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It's only currently a proof of concept, to start working more in the open with the community. Their current plan is to have openSIL available properly in some form beginning 2026. AMD has been collaborating with the likes of 9elements, AMI, AWS, 3mdeb, Datacom, Google, Meta and Oxide on this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10582878451686830924gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10582878451686830924gol1.png"/></a><em>Image Source - AMD</em></p>
<p>I'll leave the explanation up to AMD on this one from their <a href="http://community.amd.com/t5/business/empowering-the-industry-with-open-system-firmware-amd-opensil/ba-p/599644" target="_blank">blog post</a> back in April:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD believes one of the ways to attain an improved security posture is to open Silicon Initialization Firmware architecture, development, and validation to the open-source community. AMD is committed to open-source software and is now expanding into the various firmware domains with the re-architecture of its x86 AGESA FW stack - designed with UEFI as the host firmware that prevented scaling, to other host firmware solutions such as coreboot, oreboot, FortiBIOS, Project µ and others. A newer, open architecture that potentially allows for reduced attack surface, and perceivably infinite scalability is now available as a Proof-of-Concept, within the open-source community for evaluation, called the AMD openSIL – Open-Source Silicon Initialization Library.</p>
<p>AMD openSIL adheres to simple goals of an agnostic set of library functions written in an industry-standard language that can be statically linked to the host firmware without having to adhere to any host firmware protocols. AMD openSIL is designed to be scalable and simple to integrate, light weight, low chirp and transparent, potentially allowing for an improved security posture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a nice win for open source and future system security with AMD CPUs.</p>

      <title>PAYDAY 2 devs to ensure it works with Proton on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You may have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/overkill-drops-linux-support-for-payday-2/" target="_blank">seen the news</a> recently that Overkill decided to stop supporting and updating their Native Linux build of PAYDAY 2. Well, they're now saying they will ensure it works with Proton.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, you shouldn't need to do anything, as it defaults to the Windows version running in Proton anyway. For desktop Linux players, you'll just need to force Proton in the right click menu Properties -&gt; Compatibility section on the game.</p>
<p>Addressing some issues that have come up since the latest update including matchmaking problems, they included a section on the future of PAYDAY 2 running on Linux (and so Steam Deck too). Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/218620/view/3665414601842198623" target="_blank">what they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux is a complicated beast. To get the game working on both native Linux and at the same time updating the older version of the diesel engine that PAYDAY 2 for Linux was using proved unfeasible. This was one of the things we spent the most time trying to solve, yet didn’t reach our goals in the end.<br/>
Linux players can still access the game using Proton, we’ll keep testing new updates with Proton to make sure it keeps working for the upcoming patches and releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's good news for people who don't care about what happens behind the Play button and just want to play their games. Support is what's important and they clearly say they're going to ensure it keeps working and will be testing it.</p>
<p>You could argue the issue wouldn't be a problem if they kept the Linux version on an up to date game engine, but there will be reasons why they haven't done this. We know that developers can see exactly how many players are in their games from each platform (Steam shows developers this), so they likely just saw there wasn't enough players using the Native Linux version to be worth ongoing support costs and upgrades.</p>
<p>I just tested it with Proton Experimental and it worked great.</p>

      <title>Steam gets overhauled with new overlay, Steam Deck big stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released the latest big update to the Steam client, which brings with it various UI updates and the new in-game Steam Overlay. This is the update they announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/huge-steam-beta-upgrade-with-new-overlay-screenshot-manager-more/" target="_blank">back in April</a>, with it being promoted from Beta to Stable.</p>
<p>While there's plenty of tweaks, Valve said the biggest changes aren't actually user-visible because they've changed "how we share code across the Steam Desktop Client, Big Picture mode, and Steam Deck" resulting in "quicker implementation and iteration of new features" and now much code is shared between them.</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various tweaks to the Steam App UI.</li>
<li>Richer notifications.</li>
<li>A whole new in-game overlay that lets you make notes, and pin windows on top of games.</li>
<li>Hardware acceleration for Linux and macOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the new in-game overlay:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14414209981686825722gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14414209981686825722gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really great update actually, the new overlay is many times more useful than the one before. The notes system is a good idea, and having it sync to your Steam account so you have it anywhere is really quite useful.</p>
<p>Check out Valve's overview video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e8jv24NjOWQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83f1ebf0e6e4ff6cfe1466fbe1fc1590.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e8jv24NjOWQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full Steam desktop app changes can be seen in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3687931965598906184" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Over on the Steam Deck, we finally have a fresh Stable Steam Client update as well, bundling together a whole lot of the tweaks and changes Valve has been putting out in Beta. Naturally, a lot of this is the same as what's found on desktop, since they are sharing code now but there's various specific Steam Deck tweaks like fixing the notorious issue of the Steam Deck claiming it cannot reach Steam servers when resuming from sleep. Most of it is bug fixing but there's also these additions and changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for notification types shown in the Desktop Client and Mobile app: Wishlist, Trade Offer, Steam Turn, Help Request, Major Sale, and Comment.</li>
<li>Added a bell icon to the header when there are new notifications, and a green indicator to new notifications in the notifications list.</li>
<li>Apply text filtering preferences in Guides in the Overlay.</li>
<li>Expand the hitbox of buttons in the footer to make them easier to click.</li>
<li>Improved performance of dual trackpad typing in the Virtual Keyboard.</li>
<li>Any button press will now cancel the Wake custom startup movie.</li>
<li>Changed game invitations to show the launch option dialog instead of using the first option in the list. If the user has selected an option and asked to remember it, that option will be used instead of showing the dialog.</li>
<li>Added support for Mouse4 (Back) as B button in the interface.</li>
<li>Search will now return tags in addition to games. You can search for categories like "Free to Play" or individual tags like "survival" or "zombies".</li>
<li>Enabled additional toast notifications that were previously only visible in Desktop mode.</li>
<li>Restored display of Special Offers in the What's New section of the home screen.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III for Linux updated to v3.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After entirely skipping the 3.0 update for Linux, Feral Interactive has now upgraded their Linux port of Total War: WARHAMMER III to version 3.1. The 3.0 update originally released for Windows in April, with 3.1 landing in May. While it is nice to see we got the 3.1 update a bit quicker, two months between updates is not a good look if you're sticking to their Native build.</p>
<p>Main changes for 3.1 and 3.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaos Dwarfs Endgame Crisis</li>
<li>Regiments of Renown IV</li>
<li>Bretonnia changes and rebalancing</li>
<li>Event notifications fixed</li>
<li>Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs</li>
<li>Mirror of Madness</li>
<li>Free Legendary Hero: Ulrika Magdova</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get an overview on what's changed in the two below videos:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IyJS1x2SeC4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/141b49ae4808b9943d21d5de31d8397b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IyJS1x2SeC4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>This update also brings support for the Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs DLC.</p>
<p><em>Full patch notes can be found for <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/tww3-update-300/" target="_blank">3.0 here</a> and <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/tww3-update-310/" target="_blank">3.1 here</a>.</em></p>
<p>You can grab Total War: Warhammer III on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/total-war-warhammer-iii?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>ICYMI: seems like Feral won't be doing any more Linux ports, after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/total-war-pharaoh-announced-linux-port-from-feral-interactive/" target="_blank">Total War: PHARAOH</a> was initially announced with Linux support Feral quickly clarified this was in fact wrong and they're only doing it for macOS.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 535.54.03 stable rolls out for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released their latest stable driver for Linux version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/205541/en-uk" target="_blank">535.54.03</a>, following on from their recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/nvidia-535-43-02-beta-for-linux-wayland-vulkan/" target="_blank">535.43.02 Beta driver in late May</a>.</p>
<p>Compared with the Beta, NVIDIA added in these extra bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused modesets to fail in some Wayland configurations.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused head-mounted displays (HMDs) to display black after a modeset.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented SLI Mosaic controls from being displayed in the nvidia-settings control panel when using GSP Firmware.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause image corruption when unbinding Vulkan sparse textures.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused head-mounted displays (HMDs) to display black after a modeset.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the changes are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_memory_priority, and VK_EXT_pageable_device_memory extensions for Turing+ GPUs.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of Minecraft Java Edition on RTX 3000 series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a memory leak in the NVIDIA GLX driver, as reported at: <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/222697" target="_blank">https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/222697</a></li>
<li>Added support for driving very high pixel clock mode timings such as 8K @ 60Hz. Please see the "MaxOneHardwareHead" X11 ModeValidation token in the README for details.</li>
<li>Extended Dynamic Boost support on notebooks to include older Renoir and Cezanne chipsets, in addition to Rembrandt and newer AMD chipsets.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Vulkan X11 swapchain creation to fail on GPUs without a display engine when the VK_KHR_present_id extension is used.</li>
<li>Fixed console restore on legacy VGA consoles when using the NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules.</li>
<li>Added nvoptix.bin to the driver package. This data file is used by the OptiX ray tracing engine library, libnvoptix.so.1.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-compiler.so.VERSION from the driver package. This functionality is now provided by other driver libraries.</li>
<li>Added power usage and power limits information to nvidia-settings PowerMizer page.</li>
<li>Updated NV_CTRL_GPU_POWER_SOURCE NV-CONTROL API to report undersized power source.</li>
<li>Add support for version 4 of the linux-dmabuf wayland protocol.</li>
<li>Added NV-CONTROL attributes NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_MODE and NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_VALUE to allow syncing a Quadro Sync II card to different House Sync signal rates. This feature requires firmware version 2.18 or later; to download the latest firmware version, please visit: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/" target="_blank">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/</a></li>
<li>Added support for the VK_KHR_video_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_h264 and VK_KHR_video_decode_h265 extensions.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Added support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.</li>
<li>This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused incorrect reporting of presentation times when using the VK_NV_present_barrier Vulkan extension.</li>
</ul>

      <title>AMD GPUs to get Ray Tracing turned on for Mesa 23.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The RADV driver in Mesa for AMD GPUs on Linux and Steam Deck is set to get Ray Tracing turned on by default for the upcoming Mesa 23.2 release.</p>
<p>Previously you could try it in certain titles, and there were ways to enable it manually but now you won't have to do anything as the code to turn it on has been <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/commit/374bd4e1bef25ba2aeef6016ac35b41df07f3a99" target="_blank">merged</a>. Once you upgrade to Mesa 23.2 after release (scheduled for August 2nd at the earliest) with an AMD GPU, you should find games able to use it.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming, so it's really great to see Ray Tracing really getting into shape for those with an AMD GPU. It also means it will be doable on Steam Deck whenever Valve upgrade SteamOS to have the newer Mesa version, although it likely won't run too well there in many titles.</p>
<p>You can read more on the behind the scenes work from developer Friedrich Vock on <a href="https://pixelcluster.github.io/RADV-Raytracing-ON/" target="_blank">their blog post</a>.</p>
<p>What are you looking forward to trying with it?</p>

      <title>Upload VR Showcase bundle has some good picks for VR fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a fancy VR headset and fancy picking up some new games? The <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/upload-vr?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Upload VR Showcase Bundle</a> has some interesting titles worth a look. I'll list each title along with any expected compatibility thanks to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, with each being a Steam link if you need to go get more info first.</p>
<p>Included in the bundle are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/916840/The_Walking_Dead_Saints__Sinners/" target="_blank">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</a> - ProtonDB Platinum.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947500/The_Walking_Dead_Saints__Sinners__Chapter_2_Retribution/" target="_blank">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution</a> - No Reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481780/Dragon_Fist_VR_Kung_Fu/" target="_blank">Dragon Fist: VR Kung Fu</a> - One report note it works fine.</li>

</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/upload-vr?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">full bundle here</a>.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, SteamVR is currently just not working for me on Fedora KDE 38. When I load SteamVR it gives this error and the headset just flashes at me with no game output:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3517784281686744032gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3517784281686744032gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If anyone has any good tips to solve it I would love to read your thoughts in the comments as I want to get back into it with my Valve Index. Once the summer heat has died off a bit at least… Used to work well in games for the most part before this, but now I can't get it to work at all.</p>

You will learn that in this world being selfish and heartless is the only way to survive..."</p>
<p>The new version will bring remastered HD graphics, an updated UI, new quests, new boss battles, new secrets, bonus content and more. Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5yq25GLKuKI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97b9dc309618ef4658105c373a3a4d73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5yq25GLKuKI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>120 FPS mode for PC and current-gen consoles.</li>
<li>Brand-new campfire conversations, allowing you to mourn the deaths of party members even more.</li>
<li>New enemy and boss fights.</li>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I upgraded and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last of Us Part I is finally getting to a level that's actually good, and the latest update is out now including bumping it up to Steam Deck <a href="https://twitter.com/naughty_dog/status/1668682177964556288" target="_blank">Verified</a> status.</p>
<p>Quite a surprise to see, considering multiple parts of the game previously on Steam Deck would drop pretty hard below 30FPS and it was not good to play. There were also issues I showcased in previous videos, where it would completely lock up the system.</p>
<p>So what have they done? For Steam Deck specifically here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Overall improvements to performance while playing on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Addressed a memory leak issue that could cause crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain button prompts would be misaligned.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing (Options &gt; Graphics &gt; Graphics Preset) could trigger an intense lighting effect.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where in-game HUD did not match Steam Deck Performance Overlay FPS value.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during loading screens.</li>
<li>Effects Density now defaults to Very Low instead of Low.</li>
<li>[Lakeside Resort] Fixed a crash that could occur at the start of a cutscene.</li>
<li>[Pittsburgh] Fixed a crash that could occur at certain checkpoints.</li>
<li>[The Outskirts] Fixed an issue where locked FPS could make it difficult to move pushable objects.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally they also added in a very low graphics preset, a new AI quality setting and a new dynamic light quality setting - all of which add up to make it a better fit on Steam Deck thanks to more tweaks. So it's not surprising it was able to get Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What does that result in? Have a look in my video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="k4t21Z28Vgc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a77c987f41ea274a0006b961249a0dd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/k4t21Z28Vgc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As noted in the video, unfortunately, there are still locations that will end up causing the RAM use to spike up to about 14.1GB drop the FPS down to basically nothing and completely lock up the Steam Deck. So that issue isn't <em>yet</em> solved but it's also an issue in <em>multiple</em> other games. Not everyone sees it (which can cause some confusion) but for Steam Deck and bigger games, it's quite problematic when it happens. <a href="https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities" target="_blank">CryoUtilities</a> can work around it in some cases but not always. I'm hoping SteamOS 3.5 will help this issue and will be testing when Valve drop it into Preview.</p>

<p>Moonstone Island from Studio Supersoft and Raw Fury looks sweet! It's a creature-collecting life-sim set in an open world with 100+ islands to explore and now we have more details.</p>

<p>They just recently announced they're planning to release it this Summer and there's a brand new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Portal Reloaded - The Cooperative Update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for one more run through the testing chambers? The free and very popular mod Portal Reloaded just recently had The Cooperative Update <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1255980/announcements/detail/3703693931382658082" target="_blank">release</a>.</p>
<p>The game already expanded on the Portal idea a fair bit giving you a triple portal gun, with the third portal being a time portal so it all got a bit wibbly wobbly…time-y wimey. With this latest update it goes a little further adding in the new co-op mode with 20 new testing chambers, co-op time travel mechanics, a new narrative, new music and a whole bunch of improvements to single-player too. They've also added Finnish, Italian and Ukrainian subtitle options now too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Available to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, free for owners of Portal 2.</p>
<p>If you've played this latest update be sure to let me know what you think!</p>

      <title>SMITE now works on Linux and Steam Deck in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 14/06/23</strong>: after some <em>more</em> testing, one thing I have found on Steam Deck is that you <em>can</em> use the built-in gamepad controls. However, they only work correctly in battles. The entire menu / lobby and god selection seems to not work with gamepad controls. So you can use touch screen, emulated mouse input or hold the STEAM button to activate mouse cursor. Seems this is a problem even on Windows going back <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/lmrwnd/controller_doesnt_work_on_main_menu_or_god_select/" target="_blank">years</a>. It does <em>not</em> have "Full controller support" as advertised on Steam, only Partial.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Titan Forge Games and Hi-Rez Studios have updated their popular MOBA game SMITE, and with it an improvement to allow it to now work on Linux with Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>After playing a couple of games myself today, I can confirm it is working very nicely on my Fedora KDE 38 desktop. No performance issues anywhere that I could see and no kicking due to anti-cheat. This change to the Linux support status was mentioned officially in the <a href="https://www.smitegame.com/news/the-season-of-souls-10-6-update-notes/" target="_blank">release notes</a>, where they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SMITE will now run on Linux systems – Special thanks to the SMITE community for helping with this. A group of players in the r/smite discord made a big impact on this change</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So that's some great news for gamers on Linux!</em></p>
<p>However, when it comes to the Steam Deck, there it's a bit different. SMITE's controller support doesn't seem to work properly as far as I could see. Even on desktop Linux just to double-check, it didn't work right there either. So you'll need to use a Community Layout in Steam Input that sets keyboard and mouse controls up or make a layout it yourself. And make sure you keep it set to keyboard and mouse with the <em>in-game</em> settings, otherwise it gets confused and just doesn't seem to work when in a battle. Trying out the most upvoted "Xbox One Style Controls" on Steam Deck - it actually worked quite well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19467179251686677332gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19467179251686677332gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>A bit annoying needing to learn the binds manually but doable certainly and after a few games once you get the controls down, it really does seem to work quite well on Steam Deck (and really smooth on Medium settings too). But hopefully the game developer can fix the issue, or perhaps Valve can with Proton to get controller support directly working. Given how many thumbs up the community layout has though, it's likely controller support is iffy on Windows too with so many using the custom layouts.</p>
<p>You can see some Steam Deck footage in my below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZRjtQSAlpkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/75e632d7853720cff0b4b5ce69b49c3f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZRjtQSAlpkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On desktop Linux, apart from the controller issue, no other problems. Everything works as expected and performance was again very good. It felt perfectly natural to click and play so nothing to really report there.</p>
<p>SMITE can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/386360/SMITE/" target="_blank">found on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nova Roma is a new city-builder from the Kingdoms and Castles developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kingdoms and Castles is a great city-builder but it seems Lion Shield want to do something a bit different, so they've revealed Nova Roma. It was announced at the PC Gaming Show.</p>
<p>Clearly building upon the work they did for Kingdoms and Castles, they're aiming a bit higher here with a whole bunch of new mechanics but it still looks a bit familiar. You will need to adapt to heavy rains that will causing flooding and damage, keep up with the needs of all your citizens through food and entertainment and even deal with the gods. If the gods aren't happy with you, then you might find they unleash punishment on you. With it being based on a Roman theme it will explore the cultural, political, and military trials of the era.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="st6OjBam4tQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae79120405e3ce5ffb71a6744b0104f6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/st6OjBam4tQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Innovative new water mechanics that can be manipulated via infrastructure.</li>
<li>Complex supply chains requiring constant expansion into resource-rich countryside.</li>
<li>Population needs that range from food and finery to coliseums and games to keep the people entertained.</li>
<li>Intricate city management through laws, edicts, and a tech tree.</li>
<li>A new day/night cycle.</li>
<li>Confront the dangers of the world, whether it be barbarians, gods, or the jealous machinations of the old empire.</li>
<li>Bigger, better maps, better terrain sculpting, and much more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’re honored to be working with Lion Shield on its next project,” says Tim Bender, CEO of Hooded Horse. “Kingdoms &amp; Castles is a gold standard in city-building games, and we’re excited to publish the Roman-themed successor.”</p>
<p>“We’re pleased to work with Hooded Horse on Nova Roma, “ says Pete Angstadt, Creative Director and co-founder at Lion Shield. “We're building on everything we learned making Kingdoms and Castles and hope to create the best ancient Roman-era city builder we can, set in a world informed by both history and mythology."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2426530/Nova_Roma/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It should have Linux support just like their previous game.</p>

      <title>After eating up lots of game studios Embracer Group set to close a bunch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah yes, game industry consolidation is great isn't it. What could possibly go wrong when one company acquires a ton of others and then screws up?</p>
<p>Embracer Group are known for going on acquiring sprees and currently own the likes of THQ Nordic, Coffee Stain, Gearbox, Plaion (formerly Koch Media), Saber Group and all the studios they control like Flying Wild Hog, Warhorse Studios, 3D Realms, New World Interactive, Tripwire Interactive, Aspyr Media, Beamdog and the list just goes on and on and on. Their own <a href="https://embracer.com/about/" target="_blank">website</a> lists 850 IPs either owned or controlled.</p>
<p>Well, they're having a few problems. They announced in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2023-net-sales-increased-by-79-to-sek-9356-million/" target="_blank">previous revenue report</a> that a "major strategic partnership that has been negotiated for seven months will not materialize", this deal included "USD 2 billion in contracted development revenue over a period of six years" - so it was a pretty huge hit to their plans.</p>
<p>Now less than a month later they're <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-with-immediate-implementation/" target="_blank">announcing</a> a "comprehensive restructuring program", that will see amongst other things the closing of various currently undisclosed studios and terminating various projects. In an <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/open-letter-by-embracer-group-ceo-on-restructuring-program/" target="_blank">open letter</a> the CEO Lars Wingefors mentioned their plan will "transform us from our current heavy-investment-mode to a highly cash-flow generative business this year".</p>

      <title>Noxious Weeds: Prologue is a farming themed Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You retired and wanted to farm but evil creatures just won't leave you in peace, now you have to defend your farm with the help of some veggies. Noxious Weeds: Prologue is the latest take on the craze of Vampire Survivors. Inspired also by the likes of Brotato and Risk of Rain the developer says.</p>
<p>A Prologue is out now so you can try the idea free and I definitely like what I'm seeing here. Seeing evil Avocados running around firing bullets at me, while my little carrot minions fired back was quite amusing. That was funny enough but then giant evil speedy sunflowers start running around and it just keeps getting better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resist waves of enemies through nights and days.</li>
<li>20 minutes play sessions</li>
<li>A variety of upgradeable Tools to wipe out the swarm once and for all. Your belt can carry a maximum of 6; your choices will change the outcome.</li>
<li>Rescue and team up with the cutest companions. Some will heal you, while others will fight at your side.</li>
<li>Collect the perfect crop combination to achieve game-breaking builds.</li>
<li>Accessibility. Tweak monsters' health, speed, and damage to better suit your play style.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prologue content</p>
<ul>
<li>16 Tools to choose from.</li>
<li>2 Playable characters.</li>
<li>46 Harvest items for incredible builds.</li>
<li>3 Different companions.</li>
<li>Spring season difficulty.</li>
<li>1 Character and 3 crops unlockable through Steam Achievements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a Native Linux build, although using OpenGL by default which crashed for me. However running it with "-force-vulkan" as launch option made it work perfectly. The developer is looking into it. <strong>Update</strong>: the developer is now using Vulkan by default.</p>

<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the GUI to not update when deleting the bottommost backup in the Manage Saves menu.</li>
<li>An automatic backup is made when starting a world in a new version, and a permanent backup is created when loading into a new world version</li>
<li>Fixed a world load issue between versions. (You can no longer load into a world from a game version that is newer than your current game version)</li>
<li>Fixed hitbox issue for close combat and spear throwing issue</li>

      <title>Klei Entertainment announced space survival game Dread Pilots</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love pretty much everything Klei Entertainment make and Dread Pilots looks great, a space survival game where you're exploring a mysterious and hostile pocket universe called the Dread. From the creators of Don't Starve, Griftlands and Oxygen Not Included - you know it's likely to be good.</p>
<p>"The Dread is a pocket dimension somewhere between deep space and a nightmare. You face mutated, carnivorous plant life, mind-bending anomalies, living computers, fanatical cults, space vampires and more as you traverse its many regions in a desperate search for resources and allies. Explore dark infected caverns, soar past glistening technological landscapes, and navigate chaotic mineral fields, all animated in Klei Entertainment's signature hand-drawn 2D style."</p>
<p>Definitely feeling a fair bit of Sunless Seas / Sunless Skies in the gameplay here, check it out:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OEnKDOZMf8U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66f92c3bbe447f3769f41e3aade82a59.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OEnKDOZMf8U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When it comes to Native Linux support, in a reply on <a href="https://twitter.com/klei/status/1668003643700940800" target="_blank">Twitter</a> they mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like our other titles we'll explore that once we've got a bit farther on PC development to focus our development team, but exploring that is on our radar especially with growth of Steam Deck popularity. Too early to fully test and commit at the moment, but it will be explored!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be following this along with great interest, hopefully either way it will work on Linux (and Steam Deck) at least with Proton there's a good chance regardless.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1766500/Dread_Pilots/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Unsettling first-person exploration game Interior Worlds gets a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interior Worlds is a strange and unsettling liminal spaces game that arms you with a mysterious camera. It's quite atmospheric and full of secrets to discover. They recently put up a Native Linux build which didn't initially work due to some missing bits (Unity being odd) but they've now managed to solve the issues and so it works out of the box.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Interior Worlds; an ambient and unsettling first-person exploration game where you'll dive into strange, yet familiar spaces. Temporary gaps and portals we cross at some point or another - now yearning for a closer look. A look that can only be seen properly through the lens of an SLR camera."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mSHPkTUvMSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78c17789b60e22d9c1bc5ee85dc89a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mSHPkTUvMSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your vintage and mysterious analog camera to capture stunning photographs of environmental anomalies throughout each space. Keep a sharp eye out while traversing the more... ominous locations.</li>
<li>Track and share your own in-game catalog of photos, timestamped and pre-filtered with subtle layers of maximum liminal crust.</li>
<li><strong><em>Ten unique thresholds to traverse</em></strong>. A roadside hotel, empty movie theater, dying mall, and many more. Every environment is hand-crafted in a loving throwback to late 90's and early 00's graphics.</li>
<li><strong><em>A multitude of ways to capture photos</em></strong>. Adjust zoom levels, increase/decrease lens focus, tilt left/right for a dutch angle, and more. Create perturbing compositions in hundreds of ways.</li>
<li><strong><em>Unparalleled interactivity</em></strong>. Activate vending machines, phones, sinks, televisions, or simply turn the lights on or off for a different photo-moment vibe.</li>
<li><strong><em>Immersive and unsettling soundscape</em></strong>. Melt into an eerie mix of low, rumbling drones and soft, stretched pads during the journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207970/Interior_Worlds/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. Also <a href="https://sodaraptor.itch.io/interior-worlds" target="_blank">itch.io</a> but I don't think that version is up to date.</p>

      <title>You&#39;ll be building your own dungeons in Quest Master</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quest Master is an upcoming dungeon-designing sandbox adventure from Skydevilpalm, Julian Creutz and Apogee Entertainment.</p>
<p>This one will allow you to be creative, as it's as much about building dungeons as exploring them. Taking inspiration from retro 16-bit classic dungeon crawlers but giving it a modern edge. You'll be able to face various dungeons alone or with up to 3 friends in local co-op.</p>
<p>With the built in level creator you'll be able to make anything from simple dungeons to fully overworld connected quests. Making it as easy or difficult as you like, you'll be able to create "lava-filled caverns, mountainous overworlds, grassy forests, desert dunes, and more" and even create your own little narrative with NPCs and all sorts.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NX-J9kBKIs0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9be1deae6b76de04904790886dc16feb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NX-J9kBKIs0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Quest Master hands over the controls to the players to make whatever they want,” said Julian Creutz, Lead Developer of Quest Master. “The possibilities are endless, and we can’t wait to see all kinds of wacky dungeons and full-blown adventures players are able to come up with.”</p>
<p>Sounds like one to watch!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094070/Quest_Master/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>eXtremeRate put up their Steam Deck custom shell for pre-order</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to ship around the middle of June, eXtremeRate have now put up pre-orders for those of you brave enough to mod the entire shell of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The current models they're offering right now are Clear Atomic Purple $35.99, Clear Custom (no colouring) $35.99, White $45.99, Clear Slate Black $35.99 and Chameleon Purple Blue $45.99. Seems like they're quite reasonably priced and they sure do look great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10304364021686310761gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10304364021686310761gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A reminder though: it's not easy to do, and requires taking apart pretty much the whole of your Steam Deck. The guide over on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Front+Shell+Replacement/149125" target="_blank">iFixit</a> shows just how long a process it is and they labelled it as "Difficult".</p>
<p>You can see them all on the <a href="https://extremerate.com/collections/steam-deck-shells" target="_blank">eXtremeRate website</a>.</p>
<p>The other company <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/a-fully-transparent-steam-deck-mod-seems-close-to-reality/" target="_blank">about to do it is JSAUX</a>, although we don't know when it will be sometime soon. Will you be picking one of these up to try and mod your Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>A Void Hope looks like a fun atmospheric adventure with a synthwave soundtrack</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Elden Pixels who made Alwa's Awakening and Alwa's Legacy have announced their next game, A Void Hope. An atmospheric puzzle adventure with a slick sounding synthwave soundtrack not to be missed.</p>
<p>"A Void Hope takes you on an atmospheric puzzle platforming adventure to find a cure for a collapsed city. Follow the story of a tormented couple as they try to decipher reality from nightmares and overcome the shadowy threats lurking in the dark."</p>
<p>Have to admit after watching the below trailer, I'm quite hyped by this one:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D3K4n9FnXa0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6bb2f527b486a4eecff846027430067.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D3K4n9FnXa0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Getting an almost Stranger Things vibe from it.</em></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An immersive experience - Solve puzzles, find items and progress through the story in this world brimming with mysterious ambiance.</li>
<li>Something lurks in the shadows - Crisp retro aesthetics combined with atmospheric lighting shows a world in darkness but with small slivers of hope.</li>
<li>Avoid combat, embrace exploration - Delve into an adventure filled with danger and make your way through the city avoiding the threats that come your way.</li>
<li>A haunting soundtrack - Composed by synthwave mastermind Waveshaper, an eerie and evocative landscape of music accompanies your every step.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A demo should be available for Steam Next Fest later this month. So be sure to check it out.</p>

      <title>Competitive party game Unspottable gets online play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unspottable was a lot of fun at release, giving you competitive hide and seek amongst the crowd gameplay but local multiplayer was pretty limiting. Now though, it has online play!</p>
<p>Had a lot of fun playing this with family but now perhaps more of you will have a look at it. The idea is simple, you each control a character that's the same as a bunch of wandering NPCs. It's the job of each play to figure out who is who, give them a little jab with their fist and hopefully get it correct - otherwise you'll need to quickly blend in with the crowd again. It's pretty chaotic and entertaining.</p>
<p>This big upgrade for the party game has a new trailer to celebrate online play:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZNkf4GFZ33c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dcae12c6b5c0e6d39a64464ad35317db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZNkf4GFZ33c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fun for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple controls: easy to learn, hard to master.</li>
<li>Competition based on observation rather than action.</li>
<li>Tutorial to explain game mechanics to first time players.</li>
<li>Fun feedback. Ragdoll / Endgame nicknames based on stats / Camera shakes / Funny animations and designs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Competitive party game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competition from the start: in the home screen, players can already get used to the controls and fight each other.</li>
<li>No information given to the players about their position to push them to discuss, lie and add bluffing to their strategies.</li>
<li>All the players can control the level selection and fight to select the one they want.</li>
<li>Different side quests and mechanics with each level, to create new strategies!</li>
<li>Expert mode for more advanced players</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1243960/Unspottable/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Overkill drops Linux support for PAYDAY 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PAYDAY 2 came to Linux officially back in 2016 but as of today they've removed support for it, so it will no longer see updates on the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>They're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store, although not exclusive, as it will remain on Steam and PAYDAY 3 will also be on Steam. As for why they're removing official Linux support they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/218620/announcements/detail/3667665767271115729" target="_blank">said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that Linux users will not receive this update or any following updates coming to PC. In addition, Linux players will be unable to matchmake with other PC clients following this update.<br/>
We tried to find a solution, but ultimately found it unfeasible due to the Linux version being on an older version of the PAYDAY 2 engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does, however, still work quite well with the Windows version via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> on desktop Linux <em>and</em> is Steam Deck Verified against the Windows version in Proton. So while it's a loss of support for their Native build, it's still fully playable on Linux.</p>
<p>We've seen this a few times over the years, due to a mixture of reasons but the ultimate reason is pretty much the same as always — Linux and Steam Deck together hold a less than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">2% user share</a> on Steam. For many developers, right now, it's not worth the extra overhead to continue Native support until there's more of a market.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Cyber Knights: Flashpoint a squad-tactics heist RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in development from Trese Brothers who made Star Traders: Frontiers and Templar Battleforce, the upcoming Cyber Knights: Flashpoint looks exciting.</p>
<p>What is it? At it's core it's a fusion of turn-based tactical combat, with base building all about heists in a cyberpunk setting. Previously funded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tresebrothers/cyber-knights" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, they're gearing up for a public demo in Steam Next Fest due later this month but to get you ready they've released a new trailer showing off all their work. As a big fan of anything resembling XCOM, I'm rather excited to get a chance to try this one finally.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>3rd Person Turn-based Squad Tactics</strong>: The best of modern tactical RPGs—gridless movement, cover &amp; overwatch, initiative manipulation and more. Outsmart enemy security with creative stealth &amp; hacking or go loud with powerful weapons &amp; abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Cyberpunk Stories</strong>: Contacts, squad members, and world events will weave together in stories reminiscent of the pen and paper cyberpunk RPGs we played for years while building the lore of this world.</li>
<li><strong>Thrill of the Heist</strong>: Choose your jobs &amp; work your network for advantages to pull this off. Get the crew you’ll need &amp; gear them up. Finally, look for ways to score a little more—what’s the worst that could happen?</li>
<li><strong>Power-Player Strategy</strong>: Balance factions, favors, reputation and more. Rivals, fixers, arms dealers and corporate big shots... who you work for, who you fail or betray, all of it can open and close opportunities for you. Watch your heat, and try to make sure more people owe you than the other way around.</li>
<li><strong>Endless Builds</strong>: Experiment with endless combinations of talents, multi-classing, cyberware, weapons and gear to build the perfect team.</li>
<li><strong>Safehouse Base Building</strong>: Build out your safehouse and upgrade rooms such as weapon shop, hund kennel and medical bay.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving Characters</strong>: The jobs you take have consequences for both your crew and connections. Loyalty, traits, cybernetics and escapes—you might get offworld in the end, but will any of you be the same?</li>
</ul>

      <title>GuliKit reveal an upgraded anti-drift thumbstick module for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Steam Deck is a fantastic handheld devices, there's always going to be ways to make it better and GuliKit just revealed an upgraded version of their anti-drift thumbstick mod.</p>
<p>There's actually two different versions of the Steam Deck thumbsticks, and previously GuliKit had one for each but now they've combined them into one single unit. All you need to do is flick a little switch on the back of the new version, to point to which model your Steam Deck came with - nice.</p>
<p>On top of that GuliKit say this new version requires no soldering as it comes complete <em>and</em> it uses 50% less power compared to their previous version, so it sounds easier than ever to do the replacement.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7322363171686222321gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7322363171686222321gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For getting a bit longer life out of your Steam Deck with intense gaming sessions, this is one mod that seems like it may be really worth looking into.</p>
<p>You can read more about it on their <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1026071.html" target="_blank">product page</a>. No exact word yet on when they will be come available to order so keep an eye on their <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/GULIkit/page/FB794F67-E7B2-4C62-BA0D-5A6F42CABC95" target="_blank">Amazon</a> page. Their <a href="https://twitter.com/GuliKitDesign/status/1666738962323447809" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account simply said they're "ready" and they don't do sales directly from their own website.</p>
