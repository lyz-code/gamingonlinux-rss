      <title>Is X4: Kingdom End worth your money?</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It has been over four years since X4: Foundations was released. With the new fourth DLC Kingdom End, Egosoft has now brought the last of the original races back into the game, namely the peaceful and scientifically highly motivated Borons.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IdLuSIB76UA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/502dc921dad8836758e9f522284fb26f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IdLuSIB76UA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3>So, what does the new DLC Kingdom End offer?</h3>
<p>Firstly, there is, of course, the new storyline about the Borons, who were separated from the other sectors at the beginning of the game. As players, our task is to not only restore the connection with the Borons but also help them reintegrate into the community of other factions.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with the Borons: they are peaceful aquatic creatures primarily interested in science and harmony, and they prioritize violence and economy less.</p>
<p>In addition to the long-awaited reunion with the Borons, the new DLC also expands the existing sector network. The Borons add 11 new sectors, divided into two regions, to the game. Furthermore, there are, of course, the Borons themselves and all their ships and stations.</p>
<p>Economically, there is also a requirement for a specific resource that is different from many other races – the Borons require water to build their ships and stations, a resource that has not been used for building ships and stations in X4 so far.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Boron ship design is a little different from that of the other races. The Boron ships are overall more streamlined, have a deep blue color, pulsating lights, and all appear somewhat delicate. Additionally, all ships have names of aquatic creatures, which, I believe, are almost all fish names.</p>
<p>As for ship selection, many of the ships are designed primarily for good defense and speed. For example, there is the Hydra, which has an enormously strong shield performance, or the cannon ship Tresher, which is also heavily armored.</p>
<p>However, there are no battleships or frigates for the Borons. Nevertheless, the Borons have two carrier ships, one in size L and one in XL. These carriers can then be equipped with a light fighter, the Mako, or its heavy counterpart, the Barracuda. Additionally, there are various civilian ships of the Borons, such as scouts, miners, transporters, and so on.</p>
<p>Similar to previous DLCs, Kingdom End also has two new game starts that begin at different points in the game, but ultimately lead to the same sandbox-like universe that many X4 players know and love. This means that we can still enjoy all the gameplay freedoms while also immersing ourselves in the Boron storyline.</p>
<p>Of course, I would rather not spoil the story, but I can say that it is well done. One sector that will immediately catch your attention during the early missions of the new game start is the Sanctuary of Darkness.</p>
<p>This sector is not only dangerous because some aliens fly around there, but also because there is a kind of space storm raging through it which one has to fight their way. This gave me quite a headache, as I think I died about seven or eight times trying to get through this sector. Nevertheless, I think this sector is overall a nice addition because it adds exciting elements to the story as well as to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Sanctuary of Darkness can be quite frustrating, especially for beginners, and I have to confess that after the seventh or eighth try, I simply consulted Reddit to find my way through the sector.</p>
<p>A nice element of at least one of these launches is that we get the research station/player HQ shortly after the beginning of that launch – and without any work at all. We only have to dock there once and then we can chat a little with the first Boron we meet in the storyline and he then simply gives us the station.</p>
<p>The expansion also comes with its own set of achievements that can only be unlocked with this DLC.</p>
<h3>6.00 Update</h3>
<p>Alongside the paid DLC, Egosoft also released the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/6659175566905047112" target="_blank">free 6.0 update</a>. This update offers a new physics engine, improved lighting effects, and parallax occlusion mapping, which has made significant changes to the game's underlying systems.</p>
<p>However, personally, I don't think I saw much of a difference. Although I had already set my graphics settings to high and still found the game relatively attractive, there were some performance drops in certain areas. While I mostly had around 60 FPS, there were moments – especially in stations – where the FPS dropped to around 18 or 20.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, X4 is still an incredibly demanding game even with the new DLC and update, not just in terms of graphics but also in terms of CPU and RAM usage on your PC. It's hardly surprising, given that the game simulates a vast universe with around 100 sectors.</p>
<p>In addition to some new models for the construction ships of all races and the option for fleets led by a single carrier to defend multiple positions, the 6.0 update naturally offers a whole host of smaller bug fixes and changes, which I cannot mention all here. But please follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/6659175566905047112" target="_blank">this link</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p>However, one feature I particularly liked in the 6.0 update was the live-stream feature. By pressing F6, we can now select a new camera perspective that presents a ship or station from the outside – optionally with some basic information and cinematic black bars. This is great for a long journey in space, and I was delighted that Egosoft added it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Did I like X4 Kingdom End and the update?</p>
<p>To put it briefly, overall yes.</p>
<p>However, I must admit that X4 is not a game that you can just play on the side. Even though I had already spent around 150 hours in X4 before the DLC, I actually had to relearn the ship controls and figure out where all the hotkeys were in the first hour of the new DLC.</p>
<p>The other reason why X4 is not a game for "just playing for a moment" is that, after four years and with the new DLC and update, it is a real monster. The game is not only incredibly large, with around 100 sectors, but also incredibly complex. And it just takes time to make progress in certain areas.</p>
<p>You have to build your reputation, earn money, and buy or steal your fleet together – and that takes a little time. However, that's also the beauty of X4. So if you have the time and patience to get into X4, you'll definitely have a lot of fun, especially now with the new DLC and the newly added Borons.</p>
<p>However, while playing, I also noticed some things that I didn't find quite polished. For example, when I received my Mako fighter as a gift from the Borons, I didn't know how to get into the damn thing. Here, a very simple tutorial hint would have been nice to show newcomers an easy way into their ship.</p>
<p>Since X4 is still a very complex and large game, some minor bugs are to be expected. The autopilot, for example, still tends to crash into things if you rely on it too much. Other than that, there are a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing really dramatic.</p>
<p>In terms of game design, I found the mission where you have to set the navigation beacons in Sanctuary of Darkness – don't worry, it's not a particularly late mission, so I won't spoil too much – not easy at all. This is mainly because there are hardly any visual clues as to where it is safest to pass through this sector.</p>
<p>While you're told to stick to the asteroids and look for areas where nothing is destroyed, there aren't many asteroids in this sector, and the path isn't very clear. After about seven or eight attempts, I ended up consulting Reddit because it was getting too frustrating – and I found that a bit disappointing. When I had to pass through the sector again later, I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would say that X4 Kingdom End is definitely worth the purchase, especially for fans of the series. However, I think most of you have already bought the DLC by now.</p>
<p>Not only does it add the last remaining race in the X4 universe to the game, but there are also 11 new sectors and two new regions. By the way, these two regions are very different economically. While the sectors of the Provinces Adrift are initially quite starved economically, the sectors of the royal Borons are economically well-positioned. Both parties are thirsty for expanding their economic influence across the entire X-universe – and that offers some gameplay options.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the music. I can only emphazise that Alexei Zakharov did an excellent job. The music of the game was the element that captivated me already in the trailer and provided me with some beautiful moments in the game. Sitting in front of the screen and watching the new sectors and ships in live-view while enjoying the atmospheric music created some special moments.</p>
<p>So if you've played X4 in the past and have €14.99 / $14.99 / £12.49 to spare, I highly recommend giving the DLC a chance. I think the new DLC is a real improvement, as is the new update.</p>
<p>However, I hope that X4 will continue to work on the story and especially the performance in future updates, as it is still an issue. Nevertheless, X4 is and remains a unique game in its own right, and I am very pleased that it is still being developed and hope that it will continue to receive new updates.</p>
<p>If you've never played X4 before, I can definitely recommend the game, but with the small warning that the game not only requires at least a decent PC, but also a lot of time. But the game is certainly beautiful. There are few single-player space simulations that are as comprehensive and offer as much freedom as X4.</p>
<p>You can buy X4 on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/x4_foundations?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/x4-foundations?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor had a very rough launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Just like The Last of Us Part I (and so many other games recently), another major game released too early. STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor is a hot mess.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for players to make their thoughts clear, with the Steam user review rating hitting Mostly Negative shortly after release from over three thousand people, although now it's changed to Mixed. This could easily be the worst launch so far this year. It's so full of general technical issues but the biggest problem is the performance, as even on top-end systems it seems to be struggling everywhere.</p>
<p>Here's an example of just how bad it is on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="poYcwyybW8I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4253bc83e5aab08c43e51979a932c87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/poYcwyybW8I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's probably going to be quite a while before it's fixed up to a satisfactory level. They've now released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1774580/view/3719453359664023556" target="_blank">statement</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are aware that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor isn’t performing to our standards for a percentage of our PC players, in particular those with high-end machines or certain specific configurations.</p>
<p>For example, players using cutting-edge, multi-threaded chipsets designed for Windows 11 were encountering problems on Windows 10, or high-end GPUs coupled with lower-performing CPUs also saw unexpected frame loss. Rest assured, we are working to address these cases quickly.</p>
<p>While there is no single, comprehensive solution for PC performance, the team has been working on fixes we believe will improve performance across a spectrum of configurations. We are committed to fixing these issues as soon as possible, but each patch requires significant testing to ensure we don’t introduce new problems. Thanks for understanding and apologies to any of our players experiencing these issues. We will continue to monitor performance across all platforms and share update timing as soon as it is available.</p>
<p>The Star Wars Jedi Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor out on desktop Linux with my Fedora KDE 38 system running an AMD Ryzen 5800X, an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and Proton Experimental it can't hold anywhere near 60FPS even at only 1080p. Testing across Low, Medium and High details preset, the performance across all of them is very similar and even Low is well below 60FPS, often 40FPS and below. Keep in mind these shots are on Low details:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16144453171682717033gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16144453171682717033gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16342425531682717035gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16342425531682717035gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Right now, it's a definite skip until they actually sort out all the performance problems.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1774580/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Survivor/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dust off your game dev environment with the Linux Game Jam 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux Game Jam 2023 is happening and a good chance for you to blow the dust and clean away the cobwebs from your development environment and perhaps come up with the next big hit?</p>
<p>Starting on May 27th 2023 and running through until June 6th 2023 it's being <a href="https://itch.io/jam/linux-game-jam2023" target="_blank">hosted on itch.io</a> and here's the rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Huge Steam Beta upgrade with new overlay, screenshot manager &amp; more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow. Valve sure love to just drop awesome stuff out of nowhere don't they? A brand new Beta update is now live for Steam with some massive improvements. There's also a fresh Steam Deck Beta too!</p>
<p>First, let's talk Steam Desktop. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3686801719529689367" target="_blank">Beta</a> brings in a whole new Steam Overlay with a new interface and a fancy toolbar, that gives you easy access to various things like friends chat, achievements progress, guides, discussions, a browser, and more. There's a new notes app that lets you type in whatever you like, saved in the cloud and synced across other systems. Even more awesome, is that you can now pin things on top of the game window, to have them show on top — which sounds incredibly useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/899241641682676661gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/899241641682676661gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Above you can see the new overlay in action on Fedora KDE 38, with a bunch of windows open. And a note telling myself that I need to "Git gud". If you notice, the guide has a blue pin, because that has been pinned to the game, so when looking at the game it would show up like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8027767671682676763gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8027767671682676763gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Wherever you place a pinned window in the overlay, is where it will show on the game.</p>
<p>Notifications have been overhauled too and they even upgraded the screenshot manager.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19112819641682676287gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19112819641682676287gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For Linux and macOS, Valve even said their work has now enabled hardware acceleration bringing it up to the same level as the Windows client. So now Steam should be a lot smoother. One thing they noted is how a lot of work went under the hood for all this, as they changed how they share the code between desktop, big picture and Steam Deck to help bring features out faster.</p>
<p>There's subtle design changes across the whole client too, so a lot more of it matches with their newer modern design elements and it looks pretty great now overall, much more consistent.</p>
<p>It also wasn't mentioned directly but the old Steam file picker when adding a Non-Steam game is gone, instead it now seems to use the desktop file picker. Finally! That was one of the worst parts of the Steam client because that old Steam file picker was pretty terrible but now you get your full desktop picker. Excellent.</p>
<p>This overall is really quite a fantastic upgrade for Steam on desktop. According to Valve designer Lawrence Yang on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1651742201272209408" target="_blank">Twitter</a> the overlay improvements will eventually come to Gaming Mode on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Steam Deck also had a Beta and Preview update with these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3717201559846022608" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new warning icon to the header that will display when Steam Deck can't reach the Steam servers. Clicking the icon will navigate a page with more details.</li>
<li>The wifi icon will no longer show a yellow exclamation mark when Steam Deck can't reach the Steam servers. It will still show this icon if Steam Deck can't reach the internet (e.g. the connection has a login portal).</li>
<li>Added support for Mouse4 (Back) as B button in the interface.</li>
<li>Fixed opening the "Reorder controllers" dialog in the main Big Picture Window when a game is running.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new config export path that works while offline. In personal configuration dropdown the options are now "New Personal Save", which is this new option and "New Sharable Personal Save", which uses the existing Steam Workshop backend.</li>
<li>Filter the configuration export options based on whether the device is connected to Steam/Offline.</li>
<li>Fixed some flashes when adjusting sliders in the Quick Settings section of the configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed moving right in the mode settings page not jumping to the appropriate settings sub-page.</li>
<li>Fixed turning off the Dual Sense Edge controller.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Steam Deck has all the new overlay stuff too but just in Desktop Mode for now. </em></p>
<p><strong>Update 28/04/23 20:08 UTC</strong>: an additional Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3705942560783794887" target="_blank">update</a> went out, fixing up some issues and adding back the missing Steam Play settings.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us gets more optimizations and another Steam Deck fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slowly but it's happening, The Last of Us is getting fixed up after the poor launch and it's getting a little closer to being playable on Steam Deck now too. On desktop Linux at least, it ran pretty well at release (aside from all the confirmed game bugs and issues) but on Steam Deck it was especially rough.</p>
<p>Here's everything changed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1888930/view/5815877879410560069" target="_blank">v1.0.4</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized CPU and GPU use throughout the game</li>
<li>Improved texture fidelity and resolution on in-game Low and Medium settings</li>
<li>Improved graphical fidelity on the in-game Low graphics preset, particularly water surfaces no longer appear black</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur during shader building</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur when quitting to the Main Menu</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur when dying after combat</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, on first boot, players may experience longer wait times to load into the game</li>
<li>Added an option for players to lock and unlock performance stats simultaneously in the HUD menu (Options &gt; HUD)</li>
<li>Added descriptions in the Graphics menus to better explain when certain settings may affect another (Options &gt; Display)</li>
<li>Added a Texture Streaming Rate setting (Graphics &gt; Texture Settings)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where skipping cutscenes during a critical load may cause the game to hang</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the shader load warning did not appear while relaunching the game</li>
<li>Updated the VRAM bar to more accurately display the OS+Apps usage</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Screen Reader read values for locked settings which may imply those same locked setting were active</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where aiming downward while using keyboard and mouse (KBM) may increase camera sensitivity</li>
<li>Refined the handling of certain commands that are assigned the same KBM keybinding</li>
<li>Corrected Brazilian Portuguese, Croatian, Dutch, Finnish, French, Greek, Hungarian, LATAM Spanish, Spanish, Thai, and Traditional Chinese translations for multiple menu options</li>
<li>[Ultrawide Displays] Corrected the Rangefinder reticle position for the bow</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>AMD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur on AMD CPUs with affinity limited to X3D cores</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where textures may render incorrectly on AMD GPUs</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the “It Can't Be For Nothing” achievement did not trigger, despite acquiring all other achievements</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue on Steam Deck where resetting Display settings to Default no longer enabled AMD FSR 2 (Options &gt; Display)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going back to it myself today on Steam Deck to test and the first bit of good news - is that the initial shader building on the menu now only takes just about 16 and a half minutes, down from the 1 hour it took at release. That is a huge improvement but still quite a while to twiddle your thumbs when you've already waited a good while just to download the game.</p>
<p>After that though, my first attempt to just load an early saved game resulted in my Steam Deck doing a full reboot. An annoying issue that has been present since release, that a few other bigger titles also cause as well like God of War. Second load though worked fine. One of the heaviest parts of the game is actually in the intro section, and here on the default settings (Low + FSR 2 Quality) it stayed a lot closer to 30FPS compared to before where it would be sticking well below it the entire time. So there's definitely some performance uplifts with this patch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10715926001682616755gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10715926001682616755gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17163347691682616756gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17163347691682616756gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Still far from ideal though, with multiple dips below 30FPS but the improvement is <em>clear</em> in my testing. In another couple patches, and perhaps with the upcoming major SteamOS 3.5 update, it might actually be closer to a properly playable status.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you've given it another run since this latest patch, how's your experience now?</p>

      <title>Charming monster collector Cassette Beasts is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is the second full release from Bytten Studio following Lenna's Inception. It's a rather sweet evolution on the Pokémon-like monster catching games.</p>
<p>Giving off an 80s vibe, this is an open-world RPG with turn-based battles where you record monsters on retro cassette tapes, and you can use some of their abilities in the open world too. Together with the clever fusion system, that allows you to create lots of unique creatures, there's a lot to love about it.</p>
<p>Developed with Godot Engine, it has full Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified with the Steam Deck using the Native Linux build by default. The Godot Engine team just <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-showcase-cassette-beasts/" target="_blank">did an interview</a> with the developers that's worth a read too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_OLST_Fw5Ms"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d9c826a8b5b43e68a56a646276bbf49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_OLST_Fw5Ms" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?! Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li>Fuse monster forms! Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li>Explore a rich open world - Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions - Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li>Master a deep battle system - Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
<li>Play couch-co op with Friends - Team up in local multiplayer with a friend to explore an open world, transform and battle together! Facing the unknown as a duo will surely develop your relationship!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely worth picking up. The developers have supported Linux very nicely with it and it's just a great looking game. I had a huge amount of fun with the demo which you can still try right now to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive announced today that the mini-expansion Cities: Skylines - Hotels &amp; Retreats is due for release on May 23rd. On top of the mini-expansion they've also revealed three content creator packs.</p>
<p>"Revealing the last Cities: Skylines expansion and content packs is a bittersweet moment. Cities: Skylines has always been about empowering players to build the cities of their dreams, and the expansion and Content Creator Packs will provide the final tools and options to do just that," said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order. "Thank you to our dedicated community of players for their support and feedback throughout the years. As we watch the sun set on Cities: Skylines together and move to the next chapter of the franchise, we look forward to seeing and learning from the amazing creations players design, this last time and beyond."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BFc50HzpQYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19c4f39e789384fb186ac96f4704516f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BFc50HzpQYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Cities: Skylines - Hotels &amp; Retreats Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hotel Buildings: Hostels, cabins, hotels, luxurious resorts… you name it! Add a series of hotel buildings to your city on a range of budgets.</li>
<li>Hotel Management: Start with one-star hotels and unlock new options as your business revenue and popularity booms.</li>
<li>Tourism Buildings: New structures will support your hotels: parks, restaurants, playgrounds, and cafès.</li>
<li>Location: Matching hotels with good locations will be paramount, as differing locations will attract different tourist groups. We added 5 new maps for your hotels (3 European-inspired maps, 1 tropical map, and 1 temperate map).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can also look forward to the following Content Creator Packs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Industrial Evolution: Walk the path of history with “Industrial Evolution”, from Community Creator Samantha “Avanya” Woods. This Content Creator Pack includes a new set of growable buildings that span different eras of industrial building styles, from red brick walls to modern, sleek industrial complexes.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is all the final content, the game will still get general support until the end of the year. So if any big bugs need squashing then we might see some smaller updates come in. Mainly because their team are now working on the sequel with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/paradox-cities-skylines-2-plus-the-sims-like-game/" target="_blank">Cities: Skylines 2</a>.</p>

      <title>Street Fighter 6 on Steam Deck and Linux tested, Valve sets it to Proton Experimental</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Street Fighter 6 is coming up for release in June and there's a demo now available to try out on Steam, which Valve has now set to use Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1651345821332557824" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve designer Lawrence Yang noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For folks checking out the Street Fighter 6 demo on Steam Deck, the launch issue has been addressed (we’ve temporarily pinned the title to Proton Experimental.)</p>
<p>You may need to restart Steam to pick up this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you have been trying it out and couldn't get it working right, either uncheck any Proton version in the compatibility settings to pick up what Valve set or manually swap it over to Proton Experimental yourself. For now Valve think that will give you the best experience in the demo. I did notice though one video in the intro logo screen section didn't work, and was instead their video-test screen but apart from that everything else seemed to work.</p>
<p>Performance can be an issue though. It's easy enough to get a near-solid 60FPS in the versus mode on Steam Deck but the World Tour mode is a different beast. Settings will need to be turned down for it.</p>
<p>Here's a short look at the demo running on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xuKA41Z-2sM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb6e3fa37ff50c42fd7ac251770ec927.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xuKA41Z-2sM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On desktop Linux, I've done my testing here with Fedora KDE 38 and one thing it did on desktop, that it didn't do on Steam Deck, is offer up pre-warming of the shaders. So, letting it do that option, gave a wait of only around 2 minutes on my Ryzen 7 5800X / NVIDIA 2080 Ti setup, so nice and speedy compared to some other games.</p>
<p>After that, the versus mode on desktop Linux with Proton gave an almost perfect 60FPS at 2560x1400 (Ultra settings) and it looks amazing in action. It could go a lot higher but the fights are locked to 60FPS as a max:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14365365581682606110gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14365365581682606110gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The full game is set to launch on June 2nd, so it's nice to see that Valve are keeping a close eye on yet another popular titles about to release.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental upgraded for April 26th brings fixes and new game support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go, now that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Proton 8</a> is out <em>and</em> Proton Experimental has been rebased on top of Proton 8, there's more fixes and improvements coming in for Steam Deck and Linux desktop gamers.</p>
<p>Valve released an update to Proton Experimental on April 26th that includes these newly supported games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint.</li>
<li>Minecraft Legends.</li>
<li>Company of Heroes: Battle of Crete.</li>
<li>STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are fixes from regressions in Proton 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3 no longer launches to a black screen in Vulkan mode.</li>
<li>Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition and Divinity Original Sin II: Definitive Edition no longer crash on resolution change.</li>
<li>Path of Exile no longer crashes.</li>
<li>GTA V no longer freezes after each key press.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's these other improvements too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regression causing Payday 2 to crash on start.</li>
<li>Improved Elden Ring compatibility compared to Proton 8.0-1. It can still be a bit finicky.</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in Trackmania and Ubisoft Connect overlay.</li>
<li>Added a temporary workaround for EA Launcher crashing. Steam Deck's on-screen keyboard may not pop up automatically while using it.</li>
<li>Fixed Madballs in Babo: Invasion claiming the game wasn't purchased.</li>
<li>Fixed PlanetSide 2 launcher.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>Since there's many different Proton versions it can get a bit confusing, so head on over to my <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">beginner's guide on Steam Play and Proton</a> for more info.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper is getting pets and a creative mode on May 10th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming "Paws &amp; Claws" update for Core Keeper sounds wonderful, adding in two major features with pets and a creative mode.</p>
<p>Releasing on May 10th it will have an entirely new Meadow biome featuring cattle, animal companions you can hatch and lots of new game mechanics. There's also going to be new decorative items too like glass that could be useful. Adding a creative mode sounds good too, for those that prefer things a bit more peaceful. This creative mode also has a god mode, allowing you to move much more freely including through objects.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J3AHHSdTaHk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55ae7bbc66043f835e7786142a6055fb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J3AHHSdTaHk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Pricing of the game is also going to change on May 29th with prices going up, however it's also on a 20% discount from the currently lower price now until May 22nd. As for the rising price they shared these as an example of what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Price in GBP = £12.99</li>

<p>From the press release:</p>

      <title>UK CMA blocks the Microsoft takeover of Activision</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's some industry news for you: the UK's Competition and Markets Authority has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-activision-deal-prevented-to-protect-innovation-and-choice-in-cloud-gaming" target="_blank">announced</a> today they've blocked Microsoft's takeover of Activision.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the main concern of the UK CMA here seems to be around Cloud Gaming specifically. As they said in their statement "Microsoft has a strong position in cloud gaming services and the evidence available to the CMA showed that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s games exclusive to its own cloud gaming service." and that "The deal would reinforce Microsoft’s advantage in the market by giving it control over important gaming content such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft. The evidence available to the CMA indicates that, absent the merger, Activision would start providing games via cloud platforms in the foreseeable future.".</p>
<p><em>Quite a big blow to the $68.7 billion deal!</em></p>
<p>We saw Microsoft attempt to get around these concerns, with various Cloud Gaming deals being announced over the last year but it seems that just hasn't been enough. An interesting part of the CMA announcement was on a proposal submitted by Microsoft, to address some of their concerns, this proposal was to set out "requirements governing what games must be offered by Microsoft to what platforms and on what conditions over a ten-year period" but one of the shortcomings noted was "It was not sufficiently open to providers who might wish to offer versions of games on PC operating systems other than Windows.". Nice to see.</p>
<p>The UK certainly isn't the only country to be concerned by the power this deal would hand to Microsoft with the US FTC also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-hits-a-bump-as-ftc-seeks-to-block-it/" target="_blank">trying to block it</a> and according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/no-substantive-settlement-talks-between-us-ftc-microsoft-over-activision-lawyer-2023-01-03/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> earlier this year there were no substantive settlement talks on it. So now with the UK blocking it, that will likely boost the FTC's argument to block it too. On top of that, there's also the EU regulators decision coming up next month.</p>
<p>Microsoft, naturally, will be attempting to appeal the decision.</p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts?</em></p>

      <title>Valheim is getting siege weapons, fortresses and fearsome foes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming major update to Valheim with The Ashlands is sounding increasingly exciting, as the developers have another spoiler-filled development <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com/news/development-blog-fearsome-foes/" target="_blank">blog post</a> up. Naturally, you'll want to avert your eyes if you don't want anything spoiled.</p>
<p>While there's no expected release date yet for The Ashlands because they're still working out all the mechanics, this is an exciting glimpse into what to expect from it. However, we might see some public testing within the next couple of months.</p>
<p>It seems the land will be filled with fortresses and siege weapons, something that was teased on <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinEyreArt/status/1646798139930681344" target="_blank">Twitter</a> recently but now we have a clear shot of one:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20765479481682506191gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20765479481682506191gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>These fortresses will come with some scary looking creatures too like the Fallen Valkyrie and the Charred:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14217335941682506322gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14217335941682506322gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19348428301682506321gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19348428301682506321gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sure they look scary, but I would argue the scariest foes in Valheim are still those damn Deathsquitos, sneaky little things. Lost count of the amount of times I've been bested by them.</p>
<p>Oh and if that wasn't enough, there's going to be a Bonemaw Serpent ready to chomp sections of your ships away, or your arms and legs if you happen to fall into the water:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8095496471682506414gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8095496471682506414gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>All this plus the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valheim-is-getting-extensive-difficulty-options-including-a-creative-mode/" target="_blank">upcoming customisation</a> of the difficulty options (and a creative mode) really has me excited, the future of Valheim is sounding simply awesome.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: Galactic Paragons announced for May 9th and a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellaris: Galactic Paragons is the next expansion for my favourite space strategy game from Paradox Interactive and it's coming May 9th. This DLC will give deeper character and story progression allowing for more customisation of your leaders.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“There are endless stories to tell in the Stellaris universe. Breathing life into the stories of the leaders in the Galactic Council and your empires is a perfect showcase of the team’s commitment to expanding the ways our players can explore a vast and wondrous galaxy,” said Stephen Muray, Game Director for Stellaris. “Our players push us to bring Stellaris to new heights, and we'll be exploring the galaxy alongside them for years to come.”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NrWoHmBntTw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7793c3863bcba899f8e683d776969bc6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NrWoHmBntTw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique Council Roles</strong>: Specialized roles and benefits are included in Galactic Paragons to expand upon the new Council Mechanics in Stellaris! Find dozens of unique council roles based on your civics and government types, and unlock additional positions as your empire evolves.</li>
<li><strong>New Dynamic Leaders</strong>: Recruit, improve, and follow the leaders of your empire through the ages! You may shape them by picking their traits, selecting their veteran class, and guide them towards their destiny, up until they retire - or perish!</li>
<li><strong>Meet Galactic Heroes</strong>: Attract paragons of renown to your council: unique leaders with their own art, events, and stories may join your empire and bring their own benefits to your government. Or, discover four Legendary Paragons with intricate event chains and unique mechanics!</li>
<li><strong>New Traditions, Civics, And More</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A new “Under One Rule” Origin that tells the tale of the leader who founded your empire</li>
<li>Eight new Civics focused on leadership, from immortalizing the personalities of leaders past in digital archives to heavily optimized council selection via corporate charter</li>
<li>12 new Veteran Classes</li>
<li>Hundreds of new Leader Traits</li>
<li>Two new Tradition Trees, giving players new edicts and improved leaders</li>
<li>New ships, art, and story content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will of course drop alongside the 3.8 update which I mentioned recently, that will include two co-op modes. You can get a lot more info on the co-op mode in their <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-293-introducing-coop.1577064/" target="_blank">explainer forum post</a> but essentially it comes down to these key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cooperative PvE</strong> allows players to join together as a single empire to take on enemy empires. This presents a great opportunity for players to teach their friends how to play the game or divide the responsibilities of empire management for a more relaxed gaming experience.</li>
<li><strong>Cooperative PvP</strong> allows groups of players to join opposing empires to fight against each other. Splitting up duties may reduce barriers to entry of competitive multiplayer by being less overwhelming. For more competitive players, empires can also be locked and require a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a Preview update with STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor is releasing on April 28th, so Valve has released an updated graphics driver in the Preview update branch for Steam Deck. This is the work covered previously where Valve wouldn't name the game, so we got <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-improving-mesa-graphics-drivers-on-linux-for-a-secret-game/" target="_blank">a bit too excited</a> about it.</p>
<p>Released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3729585915988347091" target="_blank">April 25th</a>, the Steam Deck OS 3.4.7 Beta available in the Preview branch simply notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the graphics driver with performance improvements for STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you're wanting to get the best out of Jedi: Survivor on Friday, be sure you've opted into the Preview branch on Steam Deck which you can do in the Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>The next major SteamOS update for Steam Deck should be quite an exciting one, as SteamOS 3.5 is planned to come with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/hdr-and-colour-management-patches-for-steam-deck-amd-gpus-under-review/" target="_blank">support for HDR</a> for external screens when docked along with an upgraded Linux kernel and various improvements elsewhere.</p>

      <title>Grounded 1.2 out now and Steam Deck Verified but desktop Linux needs a small fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The survival game Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Xbox Game Studios has now released version 1.2 and it got bumped up to Verified on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/grounded-from-obsidian-adds-steam-deck-support-in-v120/" target="_blank">I reported previously</a> during the Beta, the developers managed to fix up the issues that were causing the game to not run and even with workarounds the Xbox login was still a mess.

<p>Grounded will be having a Free Weekend on Steam as well from April 27th until May 1st, so you'll be able to check it out on Steam Deck and see all the fancy new stuff too.</p>
<p>For Linux gamers on <em>desktop</em>, sadly it still won't run out of the box. However, to get it to work all you have to do is remove or rename the <code class="inline-code">SpeechSynthWrapper.dll</code> file found in the <code class="inline-code">Grounded/Maine/Binaries/Win64/</code> install folder. You can find the installed folder in Properties -&gt; Local Files / Installed Files and hit Browse. Here's a shot from it running just fine after that on Fedora KDE 38:</p>

      <title>Using a Steam Deck to control a Ukrainian automatic turret, now I&#39;ve seen it all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>People have used their Steam Deck to do all sorts of crazy things but this latest is nuts. It seems people in Ukraine are using it to help work an automatic turret. From ТРО Медіа on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tro.media.news/posts/pfbid02WH8wn384mZtJtagg9QnK9MnEFNpmjX6NLTyd3xzFsEtMmWM9cV55hVkvT8GvjJeEl" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, they shared a post giving a few details into it with it translating roughly as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sablya" is a Ukrainian automated remote-controlled fire complex designed for stationary installation on real estate objects or special transport.</p>
<p>The Shable Coordination is done via a remote control, camera and monitor, which allows combat from up to 500 from the rig, while preserving the operator's life.</p>
<p>A combat platform can be installed both stationary at checkpoints, border and other zones, including to defeat low-flying enemy "drones". On the platform you can install any light anti-infantry or anti-tank weapon weapon, for example, machine gun kalashnikov.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what did people spot in the pictures? A Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17221077421682436293gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17221077421682436293gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9027042651682436292gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9027042651682436292gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Well, it is an entire computer in your hands with a screen, with a full Linux desktop mode available. So sure, why not. Thinking plainly, it's not too different to them sitting with a laptop of any other brand, just that little bit more portable. <em>The other side is that they could just be using it to play some games in between testing and who could blame them eh?</em></p>
<p>There's spotting a Steam Deck "in the wild" and then there's this. Quite a surprise.</p>

      <title>AMD Ryzen Z1 Series announced for handhelds, ASUS ROG Ally first to get it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After many leaks, AMD has now formally announced their brand new Ryzen Z1 Series, which directly target the handheld gaming space like the Steam Deck. </p>
<p>The chips being announced today are the Zen 4 based Ryzen Z1 and Ryzen Z1 Extreme that come with RDNA 3 architecture-based graphics. AMD also announced clearly that the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/asus-rog-ally-gaming-handheld/" target="_blank">ASUS ROG Ally</a> will be the first device launching with them.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“At AMD, we’re continually advancing the next generation of gaming experiences, from consoles to desktops to on-the-go handheld devices,” said Jason Banta, corporate vice president and general manager, Client OEM at AMD. “Ryzen Z1 processors deliver gamers an elite gaming experience and extreme portability in exciting gaming form factors.”</p>

</table>
<p>The processors support USB4 and the latest LPDDR5 and LPDDR5X memory standards.</p>
<p>AMD also said in their press release that more info on the ROG Ally will be announced on May 11th.</p>
<p>“Having a great gaming experience doesn’t mean you have to be tied to a chair or a charger,” said Shawn Yen, product management director of Gaming Business Unit, Asus. “With the new Ryzen Z1 Series processors, we’re working with AMD to deliver the power, visuals and efficiency needed to enable a superior portable gaming experience — whether you’re traveling, commuting for work or simply want to game untethered.”</p>
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-z1" target="_blank">AMD page</a> for the new processors, AMD give more details and yet they're showing a Nintendo Switch and a Steam Deck in pictures before the Ally:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21165147581682435295gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21165147581682435295gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The question is why are they showing two devices not using these chips? An error left in, or are we just supposed to assume it's to showcase power from low to high without naming them directly? Curious. Or even upcoming new versions of both with these new chips (not likely).</p>
<p><strong>Update 20:12 UTC</strong>: AMD removed the Switch and Steam Deck so it's now just the Ally:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1553915221682449836gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1553915221682449836gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>So at least now we know what processor the ROG Ally will use but can it really compete with the Steam Deck? Until we know pricing, nothing is clear on that. With more power comes more battery drain too, there's so many unknowns about it.</p>

      <title>KDE apps like Kdenlive get big upgrades for KDE Gear 23.04</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Gear is the name of the big bundle of software the KDE team create, and with the KDE Gear 23.04 release there's new apps and plenty of improvements to making the desktop experience better.</p>
<p>One of the newer apps is Tokodon, a desktop client for Mastodon that supports multiple accounts, which is super useful if you have multiple accounts on the same host. <em>FYI you can follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux on Mastodon</a>.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10807629541682421056gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10807629541682421056gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the improvements include the ability to see previous messages when replying and the ability to send polls to your followers, plus you can also configure a proxy for it before logging in now as well.</p>
<p>The Kdenlive video editor, my go-to app for editing all GamingOnLinux videos got support for nested timelines, this new feature allows you to group several clips together to treat them as a single sequence, allowing you then do all sorts of things to the clips together like effects and transitions. Sounds incredibly useful. Honestly this is probably the feature I am most excited about, it sounds like it might end up saving a lot of time when editing videos with lots of different clips together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/716827921682422320gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/716827921682422320gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of other improvements elsewhere to the likes of their YouTube Music app called AudioTube getting a redesign, NeoChat for Matrix also has an upgraded design, the screenshot tool Spectacle now allows you to annotate screenshots and record your screen on Wayland (and it also had a redesign), the Filelight app for monitoring disk space gained a useful list view and lots more.</p>
<p>More can be seen on the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/gear/23.04.0/" target="_blank">announcement page</a>.</p>

      <title>Paradox announce first &#39;Immersion Pack&#39; for Victoria 3 and free upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Victoria 3 from Paradox Interactive is getting it's first "Immersion Pack" on May 22nd and here's what to expect from it.</p>
<p>It's called Voice of the People, Paradox say it challenges you to handle some of history's greatest political agitators. Coming with a new Agitator system that's highlighted with the addition of dozens of historical figures who break convention and build political power behind the force of their personality. Meet intellectuals like Mikhail Bakunin, conservative militarists like Georges Boulanger, and voices for freedom like Frederick Douglas.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jAEsJek9fW4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7abea2eaab323e568a78e3d96171bb18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jAEsJek9fW4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 60 New Historical Characters: Explore new alternate histories with real historical characters, including John Brown, Emmeline Pankhurst, and Enver Pasha.</li>
<li>Special Agitator Actions: Aid the agitators by promoting them to lead Interest Groups, or send them into exile to blunt their impact. You can also, in some cases, invite other nations’ exiles into your society to take advantage of their ideas.</li>
<li>Unique French Content: New events, journal missions, and decisions inspired by French history. Press your advantage in Northern Africa, back one of many royal claimants, or establish a strong French Empire in Europe and worldwide.</li>
<li>New French Buildings: Historic structures from France added to the map.</li>
<li>New Art: A paper map unique to Voice of the People, wrapped in a new art nouveau appearance. New animations for revolutions highlight the interest groups in revolt, and new clothing and uniforms are added for many societies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you decide to pre-order it they will throw in an extra three historical French characters - the great Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, the author and political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, and Jules Brunet, the French military advisor to Shogunate Japan. The DLC will be priced around $14.99 / £12.99 / €14.99.</p>
<p>At release as usual for Paradox titles there will also be a big free upgrade for all players too. This free update does include the agitator system but there will also be new political ideologies for France, changes to the world map, and reworks of the legislative and revolutionary processes, along with many other changes.</p>

      <title>Valve moves ELDEN RING back to Proton 7 as it has issues with newer Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Certain games on Steam that you play across either Linux desktop or Steam Deck get a specific version of Proton set by Valve, and at times they don't quite work right like ELDEN RING.</p>
<p>In this case Valve had set Proton Experimental to be the default to run ELDEN RING, where it did work previously, however they just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-upgraded-with-proton-8/" target="_blank">upgraded Proton Experimental</a> basing it upon the newly released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Proton 8</a>. With any new Proton version can come breakage as the translation layer isn't quite perfected just yet and in this case the popular game is having issues with the Proton upgrades.</p>
<p>As mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1650299941699596288" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The launch issue with ELDEN RING has been addressed by temporarily reverting the game to using Proton 7 while the Proton 8 update issue is being investigated. Restarting Steam will pick up the fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you're forcing a compatibility option on ELDEN RING, you might want to uncheck it to pick up what Valve set or change it yourself back to Proton 7 to have it work again.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to keep on top of compatibility like this.</p>

      <title>Linux and Steam Deck compatibility tool Luxtorpeda gets upgraded in v63</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a very interesting project. It's a compatibility layer (like Proton) but designed to help you run Native Linux game engines for various Steam games.</p>
<p>Why? Well, quite a number of games on Steam actually have much more modern community-made game engines, that can give all sorts of quality enhancements. Luxtorpeda allows you to easily download these and run them directly through Steam.</p>
<p>Version 63 was recently released and here's the main technical changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to using Steam Linux Runtime - Sniper for the built engines. This provides newer tooling for builds, which should make future development easier, for example being able to build qt 5.15 and have gcc 10 available. The 100+ engines have been re-built. Note that previous clients should still work on the older soldier, but any new updates will only happen to sniper (this client and above). If you run into any issues with the engines, please open a new issue in the <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">packages</a> repo.</li>
<li>Rust panics, if they occur, should now be caught and displayed in the Godot UI.</li>
<li>[dreamer] Use steamlocate v2 alpha</li>
<li>Bump h2 from 0.3.15 to 0.3.17</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from that, there's been numerous <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#630-2023-04-13" target="_blank">upgrades</a> to the various game engines it offers up to help you get the most out of your gaming. You can see a full list of <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">supported titles here</a>, along with any notes on the supported status of each one and there's quite a lot now.</p>
<p>I previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">did a guide</a> on how to use it, and while focused on the Steam Deck the same applies to using it on a Linux desktop:</p>

      <title>Pixel-art Sims styled game Tiny Life hits Early Access on May 3rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ellpeck Games have announced their pixel-art game inspired by The Sims, Tiny Life will be releasing with Linux support on May 3rd. From what I've played of some of the earlier builds, it showed a huge amount of promise.</p>
<p>"Tiny Life is a fun simulation game that aims to capture the essence of games like The Sims series, but in an isometric pixelart style. In the game, you control a set of people that live together in a household. You take care of their daily needs, build their skills, forge new relationships... or just mess up their entire life in whatever way you can think of!"</p>
<p>Their current trailer is a little old but gives you a good idea on what to expect:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iw-D7queVUI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/897b57f5d30bca7e02888d7f82dfd714.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iw-D7queVUI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At the Early Access date the developer said it will contain this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything that is currently in the Tiny Life Demo.</li>
<li>Three free, always-installed Sets of content: The Familiar Attire Set, the Woodworking Set and the Fitness Set, two of which come with lots of additional stuff to do!</li>
<li>The large Maple Plains City map which was featured in the Tiny Life Beta.</li>
<li>The ability for adult Tinies to get pregnant, and give birth to babies.</li>
<li>The baby life stage, which features unique interactions, personalities, and skills.</li>
<li>The ability to export, share and import lots, households and custom maps, both manually and on the Steam Workshop.</li>
<li>The ability to create and share custom mods for Tiny Life using the official C# Modding API, both manually and on the Steam Workshop.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1651490/view/5306971121514693921" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned they've seen around 15,000 people wishlist it, so clearly there's been a good amount of interest in this one.</p>

On top of that there's the chance to also win a 512GB Steam Deck plus over $100 of accessories from JSAUX.</p>

      <title>HDR and Colour Management patches for Steam Deck + AMD GPUs under review</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Melissa Wen recently sent in <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/amd-gfx/2023-April/092215.html" target="_blank">patches</a> to improve HDR and Colour Management on Linux for Steam Deck and potentially other AMD GPUs. The work is being done by Melissa Wen, Joshua Ashton and collaboration with Harry Wentland.</p>
<p>Exciting stuff, as eventually with this we should see some HDR fun on Linux with the likes of Gamescope. In the RFC (Request For Comments) patches, it was also specifically mentioned that SteamOS 3.5 is aiming to have "gamut mapping, HDR, SDR on HDR, HDR on SDR, and much more".</p>
<p>Excerpts from the RFC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joshua Ashton and I (with the great collaboration of Harry Wentland - thanks) have been working on KMS color pipeline enhancement for Steam Deck/SteamOS by exposing the large set of color caps available in AMD display HW.<br/>
[…]<br/>
So far, we keep these properties' usage under an AMD display config option (STEAM_DECK). However, we are fine with having them fully available to other DCN HW generations. In the current proposal, we are already checking ASICs before exposing a color feature. We can work on 3D LUT resource acquisition details to fit them to DCN 3+ families that support them. Indeed, before moving to these config boundaries, we started working on an open solution for any AMD HW.</p>
<p>The userspace case here is Gamescope which is the compositor for SteamOS. It's already using all of this functionality (although with a VALVE1_ prefix instead of AMD) to implement its color management pipeline right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like developers on KDE are interested in the work too, with Wen noting that Xaver Hugl from KDE was interested in experimenting with it for their HDR / colour bring-up too.</p>

      <title>Roblox intentionally blocking Linux with Wine in their new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the days of using workarounds to play Roblox on Linux may be coming to an abrupt end, with the upcoming launch of their new client blocking Linux intentionally.</p>
<p>This new client appears to be undergoing testing, and users quickly <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528" target="_blank">noticed</a> it wasn't working under the Wine compatibility layer on Linux. It seems the issue comes from Byfron, software for anti-cheat and anti-tamper that joined up officially with Roblox back in October 2022.</p>
<p>In reply to the forum post, a staff member for Roblox <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/2" target="_blank">mentioned</a> it is intentionally blocking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Jrelvas, Unfortunately this block was intentional. With the Windows 64-bit client launch we made the conscious decision to block the use of Wine. We came to this decision due to a combination of security and compatibility concerns. As a Linux user I am sure you understand the challenges of the Windows ecosystem. Wine is not officially supported but we are committed to working towards compatibility where possible. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a specific timeline for this support. However, I assure you that it remains a priority for our team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems it may not be forever, going by what they said above and below as this new 64bit client is undergoing intense testing right now as they gather feedback, bug reports and crash logs. In a follow-up post, another staff member <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/28" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your well thought out post. First and most importantly, we are not trying to punish the use of Wine.<br/>
Our Windows 64-bit client is in some regards quite different from the 32-bit client. We are currently gathering telemetry to analyze and hopefully fix existing issues and prevent future ones from popping up. For this process to work, it is of utmost importance to collect data from the [intended] target operating system. You will also find that we blocked the usage of VMs for the very same reason.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies some of the thought process behind the blocking of Wine. As MrEaker mentioned before, Wine remains a priority for our team, and we are certainly not deaf to the voices of our community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they seem to have <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/34" target="_blank">no plans</a> to block Wine use at all with Roblox Studio.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why they can't simply filter out the unwanted Wine results, since they obviously detect it just fine. Another few posts from the Roblox staff attempted to clear it up, as they <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/38" target="_blank">mentioned</a> their client will crash "compromised processes intentionally" and since they're going through so many thousands of crash logs, it would be quite a nuisance to add more to it. Sounds like it's complicated in many parts.</p>
<p>If / when they issue an update that does allow Wine players on Linux back in, I'll let you know.</p>

<p>The redesign of the <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> app store for Linux is now live, bringing with it a refreshed look along with showing verified developers and their apps. A much needed change that really does look a whole lot better.</p>
<p>With the new launch everything just looks a lot cleaner, and having a proper verification system in place means you will know if you're downloading something maintained by the creators and not a third-party. There's even a category just for <a href="https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/collection/verified/1" target="_blank">verified apps</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20489047961682155341gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20489047961682155341gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above is an example of the Games category which features not just games but launchers, emulators and more, everything related to gaming. You can see the blue ticks to clearly show verified apps.</p>
<p>While the front-page isn't massively different, the biggest visual change is to individual app pages. There's quite a bit more detail included on them like install size, download size, how many people have installed it, direct links to the website and documentation for help, a graph of installs over time, a collapsible changelog of the most recent update and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17764174091682155923gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17764174091682155923gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>On <a href="https://mastodon.social/@barthalion@treehouse.systems/110241570500375384" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, the Flathub maintainer Bartłomiej Piotrowski mentioned "A redesign of #Flathub is live! Drop by <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">https://flathub.org</a> to see all the shiny new things, such as developer verification and download graphs. There's more under the hood, including the long awaited subsets to enable only verified or FLOSS apps. Stay tuned for more updates!".</p>
<p>Flathub has quickly become my go-to place first to find downloads for any apps on Linux now. Especially with it being the main way to install extra apps on the Steam Deck too (through Discover), it's nice to have things the same across different systems.</p>

      <title>Valve improving Mesa graphics drivers on Linux for a &#34;secret&#34; game (update: Jedi Survivor)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/plagman2/status/1649562547908120576" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it’s for the upcoming Star Wars Jedi Survivor.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here's something interesting for you. Valve developers seem to be improving the Mesa graphics drivers right now towards a secret game. First noticed by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, developer Samuel Pitoiset has been working on improvements in Mesa for the RADV driver (AMD Vulkan). This is the driver used by most for gaming on AMD + desktop Linux and also the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22556" target="_blank">merge request</a> from April 18th, one of the commits noted there was an improvement to "a depth-only pass by +35% in one upcoming game". <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22579" target="_blank">Another one</a> from April 19th notes it gives another performance improvement of around 10% in "that game" (continuing to be rather cryptic). Then from April 20th there's <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22589" target="_blank">another</a> and when you read into the comments, Pitoiset <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22589#note_1879550" target="_blank">notes</a> it's "again this upcoming (secret) game" that was pointed out by SadlyItsBradley on <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1649512643273674753" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought perhaps it was just going to be preparations for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and they just didn't want to name the game of a partner they were testing for because it's coming soon. However, the continued secrecy around it and even saying directly it's a "secret" definitely now has my curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>Do we think this is a new Valve game? It would make sense that Valve have their people working on performance improvements, and not naming it because then the internet would go wild. Perhaps Left 4 Dead 3 that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/left-4-dead-3-appears-in-counter-strike-2-files/" target="_blank">was spotted</a> being named in Counter Strike 2 files? Perhaps finally Half-Life 3 (yeah likely not but I can dream).</p>
<p>Pure speculation of course and it may not be a Valve game at all. It really could actually just be a game they're testing for a third-party, as we know Valve do get to do driver fixes and Proton fixes at times before a game releases on Steam so it's ready for Steam Deck. Either way, it seems we'll <em>eventually</em> find out on this one…</p>

      <title>Dota 2: The New Frontiers Update is out and it&#39;s huge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dota 2: The New Frontiers Update might be one of the biggest updates to Valve's free to play MOBA ever and it's here now.</p>
<p>Starting with a new map that has been massively expanded with 40% more terrain. The interesting thing here is that the lanes aren't further away and everything is still focused on going through the centre but the expanded space opens the game up some more for new strategies.</p>
<p>Roshan has new homes, there's teleport towers to get from one corner of the map to another, there's Lotus Pools on the left and right sides of the map that spawn fruit to give Mana and HP which you can stockpile into a larger fruit too. On top of that there's powerful new neutral creeps to fight, special towers to capture to give extra vision, a new way to get out the back of your base when the enemy is attacking front and loads more. See the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eH6UJ4xDn4Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99bc9518e15f711fcce78f831864e788.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eH6UJ4xDn4Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another big change is to heroes with a new attribute type with Universal Heroes, Valve say it's a "new main stat group composed of existing heroes that now gain 0.6 damage from each stat, of any attribute". Neutral creeps will get stronger over time now too, killing other players should have more of an impact now too, abilities that disable you have been nerfed so there's less sitting around, there's major changes to how matchmaking works and the list of changes just seems nearly endless.</p>
<p>I think it may be time for me to get back into Dota 2…at least I would, if it wasn't completely <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/2294" target="_blank">broken</a> for me right now. Seems the new release has come with some issues, mine won't even launch on Fedora 38. <u><strong>Update</strong></u>: turns out my issue was a known bug with Vulkan loaders you can <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/2285#issuecomment-1518051805" target="_blank">work around</a>.</p>
<p>See all on the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newfrontiers?v=2" target="_blank">big update page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hitting retail stores in Japan from April 29th, South Korea to follow</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Komodo announced today that they're expanding the retail presence of the Steam Deck into Japan now, with South Korea to follow after.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-hitting-retail-in-hong-kong-taiwan-and-later-japan-and-south-korea/" target="_blank">Back in March</a>, they put the Steam Deck in the first retails stores in Hong Kong and Taiwan. That will expand starting April 29th, with the first store in Japan receiving the Steam Deck and the official Docking Station at EDION Namba Main Store (Namba, Chuo-ku, Osaka).</p>
<p>Komodo mentioned additionally there will be an in-store trial event which will run from April 29th until May 7th. More retail partners in Japan will be announced "Soon" and they stated South Korea is next up in the list.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are excited about opportunities that provide Steam Decks to more people,” said Ricky Uy, CEO of KOMODO, “and we hope anyone interested in trying Steam Deck in Osaka has the opportunity to visit the EDION Namba Main Store during the trial week.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>All good news, and with the Steam Deck reportedly on track to hit well <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/report-steam-deck-to-pass-3-million-sales-during-2023/" target="_blank">over 3 million sales total</a> this year, an expanded retail presence is only going to keep pushing that number higher. The Steam Deck from Valve is just going from strength to strength, especially with big Proton upgrades further improving compatibility like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">recently launched Proton 8</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-upgraded-with-proton-8/" target="_blank">Proton Experimental update</a> following it.</p>

      <title>System76 launch multiple new powerful Linux laptops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not one, not two but three product announcements from System76 today as they're launching a range of new Linux powered laptops. First is the Serval WS that will be getting a refresh but they're also bringing back the Adder WS and the Bonobo WS.</p>
<p>System76 said all of them can be configured with up to 64GB RAM, have at least a 144Hz display and up to 8TB of storage. In the case of the Serval WS it has a 165Hz screen, and the Bonobo WS can have up to 12TB of storage. So there's something that will hopefully fit every need.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8088464511682014864gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adder WS — Starting at $1599!</strong>
<ul>
<li>For the first time, System76 offers a laptop with NVIDIA 40 Series graphics — up to the GeForce RTX 4070. The new Adder WS is also equipped with an i9 13900HX CPU (24 cores, 32 threads) and DDR5 RAM. The NVIDIA RTX 4070 has more VRAM and a 54% higher clock speed than the previous generation. With its formidable speed, the Adder WS is perfect for budding professionals setting out on the next phase of their career.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Serval WS — Starting at $1799, shipping mid-May</strong>
<ul>
<li>In addition to an i9 13900HX CPU, DDR5, and NVIDIA 40 Series graphics, the 17” Serval WS brings a 4K display option back to the System76 line. A 15” option is also available with a 1080p matte display at 165 Hz. Serval WS provides high-speeds ports like USB 3.2 gen 2, Thunderbolt 4, and 2.5GbE ethernet, and can power up to 5 displays (4 external). If you’re going to be downloading and uploading lots of data, this laptop is for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coming Soon: Bonobo WS — Starting at $3299!</strong>
<ul>
<li>With an i9 13900HX CPU, DDR5, and up to an NVIDIA RTX 4090, the Bonobo WS once again returns as System76’s most powerful laptop. Amazingly, it’s also one pound lighter and 43% thinner than the previous Bonobo WS. Like the 17” Serval WS, the Bonobo WS features a 17” 4K display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they have a few laptop models back now, they've also launched a <a href="https://system76.com/laptops-powerful" target="_blank">comparison page</a> (which actually died as soon as it went live due to the demand). Clearly System76 are doing well, and they recently teased work on their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/system76-ceo-teases-in-house-linux-laptop-code-named-virgo/" target="_blank">upcoming custom laptop</a>.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 23.04 is out now with GNOME 44 and a stable Steam Snap </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical has today released Ubuntu 23.04, their latest short-term new-feature release (it's not an LTS) that will be supported until January 2024.</p>
<p>One of the big user-facing additions is the new installer that they say offers a "streamlined and more intuitive user experience". While it offers up a refreshed look the code behind the scenes is the biggest change - since it now shares the code-base with Ubuntu Server so they can give a more consistent experience.</p>
<p>This release also has GNOME 44, so you get all the latest enhancements there but Canonical also updated Ubuntu font, and they mentioned some big Snap update behaviour changes too. Instead of notifying you an update for a Snap was available and then making you go somewhere to update it, you will now get a background download and then it will be applied when the app is closed. You can also now pause Snap updates for as long as you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17882932881682006886gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17882932881682006886gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's plenty more like their Snap of Steam being promoted to stable. Canonical said over 150,000 people downloaded the preview version, so there was plenty of interest in it. This Snap bundles a bunch of dependencies needed allowing you to run new and old titles without messing with PPAs.</p>
<p>On top of that Ubuntu Cinnamon and a resurrected Edubuntu join as official flavours.</p>
<p>Canonical also did a video about their new installer:</p>

      <title>Stellaris 3.8 will add two co-op modes now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can safely say co-op is not something I ever expected for a strategy game like Stellaris but it's coming. You can even test it now. Version 3.8 is now in Open Beta on Steam, you just opt into the 3.8 version in the Properties -&gt; Beta window.</p>
<p>The two modes it will add in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cooperative PvE can be initiated from the main menu - all players that hotjoin the hosted game will join the primary player’s empire. This mode is primarily intended for teaching new players or for lower intensity cooperative gameplay.</li>
<li>Cooperative PvP can be allowed by the host of a standard multiplayer game. When enabled, empires can open themselves up to allow other players to help control their empire. We expect this game mode to be useful for competitive team play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These actually sound really great. I can think of numerous games I've had where a helping hand would have made things a lot easier, especially in the late game where you're controlling so much and there's constantly things happening. Great stuff from Paradox.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="79WxfMJSzWM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c77d58a750d4d5793abd5bb8745a68ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/79WxfMJSzWM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the other improvements coming in Stellaris 3.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added unique textures for Mercury, Venus, Neptune and Uranus for the Sol system.</li>
<li>Added unique textures for Earth and Mars when terraformed based off of available heightmap data.</li>
<li>Added new anomaly The Orb</li>
<li>Added a special solar system protected by the Lone Defender.</li>
<li>Added a decision to clear the wreckage on a Broken Shackles starting planet in the event that they are conquered before they enact the Memorial to the Unshackled decision.</li>
<li>Improved accuracy of tooltips on the galaxy setting screen and implemented experimental nested tooltip functionality.</li>
<li>The mind-wiped species from On the Shoulders of Giants will now have the Forcefully Devolved trait.</li>
<li>The Observation Insight Situation now remembers what approach you had when it last finished.</li>
<li>There is now a 1% chance that a pre-ftl civilization will spawn with the Forcefully Devolved trait.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus all the usual bug and balance fixes that Stellaris updates bring.</p>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets Minecraft Legends working on Steam Deck &amp; Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Legends just recently released on Steam and sadly at release it just wouldn't run, a quick bug report later and Valve has already <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1648890302621683712" target="_blank">solved</a> it with Proton Hotfix.</p>
<p>Initially trying through any Proton version tested it just wouldn't load, and it was the exact same problem on Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux desktop. It would just bring you right back to your Steam Library. I opened a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6696" target="_blank">bug report</a> and now thankfully it's solved. So now as long as it's set to Proton Hotfix, you're good to go. Valve have set Proton Hotfix on it, so as long as you're not forcing a different version, it will pick it up automatically.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S58JyK-lXck"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3169862688b668401478236e3bcd429b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S58JyK-lXck" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once again, Valve and their developers working on Proton have reacted very quickly to a brand new release, which is really good to see. I have found that sometimes it will just randomly crash though. Not overly often but it does happen.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, you'll want to drop it from High to Medium in the graphics settings, which seems to give overall a rather stable 60FPS and it's very smooth apart from minor loading hiccups. On High settings on Steam Deck, it will dip down to 40FPS and sometimes below, so still doable but honestly it's perfectly fine on Medium and looks great.</p>
<p>Another issue I noted, specifically on desktop Linux with the Stable Steam Client, is that the Microsoft Account login was just a blank window in the Steam browser that pops up. However, if you simply resize the window, it then renders correctly. There's an existing <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9014" target="_blank">bug report</a> for this for the main client. The login there worked fine.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, the login may seemingly not work getting stuck after entering a password, but reloading the game showed me logged in just fine. You can also try the login on Desktop Mode on Steam Deck but for me in Gaming Mode simply restarting after waiting a minute after entering password worked.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10023681001681994731gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10023681001681994731gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Ultra settings on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>So a few quirks but overall once you in, it performs great and looks great with Proton Hotfix.</p>

      <title>If You Like… Slay the Spire</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When Slay the Spire launched, back in January 2019, it represented the pinnacle in what became a well recognised genre - Deck Builders. Let’s delve into that genre and see lies beneath the surface.</p>
<p><em>IYL (If You Like) will be a short series of articles delving into various genres and looking at the best examples in each. I’ll follow a standard layout. I’ll start with a bit of history about the most famous game representing the genre. Next, I’ll cover a game that’s very similar to the original, then (hopefully!) any games that have surpassed it since, and finally any games that do things in a unique way, but still tipping their hat to the original. Then it’s over to you to tell me how wrong I am, in the comments!</em></p>
<p>Note: I did a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/deck-builders-round-up/" target="_blank"><u>very similar article last year</u></a>, so there will be serious overlap! Future IYL articles will of course cover different genres!</p>
<p>Before we start, let me be clear that while Megacrits’ game “represented the pinnacle” on its launch, it didn’t define the genre exactly. There were many predecessors that led to its creation and it would do several fine games a disservice to suggest that StS was first.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/208485801681923722gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/208485801681923722gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you fancy a dip into what must surely be the inspiration for StS, you could look at Deep Sky Derelicts, The Guild of Dungeoneering, Ironclad Tactics or even the excellent Hand of Fate games. But it was Megacrits’ game that rolled all the elements into a compelling package. It sold 1.5M copies at a recent count, half a million in early access alone.</p>
<p>I’m not going to pick bones about “Deck Builders” vs “Engine Builders” vs “Card Battlers” here. Let’s just dive in.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>A direct clone - Neoverse [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/994220/NEOVERSE/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h4>
<p>What happens when you take Slay the Spire’s three wonderfully constructed character choices and replace them with scantily clad female alternatives? Well, if the developer is Tinogames, you get an original take on StS with well thought out unique decks and mechanics, but with gorgeous, fully animated graphics thrown in. Playing Neoverse is very similar to playing StS, but sometimes feels more like a Final Fantasy game due to the gorgeous wind-ups and cinematic take downs.</p>
<p>Whether you play as Naya with her radioactivity, Clare with her shield and blocks, or Helena with her summons, each fight feels fair and crucially, just like StS, some enemies are easy as one character, but brutally difficult as another.</p>
<p>It might be unfair to call this a StS clone, since Neoverse launched only around three months later, so presumably started development pretty much alongside its famous rival, but I can’t find any developer retros and later is later, so here we are.</p>
<p>Should you buy it? Mostly yes - it has a lot of nuance that grows on you over time, like the parry, combo and precision systems that reward careful gameplay. Just be aware that it’ll look like you’re playing a dodgy porn game while you’re taking down those demons.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Games that do it better - Roguebook (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076200/Roguebook/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/roguebook" target="_blank"><strong><u>GOG</u></strong></a><strong>) and Breach Wanderers (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1394130/Breach_Wanderers/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>)</strong></h4>
<p>Oh boy, this’ll get me into trouble, I’m sure. But what it boils down to, for me, is that I’d rather play either of these games, than even one more run of StS.</p>
<p>Roguebook is set in the world of Faeria (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397060/Faeria/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general_archive/faeria_an_amazing_strategy_trading_card_game_scg" target="_blank"><u>GOG</u></a>), by Abrakam Entertainment, a game I couldn’t get into. But other than tapping into the Faeria lore, the two games are very different. Roguebook takes the StS formula, then gives you two characters to play with. Block is shared, only the first character takes damage (usually), and cards have a simple mechanic to swap your characters around - if you block, or play a <em>charge</em> card, you go to the front. And it works amazingly well, opening up a huge series of tactics around positioning, blocking and healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4846536321681925186gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4846536321681925186gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15536601561681925188gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15536601561681925188gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17879619341681925189gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17879619341681925189gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>But that’s not all - each of the four characters have their own decks and own unique capability which means that the synergies between these decks can be amongst the most game-breakingly satisfying that I’ve ever come across. Like in StS when you get your Ironclad to 999 block and draw a <em>Body Slam</em>. Seriously. Endorphin city.</p>
<p>The overworld map is beautiful, the sound design is endearing, enemies are diverse and (for the most part) fun to battle, and the attention to detail is just wonderful. It’s a masterpiece.</p>
<p>As for Breach Wanderers, the recommendation is just as heartfelt, but… murkier. Launching at Steam Next Fest back in Q3 2020, and still in Early Access today, the developers are two friends in Montreal with a vision. That vision is that their unique take on the Deck Builder puts the emphasis on the building. In Breach Wanderers, you can choose (with a few well considered restrictions) what your opening deck will consist of AND what will be in the pool of available cards throughout your run.</p>
<p>Having grown up on first edition Magic the Gathering, the ability to customise your opening deck is simply wonderful. After 110 hours of Slay the Spire’s opening four or five fights being absolutely identical in nearly every way, here was a game that gave me a choice of four opening fights with a custom deck tailored to <em>exactly</em> how I wanted to play the game. Throw in around 8 characters, interesting new game mechanics and a very grindy (in a good way) meta game and it’s plain that this one has some serious longevity beyond simply throwing Ascensions at you until you fall over.</p>
<p>It’s early days for me with the game, but so far the combination of the familiarity of StS, but with the freshness of actual deck building is an absolute winner. Highly recommended.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Something a little different: Hadean Tactics (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260590/Hadean_Tactics/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>) or Monster Train (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/monster_train" target="_blank"><strong><u>GOG</u></strong></a><strong>)</strong></h4>
<p>Remember Dota Underlords (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046930/Dota_Underlords/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a>)? God I loved that game. Until I didn’t anymore, but that was after 150 hours, so not bad for a freebie! Anyway, so did the developers of Hadean Tactics, a husband and wife team from Brazil. So much so, that the base game involves choosing your core hero, recruiting two to four followers, then throwing them into a grid-based auto-battler which could be easily mistaken for Valve’s PvP timesink.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3155545701681929992gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3155545701681929992gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2738531461681929991gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2738531461681929991gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>The differences wrack up pretty quickly though. To start with, this is PvE. Also, every 7 seconds, the game pauses and you have the familiar three mana to spend playing a choice of five cards. These can be straight up damage dealers, but the most interesting cards reposition the board, or can buff or debuff a few seconds of the fight. There’s a StS-style progress map, and of course, relics and upgrades for each of your units along the way.</p>
<p>It’s slick, it’s different and it’s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Next up, Monster Train - often cited as one of the best deck builders out there, I was excited to finally give it a try a few months ago. And yep, it’s excellent. The basic format is almost like a tower defence, as enemies enter your four-level train at the bottom and work their way upwards toward the train’s core on the top level. That gives you three levels to place your “heroes” and buff them with your deck options.</p>
<p>The graphics are absolutely stunning, the overworld map is simple but fun and the fights are usually very fair. Variety is bolstered by having around 5 or 6 factions that you can play, each with their own deck, and each run is a combination of two of these factions to further mix up possible synergies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19748689721681932986gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19748689721681932986gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/757381731681932984gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/757381731681932984gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>But while it is a truly excellent game, I have a similar problem with Monster Train as I do with Slay the Spire - after a certain point, the only replayability is in Ascensions, which simply rank up, introducing harder bosses and more punishing runs. That’s fine to a point, but it feels a little bit lazy, especially compared to Roguebook’s excellent mix-and-match challenge system which affects not just difficulty, but even how the core game is played.</p>
<p>I have no regrets though, as my nearly 60 hours in the game will attest.</p>
<h4><strong>And the rest</strong></h4>
<p>And wow, this is a big list. I’m too lazy to link all of these to their various stores, but if you’re serious about your deck builders, you don’t want to miss out on…</p>
<p><strong>Griftlands</strong> - two decks, one for fighting, one for diplomacy, all wrapped up in a story-driven series of missions. It’s out of Early Access now, and highly rated on Steam, but something didn’t quite click for me on this, particularly odd since it’s made by the awesome Klei team.</p>
<p><strong>Nowhere Prophet</strong> - guide your fledging army across the wasteland to find them a new home. Hints of base building in this one, with a Darkest Dungeon vibe at times.</p>
<p><strong>Across the Obelisk</strong> - Four heroes, four times the fun, with a story-driven overworld map. Some complicated mechanics on show here, but it’s highly-rated on Steam. I only played a handful of hours during Early Access and it’s one I’ll be going back to, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Trials of Fire</strong> - One of my favourites due to the lovely table-top feel the fights have. A really interesting open-world over-world map and a loose set of mission objectives to drive you forward. More tactical than the others, since the fights factor in position, range and line of sight.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Sky Derelicts</strong> - one the daddies I mentioned earlier, this is a sloooow starter, but worth sticking with as you build your team to take on the sci-fi themed enemies. Your deck is defined by a combination of your equipment and your character, giving some nice customisation.</p>
<p><strong>Card Hunter</strong> - a freebie, and like Trials of Fire, this introduces tactical positioning and elements like area of effect. Gets a bit naggy about buying a subscription eventually, but there’s tens of hours of enjoyment to be had first and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons vibe is hard to resist.</p>
<p><strong>Inscryption</strong> - part deck builder, part escape room, this dark, creepy adventure will keep you guessing throughout its three story-driven acts. I can genuinely say that it’s the first game in which pulling out your own tooth with a pair of pliers is a good thing!</p>
<p><strong>Tainted Grail</strong> - some unique takes on familiar mechanics and a 3D third-person overworld based around the idea of a torch slowly burning down gives this one great tension. I need to play more, as there are heaps of characters to unlock.</p>
<p><strong>Hellcard</strong> - only a couple of months old this one, but already showing promise as you put three adventures up against the army of darkness. It’s co-operative, apparently, but I don’t know how effectively that works. In single player, each character takes a slice of “pie” on the battlefield as the enemies surge towards you, each character playing their own decks, with their own special capability. One to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Room for one more? Check out Liam's recent article on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/takara-cards-is-a-unique-space-sci-fi-deckbuilding-tactical-strategy-game/" target="_blank">Takara Cards</a>, a new Early Access, space-themed deck builder.</p>
<p>And that’s it for deck builders. Did I miss any? Is Slay the Spire still the king for you? I haven’t mentioned its various excellent mods, such as Downfall, so perhaps you’re all still enjoying the champion of deck builders through its total conversions, or fan-made characters &amp; decks! Let me know in the comments!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>POSTAL 2 from Running With Scissors just had a big upgrade for the 20th anniversary and there's lots of improvements to this classic violent first-person adventure.</p>
<p>Quite possibly one of the most ridiculous games ever made, there's so many terrible things you can do in it which is great if you love a bit of dark humour. Not me of course, you would never find me laughing at the ability to give yourself the middle finger in a mirror.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17069294231681918390gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17069294231681918390gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>Takara Cards is a unique space sci-fi deckbuilding tactical strategy game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fusing together the best elements of deckbuilders and tactical turn-based battles, Takara Cards is a little unusual to get into but full of charm to keep you wanting more. It feels like an evolved idea from their previous game, NEXT JUMP: Shmup Tactics, which was also a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It's showing a huge amount of promise for the rather quirky story to it, one that sees you chasing Dragons through space as you build up your deck of abilities, progress through various turn-based battles and encounter various strange events. The combat is certainly interesting, with your deck being both your pilot and your ship and the battles are you travelling through space with your aim to destroy as much as possible and survive to continue on.</p>

<p>Currently in Early Access and available now on Steam, it comes with full Native Linux support and the developer mentioned they're ensuring it works nicely on Steam Deck as well. It's made with Godot Engine and other open source tooling as well.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play cards in a <strong>DEEP tactical turn-based Combat.</strong></li>
<li>Over <strong>70 cards</strong> and 34 unique units (so far).</li>
<li><strong>Create your character</strong> by choosing Cards and Reputation, among other things!</li>
<li>Your Deck is your Pilot and your Ship: <strong>Build it by venturing </strong>through the Cosmos and Events.</li>
<li><strong>Exoteric Karma System</strong> that influences your Character and Ship.</li>
<li><strong>Synergize between</strong> dozens of UNIQUE cards to <em>clear</em> the board of enemies <strong>in one Turn.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Go and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932210/Takara_Cards/" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.1 to get FSR 2.2, better 3D support for OpenGL, shader improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like the next update for Godot Engine is going to be a nice one for game developers, with multiple graphics enhancements on the way. Detailed in a new <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/rendering-priorities-4-1/" target="_blank">blog post</a> they revealed some of the focus for Godot 4.1, now that the dust has began to settle on the huge Godot 4.0 release that provided Vulkan support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1266249911681911728gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1266249911681911728gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Godot 4 with the <a href="https://github.com/perfoon/Abandoned-Spaceship-Godot-Demo" target="_blank">Abandoned Spaceship demo</a>.</em></p>
<p>With the 4.1 release planned for this year, now they're moving to more regular releases, some of what they have planned to add includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify bottlenecks in 3D rendering to improve performance.</li>
<li>Time slicing DirectionalLight3D shadows to reduce GPU pressure for shadows.</li>
<li>Background pipeline compilation to improve shader loading times.</li>
<li>Finishing the 3D renderer for their OpenGL compatibility that targets lower-end and mobile devices.</li>
<li>FSR 2.2 for their Temporal AntiAliasing solution, along with integrating a bunch of effects with it like SSAO, SSR, shadows and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Godot Engine is a free and open source game engine for developers, you can see more on the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed added a slick story campaign</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed is a shooter all about toys, a bit like the classic movie Small Soldiers and back in late March, it had a huge free upgrade. Honestly, this would have been my dream game to play through growing up. With movies like Small Soldiers and Toy Story, I probably would have had a tiny heart attack of excitement seeing this.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support, it's Steam Deck Verified and I checked it out a bit today in the new mode with all the improvements and it feels great! Looks fantastic too, they really have the toy style down nicely. With the new update that landed on March 27th, they really put the work in on this one with it filled full of cartoon-strip 90s inspired cutscenes, lots of voice over and overhauls to multiple parts of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7720567981681909910gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7720567981681909910gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>All the major changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the new Story mode to the base game. Cinematics and missions!</li>
<li>Added Primary and Optional missions to all levels. Some missions are completable in Free Roam for extra time.</li>
<li>Added new Boss enemy. The big man himself: Major Evil.</li>
<li>Added new Max Damage and Major Evil unlockable characters with multiple skins for characters and weapons!</li>
<li>Added new level (Rental Lair), the final stand against major evil in this upscale fancy apartment.</li>
<li>Added Story Cinematics menu to Extras so you can rewatch the cutscenes.</li>
<li>Added Max Ammo minigame playable Arcade Machine to the new Apartment map.</li>
<li>Added Max Ammo minigame button to the Extras after completing all objectives on the new map.</li>
<li>Added new Map selection and Campaign lobby for offline Singleplayer/Splitscreen to a better view of enemies and objectives.</li>
<li>Added Objectives list to the ingame Pause menu so you can more easily check your objective progress.</li>
<li>Added new random poses to characters in the Lobby menus.</li>
<li>Added new music tracks. Some music in earlier levels has been moved around for a more fitting gameplay experience.</li>
<li>Added level specific Bots that match the cutscene characters!</li>
<li>Added Options &gt; Controler slider for adjusting the Aim Damping effect.</li>
<li>Added a system to detect a corrupt save file and to restore a valid one from a backup.</li>
<li>Added objectives to end of round screen.</li>
<li>Added spectator-death mode to track enemy that killed you.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A shooter that blends in tower defence, with you facing off against many different types of enemy toys, what's not to love about it? You can play it solo or in co-op with up to 4 people with local and online multiplayer supported.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hypercharge-unboxed?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/523660/HYPERCHARGE_Unboxed/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Europa Universalis IV: Domination and free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Domination is the latest expansion for the popular strategy game from Paradox Interactive and there's also a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"Centered on the most popular and powerful nations in Europa Universalis IV, Domination revisits and revises once familiar pathways while adding more historical context and challenges to great nations like China, England, France and more. In some cases, branching missions will force you to make a choice that will irrevocably change the course of your nation, focusing your priorities in a particular direction."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x9tkAlvUXQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d28c136338e57dfba4b82bd2f739b2f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x9tkAlvUXQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Domination includes new national mission trees and features for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Ottoman Empire: A revised conquest tree with new rewards for pushing Ottoman dominance, including expansion through the new Eyalet system, and new internal changes, such as the new Janissary estate, the new Ottoman Decadence mechanic, and the ‘Ottoman Power Struggle’ disaster.</li>
<li>China: Different mission trees for the Han Ming and invader empires like the Qing. Choose between expansion and Inward Perfection, and counter the power of the Eunuchs to build a more stable empire.</li>
<li>Japan: Unite Japan as you deal with the power of the Shogun and the independent Daimyos. Choose to open the country to foreign influence or keep it isolated, while deciding upon different paths of expansion and reform.</li>
<li>Russia: Free your country of the Tatar yoke, and transform it into a Great Empire. Choose the path of Peter’s reforms to modernize the state, so your mission tree as well as your mechanics will change and evolve as the game progresses. Use the power of Cossacks and Streltsy to expand your Empire to East and West.</li>
<li>Spain: Expanded mission trees for Castile and Aragon, with different paths to form Spain, a new mechanic available for the new ‘System of Councils’ government, and decisions about the Army and Navy to get the mighty Tercios and Spanish Armada.</li>
<li>France: Fight the end of the Hundred Years War, centralize France into an absolute monarchy while dealing with the Wars of Religion, expand into Italy and the Holy Roman Empire, and lead the Revolution through an expanded mission tree.</li>
<li>Great Britain: Separate paths for either a British Empire or an Angevin Britain, as well as a deeper internal gameplay, with unique features for the English Parliament and changes to the English Civil War disaster.</li>
<li>Minor nations: Mission changes, new government mechanics and expanded flavor for Prussia, Portugal and Korea.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's also the v1.35 "Ottomans" update, which along with a ton of fixes it brings in these extras:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 3 new sets of Ideas (Infrastructure, Court, and Mercenary), and further rebalanced all the Idea Groups.</li>

<li>Added 7 new Estate Privileges, to estates that did not have a privilege that exempts them from seizing land.</li>
<li>Added more Ruler, General and Admiral personalities.</li>
<li>Added 7 new Parliament bribes and National Bribes, which are more expensive versions of bribes, but cover multiple parliament seats at a time, to Common Sense DLC.</li>
<li>Added 21 new Imperial Reforms, 21 new Decrees, and reworked special Age Abilities for Mandate of Heaven DLC.</li>
<li>Added 11 new Naval Doctrines to Rule Britannia DLC.</li>
<li>Added 11 New Iberian Holy Orders to Golden Century DLC.</li>
<li>Added the Latin Empire as a tag which can be formed through the Crusader mission tree to Emperor DLC.</li>
<li>Added 7 new Great Projects to Leviathan DLC.</li>

      <title>Fedora 38 is out now with GNOME 44, official Budgie desktop spin and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora has a big new release available in version 38 which came a bit early. As usual lots of new features and fixes, plus a fancy new Budgie desktop spin.</p>
<p>You can grab it as the main Fedora Workstation which includes an upgrade to GNOME 44 that's filled full of new features like the thumbnail view in the file picker, a new lock screen, enhanced quick settings with a "background apps" section, improvements to accessibility settings, better Flatpak support along with the new unfiltered view of applications on Flathub and so on. The Fedora team also made an adjustment to make shut downs faster.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14124217601681837433gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14124217601681837433gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Fedora Workstation 38</em></p>
<p>This release also brings with it new official spins (alternative desktop environments) like the Budgie Desktop, "Sericea" that comes with the Sway window manager in an rpm-ostree version and a Phosh image for mobile devices. This is in addition to the existing spins with KDE, Xfce and more.</p>

<p>Various other upgrades like the inclusion of the updated dnf5 package manager for testing that has performance improvements, a smaller memory footprint, and a new daemon that can provide an alternative to PackageKit.</p>

      <title>Survival game Vintage Story set for a huge update with a big story event</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story is a survival game that I simply love to watch and casually dive into now and then, and it's probably one of the most impressive indie open-world survival games around, if you like things hardcore.</p>
<p>Inspired by lovecraftian horror themes, it's often thoroughly uncompromising and it has a ridiculous amount of depth in some areas. The soon to release v1.18 update is going through the last release candidates right now and there's absolutely loads new including the first major story event, where you discover and go through a vast underground structure.</p>
<p>Another major change is the upgraded world generation with various new land forms, a geologic activity system, large scale mountain regions and more additions to world gen. Loads more added including a butterfly net and 160+ new types to collect, a glider to flow down from high altitudes, rafts, treasure maps, a writing system and bookshelves, an overhaul to doors, angled beams for construction, an improved tutorial system, ruined weapons, improved chiseling (one of my favourite features to craft!) and the list goes on and on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zD_Ui1dq-FU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e4a01f40891a38f9afc4de47d3e03cf9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zD_Ui1dq-FU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seriously impressive stuff from a tiny team, especially for a game not sold on Steam. All the changelog details can be seen in their <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/" target="_blank">News forum</a> for 1.18.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, they're also working to update from .NET Framework 4.6 to .NET7 concurrently, which will be in a future release. They're hoping to see "smoother performance, some future-proofing, and potentially broader stability on Linux and MacOS".</p>

      <title>Zoria: Age of Shattering now skipping Early Access to release in September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of the upcoming squad-based tactical RPG Zoria: Age of Shattering have changed their release plans, and they're now going to skip Early Access entirely with a small release day.</p>
<p>Originally they planned to release into EA in April, but now they're instead doing a full release on September 19th. Why? They said "We evaluated our latest milestone and realized that Zoria is so close to being completed that putting it on Early Access would only water down our progress. Launching Zoria in EA would mean launching an incomplete game for a few months when in reality, we only need a few months to finish the game.".</p>
<p>You can check out the previous trailer (now with the wrong date) if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xiaxUtG0KbI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3daae76b1a7a3e7969dbaa07abdebba8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xiaxUtG0KbI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Zoria is a squad-based tactical RPG with fluid turn-based combat, outpost, and follower management, set in an expansive fantasy world. In the game, you will lead a team of four heroes at a time with their unique skills and perks. Every team member will contribute to the battles you will undertake.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are the Commander </strong>- Lead your diverse team through the fantasy lands of a Uram continent and challenge countless groups of monsters and bosses.</li>
<li><strong>Explore the world of Zoria</strong> - Zoria has now fallen prey to the sheer brutality of the hellspawn that roams its land. Its lush forests, mysterious caves, and majestic buildings have transformed into haunting locations. Explore these mysterious lands to uncover the mysteries within.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Turn Based combat </strong>- Use the unique skills of all of your party members to fight your way through the land. Attack from close range or distance with different attack patterns and directions; heal or shield allies with various spells and commands and use your surroundings to your advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Craft, rest and survive</strong> - Keep a keen eye on your equipment and vitality as they both deteriorate over time. A bonfire in Zoria's provides a safe spot to restock your resources and prepare for the next battle.</li>
<li><strong>Class based accessibility </strong>- Take care of each of your warriors' skill development, and it will repay you on the battlefield. Having an individual with the right skills can get you into previously inaccessible places and quests. Specific characters interacting with various objects in the world of Zoria may lead you to discover hidden treasures or make your travel easier, so explore all the options!</li>
<li><strong>Base management </strong>- You have to be wise in and out of the battle. Players can regularly update the base by unlocking new wings to the buildings, which will reward you with resources, quests, or items.</li>
<li><strong>Follow missions</strong> - In your outpost, you can plan and assign tasks to your companions. Send selected party members on an autonomic mission, in which you won't participate but will receive what they find along the way. Never forget that their lives are in your hands!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available with Native Linux support on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/zoria_age_of_shattering?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1159090/Zoria_Age_of_Shattering/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Valheim is getting extensive difficulty options including a creative mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim continues to be one of the most popular survival games on Steam, and it seems in an upcoming update there's going to be much more extensive customization of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Teased in <a href="https://twitter.com/jsmars/status/1647968860711145481" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post by developer Jonathan Smårs, there's a quick video and a follow-up gif to show off some of the new options coming. After watching the quick video here's a breakdown of the modes shown off (all subject to change of course):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy</strong>: Combat is easier and there are less raids on your base.</li>
<li><strong>Hard</strong>: Combat is harder and monsters will raid your base more often.</li>
<li><strong>Hardcore</strong>: Combat is a lot harder and monsters will raid your base more often. When you die all items you are carrying and skills are lost forever. You have no map and you may not use portals.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive</strong>: In immersive you have no map and you may not use portals so you will need to use your wits to keep track of where you are in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Hammer Mode</strong>: In Hammer mode you can build all buildings for free. There are no raids on your base, and monsters will not attack you until you provoke them. Other difficulty settings are normal.</li>
<li><strong>Casual</strong>: In casual mode monsters will not attack you until provoked, there are no raids on your base, resources are plentiful, you will not drop equipped items or lose skills on death and combat is a lot easier and events are based on your individual progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just the <em>preset</em> levels though as there's sliders and tickboxes for various things underneath you can change like: the combat difficulty, death penalty, resources, raid rate, portal items, no build cost, player based events, no map, no portals and passive enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7656789351681820678gol1.jpg"/>Source - Jonathan Smårs on Twitter.</em></p>
<p>In replies Smårs clarified you will be able to change them whenever you want, and it will be set per-world for all players and can be changed on current worlds.</p>
<p>When to expect it? Smårs said it is planned to come with the "Hildirs Quest update coming soon".</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Picma - Picture Enigmas gets a free Steam release, lots of Picross styled puzzles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your Picross? Check out Picma - Picture Enigmas, a new Steam release with Native Linux support and it has a lot of content. It's also free to play, to a point. </p>
<p>I'm sure most of you know what Picross and related games are? You match up tiles in a board, based on the numbers at the sides and it eventually reveals a picture. They can be a great way to unwind and test your brain at the same time. </p>
<p>"Uncover hidden pictures using your logic skills. With a library of over 100,000 community-created puzzles, distributed across multiple puzzle types, you are unlikely to run out of challenges. So, have a seat at the Moonberry Café, let Charlotte bring you a cup of your favorite drink, and relax as you sip and solve through Picma - Picture Enigmas." — Moonberry Arcade.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-LdJx_2fLrc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fff4475df8331b269d12d81213f88d51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-LdJx_2fLrc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Much more than Nonograms</strong> - Find your favorite picture logic game from our selection of three puzzle types (more coming soon).</li>
<li><strong>Quality despite quantity</strong> - Our user content is curated by the community and only a fraction of the submitted images become puzzles.</li>
<li><strong>True logic puzzles</strong> - All of our puzzles are machine-verified to have a single logical solution.</li>
<li><strong>Massive puzzles</strong> - Our puzzles range from the tiny 5x5 all the way to the gigantic 50x50.</li>
<li><strong>True multi-color puzzles</strong> - What you solve is what you get, with up to 8 colors per puzzle.</li>
<li><strong>Play for free daily</strong> - Create and rate images to earn Coins and play at no cost.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The monetization might put some people off though. It does come with ~72 free puzzles split across three different modes, so there is quite a decent share of free content but the rest you need to pay for in some way. You can either buy coins, or buy a ticket for a length of time to access everything (like $5 for a full month), you can create puzzles to earn coins, or vote on other's designs to also earn coins. So there's multiple ways. </p>
<p>An interesting way to do monetization on a free game, although I can't see that being overly popular. I went to earn some free coins by rating what people had made, and it just instantly said there weren't any left. Still, the free stuff that's there was all pretty good. <u><strong>Update</strong></u>: the developer messaged to mention you still get a coin reward for going to rate images if there's none left (and they're right, I missed the coins it sent). They said they're going to make that clearer.</p>

      <title>MangoHud performance overlay gets a few needed fixes in v0.6.9-1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the previous release of v0.6.9, <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> has another nice update out that fixes up a few lingering problems for the Linux performance hud that's also used on Steam Deck for the built-in performance info.</p>
<p>Here's the changes in v0.6.9-1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that applied picmip without option being set.</li>
<li>Reverted x11 poller that was causing segfaults <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/commit/06edee407159f9c52cc060fa5ba135539d4c909a" target="_blank"><tt>06edee4</tt></a>.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with horizontal and legacy_layout.</li>
<li>Fixed amdgpu APU power and temperature reading.</li>
<li>Fixed certain hud elements displaying incorrectly in horizontal.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing segfault when using <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_CONFIG</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue with some elements not being in the right place with the horizontal layout was a little annoying, which I reported, so I'm really glad to see such a quick fix there so we can cram in more details. Here's a fresh example on the latest version on Fedora KDE with Everspace 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7407494031681817597gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7407494031681817597gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you're interested in this layout you can use this below, place it into your MangoHud configuration file. The main one can be found in: <code class="inline-code">~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>horizontal<br/>
legacy_layout=0<br/>
hud_no_margin<br/>

      <title>Iris and Sodium for Minecraft move to Modrinth away from CurseForge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you use the popular <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/iris" target="_blank">Iris</a> and <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium" target="_blank">Sodium</a> mods for Minecraft? Well there's been a bit of an issue lately, so the developers have dropped support for CurseForge and fully moved over to Modrinth.</p>
<p>What are the mods? Sodium is a free and open-source rendering optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves frame rates and stuttering while fixing many graphical issues. While Iris is an open source shaders mod. Both rather well-known for Minecraft fans.</p>
<p>What's going on? Well, according to the official <a href="https://twitter.com/IrisShaders/status/1647359296584417280" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account for Iris, they explained they were having technical issues with CurseForge along with difficulty in actually uploading anything. Apparently the newer CurseForge is quite broken and according to the Iris team CurseForge are "prioritizing modpacks that rip off out mod's branding in search results" and their revenue from CurseForge has been declining "despite the fact that the number of downloads has been increasing month-over-month". In a later Twitter post, the Iris team <a href="https://twitter.com/IrisShaders/status/1647702711771725824" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that "Effective immediately, Iris and Sodium have been pulled by Overwolf for encouraging users to download from Modrinth and archiving files. Modpacks will be broken.".</p>
<p>So now they're recommending all users move over to <a href="https://modrinth.com/" target="_blank">Modrinth</a>, an open source mod hosting platform, that works directly with many popular Minecraft launchers like <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Prism</a> that work great. Here's a shot I took with Iris, Sodium and Complementary Shaders v4:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4455812901681749976gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4455812901681749976gol1.jpg"/></a>OOOoo pretty!</em></p>
<p>Seems like a messy situation, hopefully the move to Modrinth will go well. Modrinth overall seems like a good platform for Minecraft modding, putting the power more in the hands of everyone.</p>

      <title>Publisher of King under the Mountain backs out so it&#39;s re-releasing as Mountaincore</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>King under the Mountain was a pretty nice colony-building game from Rocket Jump Technology, and it was going through a huge upgrade. Sadly, their publisher cancelled on them so they're having to re-release as Mountaincore.</p>
<p>It's a bit of an odd one this. The developer went from working on it solo, to having a publisher come along to help fund further development allowing them to build a small team. The plan was to continue working solidly on it for 9 months, then do a brand new release under the publisher. Just as work was coming to an end the publisher backed away.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they've been allowed to just carry on, including with all the work funded by the publisher (who they won't name). So it's getting re-released anyway now independently as Mountaincore and all original owners will get the newer game too, so no one needs to re-buy anything. Sounds like a win-win for all involved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S9XP3rGsGBs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20264c023daebedd90b4a257920d1d53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S9XP3rGsGBs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Originally inspired clearly by Dwarf Fortress, it also mixes in elements from other games like The Settlers, Prison Architect and Dungeon Keeper with an aim to be more approachable. Some of the new features due to arrive in the updated and renamed release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A completely redesigned UI - no more placeholder UI.</li>
<li>Skill levels so your settlers can develop over time.</li>
<li>Weapons, military management and a detailed combat system.</li>
<li>Monsters to deal with in the caverns of the mountains.</li>
<li>Invasions by hostile Orcs (other races to come soon).</li>
<li>Trading with merchants to plug the gaps in your industry.</li>
<li>Animations and general graphical improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370310/Mountaincore/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It's due to release into Early Access on May 18th.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley set for another update in v1.6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most popular games on Steam (and one of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/heres-the-top-steam-deck-games-for-march-2023/" target="_blank">most played Steam Deck games</a> too), Stardew Valley is coming back for another update in version 1.6.</p>
<p>The developer, Eric Barone who goes by Concerned Ape, mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1647638975568568320?cxt=HHwWgIDTjea6y90tAAAA" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "There is going to be a Stardew 1.6 update. It's mostly changes for modders (which will make it easier &amp; more powerful to mod). But there is also new game content, albeit much less than 1.5. I'm taking a break from Haunted Chocolatier to work on this at the moment. Then back to HC".</p>
<p>Looking back on it, this was actually already announced back in February where it was mentioned at the bottom of the 7 year anniversary <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/413150/view/3644012366894749557" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam. Seems the scope has expanded a bit though to include new content, as only modding changes were mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5244091971681740201gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5244091971681740201gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The modding scene around Stardew Valley remains as popular as ever, with all kinds of mods big and small like the extensive <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753?tab=description" target="_blank">Stardew Valley Expanded</a>. Plenty of the modding scene is thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI" target="_blank">SMAPI</a>, an open source modding API for Stardew Valley.</p>
<p>You can buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stardew_valley?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stardew-valley?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><em>Great to see it being supported for so long.</em></p>

      <title>MineClone2 v0.83 out now, the sandbox game for Minetest inspired by Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired might be pushing it a bit eh? MineClone2 as the name suggests really is a clone of early Minecraft, although this is free and open source powered by the Minetest game engine. A big new release is <a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?p=423766#p423766" target="_blank">out now</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/minetest-570-out-now-with-graphics-improvements-performance-upgrades/" target="_blank">recent Minetest upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>MineClone2 v0.83 "Safe and Sound" is full of new features and honestly it sounds really great. You will find new and updated music, new sound effects, biome coloured foliage and water, mobs can ride minecarts, hoppers can put items in minecarts, new and improved /clearmobs commands, Iron Golems now protect themselves and villagers, various performance improvements, improved translations, lots of bug fixes and the list goes on.</p>
<p>You can see their latest release video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="F-Lai53_Ry4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f05edd2f7dd886b2a4b06a112619509a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/F-Lai53_Ry4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see this great free and open source Minecraft alternative coming along so nicely.</p>
<p>You need <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank">Minetest</a> to play it, and then you can download it via the in-game content downloader.</p>

      <title>Lueur blends city-building with survival from a former Ubisoft developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Darenn Keller previously worked on the likes of Assassin's Creed and Ghost Recon, but now they're going indie with their city-building survival game Lueur.</p>
<p>Inspired by their love of 4x and city builders, but specifically a free little game called <a href="https://poppants.itch.io/lost-settlers" target="_blank">Lost Settlers</a>. Lueur is a minimalist tile-based city-builder, where you discover more as you explore and go through it. Developed to be cozy while building, but just a little challenging with the survival aspects of it — all with really simple controls. A key point here is the length, most games will only be around 40 minutes or so. You also build across various different levels, each with their own story and challenges to overcome.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19918943791681728711gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19918943791681728711gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The tiles have little mini-games inside them too, so you'll play a tiny arcade game to do various things. It sounds so thoroughly unique I feel like I have to play it. A fun fact for you here: not only will it support Linux, the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/DarennKeller/status/1644344494194675713" target="_blank">told me</a> they're creating it on Manjaro too and they're using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>There's also different modes available depending on your preference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settlers: A cozy and relaxing experience. You are not completely safe, but you'll have time to experiment, learn and build your beautiful city. </li>
<li>Survivors: It's gonna be a real challenge to survive. Your choices matters and time is of the essence. </li>
<li>Deity: A fast-paced unforgiving experience very close to an RTS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer gives a fun overview of what to expect below and it seems full of surprises:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xCB-JrcixkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d3d44738be07ae9ffa7ffc1239181d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xCB-JrcixkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm very keen to give this a go, it looks great!</p>
<p>You can wishlist / follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308630/Lueur/" target="_blank">directly on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One I missed recently that you should check out: Black Reliquary is a free total conversion mod for the original Darkest Dungeon, and it's available now with a whole lot of content to play through. While it's completely free, it will need you to own the full game of course but it also needs the The Shieldbreaker DLC, and the Crimson Court DLC since it pulls features from them.</p>
<p>More about it: "Black Reliquary is a complete overhaul mod for Darkest Dungeon that harnesses the original systems whilst building upon, refining, or transforming nearly every single aspect of them. This mod features an entire new story and campaign in an exotic new desert locale, with fully voiced narration and an original soundtrack. Venture into The Valley, reach the Black Reliquary, and reveal its ancient secrets."</p>

      <title>Try out a free prologue of Shogun Showdown right now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shogun Showdown: Prologue is a demo of the upcoming turn-based combat game with rogue-like and deck-building elements. It will have full Native Linux support at release, with a version available in the Prologue now too. From Goblinz Publishing, Gamera Games and Roboatino, the Prologue has so far been gathering some rather positive user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>For those of you who like repeatable games, it looks like a fun concept where positioning really counts during combat and you'll unlock plenty more as you go through it. Another game where you get that tasty "just one more run" feeling, before you realise it's 1AM and you really should be going to sleep.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rZHtTQP5FR8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5347de93467a071193999afa94067311.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rZHtTQP5FR8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available in the Prologue:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play The Wanderer: a lone warrior haunted by her past who travels the land seeking redemption through battle.</li>
<li>3 combat locations: The Bamboo Grove, The Waterfall Caves and The Port City.</li>
<li>14 attack tiles.</li>
<li>8 quests and 2 challenges.</li>
<li>10+ skills.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Last of Us has more Steam Deck improvements and lots of other fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fires continue to be put out by Naughty Dog and Iron Galaxy as they fix up The Last of Us, with a new patch landing with lots of fixes.</p>
<p>Available in v1.0.3 are these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1888930/view/3730711090586078092" target="_blank">changes</a> just for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the native UI overlapped the ‘Look’ prompt.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the DualSense™ motion sensor function may not register the player shaking the camera to fix the flashlight when prompted.</li>
<li>[Left Behind] Increased the size of the Arcade’s mini-game button user interface.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance hasn't really been fixed up yet for Steam Deck, with it still pretty messy in lots of places and it's currently rated as Unsupported by Valve through Deck Verified. As Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1643305179901739008" target="_blank">previously</a> "Getting VERIFIED isn’t a priority. Optimization &amp; stability (on the Steam Deck &amp; other pc platforms) is!".</p>
<p>So eventually, once it's had more optimizations and fixes across the whole game, it might eventually be a reasonable experience on Steam Deck. At least on desktop Linux last I checked it worked reasonably well and this patch does include numerous crash bug fixes, texture problems and lots of other fixes.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>MangoHud performance overlay version v0.6.9 is out now as a nice update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a while since the last release but a nice update to the performance hud and benchmarking tool MangoHud is out now. This is the tool used for the performance stats on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Something I'm a big fan of, because I use it plenty on desktop Linux too, it's one of the most useful open source projects for gaming. An example of a pretty basic layout for performance:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14976972521681555066gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Version 0.6.9 brings these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for it8603 sensor</li>
<li>Conform to <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html" target="_blank">VUID-VkDeviceCreateInfo-pNext-00373</a></li>
<li>Add GalaxyClient, RedLauncher, Amazon Games and gamescope to blacklist</li>
<li>Add Artix and Nobara to build.sh</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when using zink, and certain games using DXVK e.g. FarCry 3/4</li>
<li>Fixed reporting amdgpu clock speed</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with <code class="inline-code">exec</code> causing certain games to crash</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect metrics for ryzen 7000 series iGPUs</li>
<li>Fixed discovery of wine binary when using wine64 build</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also the addition of additional options to further tweak the experience how you want it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">exec_name</code> - Display current exec name.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">hud_compact</code> - Display compact version of MangoHud.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">hud_no_margin</code> - Remove margins around MangoHud.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">horizontal</code> - Display Mangohud in a horizontal position.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">toggle_hud_position</code> Toggle MangoHud postion. Default is R_Shift + F11</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_limit_method</code> If FPS limiter should wait before or after presenting a frame. Choose <code class="inline-code">late</code> (default) for the lowest latency or <code class="inline-code">early</code> for the smoothest frametimes.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">picmip</code> Mip-map LoD bias. Negative values will increase texture sharpness (and aliasing). Positive values will increase texture blurriness (-16 to 16)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">af</code> Anisotropic filtering level. Improves sharpness of textures viewed at an angle (0 to 16)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">bicubic</code> Force bicubic filtering</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">trilinear</code> Force trilinear filtering</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">retro</code> Disables linear texture filtering. Makes textures look blocky</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">position</code> new option: <code class="inline-code">bottom_center</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of a nice clean horizontal layout I tested today with Everspace 2:</p>

      <title>Ubisoft hiring Linux developer talent for XDefiant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>XDefiant is an upcoming free-to-play, first-person arena shooter from Ubisoft and it seems they need a bit more Linux talent. In an advert on their <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/search/743999879479053-linux-systems-engineer-xdefiant" target="_blank">careers website</a> there's one noted for "Linux Systems Engineer - XDefiant", with the option to work remotely too.</p>
<p>The placement reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for a highly talented, motivated, and experienced person to work with us on XDefiant, a new multiplatform online multiplayer action game based in our San Francisco studio. XDefiant is a free-to-play, fast-paced arena shooter that combines intense gunplay with personalized loadouts and specialized factions, as teams of gunfighters battle for domination.</p>
<p>You’ll be working to extend and improve our game’s services running on Linux. You’ll be adding functionality and features, improving performance, and improving the Snowdrop engine’s support for Linux. As we all know, Linux is an extremely stable and performance-oriented OS, and you’ll be able to make XDefiant really shine there. You will work on a small, collaboration-oriented team where you will have the opportunity to contribute in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>You’ll also be part of the diverse Ubisoft San Francisco team. We embrace a variety of work situations based on what is best for the team, and we welcome people working in our SF office, <strong>remotely within the continental US</strong>, or some combination of the two. We put a priority on supporting our team members and what makes them happiest and most productive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you'll be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand and improve the Snowdrop engine’s presence on Linux.</li>
<li>Optimize engine and game code.</li>
<li>Debug and refactor systems as needed to take the best advantage of Linux.</li>
<li>Work with the rest of the engineering staff to help them expand their cross-platform mindset.</li>
<li>Coordinate with other developers to ensure smooth roll out of new features.</li>
<li>Create and maintain technical design documents and best practices.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Could be a good one to try for some of our more experienced readers perhaps. Who knows, maybe it will even result in getting it working on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</em></p>

      <title>Landnama gives a non-violent exploration city-builder roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending features from city builders and dungeon crawling roguelikes, Landnama sounds pretty unusual, especially with the non-violent theme too.</p>
<p>You control a band of Vikings, as they set out to settle Iceland. There's no combat here though, as the game focuses on the farmers, explorers and builders. So the challenge here is the exploration, and the count-down to Winter and with a single resource of Heart you'll need to weigh up every possible decision.</p>
<p>So far they've only released a very brief teaser along with info about what it is, plus a bunch of screenshots:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bEAtDYrGoRI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dce3cdadd317ae33f49d8d4610cb6492.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bEAtDYrGoRI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Certainly has me curious to try it.</p>
<p>Developed by indie team Sonderland, three dads and close friends from Germany, France and Canada with different backgrounds and perspectives on gaming, united by the desire to make beautiful, minimalist games they love to play. It will have Native Linux support at release. Their plan is to release it sometime this year, and there's a Playtest on Steam you can request access to try it.</p>

      <title>The latest Steam Survey had a huge surge of Simplified Chinese</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After waiting a while to see if Valve issued any corrections, it seems that the latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for March 2023 is staying as it is, with a huge surge of Simplified Chinese. The last time we saw such a thing, it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-steam-hardware-survey-had-some-flaw-causing-cyber-cafes-to-be-over-counting-users.11711/" target="_blank">was an error</a> in the Steam Survey, as it was over-counting cyber cafe customers. This time, maybe not then.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">latest details</a> it shows users with Simplified Chinese as their language now at 51.63% (+25.35%), knocking down English to 22.83%. That's the kind of increase that certainly raises a few eyebrows. </p>
<p>Due to the influx, it also caused the Linux user share to go from 1.27% in February to 0.84% in March. Quite a stark drop, since Linux isn't particularly popular in Asia and again, we've seen that happen before a few times when Simplified Chinese as a language choice on Steam goes up, the Linux share goes down with it.</p>
<p>The biggest winner on the survey is Windows 10 64 bit, which went up to 73.95% (+11.62%). Filtering it over to just the Linux details, these are the most popular distributions for March 2023:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 21.20% + 0.15%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.36% + 0.19%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 9.61% + 9.61%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.10% - 0.17%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.95% + 0.45%</li>
<li>Other 44.79% + 8.33%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is of course: what's going on? What do you think has happened? </p>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-55 released with an essential fix for Easy Anti-Cheat issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-55" target="_blank">version 7-55</a> was released a few days ago, and it's an essential update for those of you preferring it to the official Valve Proton on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>It appears that when releasing version 7-53 a few weeks ago, which included a fix for Star Citizen, it ended up causing problems for other games using Easy Anti-Cheat. Here's what's changed in GE-Proton 7-55:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a hotfix for EAC. In 7-53 the star citizen hotfix broke EAC compatibility for other games, this has been fixed now.</p>
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to git.</li>
<li>nvapi enabled for final fantasy stranger of paradise.</li>
<li>legacy xactengine winetricks protonfix removed as it's finally no longer needed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>LIVE A LIVE originally released in the 90s for the Super Famicom, and now it's being revived with the same style as OCTOPATH TRAVELER and it's already Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>It doesn't actually release on Steam until April 27th, so it's another nice example of Valve getting some early pre-release testing of a bigger upcoming game. Hopefully we'll be seeing more of this to come, as the popularity of the Steam Deck continues to rise, it would be good to have more developers work with Valve before release to ensure their games are in a good state.</p>

      <title>Microsoft experiments with a handheld Windows 11 mode for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 13/04/23, 17:11 UTC</strong>: the developer involved is playing it down noting it didn't go anywhere and it's not a recent thing, mentioning in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12kjgkh/comment/jg3lsvm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post ("this article" is referencing The Verge):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started this hackathon project and it didn’t go much of anywhere, but this article uses wording to make it seem like it’s something under development. Problem is - We just didn’t have the right engineers to do a lot of what we wanted to do in the short hackathon project timeframe. Maybe this odd article can help me pitch this to Microsoft again. Phil Spencer was very nice and tried to drive me to some people that could help, but everyone was tied-up at the time.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>This is interesting, it seems Valve have lit a small fire under Microsoft once again, as they've been experimenting with a handheld mode for Windows 11 to help devices like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>To pre-empt complaints from some comments: yeah, I know, this isn't specifically Linux news but things happening in the industry are important.</em></p>
<p>With thanks to Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1646339289230483458" target="_blank">@_h0x0d_</a> noticed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/13/23681492/microsoft-windows-handheld-mode-gaming-xbox-steam-deck" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, they shared what seems to be an internal video from Microsoft developers talking about a Hackathon they did to optimise Windows 11 for handhelds. The important point here, is that it's largely due to the popularity and success of the Steam Deck which ships with SteamOS Linux.</p>
<p>You can get Windows on Steam Deck but it's not exactly supported, with Valve just throwing up the drivers for download that they occasionally update. Valve's focus of course is on SteamOS, where they have all of the control they want for their own device.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8187086201681390575gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8187086201681390575gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured Credit - @_h0x0d_</em></p>
<p>During the Microsoft's developers testing they also worked with another developer to work on <a href="https://github.com/mKenfenheuer/steam-deck-windows-usermode-driver" target="_blank">a project</a> that gives a "windows usermode controller driver for the steam deck internal controller".</p>
<p>It's interesting to see Microsoft developers react to a change in the market like this, although it might never actually become a real thing, it would depend on them gathering more support inside Microsoft to make it happen. Competition is good though, and it might even give Valve perhaps a few ideas or even the KDE team to improve the Plasma Desktop experience.</p>

      <title>Grounded from Obsidian adds Steam Deck support in v1.2.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The survival game Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Xbox Game Studios is gearing up to launch version 1.2.0 that's now available to test. With it comes Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>It seems that Microsoft / Xbox published titles have been seeing some attention lately, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/halo-the-master-chief-collection-gets-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> also recently boosting its Steam Deck support. A sign of more great things to come?</p>
<p>Grounded <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/131791-public-test-patch-notes-for-update-120/" target="_blank">version 1.2.0</a> has hit the stage where it's ready for people to opt-into the Beta, so you can give it a try right now. The patch notes show quite a lot being added and Steam Deck got a special mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Steam Deck Support</h3>
<p>Grounded has been updated to include official Steam Deck support. Fixed issues and improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game now boots past the initial loading screen.</li>
<li>The Xbox log-in window properly displays.</li>
<li>Tuned the default graphics settings for Steam Deck to provide an enjoyable experience. Also includes some Steam Deck-specific optimizations.</li>
<li>Steam Deck virtual keyboard pops up when selecting any input text field in the game (entering a multiplayer game password, naming your trail marker / storage, pet, etc.)</li>
<li>Control prompts no longer flip flop between displaying gamepad and mouse/keyboard controls when using the touch pad or gyro.</li>
<li>Note: <em>The Steam store page will not reflect this official support until after the 1.2 Public Test period is complete.</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Previously, you needed various workarounds to be able to actually play the game, as it would freeze on the intro and after that the Xbox login screen also wouldn't work. This patch solves that. Testing it with a fresh install on Proton 7.0-6 (the current main Proton) and yup, it works without an issue getting into the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17073059671681388561gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17073059671681388561gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16116363611681388562gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16116363611681388562gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Once version 1.2 is released properly, this will quite likely get Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Testing it on desktop Linux (Fedora KDE), sadly I couldn't reproduce it working with either Proton 7.0-6 or Proton Experimental through repeated runs and trying a few different things but on Steam Deck it was without issues. So hopefully Valve and their Proton developers will figure out what the differences are and get it working, or perhaps even Obsidian can look into why that is.</p>
<p>You can buy Grounded on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Sci-fi puzzle game Photon Engineer out now, made with open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love puzzle games like Portal and The Talos Principle? Photon Engineer might be one for you to have a look at.</p>
<p>An interesting note about this one and why it's being highlighted: the developer behind it created their own <a href="https://github.com/petitg1987/urchinEngine" target="_blank">open source game engine</a> with Vulkan, and then made this game with it. Seems like quite an impressive feat, while a lot of developers go for an off the shelf game engine. Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>40 levels/platforms to discover.</li>
<li>95 puzzles (45 puzzles with lasers and 50 sliding puzzles).</li>
<li>15 puzzle achievements that extend the game experience.</li>
<li>Each puzzle is unique and provides a new idea.</li>
<li>The further you go, the more complex mechanisms you'll encounter.</li>
<li>Lasers are all marked with symbols for colorblind players.</li>
</ul>

      <title>X4: Kingdom End and free major upgrade out now, making it Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Egosoft have just released the next major expansion for X4: Foundations named X4: Kingdom End, plus a major free upgrade is also out now that brings full Steam Deck Verified support.</p>
<p>While the game had been given a Steam Deck Verified rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/5309220324014797184" target="_blank">back in March</a>, this was <em>specifically</em> for the Beta of the 6.00 update that only launched today. Confusing really, to have a public store page rating for something people would have to know about and manually opt into, a part of Deck Verified I hope Valve make clearer in future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enjoy a long-awaited reunion with the Boron in X4: Kingdom End, the fourth expansion for X4: Foundations, which completes the collection of the main factions in the X Universe. Discover the unique Boron ships, and fly them through distinctive systems, on a journey of discovery. Visit fascinating places, uncover old secrets and make new acquaintances. Embark on an immersive new chapter of X4!</p>

<p>There's absolutely loads new in the game update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Feature: Updated graphics engine, with Parallax Occlusion Mapping, Reflection Probes, enhanced lighting, improved shadows, and more.</li>
<li>New Feature: Jolt Physics engine.</li>
<li>New Feature: Live Stream camera mode.</li>
<li>New Feature: Position Defence for carrier-led fleets.</li>
<li>New Feature: New Construction Vessel designs for Paranid, Teladi, Split and Terran factions.</li>
<li>Added new bombardment assignment for subordinates.</li>
<li>Added command to order ships to attack surface elements on designated targets.</li>
<li>Added Salvage at Position and Deliver Salvage commands for use with repeat orders.</li>
<li>Added self-destruct command for player-owned satellites, resource probes, nav beacons, lasertowers and mines.</li>
<li>Added detection and penalty for theft from station build storage.</li>
<li>Added more gamestart information, indicating whether they are Tutorial, Guided, Assisted or Sandbox, and adjusted order.</li>
<li>Added option to edit Buccaneer relations in Custom Gamestart Editor under certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Added Custom Gamestart Editor story states for Tides of Avarice stories.</li>
<li>Added player HQ to Station Design Simulator.</li>
<li>Added Supervised Mining missions.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Driver updates for AMD RADV to give nice boost for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming Mesa driver 23.1 release is sounding like it's going to be pretty great, with the Graphics Pipeline Library ("GPL") being enabled by default, plus we're looking at smaller shader cache sizes too.</p>
<p>We're still around a month away from the release of Mesa 23.1 but that doesn't stop me being excited by it. Going by the current <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/release-calendar.html" target="_blank">roadmap</a>, the estimated release date is May 3rd. When you will get the update will depend on the usual update times for whatever Linux distribution you're on, and for Steam Deck — likely for the next <em>major</em> upgrade.</p>
<p>Merged into the AMD RADV driver in Mesa a couple of days ago, was <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22362" target="_blank">a change</a> to enable GPL by default. What this should do, is much improve the stuttery situation that many games on Linux and Steam Deck face when they don't have a shader cache. You can read a whole lot more about how it works in the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/reducing-draw-time-hitching-with-vk-ext-graphics-pipeline-library" target="_blank">original announcement</a> post from The Khronos Group who oversee the Vulkan API.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22030" target="_blank">recent addition</a> that was merged into Mesa only a day ago, "re-implements the RADV pipeline cache based on the common vk_pipeline_cache", and as a result the developer noted they saw a <em>reduction</em> in the cache file size by "~60%" for single-file disk-cache and "~2%" <em>increase</em> for multi-file disk-cache "due to the overhead from additional small files".</p>
<p>All this and more was summed up in my recent Steam Deck overview news video:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 announced, plus RTX Remix released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have revealed the GeForce RTX 4070 as the latest in their Ada Lovelace architecture lineup. Plus, there's an initial release of RTX Remix.</p>
<p>For the RTX 4070, NVIDIA claim it gives the ability to "run most modern games at over 100 frames per second at 1440p resolution" (although this is when using DLSS). Specifications in comparison to the 4070 Ti, mostly highlighting the bits that are different between them (from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4070-4070ti/" target="_blank">here</a>):</p>

<p>From what NVIDIA say it gives "on average 2.6x faster with DLSS 3" when compared with the RTX 2070 SUPER and "on average 1.4x faster" than the GeForce RTX 3080 with DLSS 3. NVIDIA also said that in games not using Ray Tracing or DLSS the RTX 4070 is "on par" with the RTX 3080 while "running at nearly half the power — and offering an additional 2GB of memory" plus they've given it 36MB of L2 cache.</p>
<p>When will you be able to get one? The GeForce RTX 4070 will be available from tomorrow priced at $599 / £589.</p>
<p>At least on pricing, it seems a fair bit more reasonable than what NVIDIA has been putting out previously, although it still feels quite inflated. Do mention in the comments what you think to the value of it. Do you think it's worth it?</p>
<p>NVIDIA also additionally just recently tagged the first public release of <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix" target="_blank">RTX Remix</a>, their software to add path-tracing to classic games. It's available under the MIT license, making use of DXVK with their own <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/dxvk-remix/" target="_blank">fork</a>.

      <title>KDE Connect is getting some upgrades for easy file-transfers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Connect is up high on my list of my favourite open source apps, because it makes transferring files between devices (PC / Steam Deck / Mobile) and more real easy. It's been around for a while now and the good news is that it's going to keep getting better.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://albertvaka.wordpress.com/2023/04/11/the-road-to-kde-connect-2-0/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, developer Albert Vaca announced they've been given a grant from the NLnet foundation as part of the NGI Assure fund, which will enable them to work on it full time.</p>
<p>Some of what they have planned includes adding in a mDNS backend for KDE Connect on all supported platforms, to improve device discovery and connections. Beefing up the security is going to be another area they're focusing on with dropping older encryption (that was used for older Android), upgrading various dependencies and ensuring all the latest security patches are in.</p>
<p>Plus they're also going to be looking at accessibility, to ensure the interface is as easy to use as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17465440141681320781gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17465440141681320781gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall it sounds like the future of KDE Connect is looking great.</p>

      <title>Half-Life: Alyx fully playable without VR even on Steam Deck thanks to a mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a few efforts to get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" target="_blank">Half-Life: Alyx</a> playable without VR and the latest is <a href="https://github.com/bfeber/HLA-NoVR" target="_blank">HLA-NoVR</a>, out now and it's now possible to play it through, even on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>All you need to do is download it from <a href="https://github.com/bfeber/HLA-NoVR" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr/downloads/half-life-alyx-novr-script-update-6" target="_blank">Mod DB</a>, and place it into your Alyx install folder, overwriting the existing files and then set "-novr -vsync" as a launch option and yup — it works. The screenshot below is it running on my Fedora KDE desktop, with Proton 7.0-6 and MangoHud as well. I've only tested with Proton, as the Native Linux build hasn't work for me for some time now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1896782131681241500gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1896782131681241500gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking in an <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr/news/full-campaign-playable-without-vr-update-out-now" target="_blank">update</a> on Mod DB the developers of the mod said: "This is our biggest update yet and we have no plans on slowing down! With thousands playing Half-Life Alyx NoVR we are happy to announce our largest update yet! As the titles state the entire game can now be played from start to finish, with the Gravity Gloves fully implemented along with combine fabricators providing weapon upgrades. Also since we are now updating the final parts of the game there may be spoilers! We will do our best to not spoil anything while ensuring we communicate these late game areas have been updated along with their gameplay mechanics."</p>
<p>They do still have a whole bunch of stuff left to do, but it's quite impressive what they've been able to achieve. You're also not currently able to get some of the Steam Achievements but it seems a lot of them are possible now (33/42). Even some popular mods for Alyx are playable with this including Levitation, Extra-Ordinary Value, Belomorskaya Station and Overcharge.</p>
<p>You can see in the shot below of Alyx running on my Steam Deck too, and there's even a Steam Input configuration ready for it and it felt quite playable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6260461811681243024gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6260461811681243024gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Half-Life: Alyx in VR is one of my all-time favourite experiences, so it was thoroughly weird going through a little bit of it with this mod.</p>
<p>You can see some of their videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gb_2_" target="_blank">YouTube</a> full of spoilers of course.</p>

      <title>Popular survival roguelike Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead gets a Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a rather popular roguelike, quite possibly one of the best, and now it's available on Steam.</p>
<p>This is an official release from the developers too, with the Steam release being handled by one of the developers most involved with maintaining it. Although it's free and open source, the Steam release is paid to hopefully keep development on it going even further.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15341913281681221408gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15341913281681221408gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex and diverse enemies from ever-mutating legions of the undead, to giant insects, to existential horrors from between worlds.</li>
<li>Unparalleled vehicle building and customization system.</li>
<li>Immersive, exquisitely detailed crafting system covering everything from smithing and soldering to keeping your sourdough starter fed.</li>
<li>Build almost anything you can imagine, from a wattle-and-daub shelter in the woods to a tower of reinforced concrete and living alien resin.</li>
<li>Populate your base with NPC allies that help you craft and keep you company.</li>
<li>Explore one of the most detailed and immersive skill and proficiency systems in any RPG.</li>
<li>Ever expanding content, with new major updates released regularly.</li>
<li>Challenging, rewarding game balance that forces you to evaluate every step, or pay the price. You'll soon see why most of the world's population is dead!</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you played it? What do you think to it? I know plenty of people who love it and it's in the top 30 survival game list on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc" target="_blank">RPS</a> even. Hopefully the Steam release will make it more accessible than ever, and bring a new audience to it, it's a game that deserves to be played — if the style is your cup of tea. We even had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/cataclysm-dark-days-ahead-is-a-sprawling-foss-apocalypse-roguelike/" target="_blank">contributed article</a> a while ago talking about it.</p>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2330750/Cataclysm_Dark_Days_Ahead/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development, or via the <a href="https://cataclysmdda.org/" target="_blank">website</a> as before.</p>

      <title>Open Hexagon gets new content plus Linux and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open Hexagon is very much Super Hexagon hyped up to max, open source and just absolutely nuts to play. A fresh upgrade is out now and it sounds great, especially for Linux desktop and Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>In version 2.1.7 the developer mentioned it "adds three new ranked packs, significantly optimizes various aspects of the game's performance, and finally provides a native Linux build that works great out of the box on Steam Deck, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux".</p>
<p>For those that don't know it the idea is simple: survive as long as you can. With only a few buttons to press it's simple enough but incredibly hard to master as you try to avoid all the obstacles.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13630854691681218577gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13630854691681218577gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While the game on a basic level was taken from Super Hexagon, the developer of Open Hexagon takes it to a whole different level with multiple new game mechanics to melt your brain like curving and accelerating walls, you really need concentration for this one. Built for modding too so you can make your own crazy stuff in it.</p>
<p>Never seen it? Original release trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="06y7mEsAMHM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa61a937449ea714011a3205b990ecc4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/06y7mEsAMHM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358090/Open_Hexagon/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the source is up on <a href="https://github.com/vittorioromeo/SSVOpenHexagon" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Minetest 5.7.0 out now with graphics improvements, performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free and open source voxel sandbox game engine <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank">Minetest</a>, largely known for comparisons to Minecraft, has a big update out in version 5.7.0. Sounds like a really great release too with plenty of new features and upgrades to the engine.</p>
<p>There's some new graphical features that have been added with post-processing implemented, like bloom and dynamic exposure. The developers said they do plan to add more effects in future like depth-of-field, volumetric lighting and others. Mods and Games will have full control over it all too.</p>
<p>A big performance win is the changes to make better use of your GPU, which they said gives "vastly improved performance on modern hardware at 500+ view ranges". As an example of it they showed a screenshot of it running on Steam Deck with a 600 view range that gives 53FPS whereas before the optimisation it would get 10FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14105411131681217462gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14105411131681217462gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's also been other optimizations done too like the occlusion culling, for not rendering areas that cannot be seen and some more multi-threading has been added too. A nice adjustment for modding is that worlds won't load if a mod doesn't have all of its other content dependencies, instead of just loading with them disabled causing confusion and other problems.</p>
<p>See more in the release <a href="https://blog.minetest.net/2023/04/08/5.7.0-released/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I got a juicy patch with Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>It's certainly no secret that The Last of Us Part I had a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/the-last-of-us-on-steam-deck-is-not-great/" target="_blank">really bad launch</a> overall and the developer is now trying to improve things. This new patch goes over crash bugs, does a little optimization of texture streaming to reduce CPU usage, some textures not rendering correctly was fixed and a whole lot more. So we're slowly getting closer to the state it should have released in.</p>
<p>Nice to see the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> getting some dedicated attention here too, with it seeing these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where PSO Caching may freeze at 50% completion.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where plugging in a DualSense controller while viewing cutscenes from the Cinematics menu may force a player into gameplay.</li>
<li>Adjusted the user interface to show Steam Deck controls in the Screen Magnifier menu.</li>
<li>Adjusted positioning of the Weapon and Health HUD elements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Full patch notes <a href="https://feedback.naughtydog.com/hc/en-us/articles/14662356357908-The-Last-of-Us-Part-I-v1-0-2-0-Patch-Notes" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to playing it through again, either on my Steam Deck or Linux desktop, once it's had a bit more time in the oven. I will be happy when it's sorted, as it's still one of my all-time favourite stories. If you're jumping in again, do let me know in the comments how you find it now.</p>

      <title>EVERSPACE 2 out now, devs focus on Proton for Linux - Steam Deck optimizations planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ROCKFISH Games have now launched EVERSPACE 2 and it looks awesome! One of their original Kickstarter promises did not make it though, with Native Linux support being cancelled as they will support it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> instead.</p>
<p>Despite repeatedly mentioning a Native Linux build would come, even as recently as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/everspace-2-gets-a-steam-deck-and-linux-release-update/" target="_blank">mid February</a>, they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/3695807559244833672" target="_blank">decided not</a> to go through with it. Why? They said Vulkan support in Unreal Engine 4 is "broken and incomplete" and it gave between "50% - 80%" of the performance compared with just running the Windows version in Proton. There were other issues, like VRAM leaks causing crashes. After they spoke with Epic Games, they said it's clear Unreal Engine 4 won't get fixed up with the focus now on Unreal Engine 5 and ROCKFISH don't have the time to fix up the game engine.</p>
<p>They shared a screenshot as a quick example showing the Native build with Vulkan, their Windows build with DXVK and the Windows build with VKD3D-Proton and the performance difference speaks for itself really:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16093829431680863195gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16093829431680863195gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The good news is they plan to ensure it does work well with Proton and they will continue to optimize it there. Any Kickstarter backers not happy can request a refund too which is good to see.</p>
<p>As for Steam Deck, dedicated optimizations for it are also still planned.</p>
<p>For players on other stores like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/everspace_2" target="_blank">GOG</a>, it does make things more complicated, since Steam is the only store to officially support a translation layer like Proton. However, you can try with <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>

      <title>Report: Steam Deck to pass 3 million sales during 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new <a href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/pr/2023/04-apr/omdia-steam-deck-installed-base-to-surpass-three-million-during-2023" target="_blank">report</a> from Omdia currently doing the rounds is that the Steam Deck from Valve is set to hit 3 million sales during 2023.</p>
<p>We already knew it had hit at least <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">1 million in 2022</a>, when a KDE developer gave away the figure but Valve actually hasn't talked about the sales figures yet. It's easy to see why Valve aren't announcing any figures — but it seems others will do it for them anyway like this. The report estimates Valve hit about 1.6 million during 2022 and will ship 1.9 million in 2023.</p>
<p>So why don't Valve give out any figures themselves? Valve has always been pretty tight-lipped about details, and this is really no different to their normal operation. They don't need to give out figures either, they're a private company and don't have anyone to please but their own pockets. If they did release regular figures, can you imagine the wider headlines from the major gaming press (and likely other media too)? No doubt it would be instantly talked down like a failure because it's not hitting the levels of the Switch or Xbox.</p>
<p>As we know, it doesn't <em>need</em> to shift multiple millions per month for Valve, since it's part of a single ecosystem where they continue to print money with their 30% cut of Steam games. It doesn't really help though that it's sold in very limited places (mostly via Steam or Komodo), with the only actual retail presence <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-hitting-retail-in-hong-kong-taiwan-and-later-japan-and-south-korea/" target="_blank">recently announced in Asia</a> and even there it's limited. So when you think it's shifting this many with no traditional retail store presence outside of the previous link talking about a few Asian regions, and still only being available in select countries officially worldwide, it's doing well overall. </p>
<p>Realistically speaking, the Steam Deck is a niche device, especially considering a lot of people using Steam would already have a PC or Laptop to play their games. That said, it does seem to be hitting above its weight, as Valve devs noted over around 42% of people buying one ended up spending the majority of their gaming time with it. Plus, with a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/no-trunext-gen-steam-deck-for-a-few-years-valve-say/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 2 likely years away</a>, there's no reason to hold off on picking one up now if you want to play PC games on the go that it enables.</p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts?</em></p>

      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It took quite a while for the issues to be figured out but Halo: The Master Chief Collection (MCC) now has improved Steam Deck support. This should also mean it works better on desktop Linux too.</p>
<p>While the game did somewhat work for a while, you weren't able to play fully online with others due to problems with Easy Anti-Cheat. Whatever the issues were have been <em>partially</em> solved now so players on Steam Deck can jump into EAC enabled games in multiplayer matchmaking and the Custom Game Browser. In a <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/14589112499348" target="_blank">support post</a> on the official site, the developers said that future updates will "continue to improve Steam Deck compatibility as well".</p>
<p>Testing it myself and yup — playing online works just fine:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3426247311680725846gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3426247311680725846gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's some known issues though, like the launch options being <em>backwards</em>, that you need to keep in mind for now until future updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When launching Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam Deck, selecting one of the available Anti-Cheat launch options will result in the game launching with the opposite launch option. For example, selecting “Anti-Cheat Disabled” will result in MCC launching with Anti-Cheat enabled.
<ul>
<li>Until this issue is resolved in a future update, players on Steam Deck must select the “Anti-Cheat Disabled” launch option to access multiplayer matchmaking and the Custom Game Browser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shortly after being removed from or leaving a party with other players via the Roster menu, players on Steam Deck may experience Halo: The Master Chief Collection freezing or crashing.</li>
<li>Players on Steam Deck are unable to play <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403583912084" target="_blank">Campaign Co-op or Spartan Ops</a> with players on PC or Xbox consoles. Attempting to do so may result in players accessing gameplay, however, all sessions will eventually experience a “Connection Interrupted” error or a similar disconnection.
<ul>
<li>Campaign Co-op and Spartan Ops will function as expected if all players in the group are playing on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>By "PC", they of course mean specifically Windows in the above quoted list.</em></p>
<p>For people trying it on Steam Deck for the first time, just be aware it won't automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard to sign in. You need to press STEAM + X to have it appear, and it may take a few taps in the input box to have it actually get focus from the keyboard. Hopefully they work on that too.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the Stellaris 16 (Gen5) for people with money to burn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have some spare cash and in the market for a pricey and powerful Linux laptop? TUXEDO would like a word with you for their Stellaris 16 (Gen5). For those of you who want desktop-class performance in something easier to move around, perhaps it might be interesting.</p>
<p>This upgraded model now includes the ability to spec it up to a RTX 4090, which is pretty ridiculous to have in a laptop. It also has a Cherry MX ULP keyboard for much improved typing, although they offer a cheaper silent option too. It has a 240Hz G-SYNC 2560 x 1600 screen and 16GB DDR5 RAM at a minimum too. When it comes to the base configuration you'll get an Intel Core i9-13900HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 2 x 8 GB DDR5-5600-MHz and a 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1195649991680708672gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1195649991680708672gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Connectivity plenty too according to the specs sheet as it comes with a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, Microphone-in, Headpone-out, a SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader, Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4 Gen 3, HDMI 2.1, 2.5Gbit LAN and even space to hook up their TUXEDO Aquaris water cooling system.</p>
<p>They seem to be especially hyping up the cooling system on this one, noting it has "6 heatpipes" with a "liquid metal thermal compound on the CPU and GPU" that allows it to hit top performance and stay there claiming it's "superior to the one of typical thin-and-light gaming notebooks and allows for comparatively higher performance or alternatively quieter operation" to provide "outstanding performance for content creation or gaming".</p>
<p>Pricing starts at €1763.87 EUR (excl. VAT). They expect it to become available at the end of April, with pre-orders live now.</p>

<p>On the Fanatical side it's on their <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100721639-13797872?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-play-on-the-go-bundle%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3DPTW" target="_blank">Play On The Go Bundle</a> where you can buy 3, 5 or 8 games together from a selection and get them cheaper and then you'll get a discount voucher to use on a JSAUX Docking Station (models HB0604 or HB0702). The game bundle has these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>198X</li>
<li>Creepy Tale 1 &amp; 2 Double Pack</li>
<li>Cyber Hook</li>
<li>Dead Island: Riptide Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Door Kickers: Action Squad</li>
<li>Evan's Remains</li>
<li>Ghost 1.0</li>
<li>Gone Home + Original Soundtrack</li>
<li>Horizon Chase Turbo</li>
<li>Hunted: The Demon's Forge</li>
<li>Iconoclasts</li>
<li>Legends of Kingdom Rush</li>
<li>Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix</li>
<li>PC Building Simulator</li>
<li>Pile Up! Box by Box</li>
<li>Snooker 19</li>
<li>Speed Limit</li>
<li>Splasher</li>
<li>Thunder Wolves</li>
<li>Totally Reliable Delivery Service</li>
<li>Youtubers Life</li>
</ul>
<p>The other side is JSAUX where you can grab either the <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/m-2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0604" target="_blank">HB0604</a> or <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">HB0702</a> Docking Station, and then you'll get a discount voucher to spend at Fanatical (both sides give 10% off). So if you're in need of new games and potentially a Docking Station for the Steam Deck, this might be a good little deal to grab.</p>

<p>What have you been playing recently? I've been blasting through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" target="_blank">DOOM</a> (2016) and I'm very close to finishing it. The Steam Deck has been great for getting me to go back through my vast Steam Library. Going to need a break after that though, it's quite intense so I'll perhaps jump into something a bit less full-on for my next game.</p>

      <title>System76 CEO teases in-house Linux laptop code-named &#39;Virgo&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux hardware vendor and creator of the Pop!_OS distribution, <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a>, have made their own desktop for a while now but they're moving onto a custom laptop next. Something they've been planning for some time, as they've gradually scaled up their in-house manufacturing. </p>
<p>On <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141037787618107" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, System76 Founder and CEO Carl Richell, showed off two photos of the panel for the LCD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Virgo” is the code name for the laptop we’ll manufacture at our Denver factory. This is the LCD “A” panel milled from thin 6061 aluminum bar stock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12049056341680633701gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12049056341680633701gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14465118761680633703gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14465118761680633703gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click above to enlarge the photos - credit to Richell</em></p>
<p>Clarifying some more details in a reply to a <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@serebit/110141401345257994" target="_blank">question</a> from Budgie desktop developer Campbell Jones, Richell <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141775241580126" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There wouldn't be an ODM or OEM involved in this case but some outside suppliers would make parts for us that we design. We don't have SMT machines for PCBs for instance but we do the EE work. We have laser, mills, brakes, 3D printing, paint, fastener machines and other machines and techniques in the Denver factory. There's a video on our desktops page that shows some of them. <a href="https://system76.com/desktops" target="_blank">https://system76.com/desktops</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, they'll be <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141779272995706" target="_blank">going with</a> the keyboard design from their <a href="https://system76.com/accessories/launch" target="_blank">Launch</a> keyboard too, so the Launch must have been quite popular for them to stick to the rather different layout.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments releasing May 11th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive confirmed today the Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments DLC will release on May 11th along with a major free update for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ATwJhpy_FQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4737c3f817906b7ddede7299a897f9cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ATwJhpy_FQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main highlights of the DLC include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Grand Tournaments: Host a grand demonstration of feats of arms, attracting nearby nobles and wandering knights. Choose the events, set the destination and use the tournament to improve your social standing or military prowess.</li>
<li>Grand Tours: Take a trip through your realm to take stock of your vassals, gifting them with your benevolence or extorting them for higher taxes.</li>
<li>Grand Weddings: Save your gold for an elaborate ceremony that centers the real meaning of marriage - politics. Honor your in-laws, cater to your vassals and demonstrate your power.</li>
<li>Travel System: Plan your route to these great activities, choosing safety through civilized lands or risking everything for a more direct route through dark forests or dangerous mountains. Ease your way with a large entourage that marks your importance or travel light so you can get down to business.</li>
<li>Knightly Accolades: Honor your best knights with special titles and accolades that will give bonuses to them and the armies they lead.</li>
<li>New Armor Designs: New historical armor designs from across the centuries, integrated with the new Tournament and Accolade systems.</li>
<li>New Western Clothing: New art for clothing designs will show how fashions changed and evolved in Western Europe from the time of the Carolignians to the closing of the medieval era.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Paradox have also given out some info about "Chapter II", a planned series of extra content coming which you can purchase that will include all of these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments</strong>: Join great adventures and activities. Take a tour of your realm to check in on your vassals face-to-face. Host grand tournaments to demonstrate your wealth or military prowess. Impress your friends and rivals with great royal weddings. But, no matter the activity, keep an eye out for schemes, as nothing is better than a party to cloak ill-intentions.</li>
<li><strong>Wards and Wardens</strong>: In this pack, new events add greater depth and interaction to the challenges of raising and educating children. Whether parent, tutor or warden, the personalities of the child and the adult may clash as headstrong or determined children resist the knowledge of their betters. Strong guidance, however, can lead to a lifelong bond across the generations.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy of Persia</strong>: This forthcoming addition for Crusader Kings III lets you relive the dramatic struggle for survival and empire in the lands between the Euphrates and the Indus. With special attention to the culture and history of medieval Persia, Legacy of Persia introduces new systems for Clan government rulers, and expands on the Islamic and Zoroastrian religions dominant in the region at the time.</li>
<li><strong>Elegance of the Empire</strong>: You can dress your Central European characters in the finest of finery with this clothing pack exclusive to owners of Chapter II for Crusader Kings III. Inspired by the historic regalia of the 11th century rulers Emperor Henry II and Empress Cunigunde of the Holy Roman Empire, this pack includes not only new robes and dresses, but historically appropriate crowns and other regalia.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By itself Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments costs $29.99 / £24.99 / €29.99 or you can buy Chapter II for $34.99 / £29.50 / €34.99 to get all of it.</p>
<p>You can buy Crusader Kings III from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crusader-kings-iii?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us now Unsupported on Steam Deck, bad look for Valve and Naughty Dog</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's official, Valve put The Last of Us Part 1 through Deck Verified and gave it an Unsupported status on Steam Deck. Not really a good look for either Valve or Naughty Dog.</p>
<p>Before release, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said pretty clearly on <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1601694903724953600" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that "Ellie and Joel will grace the Steam Deck… don’t worry!". However, Druckmann didn't exactly say when, so I suppose the statement isn't exactly false just yet? Worse though, is that Valve began using it in their Steam Deck clips on the official Steam Deck <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and it's even still showing it today:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12472031531680608102gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12472031531680608102gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pretty misleading isn't it? While it only shows briefly, it's a very well known scene in the game (and the TV show…), that plus Druckmann's statement together aren't great, no doubt some people pre-ordered it based on the hype surrounding it. Especially a nuisance given how specifically on Steam Deck, half the refund window was taken up by it doing the shaders.</p>
<p>Personally, I've been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/the-last-of-us-on-steam-deck-is-not-great/" target="_blank">rather disappointed</a> with the situation. It's not just the Steam Deck performance though, the game as a whole had a really rough launch on PC in a clear case of another game just being released too early. There's been quite a few bigger games launching in a state over the last year but at least they weren't being hyped up for the Steam Deck in the way this was. Hopefully both Valve and Naughty Dog will reflect on this.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog have said on <a href="https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1643025458232180737" target="_blank">Twitter</a> yesterday, April 3rd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reminder that we will have a new hotfix live for The Last of Us Part I on PC tomorrow, and a patch on Friday.</p>
<p>We will share patch notes when the hotfix is live, and let you know some of what to expect in Friday's patch ahead of its launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the follow-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And while we know many of you would like to play The Last of Us Part I on Steam Deck, we are prioritizing fixes and patches before submitting it for verification.</p>
<p>We will keep you updated of its Steam Deck status as we continue to improve the PC version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Kinda amusing their note about verification but Valve ran it through anyway…</em></p>

<p>Heroic Games Launcher has a brand new release available for helping you manage Epic Games, GOG and more on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Easily one of my favourite open source projects! It doesn't just help you deal with Epic and GOG though, since you can add anything else into it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14072729971680606812gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14072729971680606812gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main new features in Heroic version 2.7.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Auto Install UbisoftConnect when running UbisoftConnect games.</li>
<li>UI improvements on the GamePage to make it cleaner and organized.</li>
<li>Library render improvements and download GOG game images in the background.</li>
<li>Improve <code class="inline-code">pc/applegamingwiki</code> accuracy and add <code class="inline-code">gamesdb</code> info.</li>
<li>Improvements on Epic Login.</li>
<li>macOS binaries now are signed with an Apple Developer certificate.</li>
<li>Translations update.</li>
<li>Show game logs from the card's context menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerous bug fixes were also included like a fix for shortcut names, Discord integration, auto-enabling anti-cheat runtimes, properly stop all Wine processes when closing a game and more.</p>
<p>See all on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.7.0" target="_blank">release page</a>.</p>
<p>It can also be used on Windows and macOS and even <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heroic-games-launcher-vs-epic-games-launcher/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> seem to love using it, noting how they're enjoying it on Steam Deck and how it loads so much quicker than the official Epic Games app on Windows too. Nice to see many more people appreciate open source projects like this.</p>

      <title>Hell Let Loose planning Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The hardcore FPS Hell Let Loose had a 2023 roadmap reveal, and they've confirmed they're planning to add Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>It uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which has been the problem in running it currently as developers need to manually enable it for Linux / Steam Deck. Even though Valve worked with Epic Games to ensure both the newer EOS version and the older version of EAC are supported, it's not always as easy as just hitting a button and making sure things are in the right place. As we've seen from Halo MCC and others, sometimes it just doesn't work, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>At least in this case, Steam Deck support is firmly on their roadmap, which a target for September:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9451743611680600045gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9451743611680600045gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So I'll be following it along, to keep you informed on any developments there. No doubt it will use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> (not Native). September is still a while away so it gives them plenty of time for testing and figuring out any problems and gives Valve even more time to improve Proton further too.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck mention is at about 6:26:</p>

      <title>Asus announce the ROG Ally gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More companies are beginning to see there is a market for a PC gaming handheld, with Asus planning to release the ROG Ally. Initially, this seemed like an April Fools joke but it turned out to be real.</p>
<p>For the GamingOnLinux readership it might not be exactly what you're going to instantly sign up for, since it will be coming with Windows 11, but it's interesting to see more companies jump in and no doubt after a while Linux drivers will appear like they do for pretty much everything. We may even see Valve support it with their <em>eventual</em> release of SteamOS 3.</p>
<p>Coming in a bit smaller than the Steam Deck with no touchpads, it will limit what you're able to play a bit more but it will have a 16:9 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a custom AMD APU they claim is the "fastest yet", a dual-fan design and eGPU support. Asus claim it will offer double the performance on the Steam Deck but they're not giving out any tech specs or battery life details.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s5lq4Q7YAjE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e691c224fbd3dd63c8be4bd4164aed6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s5lq4Q7YAjE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Asus are a much bigger name than the likes of AYANEO, GPD and Onexplayer so they could potentially offer prices a bit lower since they're likely able to take on a bit more of the costs. Naturally though, they will still have to price it at a point where it makes enough money to be profitable to a point where it makes sense, so I still expect it to be a fair bit higher than the Steam Deck pricing since they can't make up for it by the 30% cut Valve get from Steam games.</p>
<p>LinusTT and Dave2D managed to take a look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="drLZxyv79Oo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/abc0e73469cb3db8d4d5986fe53c3846.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/drLZxyv79Oo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S9a3oAiN2ik"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/243875d4adfc1aadff50ec7a660ba827.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S9a3oAiN2ik" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They're only prototypes right now, so there's of course every chance that Asus <em>don't</em> actually end up releasing it but given how far along it is, I imagine they will. You can follow it on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus/learn-about-rog-ally/pcmcat1678398541884.c" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> if you want to be notified of when it's available, no word yet on availability in various regions.</p>
<p>Given how Valve have clearly said there's no planned Steam Deck refresh for some time, as they're waiting for it to be truly worth it, this is the closest I've been to believing it has some <em>real</em> competition. It all depends on the price.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>
