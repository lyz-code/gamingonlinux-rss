      <title>The classic Serious Sam 2 gets a big upgrade and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A blast from the past returns in style, with Serious Sam 2 from Croteam recently getting a huge 20th Annviersary Update and now it has been Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Part 1 of the update rolled out October 11th and Part 2 on October 27th. Across the updates the developer added in a load of Steam community items, they bundled the huge Renovation Mod mod into the game, gave it a big UI upgrade, improved controller support, lots of bug fixes and…it's quite a long list.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5352701931761920828gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Thanks to all the upgrades to the UI, defaults and controller support it is also now Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible for you to take on the go. And, means it should work great with Proton on Desktop Linux PCs too. Valve bumped up the default to run on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/proton-10-0-3-release-candidate-live-for-testing-better-windows-game-compatibility-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming Proton 10</a>.</p>
<p>Great to see more classic games get upgraded to work well on modern systems.</p>

      <title>Linux users have no reason to worry about recent AMD GPU driver changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a little PSA to Linux users and Linux gamers, with news reports out there about AMD shifting focus away from certain GPUs.</p>
<p>What's happening? People noticed in the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/support-articles/release-notes/RN-RAD-WIN-25-10-2.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Adrenalin Edition 25.10.2 release notes</a> how it says "New Game Support and Expanded Vulkan Extensions Support is available to Radeon™ RX 7000 and 9000 series graphics products" signaling a shift away from earlier generations like the popular Radeon RX 5000 and RX 6000 series. According to <a href="https://www.computerbase.de/news/grafikkarten/fsr-4-auf-rdna-2-vom-tisch-amd-versetzt-radeon-rx-5000-und-6000-in-den-vorruhestand.94862/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">computerbase.de</a>, they've had confirmation from AMD that the RX 5000 and RX 6000 series are indeed going into "maintenance mode".</p>
<p>The thing is - this only concerns the <em>Windows</em> driver.</p>
<p>Linux uses a very different driver system with the open source Mesa project that contains many drivers, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/amdvlk-has-been-discontinued-as-amd-are-throwing-their-full-support-behind-radv/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AMD recently discontinued their AMDVLK</a> to give their full support for Mesa's RADV. So, you don't need to worry about it if you're on Linux, as we've seen from updates to Mesa for some pretty old GPUs at times. And, with Mesa drivers being open source, anyone can pick up the torch anytime if an older driver stops being updated by the existing maintainers. Something that's not the case with closed-source drivers.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course we have Valve with SteamOS Linux with the Steam Deck using an AMD APU - it's not like Valve are going to stop all the driver upgrades any time soon either which benefits all Linux users.</p>
<p>Anyway, the recent news is nothing to worry about for Linux gamers.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Advance Wars, the new Earth vs Mars from Relic Entertainment is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A smaller team at Relic Entertainment under the Relic Labs umbrella have released Earth vs Mars, a homage to some classic strategy games like Advance Wars.</p>
<p>Quite a break from the likes of Company of Heroes / Dawn of War. Relic said their smaller teams with Relic Labs are experimenting with smaller games to get them into your hands sooner. Not really surprising, spending many years building up single games simply isn't sustainable for a lot of developers.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">This love letter to the turn-based strategy genre puts players at the helm of Earth’s forces in a desperate battle against a full-scale Martian invasion. Players must lead an unlikely group of commanders against alien saucers, grav-tanks, and elite alien warriors threatening the planet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Humanity’s secret weapon is the <em>Splice-O-Tron</em>, a device that fuses human volunteers with Earth’s creatures to create powerful hybrid super soldiers. From cheetah-fly scouts to rhino-human tanks and squirrel-cow infantry, these bizarre, but powerful, super soldiers give humanity a fighting chance. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify">As the campaign unfolds, you’ll unlock new creatures, upgrades, and commander abilities—but your enemy evolves too, unleashing horrors like “The Creep” and other mutant creations.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yNjOInCD9uM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c8988f1e8fdf63050d06b2c4d0bb667.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yNjOInCD9uM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Splice-O-Tron –</strong> Bringing some old-school Relic flavor to this genre, the Splice-O-Tron is a key mechanic in <em>Earth vs Mars</em>. Combining creatures with human “volunteers” will allow you to field an array of exciting and powerful hybrid units</li>
<li><strong>Single Player Campaign –</strong> <em>Earth vs Mars</em> will feature an expansive narrative focused campaign composed of over 30 hand-crafted missions</li>
<li><strong>Online Multiplayer –</strong> Battle against other commanders in 1vs1 multiplayer, either as the armies of Earth or as the forces of the Martian Invaders</li>
<li><strong>VS Mode –</strong> Battle against the A.I. on custom maps giving endless replayability to single-player fans</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Mode –</strong> Chase your high score in battles against the A.I.</li>
<li><strong>Map Lab – </strong>Fully featured map editor allows you to create custom maps and scenarios</li>
<li><strong>Unit Abilities –</strong> Many of the units in <em>Earth vs Mars</em> will have their own unique abilities, adding new strategies and gameplay depth to this style of game</li>
<li><strong>Commanders –</strong> There will be multiple commanders in the game, each bringing unique abilities that change the way you play</li>
<li><strong>Beautifully realized 3D world –</strong> The world of <em>Earth vs Mars</em> brings expressive units, vibrant environments, and stunning effects to players</li>
<li><strong>Fully Voiced Experience - </strong>The game is fully voiced, bringing commanders, units and story moments to life</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a campaign demo available to try before you buy. You can also follow the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/reliclabs.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>ARK: Survival Ascended gets bumped up to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARK: Survival Ascended entered Early Access in 2023, and while it worked well enough on Linux / Steam Deck - Valve noted it was Unsupported until now.</p>
<p>What is it? ARK: Survival Ascended is a remake of the original ARK: Survival Evolved with Unreal Engine 5. Form a tribe, tame &amp; breed hundreds of unique dinosaurs and primeval creatures, explore, craft, build, and fight your way to the top of the food-chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2389526161761910115gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Not long after the initial release, Valve checked it over and gave it a Steam Deck Unsupported rating noting the anti-cheat was <em>not</em> supported. The game uses BattlEye, even though it's <em>not</em> actually listed on the Steam store page (so they seem to be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">breaking Valve's own rules on that</a>). It's not entirely clear when BattlEye was actually enabled for Linux / SteamOS but it has been working for a while now and is listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>As of October 30th, Valve finally re-tested it and gave it the green Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible tick. They've also now by default set it to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/proton-10-0-3-release-candidate-live-for-testing-better-windows-game-compatibility-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming Proton 10</a>.</p>

      <title>The classic tense horror roguelike &#39;Basingstoke&#39; from Puppygames gets a big surprise upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Basingstoke (now known as Welcome to Basingstoke) is an absolute underappreciated gem from Puppygames, and now is the perfect time to jump back in. It somewhat recently had a console release, and so the developers have refreshed the PC version with a whole bunch of upgrades so perhaps it's time to give this classic a new life.</p>
<p>What is it? If you've not heard of it before - it's a tense roguelike from 2018 that mixes stealth and arcade action. You get to explore the smouldering ruins of apocalyptic Basingstoke, UK, a world of extreme peril where reanimated undead and ferocious alien monsters roam. It really is an <em>incredibly</em> tense game, and one that Puppygames previously said <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/as-puppygames-reflect-on-the-release-of-basingstoke-they-say-it-financially-ruined-them/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financially ruined them</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/336940/view/547875764461113018" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new update</a> announced adds in a big remake of the later stages of the game, along with a special new end level that actually allows you to escape with 10 completely new areas and nearly 300 new scenery items. All that plus what's in the list below (and many bug fixes) add up to an awesome sounding upgrade:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Achievements for the new levels, Horde mode... and a new extra special secret one :)</li>
<li>Added three new special Omnicorp items</li>
<li>Replaced the old Horde mode UI and added special skins for the Horde mode characters</li>
<li>Enemies would block the player hurdling if on the other side of a barrier - now the player knocks them back instead, and ninja kicks them if timed right</li>
<li>Added UI scaling option</li>
<li>Added controller shake support, and sliders for controller and camera shake</li>
<li>Added audio recording to instant replay, and options for resolution, framerate etc. (Windows only)</li>
<li>Added quick zoom control that works in the game and the map</li>
<li>Added controls to the map to find the level start, player and exit</li>
<li>Changed the map so undiscovered areas are shown as flat black rather than hidden</li>
<li>Added various tweaks to enemy spawning and behaviour based on difficulty autotuning</li>
<li>Added FRAGILE warning to melee weapons if near breaking</li>
<li>Added option to view item info in the shop and vending machines</li>
<li>Changed popup help controls – show map, show next help, or close help, depending on context</li>
<li>Added enemy models to enemy info in the encyclopedia</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The most recent trailer to show it off (for the console release) is below:</p>

      <title>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake out now and Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix have released DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake and you should be mostly good to go on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck with it.</p>
<p>Valve have stuck it with a Playable Steam Deck rating and it's SteamOS Compatible. The main issues noted being small text, plus it requires an internet connection for the first run and it doesn't default to external controllers - so you may need to use the SteamOS Quick Access menu to change the active controller.</p>
<p>Apart from that, you should be fine as everything else works with the testing being done on Proton 10.</p>
<p>Release trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Cle07k1-TWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a055ed4911cd4114853460bc4234675.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Cle07k1-TWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake combines full remakes of DRAGON QUEST I and DRAGON QUEST II, which chronologically take place after DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake which launched in November 2024. You will get to experience the conclusion to the Erdrick Trilogy in these two standalone epic adventures, with the upgraded HD-2D graphical style with never-before-seen story content and gameplay updates that includes a new, fully explorable underwater world and playable character in DRAGON QUEST II, among many other additions.</p>

      <title>Replicat is basically the classic card game snap meets Balatro - check out the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Balatro, much like Vampire Survivors, has created a bit of an indie trend and now the classic card game snap has been given the Balatro treatment in Replicat.</p>
<p>There's a demo available, built with Unity it has Native Linux support with a release currently planned for November 19th. I've given the demo a run through and think they genuinely have a great idea here. The classic card-matching memory game, but tweaked for modern generations to add a little more flavour. Since it's now a roguelike deck-builder, you get to acquire all sorts of special cards to bend and break the game resulting in some crazy combos.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14246509831761832748gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14246509831761832748gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Much like the inspiration, you go through rounds to build up a score and you need to keep hitting a higher score to continue on. Here it's definitely challenging, especially because my short-term memory is apparently awful. During your run you earn money to spend on new cards in the shop to add to your deck like cards that give you bonus moves or matching any other card. You also get to buy up special curios which allow you to tweak your whole run with bonuses like multiplying your score or money.</p>
<p>With all the ways you can change your run, it's not entirely a memory game like snap. Since you can acquire tools to reveal extra cards, keep them flipped so you can see them instead of them flipping back when you mismatch and even ways to force mismatches to work. There's a lot of ways to mess with it in your favour. Some cards will also auto-reveal their match, if you're lucky enough to pick them.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NyC-yxNeMQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/35b6f4daddaf7158c4fe3d4a39690d1e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NyC-yxNeMQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>My only concern is time. There's so many games releasing, this might suck a lot away from me because the demo is quite delicious.</p>

      <title>The brutal survival horror Darkwood is getting a sequel with Darkwood 2 from Hooded Horse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Publisher Hooded Horse recently revealed Darkwood 2 is coming from the developers of the Pathologic series. It's being made in consultation with the original Darkwood developers Acid Wizard. No release date has been set for it yet.</p>
<p>Need a refresher first? Darkwood originally released in 2017, and went onto receive an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from players on Steam (over 20,000 users rating it). It's a dark and spooky top-down mixture of exploration, action, survival and horror. Darkwood 2 is set years following the first game but it's completely standalone, so you don't need to have played the first game. With a new story, new lands to explore, new horrifying creatures to evade and it looks just as terrifying.</p>
<p>The first trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CR99LP_nays"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/74583aacebafdedf89aa418e3d04b855.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CR99LP_nays" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"The original Darkwood is a unique experience in horror -- mixing resource management and strategic survival into a rarely used top-down horror format," says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. "We’re honored to be part of the sequel, and to be working with such a great team."</p>
<p>"Crafting the world of Darkwood was a very challenging and long journey for the team," says Acid Wizard co-founder Gustaw Stachaszewski. "After an experience like that, you become emotionally attached to your work. We know that the fans have been eagerly awaiting a continuation of Darkwood. For years, the idea of handing over our baby to another studio was something unthinkable for us. But, after it became evident that working together is not viable anymore, we decided that Darkwood should live on, even if not directly through our work."</p>
<p>"We're genuinely excited to pass on the torch to Ice-Pick Lodge - creators whose work on Pathologic has inspired us for years. The team at IPL really gets what makes Darkwood a unique experience. We believe they will not only honor its spirit but will create something truly exceptional. As for us, we'll be in the background, making sure it stays true to the original vision."</p>
<p>"I believe the most interesting things are created when people with very different backgrounds work together on creative projects," says Alexander Souslov, Executive Producer on Darkwood 2. "Ice-Pick is known for its focus on narrative and on the design of semiotic systems. Hooded Horse, on the other hand, is renowned for its expertise in strategy. What kind of game could come from that? It has to be something so compelling that I’d want to play it myself. I’ve been genuinely impressed by their clear understanding of what developers face, their focus on success and mutual growth, and their dedication to long-term support for their games."</p>
<p>"Our collaboration is just beginning, but with people like this working together, I’m confident something truly special will come out of it," says Ice-Pick co-founder Ayrat Zakirov.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu getting optimisations for modern processors with architecture variants</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical announced they're working on architecture variants of Ubuntu, to hopefully result in better optimisation and performance on modern processors.</p>
<p>Posted today on the Ubuntu Discourse forum, developer Michael Hudson Doyle they note how Ubuntu has a focus on wide compatibility but there is a performance trade-off with it. So with Ubuntu 25.10, they've now added support for packages that "target specific silicon variants, meaning you can have your cake and eat it too". The first supported is amd64v3 (x86-64-v3) that should be supported on Intel Haswell / AMD Excavator and above.</p>
<p>For those wanting to squeeze every possible bit of performance out of their machines, this sounds like a nice upgrade for Canonical to be working on.</p>
<p>As Doyle said they've made changes to dpkg, apt and Launchpad to support building multiple version of packages for different levels of the x86-64 architecture. Some packages are now available on an opt-in basis for the x86-64-v3 architecture level.</p>
<p>The current aim is to have the Ubuntu 26.04 LTS release have all packages rebuilt and ready for the x84-64-v3 / amd64v3 architecture.</p>
<p>You can test it out yourself right now on an Ubuntu install. See the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/introducing-architecture-variants-amd64v3-now-available-in-ubuntu-25-10/71312" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> for details.</p>

      <title>Bazzite using Fedora 43 is out now with full Xbox Ally / Xbox Ally X support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> Linux has been upgraded with the Fedora 43 release, and it comes with many handheld gaming enhancements for those wanting to break away from Windows.</p>
<p>With this release they've added full support for the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X, although they note there's an issue with the Xbox Ally X above 80% volume they're currently trying to track down with the makers of the amplifier. So for now you'll need to keep an eye on that. Great to see support arrive though, since multiple reports (like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/807711/xbox-ally-sleep-fail-bazzite-fix-performance" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) are out there about how much better the devices run with Bazzite compared with Windows.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/52787831761829276gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's also expanded support for the Legion Go 2, although it's not <em>completely</em> finished yet as it's missing "HDR PQ" but it also adds support for the two new buttons below the d-pad. Support for the OneXPlayer X1 Air was also added but currently missing granular TDP controls. And, the weird crypto handheld SuiPlay0X1 is also now supported.</p>
<p>You also get the latest GNOME 49 and KDE Plasma 6.4 desktop environments, continued NVIDIA support for older GPUs, improvements to the Bazaar app store, Steering Wheel support and more.</p>
<p>Overall, another fantastic sounding release from the Bazzite team - easily the best way to get something like SteamOS on various different handhelds, TV PCs and more.</p>
<p>See all in the <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-fall-update-fedora-43-xbox-allies-legion-go-2-nvidia-gtx/10948" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve fix some games on Linux / Steam Deck having incorrect Steam Play settings and added a chat warning</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Beta is out for Desktop and Steam Deck / SteamOS which brings some important bug fixes, and one that was especially annoying for Linux systems.</p>
<p>When you buy a new game and install it right after purchase, sometimes it wouldn't work correctly due to some Steam Play misconfiguration. This should no longer be an issue with the Beta and eventually all Linux / SteamOS gamers when Valve put it into the main stable client. There's also a new chat warning to help protect you from suspicious activity.</p>
<p>From the main Steam client Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/567016696189026490?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>

      <title>The extraction shooter ARC Raiders is out and appears to work on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ARC Raiders from Embark Studios has released today and even though it has anti-cheat, it still appears to run just fine on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>What is it? A PvPvE extraction shooter set in a world filled with lethal machines, where humans live underground and go raiding for supplies up top. You can play it alone, or in a squad of up to three players. It's all about risk versus reward, with the loop of running around dangerous areas to find loot.</p>
<p>Much like The Finals from the same developer, ARC Raiders also has Easy Anti-Cheat but it appears they have it enabled here as well since I've had no problems jumping into it today to test it out with the release. Embark didn't reply to repeated emails from GamingOnLinux to talk about Linux and Proton, but still nice to see it working. For now, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page lists it as working</a>.</p>
<p>On my Desktop system with Kubuntu 25.10 and an AMD Radeon 6800 XT (Mesa 25.2.3) with Proton 9 it wouldn't load it at all, but swapping over the Proton version to Proton Experimental and so far I haven't encountered a single issue. Performance is good enough at 2560x1440 with all settings on Epic, with AMD FSR 3 Balanced it so far hasn't dipped below 60FPS even once and feels great overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9622143381761822906gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9622143381761822906gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20694098481761822931gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20694098481761822931gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm hoping that we don't see it constantly break on Linux with Proton like we do fairly often with The Finals, and for it to just keep working like it is now as it's quite impressive. Again, it shows Linux can be an excellent platform for gaming - as long as developers don't actively block it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11394761091761823862gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11394761091761823862gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11646250461761823866gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11646250461761823866gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it's an extraction shooter, it's very tense. Your group can encounter another group of players at any time, and as I found it in my first group session - some people will shoot first and ask questions later. Other times, people will wave and ask you not to shoot, so you all put away your weapons and slowly walk away from each other.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6262155171761824911gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6262155171761824911gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2740388781761824914gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2740388781761824914gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just other players here though, there's also all the different machines you're fighting against both on land and in the air that make it quite a rush to run through and so some looting. Weird little speedy spider things that creep me out, exploding roller balls, multiple flying machines with guns and plenty more.</p>
<p>Once you're done looting with a nice full backpack, you can extract from different locations on the map to return home to craft, trade, pick up more quests and so on. Each extraction point has a limited timer and extracting isn't always easy since other players might be stalking it, or there might machines flying around that take notice of the noise. Like what happened to my group earlier, as multiple flying NPCs were around the extraction point and downed us both. But here's where it's not too punishing, you can <em>still</em> crawl and activate the extraction. Which I thought was a nice touch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699970831761825547gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699970831761825547gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Downed by not out, we managed to extract in the above picture. Phew.</em></p>
<p>However, I wouldn't be doing my full duty here though if I didn't point out the generative AI message on Steam, which the developers put up that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the developer has confirmed multiple times elsewhere that this type of AI is only used for text to speech for voice barks like "go over here" or to point out items in the world using the same text-to-speech system as in The Finals. For this they hired actual voice actors too as noted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-doesnt-ai-generate-guns-from-youtube-videos-embark-clarifies-thats-a-research-project-and-not-something-that-were-using-in-the-game-now" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">RPS</a>.</p>
<p>There's also numerous in-game purchases, plenty of which are not particularly cheap for the customization.</p>
<p>The game has only just begun life, and I've only just begun exploring it, so likely more to come on this one from me. Hopefully not a report on the anti-cheat suddenly being blocked but we'll see.</p>
<p>Right now, Fanatical has it with 14% off.</p>

      <title>Minecraft Java modding is about to get a lot easier and more interesting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang announced a big change is coming to Minecraft: Java Edition, one that could make it a whole lot easier to make mods and perhaps make them more exciting.</p>
<p>While Minecraft has a long history of modding and there's some truly massive mods out there, the game has been using obfuscation to make it more difficult to pick it apart. Something that is quite normal in the software industry as one tool in the box to protect games. But, that's now going to change as they're completely removing the obfuscation!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16727030411761757023gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a long time, Java Edition has used obfuscation (hiding parts of the code) – a common practice in the gaming industry. Now we’re changing how we ship Minecraft: Java Edition to remove obfuscation completely. We hope that, with this change, we can pave a future for Minecraft: Java Edition where it’s easier to create, update, and debug mods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When? Quite soon actually. They said the first snapshot after the full Mounts of Mayhem launch will no longer obfuscate the code.</p>
<p>It will take time for modders to catch up with the changes, since everything will be so open now and a lot of tools were built with the obfuscation in mind but it will make it massively easier in the long-run.</p>
<p>This is a genuinely great move. I'm excited to see what happens next for modders.</p>
<p>However, the cynic in me says this suggests that it's a step towards Mojang eventually retiring Minecraft Java and going all-in on the modern Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (which doesn't have Linux support). Hope I am wrong on that though, but having two entirely separate versions is likely not something the higher ups at Microsoft want to continue forever.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another bigger release has arrived on GOG with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle now available for fans of the DRM-free store. The game was originally released in December 2024.</p>
<p>Along with the launch it's also 20% off until November 5th at 2PM UTC.</p>
<p>More about it: "Uncover one of history’s greatest mysteries in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a first-person, single-player adventure set between the events of Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade. The year is 1937, sinister forces are scouring the globe for the secret to an ancient power connected to the Great Circle, and only one person can stop them - Indiana Jones. You’ll become the legendary archaeologist in this cinematic action-adventure game from MachineGames, the award-winning studio behind the recent Wolfenstein series, and executive produced by Hall of Fame game designer Todd Howard."</p>

      <title>Escape From Duckov is silly, entertaining and worth grabbing if you don&#39;t mind the grind</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A single-player extraction shooter with ducks? Escape From Duckov is quite silly, but it works and most importantly it's entertaining to play. Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p>What is it? It's a top-down extraction shooter featuring silly-looking cartoony ducks. Even the world you're on is shaped like an egg, which is slowly falling apart. You customize a duck, and then set out to try and escape the planet by eventually crafting a rocket. It has a mixture of action, exploration and crafting / base-building.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1968659261761746894gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1968659261761746894gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The name is of course a play on Escape from Tarkov, and so you could be forgiven if you thought this was some sort of parody but the reality is they're barely anything alike aside from the very basic extraction idea where you have to exit the map. This is a much more casual game (but still challenging), and single-player. A lot closer to ZERO Sievert than Tarkov, but more chilled.</p>
<p>The idea is to provide an extraction shooter that's a bit more suitable to a wider audience, with a friendlier theme and I think it's a full success on that. Giving you a world to explore and uncover the secrets, with combat that's fun and a little challenging but the game doesn't feel like it punishes you for being a little bit <em>crap</em>.</p>
<p>Customization is almost as much fun as the game itself, allowing you to make the stupidest looking quacker you can imagine. Just look at my beast:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12498375481761745249gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12498375481761745249gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the addition of base-building, along with needing to find blueprints out in the world to expand what you can build, it gives you plenty to work towards that results in quite a satisfying loop to run around.</p>
<p>The shooting is one of the most important bits of course, this is a top-down shooter at the core of it. And, thankfully, the shooting is actually good, not incredible, but good enough that it will keep you on your toes. The action will often make you scramble so you don't get turned into a meal. The feeling of trying to sneak around, and hearing a quack as you're spotted and suddenly the rush comes in as you don't want to lose all that valuable loot is ace. Especially nice with all the different types of melee and ranged weapons, along with tiers of them and tiers of ammo. There's a lot of content to explore, find and unlock as you go through it.</p>
<p>Like the level system with you gaining XP as you do various tasks, which allows you to boost your little duck with all sorts of goodies. They all come at a cost, but there's a lot there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13567682661761747152gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13567682661761747152gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And, since it's an extraction shooter - you may be familiar with the mechanic of having a special pocket to keep at least something safe. Here you have that, in the form of a little companion that runs around with you. Good, because it's not without frustrations, the most annoying being losing items or just trying to find what you need and seeing your progress halted as you attempt to get it back. But, it does well on the risk versus reward system here to keep you wanting to push further. It is a complete <em>grind</em>, one that can at times feel quite a bit annoying.</p>
<p>It's nice that it's <em>not</em> just an aimless runaround too, since there's a dedicated quest system to give you a sense of progression and actively guide you through the game. This is <em>not</em> just a do whatever you want exploration and crafting game though, that progression very much gates everything. You need to go through a series of tasks, to be able to actually get anywhere and experience the different maps.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm only scratching the surface a bit on what to tell you about it. There's lots of features that all add together. A day and night cycle for example, where it's more difficult to explore at night but you can skip it by sleeping. When hit you can bleed, which can become a frantic race to get some bandages on, which is especially heart-racing due to the fog of war system while you're exploring. You don't know what's going to be around the corner, and enemies appearing when coming into view did startle me quite a lot at times when I wasn't ready for it.</p>
<p>While the base game has plenty to keep you going for multiple tens of hours, it's the community side of it that has really helped it flourish. The developers actively support modding and playing it your way by adding in new weapons, custom maps, quests and whatever else the community can come up with.</p>
<p>One thing that does let it down is the lack of controller support. This would have been great to kick back and relax with, and I do generally feel more comfortable with this sort top-down shooter with a controller. So hopefully that's something they can eventually work in. Especially so, as it would make a great Steam Deck game too then. And given the controls, I can't imagine it would be too difficult to do with a few UI tweaks. We've seen far more complicated games have full controller support.</p>
<p>This all would have worked just fine without all the ducks, but it's clear the silliness of the ducks that has helped it sell so well. It's a nice hook to pull people in, making it a little different to the crowd. Impressively, the game has sold multiple millions since the October 16th release. As of October 28th, they announced it crossed over 2 million. That's some seriously amazing numbers.</p>
<p>Overall, if you love the structure of roguelikes with a bit of base-building and like the idea of extraction shooters this should be an easy choice for you to pick up.</p>
<p>Works great on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) with Proton 9. A flawless experience as far as I can tell.</p>

      <title>The follow-up to one of the best escape room puzzle games, Escape Simulator 2 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pine Studio have released Escape Simulator 2, the follow-up to their first smash-hit escape room puzzle game and it looks fantastic. No Native Linux support this time, although it does have direct Steam Deck support as they confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/escape-simulator-2-to-be-steam-deck-optimised-for-proton-on-linux-releases-in-october/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when covered here on GamingOnLinux previously</a> they're ensuring it works with Proton for Linux gamers.</p>
<p>Compared with the first game, a lot is new and improved. Still built with Unity, but they overhauled a lot and expanded it for the sequel with 12 brand new escape rooms they said are "larger and more detailed than before" with around 50 minutes playtime per room. There's also a new shared hub lobby for you and friends, a new autosave system, drop-in multiplayer support, and a big upgrade to the room editor too because the first game lived on the community with a lot of extras being made for it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yFQHAeeX0RY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d971d96d489cbdfac37630e6c836aca9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yFQHAeeX0RY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why a sequel? </strong>A sequel gives us a fresh start and lets us push the limits of the genre further. We were inspired to explore darker escape room themes and experiment with new gameplay and puzzle ideas. Splitting from the original game let us focus on improving key features like rendering, networking, physics, and animations.</p>
<p><strong>Will Escape Simulator still get updates? </strong>Yes! With the recent Mayan DLC and more content on the way, we’ll continue supporting the original game while expanding its reach to new platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Is it scary? </strong>While <em>Escape Simulator 2</em> is darker and has a more mysterious vibe, it’s not a horror game. The game also doesn’t feature any jump scares or gore.</p>

      <title>As Amazon cut thousands of jobs, New World: Aeternum will see no more updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon recently <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> pretty heavy job cuts, and it seems they're pulling back on video game funding with New World: Aeternum no longer being supported. In the Amazon announcement they noted "an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles". Ouch.</p>
<p>Why? They don't actually say exactly why in the announcement, but of course it's AI-related:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="contentContainer block">
<div class="contentItem-role-text">
<div class="text">Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well. Across our businesses, we're delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming with this news we had the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063730/view/498336168563182229" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> that New World: Aeternum is having the plug pulled on it. The game will receive no more updates, but previous updates for existing owners have been made free. Amazon said the servers will remain online in 2026, but they aren't going into any specifics on exactly how long the game will be online. Eventually of course, they will no doubt completely shut it down. It's only a matter of time before another game is just lost.</p>
<p>Why? They said "After four years of steady content updates and a major new console release, we've reached a point where it is no longer sustainable to continue supporting the game with new content updates". Which is surprising, considering through October it saw quite a big resurgence in players. But even before that, it was still seeing peaks on Steam of over 10,000 per day — but for the likes of Amazon, clearly that's not enough.</p>
<p>While the FAQ in the announcement noted you should still be able to grab the game to play it, the Steam page has no current way to do so. The area where it would have a buy button or an add to account button for free games is just entirely blank now as shown below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7020882221761739956gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A full staff memo from Steve Boom, VP of audio, Twitch, and games was shared on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, which notes "we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team".</p>
<p>Amazon only just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-relaunched-with-prime-gaming-merged-in-and-a-new-ai-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did a refresh of Amazon Luna</a>, their cloud gaming service which now has more of a focus on party games and a weird Snoop Dog AI game.</p>

      <title>Brotato gets a juicy free update out now - along with new Linux and macOS support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/evil-empire-dead-cells-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-take-over-brotato-with-a-plan-for-more-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Evil Empire now in control of the future of Brotato</a>, the first free content update under their wing is out now and it really sounds great.</p>
<p>The appropriately named New Dawn Update brings only a little bit of new content like 6 new items and 1 weapon, with the focus on quality of life features to improve the game. Like the ban system, that allows you to ban up to 8 items from the shop that you don't want to see appear during a run, but you have to unlock it by beating Danger 3 or higher. There's also now a save profiles system, so you can have 3 separate saved games. And, since there's a lot of items and you can get a bit overloaded with info, there's now also a codex to read through and potentially plan ahead a bit.</p>
<p>Oh, and Native Linux and macOS support also landed too! Turns out they were already planned, Evil Empire just finished them off and got the versions released.</p>
<p>More was added like various tweaks to animations, the UI and so on.</p>

      <title>The big Crusader Kings III: All Under Heaven expansion is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Crusader Kings III: All Under Heaven expansion has released and to much surprise, it seems finally Paradox are back on form with players loving it.</p>
<p>After a string of misses recently from Paradox, with the last two DLC releases for CK3 missing the mark and plenty not happy with Stellaris DLC either - it's nice to see something actually go well. Especially nice, as next to Stellaris this is actually one of my favourites from Paradox.</p>
<p>Key features of the expansion include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>China: The Mandate of Heaven –</strong> Achieve the highest tier of power with the <em>Hegemony </em>title, navigate the <em>Dyanastic Cycle</em>, explore the <em>Celestial </em>government system, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Japan: Rise of the Shogunate –</strong> Forge your destiny and rise through the courtly system to become a mighty Shogun or Kapaku regent, lead the Imperial Yamato house to restore power to the Emperor, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Southeast Asia: God-Kings and Temple Empires – </strong>Rule as a <em>Devaraja </em>with the Mandala Government and perform <em>Tributary Missions</em> to increase favor with subjects.</li>
<li><strong>Explore the Silk Road, new Starting Bookmarks, and Historical Flavor </strong>– Thrive alongside the expansive <em>Silk Road</em>, bring fresh perspectives with additional historical bookmarks, and immerse yourself in the historical nuances of Asia with throne rooms, events, and traditions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3ol_1hioedA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/88032c26efc50fec00ebb959837b9082.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3ol_1hioedA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On Steam, it quickly gained a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>The 1.18.0 free update also arrived with the DLC expansion, which includes a lot as well. Too much to include here which you can read on their <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/all-under-heaven-release-schedule-changelog.1864262/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>
<p>However, looking around, unfortunately it seems the Linux version has been left in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1158310/discussions/1/601919346587239966/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a bit of a state</a>. It's also problematic with Vulkan on Windows too, so seems something with their Vulkan rendering has been broken with this DLC release. Hopefully we'll see a quick patch to solve whatever is going on there.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors just keeps on giving with a free Balatro DLC, online co-op and more free content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors just dropped a massive content update that includes a free Balatro crossover DLC, online co-op is live and more added. Just when you think you're done, they pull you back in for another bunch of hours. <em>Please won't somebody think of my free time.</em></p>
<p>The Balatro crossover includes 4 new characters, 4 new weapons and evolutions, a new music track and the special Ante Chamber: "Enter the Ante Chamber, an extradimensional analogue of Balatro's user interface. Battle buffoonish foes on a facsimile of Jimbo's home turf accompanied by a new ally, the Outer Saboteur, a silly little sidekick that steals your coins to throw them at enemies".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gB0begpTOdQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2942154a2eb457e2f6bcaf55d793fc81.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gB0begpTOdQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not enough for you?</p>
<p>Okay, well there's also online co-op now available for everyone. That, and the 1.14 update which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A gamba themed stage: Westwoods</li>
<li>A labyrinth themed stage: Mazerella</li>
<li>A new relic that lets you play Party Mode (play with up to 4 characters at the same time)</li>
<li>2 new playable characters</li>
<li>2 new weapons with their respective evolutions</li>
<li>1 new Character Morph</li>
<li>1 new PowerUp</li>
<li>3 new Darkanas</li>
<li>Survarot game mechanic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are Survarots?</strong><br/>
Survarots are a new form of power creep that is currently usable by the character Secretino and all the Ante Chamber characters. They are vaguely similar to Arcana cards, but are themed after characters from Vampire Survivors and provide different types of bonuses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But wait, there's actually <em>more</em>. The Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania expansion also had an upgrade to bring 16 new secret characters, 3 new weapons, 13 new weapon unions, 1 new adventure and 12 new music tracks.</p>
<p>Oh, also the board game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/152730994/vampire-survivors-the-board-game" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter is now live</a> too.</p>
<p>They've said the next update will likely now be in Q1 2026. With a focus on "QOL improvements to better manage the avalanche of available content and the late-game on-screen chaos, performance improvements for less powerful platforms, save slots (finally), and of course a bit more content".</p>

      <title>The excellent city-builder Timberborn is approaching the 1.0 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Timberborn is a city-builder full of beavers, in a world where humans are long gone. It's properly great, and now it's finally about to hit the big 1.0. I absolutely loved it when I initially covered it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/goodbye-free-time-i-have-discovered-timberborn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here on GamingOnLinux back in July 2023</a> (wow, time really flies).</p>
<p>Over 4 years in Early Access is about to come to an end, and you can even try the 1.0 yourself as it's available in a Steam Beta. It's not quite finished with only some of the new features for the 1.0 added like multiple new map objects, such as Water Seeps and Unstable Cores, as well as two fresh maps, Spiral Stairs, customizable Banners and duplication tools along with reworking modding to make it easier.</p>
<p>There's even a few visual tweaks and animation upgrades to make the whole game look quite a bit better. On top of that there's even more like improved loading times, improved performance, upgrades to the UI and so on.</p>
<p>Check out the video below on it:</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-24 brings fixes for Space Engineers, Blade &amp; Soul NEO</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again, yet another hotfix release for the GE-Proton compatibility layer for running more Windows games on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Following quickly on from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/ge-proton-10-23-released-with-fixes-for-killer-instinct-heroes-of-newerth-reborn-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-23 a day ago</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/ge-proton-10-22-released-with-a-fix-for-game-launchers-persona-5-strikers-and-richard-burns-rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-22 the day before</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/ge-proton-10-21-brings-fixes-for-blue-protocol-black-desert-battle-net-ubisoft-connect/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-21 little over a week ago</a>. Seems the tradition continues with hotfixes, since GE-Proton has no quality assurance testing on it which Valve's official Proton does and so issues appear often in new releases. You generally only need it for very specific games as it's best to stick with Valve's official Proton.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 43 has officially arrived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora Linux 43 has arrived for Fedora Workstation, Fedora KDE and other assorted flavours that use Fedora have also seen various upgrades.</p>
<p>There's a lot of the usual background upgrades bumping up the versions of various software included, but plenty of user-facing improvements too. Across different spins of Fedora, you should now see their newer Anaconda WebUI installer for example. GNOME in Fedora is also now Wayland-only coming in with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/gnome-49-released-with-new-video-player-document-viewer-improved-app-store-and-disabled-x11-session/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 49 with all the goodies</a> that gives you like a new video player, an improved GNOME Software app store and much more.</p>
<p>On the KDE side you get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/kde-plasma-6-4-brings-improvements-for-accessibility-colour-rendering-tablet-support-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Plasma 6.4</a> which also has a whole lot new like per-workspace tiling options, accessibility upgrades, drawing tablet improvements and lots more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7950894951761662138gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Fedora Linux KDE 43 screenshot" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7950894951761662138gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fedora Linux KDE 43</em></p>
<p>One major background change is the swap over to RPM 6 for packages. This should be transparent to users, but comes with many benefits to security. And, starting with this release the installer will no longer support installing Fedora on disks that use Master Boot Record (MBR) while in UEFI boot mode on 32-bit x86 systems, it will instead enforce the use of the modern GUID Partition Table (GPT). This only affects new installs. Another seemingly small change, but one needed, is that the /boot partition has been bumped up to 2 GiB due to increasing sizes of everything like firmware, initramfs and more.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/release-notes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>. And various blog post <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcements</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed it recently, we also had the news about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/fedora-linux-project-agrees-to-allow-ai-assisted-contributions-with-a-new-policy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora officially allowing AI-assisted contributions</a>. Which, going by all the comments and quotes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamingonlinux.com/post/3m3u3bad3tx2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">on our Bluesky post</a>, has not been received well at all.</p>

      <title>Time to run as Death by Scrolling from Ron Gilbert / Terrible Toybox is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death by Scrolling is a rather unique twist on some of the ideas from survivor-like bullet hells, from Ron Gilbert / Terrible Toybox and MicroProse Software.</p>
<p>MicroProse didn't reply to our key request, so I had to pick up a personal copy for this one. Glad I did, as I've been having a lot of fun dying repeatedly as death eventually catches up to us all. This game gives us a whole new meaning to doom scrolling. Instead of endlessly swiping on social media or the news, you can doom scroll a little pixel character up the screen away from the grim reaper and all sorts of critters out to get you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12909778101761660851gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The idea here is that you're in purgatory. And of course, capitalism cannot be escaped even in death. You have to run to earn your afterlife, to gather enough gold to be allowed to pay the ferryman to cross over the river. They sure do want a <em>lot</em> of gold though, and gathering that gold has you running through a gauntlet of increasingly difficult biomes filled with all sorts of traps and creatures in your way.</p>
<p>The setup is simple, you just keep on running and have an additional button so you can briefly sprint. While you run you grab gold to build up towards crossing the river and gems to buy some meta-upgrades like additional health, faster projectiles, damage reduction and more. There's various weapon cards to pick up which auto-fire when you're near enemies, and various character buffs but you can only have a few cards in total.</p>
<p>It's all the limits that make this one a bit challenging. Your cards can only be used a certain amount of times or steps until you need to run across the screen to grab another card. Starting off really easy, the later levels pack in some pretty brutal enemy types along with more cramped lanes to run through that really keep you on your toes. Not just that, but the impending doom of the fire at the bottom of the screen while it scrolls, and then the grim reaper starts chasing you too. And of course, the reaper cannot be killed unlike the other creatures in your way, only temporarily stopped.</p>
<p>After you manage to reach the end of each level, you also get to pick a random bonus out of three choices that will stick through this one single run too. Like better odds of gems appearing, more gold, better critical hit chance and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8lz3_H_hahc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3aec9d9ed0572d02e1d7b11a59b9bc76.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8lz3_H_hahc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Varied Cast of Characters:</strong> Select from multiple playable characters, each offering distinct abilities and perks to suit your playstyle.</li>
<li><strong>Vertically Scrolling Mayhem:</strong> Constant upward movement means no time to rest—let the fiery bottom of the screen catch you, and it’s game over.</li>
<li><strong>Relentless Pursuit:</strong> The Reaper is always close by—stun, dodge, and outmaneuver, but never kill him!</li>
<li><strong>Loot &amp; Progression:</strong> Collect gold and precious gems to unlock upgrades, power-ups, and abilities from quirky vendors.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus Runs &amp; Side Quests:</strong> Discover extra challenges and side quests at the top of each level for extra rewards.</li>
<li><strong>Monster Mash:</strong> Battle quirky underworld creatures, from hellish pests to demonic bosses, all in a wild vertical sprint.</li>
<li><strong>Quirky Lore &amp; Humor:</strong> A tongue-in-cheek take on afterlife bureaucracy, with cheeky dialogues and playful narration.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> See how your purgatorial performance stacks up against other trapped souls.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In my time spent running I've been blown apart by bombs, sliced in half by the reaper, shot at by cowboys, feet that went through spikes and numerous other dumb ways to die. The Native Linux version has been working perfectly on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) too so that's great.</p>
<p>Overall, it's properly unique endless-scroller style rogue-like that's worth grabbing.</p>

      <title>The new survival game VEIN looks awesome with intelligent AI and interactions with nearly everything</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just released into Early Access with Native Linux support, VEIN could be the next big survival game with a whole lot of features that just look and sound great. It may not be all that impressive graphically compared to some other survival games, with a rather flat-looking style to it, but it seems the list of features and general world interactivity make up for it.</p>
<p>You know the drill when it comes to this though - the world ended, it's a zombie apocalypse. It's been done over and over again. Where it actually sounds interesting is everything else. The environment is dynamic and changes with the seasons along with "long-scale" random events. There's also some intelligent AI they say that can "see, hear, feel, and smell you, and react intelligently to those senses".</p>
<p>Additionally there's a lot of character customization, nearly everything is usable in some way down to simple things like knocking on doors and turning on taps. Then you get into the building systems where you can build up a safehouse, you need to go hunting and till the land for crops and there's even vehicles too. So far, it seems like it has everything to make it quite a hit.</p>

<p>There's even a demo available that has some limits on it so you can at least try before you buy.</p>

      <title>A wildlife DLC has been teased for Two Point Museum</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It wasn't enough that Two Point Museum <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/two-point-museum-meets-vampire-survivors-in-the-latest-crossover/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently had a Vampire Survivors crossover</a>, it's now getting a new DLC that's a bit on the wild side. How wild? Well, the DLC will be "dedicated entirely to the wonders of wildlife".</p>
<p>Not much is actually known about it right now, other than the very brief teaser we've been shown with a promise of "more information about the release date and gameplay details will be shared soon" and that "Wildlife Experts will be called upon to rescue, heal, raise, and re-wild an incredible variety of creatures, while expanding your museum in exciting and unexpected ways".</p>
<p>It's due to arrive sometime this "Winter".</p>
<p>You can see the brief teaser below:</p>

      <title>Civilization VII set for a big change to allow you to play as one civ continuously</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games have heard your cries, and so Civilization VII is getting an update at some point to let you play as one civ continuously through the Ages.</p>
<p>So, you know, like you would actually expect from a Civilization game instead of the incredibly divisive ages system that transforms your civ into something else as you progress. It was always an odd move for Civilization VII, as they tried to mix up the gameplay with competition from the likes of Humankind and other 4x games.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/511846967442147918" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the devs talked about some major changes including "dramatic changes to the Legacy Paths and Victories" that will "open up the game and provide many new paths your empire can follow while achieving greatness and competing for victory". The bigger one has "been one of the most requested features from players - we're internally playtesting ways to play as one civ continuously through the Ages, allowing you to choose a civilization from any Age and guide them throughout your journey through history".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7114300111761646974gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Civilization VII</em></p>
<p>Also announced with the upcoming version 1.3.0 is a new "Tides of Power" content collection, which will be free from November 4th until January 5th, 2026. This will contain a new leader, two new civilizations and more to come.</p>
<p>On top of all that the Naval Update will come with version 1.3.0 on November 3rd which includes a new ship, a new building, new resources and terrain types, naval combat upgrades and lots more.</p>

      <title>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection releases soon from Digital Eclipse and Atari and ahead of release Valve have given it the green tick to be Steam Deck Verified. </p>
<p>So, it <em>should</em> be click and play without problems on Valve's handheld and other Linux systems. According to Valve's rating though, the game does not default to external controllers so you need to swap the order in the SteamOS Quick Access menu. Apart from that, it should be smooth. Valve's rating was tested with Proton 10.</p>
<p>Fans of the classics might be interested in this release with multiple games, online play with rollback netcode, along with a full interactive documentary which actually sounds quite interesting for a little look behind the game dev curtain.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a8Hb7DMRnvY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fd4589bf924297e8f1e796a79f8039ee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a8Hb7DMRnvY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Multiple  Iconic Editions - </strong>Experience the legendary origins of Mortal Kombat with the iconic arcade classics along with well loved home versions and rare, fan-favorite releases.</p>
<p><strong>Online Play - </strong>Engage in online battles enhanced by rollback netcode— engineered to preserve the precision of every attack, even with players across vast distances.</p>
<p><strong>No More Secrets - </strong>At the touch of a button, unlock all secret characters, change game settings, and access the buried developer menus to play the games your way. </p>
<p><strong>Interactive Documentary - </strong>Deep behind-the-scenes content chronicles the history of the franchise, featuring exclusive new interviews with original MK developers Ed Boon, John Tobias, Dan Forden, John Vogel, and dozens more.</p>
<p><strong>The Full Story - </strong>Detailed character histories and timelines trace the epic narrative of Earthrealm, Outworld, and Edenia through the arcade era.</p>

      <title>Ghost of Tsushima gets Steam Deck Verified as the devs push the multiplayer into a DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's certainly one way to get around the Steam Deck rating system isn't it. Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT now has the online play split off into DLC. Coming with update 8, the game has now been bumped up to Steam Deck Verified by Valve too with Proton 10.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215430/view/535490865486891911" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers noted they split online play into a free DLC, along with improving the interface on Steam Deck and adding a Steam Deck graphics preset too. Plus some other fixes at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12435349871761645274gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The problem with Ghost of Tsushima isn't the PSN login, but its use of the PlayStation Overlay, which for some reason just doesn't work with the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux systems. It's not entirely clear why and no word from Valve on what's the hold up there either. I think this shows that Valve also <em>need</em> ratings for DLC, not just for the base game, since quite a lot of games have huge expansions DLC that may not run the same as the original game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima (singleplayer) is now Steam Deck verified.</li>
<li>Online Multiplayer Legends Mode is now a separate DLC on Steam*.</li>
<li>Various user interface optimizations for Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Added a Steam Deck graphics preset.</li>
<li>Resolved an audio bug that occurred for some players during the Eternal Blue Sky mission.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to Steam Input.</li>
<li>Updated AMD FSR to version 3.1.4</li>
<li>When enabling AMD FSR 4 in the driver, the game now also displays this version in the menu and launcher.</li>
<li>Various performance optimizations and stability improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* A PlayStation Network Account is required for Legends mode</em></p>

<p>Another new build of GE-Proton is here to improve compatibility for Windows games on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. Pretty much as is tradition at this point, a hotfix follows a release since GE-Proton has no quality assurance testing on it which Valve's official Proton does.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.17 Beta disables wake-on-bluetooth for Steam Deck LCD again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that wake-on-bluetooth for the Steam Deck LCD model is quite problematic, as Valve have again disabled it in the latest SteamOS update. This is in the Beta channel so you need to be in the Preview / Beta via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.7.17 Beta: The Blues changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily re-disabled experimental wake-on-bluetooth support for Steam Deck LCD while issues with spurious wake-ups are investigated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could prevent updating from specific older builds of SteamOS.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with the Discover app in desktop mode that could cause update failures in some scenarios.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the demo for Turnbound, a clever haunted boardgame inventory battler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turnbound looks like it could be a really good one, a PvP inventory management auto-battler that does things quite differently to others in the genre. It also has a demo available you can try out right now, and the game will be coming to Early Access sometime soon.</p>
<p>Like other inventory battlers, it's all about what you stick in your bag and building up combos. However, it sets itself apart in a big way. Instead of your combined inventory battling your opponents, you battle all the individual tiles from the items in the bag. Really think the idea, setting and style of this are fantastic.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8OKXNyU13Jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f89ab1ccddbf5ba645a907f2024a9263.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8OKXNyU13Jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Of the Early Access release, Designers Tom and Donald said, “We have seen creators refer to us as ‘Indie Hearthstone Battlegrounds’ - that is a big goal and one we aspire to live up to.” “Because of all the possible combinations and builds, games like this turn out best if they are community driven. Being in Early Access gives us the opportunity to start involving players early.”</p>
<p>It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> and has Native Linux support. You can also follow the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/1tkgames.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt to fully shut down in April 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to say goodbye completely to another game, as Sharkmob AB have announced the full shutdown is coming for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodhunt.</p>
<p>A battle royale game that originally launched back in 2022 after Early Access in 2021, it never really fully hit the mark. It lost most of the players in the space of two months after the full release, which is pretty striking when looking back on it on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/760160/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://bloodhunt.com/en-us/news/bloodhunt-servers-will-close-on-april-28-2026" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they've confirmed the servers are being closed on the 28th of April, 2026. They've also just closed up in-game purchases with the closing announcement. From the developers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Bloodhunt Community,</p>
<p>When we first opened the streets of Prague to you, we could only hope that the nights you spent there would create the memories they did. From the battles fought on the rooftops to the friendships made in the chaos, Bloodhunt has lived through you in countless unforgettable ways.</p>
<p>During these past 4 years, we have been thrilled to see your passion and dedication to Bloodhunt. Your feedback, creativity, and enthusiasm for our game has meant the world to us. However, despite you, our amazing community, the current player population has reached a level where keeping the servers running is no longer sustainable.</p>
<p>This has led us to make the difficult decision to take Bloodhunt offline.</p>
<p>The sun is now going to rise over Prague. We will be taking down the Bloodhunt servers on the 28th of April 2026, after which the game will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6910324721761569700gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It may not have been as popular as some other multiplayer games, but it really is a shame to see all the developer effort now go completely to waste. No option of player-run servers, once again just a game that is going to end up as nothing more than a memory. A kick in the nuts for game preservation and history.</p>

      <title>The huge TimeSplitters Rewind fan project launches in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TimeSplitters Rewind is a massive upcoming fan project that pretty much remakes the original trilogy of TimeSplitters games and it finally has a release date. <em>It will be completely free since they don't own the IP.</em></p>
<p>A new website for it has been launched, which has a very brief teaser trailer and going by the countdown it will launch officially on November 23rd. Here's more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="space-y-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
<p>TimeSplitters Rewind is a fan project that serves as a greatest hits collection of maps, modes, leagues, challenges and story content across the original trilogy of TimeSplitters games.</p>
<p>Rewind is not a traditional remake in that there aren't 3 separate executables, it is one game that, as closely as possible, captures the spirit of the 3 games in one. So, unlike a traditional HD collection or remake, it is its own title. By the end of this game's development, the goal is to have extensive content spanning the three games but our initial launch will focus on a subset of both existing content from the original games and some new content.</p>
<p>Across the past decade, nearly 200 hundred contributors have committed hours to this project, ranging from a few hours to thousands of hours of development time, some hobbyists and others AAA game developers. This is the largest amount of free content ever provided in a video game (without monetized elements) and it was not easy to make.</p>
<p>We made this game from pure passion and an interest in seeing more TimeSplitters content. Feel free to read the full project history below!</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>According to their latest info, the are setting the Steam Deck with Proton as the minimum specifications required to run the game. Nice to see, so it should run well across a variety of systems. </p>
<p>Latest teaser from the website is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wtWQ3cp5foI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/29905e1b8feb6961c1cde23fde668f0f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wtWQ3cp5foI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">At launch it will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>28 Maps.</li>
<li>Online and Offline Story Mode.</li>
<li>50 Arcade Leagues.</li>
<li>32 Challenges.</li>
<li>91 Characters.</li>
<li>41 Weapons.</li>
<li>20 Arcade Game Modes.</li>
<li>New Game Mode - Team Elimination.</li>
<li>Updated Game Mode - Last Stand.</li>
<li>Online and Offline Arcade w/Bots.</li>
<li>10 Players Online.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, the original developer of the series Free Radical Design was closed by Embracer Group back in 2023. This will likely be the closest we'll get to a new game in a long time.</p>

      <title>MISERY is a new rogue-lite Stalker-like co-op survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A rogue-lite Stalker-like to play with friends designed to look like a game from retro consoles? You can sign me up for some MISERY right now. Set in a post-apocalyptic exclusion zone you have to scavenge abandoned locations, survive deadly anomalies and mutants, and try to survive another day in solo or with friends (5 players total).</p>
<p>While not based on Stalker directly, the inspiration is pretty darn clear. In fact, there was already a Stalker mod called Misery but they don't actually seem to be directly related.</p>
<p>How it works: you wake up in the basement of some sort of fallout bunker, and as you try to leave for the first time a siren goes off because a nuclear bomb is coming. The next 60 seconds become a mad-dash to collect a bunch of items to help you survive the rest of the game. Once ready and you extract before the 60 seconds are up, the real survival then begins as you enter into a rather spooky looking procedurally generated world full of anomalies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18358689321761567939gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18358689321761567939gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This loop is quite interesting, although much like classic Stalker it's pretty brutal on the difficulty. The rogue-lite loop here does seem quite clever though, as you repeatedly go scavenging to craft new and improved items or go speak to some traders and then back you go for some more exploration. And as time goes on, you build up your shelter into something more useful too.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see a whole lot more from this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BLMcHh2-cDQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b6256220d3d9f073b7889a1cf5bb542a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BLMcHh2-cDQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable. In my testing, it worked just fine on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.10) with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>The useful AI warning for Steam script has been turned into a proper browser extension</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/want-to-avoid-ai-gen-on-steam-this-browser-userscript-might-save-your-day/page=2/#comments" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux highlighted a useful browser script</a> to give you a better warning for games on Steam using AI, and now it's even easier to use.</p>
<p>To save you clicking around: instead of the generative AI message being buried at the bottom of a Steam page, it gives you a big warning box to ensure you cannot miss it. It doesn't stop you doing anything, just ensures you're properly aware. Much better. And now, it has been turned into a full browser extension for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ai-warning-for-steam/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ai-warning-for-steam/clegcobheppnnigaaeelfkeomjcngmnh?pli=1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Chrome</a> so you don't need to mess with userscripts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1364128541761565950gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - an example of it in action, using the Firefox plugin.</em></p>
<p>I really do love this. It has been saving me a lot of time recently on skipping over games that use generative AI. Something I try my best not to cover, since there's absolutely tons of games releasing all the time without it.</p>
<p>Full source code is still up on the <a href="https://github.com/seeeeew/aiwarningforsteam?tab=readme-ov-file" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>You can grab 911 Operator for free to keep on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A free game to start your week? Wonderful. 911 Operator from Jutsu Games is currently free to claim and keep on Steam. Always nice to be able to build up your Steam account.</p>
<p>Why is it being given away free? It's part of the Games Operators publisher sale, so it's a good way for them to get more eyes on everything, and if you like 911 Operator they have a few DLC you can grab as extras too. Jutsu Games also recently launched a major update for their latest game Infection Free Zone.</p>
<p>More about it: "In 911 OPERATOR, you take on the role of an emergency dispatcher, who has to rapidly deal with the incoming reports. Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity. Keep in mind, that the person on the other side of the line might turn out to be a dying daughter’s father, an unpredictable terrorist, or just a prankster. Can you handle all of this?"</p>

<p>It's free until October 29th. It's rated Platinum on ProtonDB.</p>

      <title>GOG asking for more donations from gamers with the new GOG Patrons program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it hasn't been properly publicly announced yet, GOG Patrons is a new system launched by GOG to hopefully pull in more people to donate. This isn't the first time GOG have asked for people to donate, as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/gog-now-ask-for-donations-when-you-buy-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in June</a> they added a donation form to the checkout page but this goes one step further.</p>
<p>The main point of the GOG Patrons program appears to be directly supporting their game preservations efforts as part of the official GOG Preservation Program. Not to paywall anything on the GOG store, just as an additional way to support GOG directly.</p>
<p>It seems a lot like a built-in form of Patreon, and anyone who has used Patreon (<a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">like ours</a>) will be familiar with the idea. You pay a small amount each month to something / someone you like, and potentially get rewards for your support. In the case of GOG they say you get access to an exclusive Discord, voting on Preservation Program priorities, credit for your support on game store pages and behind the scenes content.</p>
<p>GOG have so far only sent an email out to some customers to let them know about it, as it's currently in "Early Access" according to GOG staff. As <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/gog_patrons_thoughts/post5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on the GOG forum from staffer "king_kunat":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey hey, everyone! :D Just wanted to quickly jump in and shed a bit of light on the topic:<br/>
<br/>
We’ve indeed launched the GOG Patrons program today in its early access phase. Long story short, it’s a new way for players who care about game preservation to directly support our ongoing work. And as we’ve mentioned (and will keep repeating everywhere): it’s not a game subscription or a paywall and everything you’ve ever bought on GOG remains fully yours, forever.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is simple: Patrons help fund our efforts to keep classic games alive by restoring, maintaining, and improving them. In return, they get access to an exclusive Discord community, behind-the-scenes content, and small recognition perks across GOG, just as Shanuca mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
The initial response has been positive, and we’re already learning a lot from the feedback we’ve received. This early phase helps us fine-tune the program before it opens more broadly, ensuring it truly meets our community’s expectations and reflects GOG’s values. We'll update you more and more as we go and make the program public.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this clears things up a bit!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn't give any guarantees that your support will actually lead to anything, as that would be impossible to do, it all depends on what rights holders they can convince or track down to actually let GOG revive their games.</p>

      <title>Halo: Campaign Evolved announced for release in 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft / Xbox Games Studios revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will be releasing sometime in 2026 and it will have a Steam release too. As long as there's no major annoyances from Microsoft here, it should hopefully run well enough on Linux based systems using Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>Coming from Halo Studios, the original is being remade in Unreal Engine 5. It will be coming with "stunning new 4K visuals, updated animations, remastered music, and re-recorded voice lines". Plus we're getting treated to weapons and vehicles from later games in the series, and three new bonus prequel campaign missions. We also get up to 4 player online co-op with cross-play, but split-screen is once again console-only.</p>
<p>See the main trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efThjRym-ks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0a0ae828c5dbcaf12d015bab34b7636f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efThjRym-ks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And additionally 13 minutes more gameplay:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hSjbIM0iegY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d990ddb7784e174601e05f4ed463ffbf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hSjbIM0iegY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So how many times has this Halo been released now? We had the original on Xbox, then Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo PC, Halo: The Master Chief Collection and now Halo: Campaign Evolved. Did I miss any?</p>

      <title>Cronos: The New Dawn now has a demo available on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you were interested in Cronos: The New Dawn but weren't sold on picking it up yet, you can now try the demo that's recently released. The demo actually released earlier this week, but Steam only just today sent me a notification to say it's available. Bit of a delay there.</p>
<p>More about it: Cronos: The New Dawn is a brutal third-person survival horror where you fight for the future by salvaging the past. Burn monsters before they merge. Extract souls from the living. Adapt or die.</p>
<p>Unlike the full version, there's only a Windows build of the Cronos: The New Dawn demo. It doesn't have a Native Linux version for it, but it <em>does</em> have one for the full game which was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/bloober-team-announce-a-native-steam-deck-release-for-cronos-the-new-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released to improved it on the Steam Deck</a>. The developer, <br/>
Bloober Team, never did reply to GamingOnLinux when we asked what improvements they actually put in for the Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="muJlwDnk9Dk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee96a02b969ea2f489283b255c1c7ad5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/muJlwDnk9Dk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see demos make such a big comeback over the last few years, which we partly have Valve to thank for all the Steam Next Fest events that really bring attention to trying out games before buying them. Hopefully we'll see this continue, especially with the absolute onslaught of games being recently constantly — developers need more ways to hook players in and a demo is a good way.</p>
<p>The demo for Cronos: The New Dawn gives you the first ~30-40 minutes of the game and saves transfer to the full package.</p>

      <title>From former Telltale Games veterans, Dispatch is out and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While only two episodes are currently live with the rest to follow soon, Dispatch from former Telltale Games veterans has arrived. All of the episodes are due to be out by November 12th which is an interesting way to do a release, to build up hype as more people discover it and play through it and talk about it. You're <em>supposed</em> to think of it more like a TV series in that way.</p>
<p>It's a star-stacked game too with voices from the likes of Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad), Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part II), Erin Yvette (The Wolf Among Us), Jeffrey Wright (Westworld), Travis Willingham (The Legend of Vox Machina), Alanah Pearce (Cyberpunk 2077), Matthew Mercer (Critical Role), MoistCr1TiKaL, Jacksepticeye, Lance Cantstopolis, Joel Haver, and THOT SQUAD, a wild mix of actors, comedians, and creators from across games and entertainment.</p>
<p>Don't go into this expecting a traditional Telltale-like experience though, it's <em>very</em> different.</p>

<p>"We built Dispatch to be something people can play, watch, and talk about together," said Nick Herman, Creative Director and co-founder at AdHoc Studio. "Some of our favorite gaming moments come from comparing choices with friends, and we hope this series sparks those same kinds of conversations."</p>
<p>Since it's based on episodes, and most aren't out yet, you can't properly review something like this just yet. So keep that in mind. But here's a few thoughts anyway…</p>
<p>Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified and it works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9. I've played through on Kubuntu 25.10 and haven't encountered a single problem. I'm genuinely <em>extremely</em> happy that thanks to all the work Valve puts into Proton, that we can experience episodic stuff like this from the day of release. Makes me think back to a good few years ago when this would have been near impossible without fiddling with Wine directly which often got messy.</p>
<p>I know some people probably have superhero fatigue, but not me. I'll soak up anything I can related to it. And what great timing, with Gen V Season 2 just finishing and now I get to play Dispatch. It's interesting for another two reasons: the first because you didn't have any powers to begin with. You were originally a hero in Dispatch but more like a Temu version of Iron Man in a mecha before it gets ruined whereas now you're one of the suits managing everyone which makes it quite a different experience; and also that you're not dealing directly with standard hero types, you're actually managing a team of misfits basically, a bunch of ex-supervillains going through rehabilitation to try and improve.</p>
<p>I especially liked the amount of options it has for accessibility. Subtitles with sizing and background and the option to add character names to each subtitle, the choice to have quick time events be cinematic (so events just happen) or be interactive, some effects can be disabled, nudity can be removed, there's colour blind modes and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16752649081761317718gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16752649081761317718gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What you get is a mixture of two rather different games. An interactive movie-like experience, blended with a choice-based management sim. In between all the animations, you'll be doing the actual work as a dispatching agent, choosing what heroes to send to each situation. Each of them have their own strengths and weaknesses, and you have to match them up to each problem as best you can. It also sprinkles in little mini-events, where you make more choices on how to handle each situation. I failed a few bits here and there, but it is easy enough to understand and thanks to all the chatter from the heroes, it keeps it really engaging. Still, it's quite odd to jump from full animations into a top-down management sim.</p>
<p>Showing off how your decisions stacked up against other players at the end of an episode was a nice touch too.</p>
<p>Going by what I've played so far, it's quite brilliant. Very much enjoying the writing, some quality moments in there really helped the the top-notch voice over making it thoroughly interesting to play. The animation is great too, reminds me a little of Invincible but perhaps actually even a little better. I could have happily just sat back and watched this, but the interactive elements help you feel like a part of it.</p>
<p>Seems like it will be relatively short overall though, with the first episode by itself only taking about an hour.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">We'll see the next episodes land:</p>
<ul>
<li>October 29th - Episodes 3 and 4</li>
<li>November 5th - Episodes 5 and 6</li>
<li>November 12th - Episodes 7 and 8</li>

      <title>Spin to fight and win in Roulette Hero, a rather unique strategic roguelike deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Combining elements of Slay the Spire and Luck be a Landlord, the roguelike deck-builder Roulette Hero is out now and it will likely spin your hours away. <em>Note: a key was sent to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Here you pick a character and face off against various different types of enemies in turn-based battles. However, it's often based on a fair amount of luck and just a little skill. The board is basically a fancy roulette wheel covered in various animals and coins, with each animal having a different effect on the enemy. As you pull the lever, the cost to do so will increase until you need to end your turn where the enemy will attack and reset the cost to pull the lever. It's a proper cleverly designed game, one that really does hook you in like a cat with sharp claws.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6670144661761311020gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6670144661761311020gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Each time you end the turn not only does the enemy attack, but the board evolves too with new animals added to it. As at the start of a run, most of the board is covered in rocks. The deck-building comes in here, as you have a shop to spend some of your coins to upgrade or swap the animals around. When you defeat an enemy, the game progresses onto the next but the board stays with you for you to keep upgrading.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you win a battle, you'll also get to pick a cartridge that acts as a special upgrade for your character and run by giving you various buffs. You get things like a boost to max HP, gaining shields when you get coins, a chance to get an additional spin and all sorts.</p>
<p>The enemies do get steadily more difficult to overcome the longer you go through a run, which is where a bit of skill from the player really comes in. It's about making the most of every spin across every turn, to not blow through all of your coins too quickly. Making use of upgrading animals from the shop, and the fun over-powered combos that can happen. The first spin on a turn is always free though, so even if you run out of coins, it's not instantly the end.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CnTq9nkvj6g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47e8e6473e966d46ce2f665724dd0c49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CnTq9nkvj6g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And in true deck-builder style, as you plan and win or lose you'll unlock more content to add into future runs.</p>
<p>The game works perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9. No issues encountered at all. It might even be a new favourite of mine and so I think it's well worth picking up if you like the sound of it. A true genuine delight of a game, an expected gem.</p>
<p>For £8.50 you can't go wrong with it.</p>

      <title>Stress testing and benchmarking tool OCCT gets an essential Linux fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OCCT is a popular tool for stress-testing and benchmarking your system that recently had a Linux release, and now as of the latest update it should work better.</p>
<p>The developers recently released a major new version of the tool (v15) which came with big new features like storage stability testing for HDDs and SSDs, improved Linux support, a UI skins system and many other improvements. It came with a problem for some Linux users though, where it stopped working. With the update OCCT 15.0.4 noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This important update fixes a very tough issue where OCCT, when launched from Steam under Linux, would refuse to start. The compatibility layer of Steam was at fault.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the reports and patience ! We're sorry it took us a few days to fix, it was not an easy one.<br/>
<br/>
Changelog :</p>
<ul>
<li>Main : Fixed : OCCT would refuse to start on Steam+Linux due to a failure in enumerating storage devices.</li>
<li>Ui : Fixed : The waiting dialog had an ugly border around the background</li>
<li>Benchmark : Fixed : Upload would never stop when doing it without a license</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Roman city-builder Nova Roma from the devs of Kingdoms &amp; Castles arrives in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Lion Shield who created the rather great Kingdoms &amp; Castles, their next game Nova Roma has been confirmed for Early Access release on January 22, 2026. It's actually a spiritual successor to Kingdoms &amp; Castles with some similar systems at play.</p>
<p>More about it: As the once-great Roman Empire falls into decadence and decay, players will lead a small band of citizens in search of new lands, hoping to build Nova Roma (New Rome) – a bastion for all that was once good in the Empire. Starting from a humble village, appease the gods with grand temples, sate the citizens' many needs, and build a society that will be the envy of the world for millennia to come.</p>
<p>You'll be dealing with dynamic weather, water manipulation, divine intervention, and the ever-looming threat of barbarians and vengeful Emperors in this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P0Is5zmKugs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70e01b993611d77fb4d660935c01e0ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P0Is5zmKugs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nova Roma will be localized from English into German, French, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Turkish, Ukrainian, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.</p>

      <title>Award-winning gothic horror narrative adventure Scarlet Hollow gets a release date for Episode 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just in time for Valentine's Day next year, Scarlet Hollow will expand with the fifth episode the day before on Friday the 13th but the story isn't over yet. There's still another two episodes to go for it to leave Early Access but they work well as standalone episodes.</p>
<p>Scarlet Hollow has Native Linux support, it's Steam Deck Verified and it has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. It genuinely is one of the nest visual novel styled narrative horror adventures ever. There's a demo available which is the first episode for you to try.</p>
<p>More about it: Enter the fifth episode after last chapter's harrowing end, and cling to sanity throughout the onslaught of unpredictable scenarios rooted in the choices made in previous episodes. Experience more than 870,000 words of branching storytelling from award-winning writer and developer Tony Howard-Arias and compelling new illustrations from award-winning artist Abby Howard, the married duo behind 2023’s critically acclaimed bestseller Slay the Princess.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LwZ9wlVV42U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b93a63ac8e6635e7b5b6031231f9a41.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LwZ9wlVV42U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“This is far from the end, but that doesn’t mean Scarlet Hollow is ‘unfinished’ necessarily,” says Tony Howard-Arias, co-founder of Black Tabby Games. “Each chapter has its own self-contained story, even as each of them slot into a bigger overarching narrative. For us, Scarlet Hollow has always felt like a seven-game series where you get to carry your choices forward into each new installment. And if you don’t believe me, Episode 1 is free. You can always see where it takes you.”</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A heavily branching narrative where your decisions (actually) matter</strong>. The relationships you forge and the decisions you make will dramatically alter your journey.</li>
<li><strong>A complex paranormal mystery</strong>. Investigate haunted houses, strange sightings in the woods, a deteriorating mine, and more as you try and piece together what happened in Scarlet Hollow.</li>
<li><strong>Trait-based dialogue and role-playing.</strong> Scarlet Hollow's dialogue system is driven by role-playing elements that let you choose who you want to be. Are you quiet and observant? Hot and clueless? <strong><em>Can you talk to animals</em></strong>? 21 different character builds change how you interact with the world and how your story unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>A dynamic relationship system that reacts to your every choice and changes how your story unfolds.</strong> People won't just like or dislike you. Become friendly rivals, bitter adversaries, best friends, or mild acquaintances with everyone in town based on how you approach the story.</li>
<li><strong>Original monster designs </strong>inspired by Appalachian myths and cryptids<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>No jumpscares.</strong> All of the horror in Scarlet Hollow comes from dread, tension, and a sprinkle of disturbing imagery.</li>
<li><strong>A touch of romance.</strong> Whether you're into goths, dads, moms, paranormal investigators, mysterious recluses, or <strong>actual monsters</strong>, you'll find something waiting for you here. And if you'd rather avoid that entirely, your story won't be any less for it.</li>
<li><strong>Hundreds of meticulously hand-drawn and traditionally inked backgrounds.</strong> Every background in the game is hand drawn and inked by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.</li>
<li><strong>Fully immersive art.</strong> Each major character has dozens—and often hundreds—of hand-drawn sprites that interact with backgrounds and capture a full range of lighting, emotion, environment, and outfit changes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will perform better on AMD GPUs with Mesa 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 26 is due for release early next year, and it appears that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is one game that's set to benefit greatly from it.</p>
<p>With any current version of Mesa paired with an AMD GPU in the game, you might see various parts of it get some pretty heavy lag and stuttering. You can see some chatter on it and a video example in a Mesa <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13901" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a>, with the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13901#note_3113558" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video example</a> showing the issue quite clearly.</p>
<p>One of Valve's developers, Samuel Pitoiset, who works on Mesa and other things mentioned they "wrote a new allocator for descriptor sets and it is way faster". The user who opened the original bug report tried the Mesa patch and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13901#note_3150859" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> how "What can I say other than wow.... the stutter is basically gone now". That code has already been <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/37976" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merged</a> in and going by a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13901#note_3156197" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">comment</a> from Pitoiset it will debut with Mesa 26 due in January 2026.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18942626221761299790gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Nice to see another performance issue on Linux with AMD GPUs being solved. This might affect other games too if they do similar things but for now Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is the main one confirmed to see a boost.</p>

      <title>Grab a short free horror experience with the new release of Days Without Incident</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>First built in 2017 it never saw a release until now, Days Without Incident is a free short horror game that looks worth a go. Playable from start to finish in a single evening, you've got nothing to lose but you might need some spare pants.</p>
<p>More about it — Days Without Incident was first built in 2017, during the years when We Create Stuff were transitioning from experimental modders with the successful Nightmare House: The Original Mod for Half Life 2, to full-fledged developers. Days Without Incident never saw release (until now) but, the ideas and mechanics later inspired psychological storytelling horror, In Sound Mind which released on the 28th of September 2021. They decided to clean it up and release it as a free gift to the indie horror community.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks really great, giving classic Disney vibes but in a black and white first-person shooter and now we have a confirmed release date. It was going to release this year, but it's been moved to March 19th, 2026.</p>
<p>More about it: "MOUSE: P.I. For Hire is an action-packed first-person shooter that draws inspiration from the classic cartoons of the 1930s. Its black and white rubber hose visuals are drawn by hand, frame by frame, delivering a striking vintage aesthetic.

For Hire offers a unique mix of explosive FPS action and hand-drawn rubber hose animation. Stepping into the shoes of Private Investigator Jack Pepper - played by the inimitable Troy Baker - will be an experience that players will not forget!”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Black and white, hand-drawn rubber hose animation, inspired by cartoons of the 1930s.</li>

      <title>Amazon Luna cloud gaming relaunched, with Prime Gaming merged in and a new AI game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon have today relaunched <a href="https://luna.amazon.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon Luna</a>, their cloud gaming service and it also merges in Prime Gaming with the monthly game giveaways too.</p>
<p><a href="http://gaming.amazon.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a> is no longer a standalone separate thing, as going to Prime Gaming is now just a page to claim games on the Amazon Luna website directly. Still the same process as before though. If you're an Amazon Prime member, you still get the standalone game keys each month to redeem across various stores. Clearly though, Amazon are trying desperately to funnel more people into the Luna service with this move.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1618403911761226160gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Along with the refresh, they've also launched GameNight. Their new set of social games where you can use your phone as your controller. This features games like Angry Birds Flock Party, Tetris Effect: Connected Party Edition, The Jackbox Party Pack 9, Ticket to Ride, Ultimate Chicken Horse and an <em>AI</em> powered game named Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>Everything needs AI now! As the Courtroom Chaos page notes: "Snoop Dogg lends his voice, looks, and personality to the generative AI bench to hear your testimony, ask questions, try the case and render the verdict". However, Amazon are clearly betting this AI game will pull people in, as it only gives you a limited amount of cases per day but you can <em>pay</em> for more. How generous of Amazon.</p>
<p>That's on top of all the regular cloud gaming with Alien: Isolation, Dave the Diver, Skyrim, Fallout 4, Fallout New Vegas, Fortnite, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege X and more playable in the browser (they support Chrome on Linux).</p>
<p>Luna cloud gaming is supported across U.S., UK, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Portugal, Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>

      <title>Krafton (PUBG, Subnautica, inZOI) becoming an &#34;AI-First&#34; company</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Krafton, the publisher of the likes of: PUBG, Subnautica, inZOI and Dinkum, have just put out a press release talking about a major investment into AI.</p>
<p>Currently, the news post is only in Korean and features a lot of corpo-suit speech but running it through Google translate (it may be a little rough), gives a good idea of what's going on at least.</p>
<p>Their CEO, Kim Chang-han, said they're transforming into an "AI-first" company which involves establishing "an AI First Culture". Beginning today, they're planning to roll out an "AI-centric management system centered on Agentic AI" for "automating tasks while allowing employees to focus on creative activities and complex problem-solving". Chang-han believes this will allow them to "leap forward as a company that fosters employee growth and expands the scope of organizational challenges through AI".</p>
<p>One part of the plan is to invest around "KRW 100 billion" on a GPU cluster that will "support multi-stage tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning, serving as the foundation for accelerating the implementation of Agentic AI" that will help them with "AI workflow automation, strengthen AI R&amp;D, and in-game AI services" and so on.</p>
<p>Another part of it starting in 2026 is that they're going to allocate around "KRW 30 billion annually" to support their employees to directly use AI tools with their work. This includes generally expanding the scope of how AI is used across the company to " apply AI throughout its entire management and decision-making processes".</p>
<p>The original post in Korean can be seen on their <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press post</a>.</p>
<p>Not really a surprise for Krafton given they've been bullish about AI for a while now, while using it directly in inZOI for various things and the newer AI companions for PUBG too. So prepare for a lot more AI generation in games coming from Krafton as a publisher and from developers under their wing.</p>
<p>Just as a reminder too, Krafton own the Last Epoch devs <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/last-epoch-devs-eleventh-hour-games-have-been-acquired-by-krafton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eleventh Hour Games</a> and were the ones that saved <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-lives-again-with-krafton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tango Gameworks</a>. I have to wonder how their teams now feel, along with everyone else working for Krafton as it seems they'll be required to use AI more and more from now.</p>

      <title>PAYDAY 2 is going to live again with a new team and new updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While PAYDAY 3 continues to do rather poorly, PAYDAY 2 is coming back to life to refresh it with some upgrades.</p>
<p>Not really a surprise when you look at PAYDAY 3, which currently has a Mixed overall rating on Steam and since it's a multiplayer game it only sees a peak of a few hundred players each day which has been trending in a downwards spiral recently. While PAYDAY 2 continues to see tens of thousands each day despite being over 10 years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10220112281761217005gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>In an announcement on Steam posted on Tuesday, Starbreeze said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello heisters,<br/>
<br/>
<strong>We’re excited to announce that we’re partnering with Sidetrack Games to support the PC-versions of PAYDAY 2 with quality-of-life improvements and general game fixes.</strong></p>
<p>Sidetrack (formerly known as the M.U.G. Team) is a talented team with deep roots in the PAYDAY modding community. Their work on <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/414740/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">RAID: World War II</a> showed that they have the skill and perseverance to deliver quality updates over a long time. <strong>They know the PAYDAY 2 engine inside and out, and they’ve already gotten started.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first update goes live this Thursday, October 23,</strong> and is focused on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience.</p>
<p>Collaborating with Sidetrack Games allows <strong><a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/starbreeze?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Starbreeze</a> to maintain full focus on <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PAYDAY 3</a></strong>, while <a class="Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PAYDAY 2</a> continues to deliver value for all players with the dedicated, expert support they deserve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a pretty old Native Linux port, which I'm not personally up to speed if it works well nowadays or not. So you may be better with Proton, it always was a little buggy anyway. Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible with Proton.</p>

      <title>MicroProse reveal Dungeon Holdem a mixture of poker and dungeon crawling that looks ace</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MicroProse just announced they're publishing Dungeon Holdem a fusion of poker, dungeon crawling, and deckbuilding RPG mechanics and it really looks ace.</p>
<p>Yet another game that looks distinctly like it was inspired by Balatro, but I'm certainly not complaining. The setup and gameplay of this will no doubt be sucking away many hours from me. You'll need to master the rules of poker to win, but naturally you can do all sorts of funny things to chain stuff together for some awesome combos to bend the rules. As you go through a run you'll also get to unlock various abilities across two different characters, with hundreds of unique skills to build up your deck.</p>
<p>Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HmbXHQZ8tBI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8cb10846d65cce43cedeb9d53e3f79ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HmbXHQZ8tBI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>MicroProse said: "Blending the tension of a poker table with the thrill of a dungeon crawler, Dungeon Holdem captures MicroProse's legacy of games built on tactics, ingenuity, and risk management".</p>
<p>No release date or even mention of a demo yet so stay tuned. Loving the style of it though.</p>

      <title>Embark Studios confirm rollout of Denuvo Anti-Cheat for THE FINALS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a major midseason update out today, Embark Studios have given an update on their anti-cheat plans as more tools are being added to it. The game <em>should</em> still fully work on Linux / SteamOS platforms (like Steam Deck), as they've said multiple times before they won't be doing anything in THE FINALS to specifically block Linux.</p>
<p>They confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/the-finals-gets-a-huge-upgrade-for-season-8-plus-anti-cheat-changes-confirmed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously</a> that Denuvo Anti-Cheat was in their plans, but the actual rollout of it as an additional tool has now begun which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2073850/view/523105966512669165" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a> should be finished by the end of next week. They said "Denuvo AntiCheat turned out to be a perfect complement to our existing tools. Rollout will start with this release, and complete by the end of next week", so we assume this will be in addition to Easy Anti-Cheat that it already has. We're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting both on our anti-cheat page</a> to be sure for now.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WnVSxdaT40U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3400c76d4ed2cdb50904942aa803c802.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WnVSxdaT40U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Along with the anti-cheat update, THE FINALS also has a whole new free-for-all Halloween event that sounds pretty fun:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did you hear that? That’s your cue to run!</p>
<p>In<strong> GHOUL RUSH</strong>, everyone starts off as a Survivor in this brand new, limited-time, Free-For-All mode. Get eliminated even once, and you’ll be doomed to spend the rest of the round as a Ghoul, hunting down the remaining unturned Contestants! Each match lasts for three intense rounds, so you'll have time to switch your tactics and seek revenge!</p>
<p>Earn cash as a Survivor by eliminating Ghouls and other survivors, by staying alive for as long as you can, or by making it to the end of the round as the last surviving Contestant! Once you’re a Ghoul, earn cash by eliminating Survivors.</p>
<p>Enter the foggy and frightening ALFA-ACTA P.E.A.C.E. Center for this event and take a fixed loadout with you, depending on your choice of Heavy or Medium Build. Once you’re a Ghoul, you’ll need to either rely on your Sledgehammer or your trusty Dagger and, of course, what’s left of your wits!</p>
<p><strong>Can you survive the Ghoul Rush?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to their next game, ARC Raiders, which releases on October 30th — Embark and their press teams have not replied to multiple emails from GamingOnLinux to confirm if the release will have the anti-cheat enabled for Linux. We go with the thought that just because one game from them works, it does not mean the next will (since anti-cheat is such a problem for Linux gamers). Also, just because previous playtests for ARC Raiders worked, doesn't necessarily mean the release will when everything is online. We've emailed <em>again</em> today to see if they finally want to talk.</p>

Today, the Into the Unjust: 4.1.0 update landed and along with a whole bunch of general balancing changes to make it a bit more fun, there's a <em>lot</em> of bug fixing and optimization going on. Arrowhead devs said they've "overhauled how we approach patching to better target the pain points you’ve shared with us" which means "more focus on stability, balance, and the issues that affect your experience the most".</p>

Thankfully it's one game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with anti-cheat</a> that works well on Linux.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux project agrees to allow AI-assisted contributions with a new policy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AI generation, it's everywhere! And now it's going to be formally accepted into Fedora Linux, as per the latest approved change with a new policy.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/council-policy-proposal-policy-on-ai-assisted-contributions/165092/242" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> came on the Fedora discussion board from Aoife Moloney that notes "the Fedora Council has approved the latest version of the AI-Assisted Contributions policy formally". The post <a href="https://pagure.io/Fedora-Council/tickets/issue/542#comment-990415" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">links to</a> what will be the final version of the policy and it seems at least reasonable, with whoever contributing the code being required to be fully transparent on what AI tool has been used for it.</p>
<p>Copied below is the approved policy wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fedora AI-Assisted Contributions Policy<br/>
You MAY use AI assistance for contributing to Fedora, as long as you follow the principles described below.</p>
<p>Accountability: You MUST take the responsibility for your contribution: Contributing to Fedora means vouching for the quality, license compliance, and utility of your submission. All contributions, whether from a human author or assisted by large language models (LLMs) or other generative AI tools, must meet the project’s standards for inclusion. The contributor is always the author and is fully accountable for the entirety of these contributions.</p>
<p>Transparency: You MUST disclose the use of AI tools when the significant part of the contribution is taken from a tool without changes. You SHOULD disclose the other uses of AI tools, where it might be useful. Routine use of assistive tools for correcting grammar and spelling, or for clarifying language, does not require disclosure.</p>
<p>Information about the use of AI tools will help us evaluate their impact, build new best practices and adjust existing processes.</p>
<p>Disclosures are made where authorship is normally indicated. For contributions tracked in git, the recommended method is an Assisted-by: commit message trailer. For other contributions, disclosure may include document preambles, design file metadata, or translation notes.</p>
<p>Examples:<br/>
Assisted-by: generic LLM chatbot<br/>
Assisted-by: ChatGPTv5</p>
<p>Contribution &amp; Community Evaluation: AI tools may be used to assist human reviewers by providing analysis and suggestions. You MUST NOT use AI as the sole or final arbiter in making a substantive or subjective judgment on a contribution, nor may it be used to evaluate a person’s standing within the community (e.g., for funding, leadership roles, or Code of Conduct matters). This does not prohibit the use of automated tooling for objective technical validation, such as CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, or spam filtering. The final accountability for accepting a contribution, even if implemented by an automated system, always rests with the human contributor who authorizes the action.</p>
<p>Large scale initiatives: The policy doesn’t cover the large scale initiatives which may significantly change the ways the project operates or lead to exponential growth in contributions in some parts of the project. Such initiatives need to be discussed separately with the Fedora Council.</p>
<p>Concerns about possible policy violations should be reported via private tickets to Fedora Council.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also follows a recent <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/37233" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">change</a> to the Mesa graphics drivers contributor <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/submittingpatches.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">guidelines</a>, with a note about AI as well. Discussions on whether Mesa will actually allow AI contributions seem to still be ongoing though.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>The Jackbox Party Pack 11 has arrived with a whole new set of games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For your next little gathering, The Jackbox Party Pack 11 is available now bringing with it five completely new original games to laugh with your pals. And once again, you can play the pack on nearly everything. With Native Linux support, it also works across various other devices.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The games included in this one are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Legends of Trivia – A co-op twist on classic trivia, where you work together to conquer challenges and defeat devious monsters with the power of knowledge.</li>
<li>Suspectives – A detective-themed social deduction game where players work together to uncover the secret criminal hiding among them.</li>
<li>Doominate – A chaotic twist on joke-writing games where you take turns destroying each other’s wholesome ideas, all in the name of comedy.</li>
<li>Hear Say - Players record their own lines and sound effects for bizarre, unseen video clips using just their phones and the group votes for the funniest and most fitting soundscape.</li>
<li>Cookie Haus - Fulfil cookie design orders for unusual clientele in Jackbox's coziest drawing game yet!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The most recent trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a8IwlJvXhgk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac0eeb997062a908c11c2eda8f68114f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a8IwlJvXhgk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With this being the first pack in some time that actually has properly original games, hopefully the release goes well for them. Especially as the previous pack had what appears to be the worst overall Steam user rating in the series, so it would be good to see them back on top form for party game fans.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Magic &amp; Cards will give poker the roguelike deck-builder treatment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo coming on November 5th, Heroes of Magic &amp; Cards is another interesting spin on deck-builders that blends in poker mechanics for something different. <em>Turn-based card-battling fans will probably enjoy this one!</em></p>
<p>Not directly a poker game, simply taking elements from the classic like we've seen other games do. Take down enemies with powerful cards to enable you to hit them with pairs and straights, along with various combo attacks to unleash various elemental effect along with having special class-based abilities that all together should mix things up nicely.</p>
<p>Have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="k_YhoULB4O0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f72d429179de4f307030e6503c483163.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/k_YhoULB4O0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Poker is intrinsically fun and deeply complex. It's great for deckbuilder games, but it’s underused” Co-Founder of First Day Entertainment, Stephen Gou,  says. We wanted to fill that gap so we made Heroes of Magic &amp; Cards."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Poker Roguelike Power. Build your perfect deck as you traverse the world, ensuring that by the time you fight the next boss, every draw is a guaranteed powerhouse! Crush your opponents with straights and pairs!</li>
<li>Customize Your Plan of Attack! Every run offers a different assortment of enchantments and relics through a series of random encounters. Make the most of what you find, putting together your strategy one shift at a time. Will you focus on healing? Changing your card values to maximize your combos? Will you just aim for raw damage? Every find has its uses!</li>
<li>Choose Your Class! Each class has its own unique abilities to push the flow of combat even further! Powers like Chain Lightning, Hell Fire, and Shield Burst completely change the flow of combat and set you up for devastating finishers on the most powerful bosses!</li>
</ul>

      <title>RV There Yet? is the latest co-op hit on Steam with plans to get it Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More silly co-op games to play with friends? Yes please. RV There Yet? looks like it could be a fun time and they're working on getting it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What is it? You and your buddies are on your way home from a relaxing vacation but are forced to take an alternate route. Get your RV through the back country and find the exit to Route 65. A co-op adventure about driving your recreational vehicle home.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H7mXFwVNX6Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8f80827754a4d210cfc2640603382fb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H7mXFwVNX6Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems it has been more of a hit than expected too. Originally made for a game jam, they turned it into a Steam release and ended up amassing over 300,000 wishlists. At launch yesterday, it managed to get over 30,000 people playing it at the same time, pretty impressive for another small developer.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3949040/view/541119816328546392" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they noted some things they're currently focusing on:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Keybindings</li>
<li>Full Controller Support</li>
<li>Steam Deck Verified </li>
<li>In-game localization</li>
<li>Auto-activation VOIP Mode</li>
<li>Achievements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Could end up being a great one to play with friends alongside the likes of PEAK, R.E.P.O and other more recent online co-op games. And, since I play a big mixture between my Desktop Linux PC and Steam Deck depending on where I am and how I feel, more games that run well on both is a big plus for me and no doubt many others.</p>
<p>Going by the Steam user reviews players are loving it, but it's a little bit unstable. So I'll be taking a proper look after a patch or two.</p>

      <title>Cult of the Lamb becomes a bit more of a farming sim with the new Woolhaven DLC trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few days ago we got a fresh look at the ranching system in the upcoming Cult of the Lamb DLC Woolhaven, and I really can't wait to jump back into it. We're still not being given a date for when it will arrive though, other than sometime early next year.</p>
<p>Cult of the Lamb is truly an <em>excellent</em> game with such a magnificent style to it. Although I did find the combat quite difficult, especially one particular annoying boss that kicked my ass so many times I lost count. But, it's the Cult side of things I think I actually enjoyed the most out of it. Building up your little village, getting everyone to do my bidding and dealing with all the issues that arise. Still, the mixture of culting and combat is great together but it was clearly ripe for expanding.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Woolhaven DLC will give you a whole lot more to do as highlighted in the recent ranching overview trailer and this has made me really excited for it. Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JziX-60OyCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dedcaa90a8921b644543481dd017fdd8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JziX-60OyCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">DLC highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Return the lost souls of Woolhaven to their spiritual home and learn the long-forgotten history of lambkind. Rebuild the fallen town to its former glory and reclaim the mountain to restore the depleted power of Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs. But beware: there is always a price to be paid.</li>
<li>Endure harsh weather, including blizzards and freezing temperatures, that threaten your Cult’s survival. Build new structures to keep your loyal followers warm and protect them from frostbite and famine.</li>
<li>Unlock ranching at your Cult base and breed rare animals that provide wool, warmth, and when times are particularly desperate, precious meat. Tame, ride, and let your followers take care of these majestic creatures.</li>
<li>Venture into a new realm battered by bitter storms, crawling with creatures corrupted with the Rot lurking beneath the snow. Battle through two vast new dungeons, where the echoes of the past refuse to rest.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cult of the Lamb the base game works perfectly on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>

      <title>The Farmer Was Replaced is a satisfying way to learn a little programming with automation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Learning a little programming doesn't need to be boring, and The Farmer Was Replaced makes it quite fun actually with you coding a little farming drone. <em>Note: the publisher sent GamingOnLinux a key.</em></p>
<p>It uses a Python-like language that carefully and slowly guides you through programming blocks of code, to get a drone to do its thing and build up a collection of resources for you. After you get enough resources, you can jump into a tech tree to unlock more of the game to do a little more in-depth programming and farming. In a way, it's also an idle game, because once you've got a good loop going you can sit back and watch the satisfying action of your code move your drone about to do its work.</p>
<p>Now, I'm no stranger to programming, this very site you're reading was coded by me, but it's also held together by hopes and dreams because I am a terrible programmer. So, games like this that helpfully introduce lots of programming elements in a fun way really are great. And, this might actually be one of the best I've played. I still feel like a complete dumdum going through it, but it gives an interesting challenge that tickles the mind a bit in a way that pushes you to want to actually program a little more and see what you can do.</p>
<p>What's really interesting here is the layout of the game. There's no levels to go through, it's all one self-contained ever-expanding plot of land that grows as you plant and harvest to unlock more of it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aP2WHQKJVsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64c4c1aa0c2eb50e53a772b0d683f8c1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aP2WHQKJVsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Something else that's interesting is that you can open multiple windows, to have an array of different code blocks. So you could set up an initial loop to get going, and get some resources, while you work on another better block to replace it later or to do something else entirely. Lots of nice ideas went into this one.</p>
<p>What's also really slick about it, is that the code blocks you create are actually stored directly on your system in .py files, so you can actually edit them outside of the game in your favourite editor too. On Linux with Proton, that would be somewhere like this:</p>
<p><code>steamapps/compatdata/2060160/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/TheFarmerWasReplaced/TheFarmerWasReplaced/Saves/Save0/</code></p>
<p>Wonderful idea, great presentation and really easy to get into. But, it won't hold your hand, you still have to figure out all the solutions entirely by yourself. It gives you the tools, and guides you a little on how to use them but the rest is up to you.</p>

      <title>Craft unique cards with stickers in the cute deck-builder My Card Is Better Than Your Card!</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As far as deck-builders go, My Card Is Better Than Your Card! is definitely more on the cute side with you crafting cards from stickers you collect. Currently in Early Access from Utu Studios, it has a genuinely lovely idea for a turn-based card battler.<em> Note: the developer sent GamingOnLinux a key.</em></p>
<p>Here pretty much every card can be completely unique, because there's no standard set of cards. While you do get an initial deck to play with with some basics, everything from then on is entirely down to how you want to play. Cards are built by stickers you find digging in the sand (who is burying all these stickers?) or buy at a shop from coins earned through battles, and each sticker has its own effect. You can load up cards with lots of these stickers to make them quite ridiculous but they all come with a cost attached to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4546119831761130620gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4546119831761130620gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Candy is the cost / mana system here, with each card having a candy cost depending on what stickers they have. You start battles with a small amount of candy, and each turn you can pick to boost your candy amount or draw an extra card. Then it's down to the battles.</p>
<p>This is where it's also quite unique, as the battle system is a bit of a tug-of-war. Instead of a health bar, you have a star meter with a total one of you has to hit. Each player builds up stars during a turn by playing cards, and then whoever has the most at the end of both turns will have their stars added to the meter (minus the amount of stars from your opponent) to progress towards one side. So if you have 10 stars, and your opponent has 6, you get 4 stars added to the meter towards your opponent.</p>
<p>There's also a special fever meter, which over time adds a multiplier to the total stars you have at the end of a round. This is pretty much essential, as otherwise battles might end up going on and on forever since it's a tug of war.</p>
<p>While it may look incredibly inviting from the visuals and setting, it's really quite a challenge. You have to pay such close attention to all the stickers, because you can really stack up some insane combinations with them and end up getting tons and tons of stars every round.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3L02RMI8Pmc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47ef6def45f7c869ad1d49b3b3c1a207.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3L02RMI8Pmc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really loved what I played of it, but they really do need to be careful on the balance of the stickers to make the cards, because even early on in the game it can end up a bit more challenging than it needs to be while it's easing you in. Aside from that, it's a brilliant idea with great presentation.</p>
<p>Really fun to play and create cards and I'm looking forward to seeing it finished. Works perfectly on Linux with Proton 9. Definitely one of the most interesting deck-builders released in the last few years.</p>

      <title>Tingus Goose is one of the weirdest games I&#39;ve ever seen</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I really don't have a clue what's going on in Tingus Goose, an upcoming idle / clicker game in the spirit of stuff like Cookie Clicker. It's supremely weird. No way of describing this game is going to make it not incredibly bizzare. But, I am somehow captivated by it, and the demo runs perfectly on Linux with Proton 9.</p>
<p>So what's the deal? Two people fall in love, one gets pregnant and then a goose somehow merges inside with the baby. Then it sprouts and you keep watering this goose to see it continually grow up towards reaching another goose. Oh, and your goose keeps shooting out tiny little baby people that allow you to earn more money, to pour more water on the goose to grow it some more.</p>
<p>Your ever-increasing goose neck also sprouts more goose heads, each with a different helpful bonus. You'll end up bouncing tiny little babies everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14893037781761127211gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14893037781761127211gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Something about it just really hooked me. The design is deliciously insane.</p>
<p>They've also now just announced it's launching on November 20th.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2TWvg-dbuUo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9cb73bdf2b401b1a451d4bde3b077f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2TWvg-dbuUo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Plant seeds in people: Pop a goose seed into a patient's torso, add water, and watch a towering goose-tree burst to life in MasterTingus's unmistakably twisted style.</li>
<li>Idle meets Rube Goldberg: Babies rain down branches, ricocheting off "Blossoms" to generate cash while "Specimens" chain wild synergies for exponential growth.</li>
<li>17 unsettling chapters, 150 plus unlockables: Every chapter introduces new modifiers, lore, Blossoms, Specimens, and Relics. All art is hand-illustrated by MasterTingus.</li>
<li>Each run offers a uniquely bizarre experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"This game to me feels like a perpetual soup. I kept adding wild ideas into the broth for over 4 years. Every so often I taste the soup and I add more stuff into it. It's now become an abomination that even I can't control. This game is now bigger than me. Does the soup taste good? Yes." - Master Tingus</p>
<p>"We took an already-addictive idle core and matched it with MasterTingus's unforgettable art," said Brian Zou, founder of Sweaty Chair Studio.</p>
<p>"Tingus Goose combines an absurd premise with deeply rewarding incremental mechanics," added Austin Oblouk, CEO of Playsaurus. "Finding an idle game with this level of creative depth is rare. Fans of the genre are going to love it."</p>

      <title>Steam gets personal with a recommendations calendar to help you find games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have remembered that Steam Labs exists and have a new experiment for us all to try: a personal recommendations calendar for recent and upcoming games.</p>
<p>While Valve already have various lists you can go through, and a discovery queue for suggestions, this new calendar might make things easier for you to plan your upcoming purchases. Based on data collected from people with "similar playtime profiles to you" it then goes over their wishlists to help build a release calendar for you. That, and what games you've put the most time into to help build up some genres and it refreshes daily to bring all the data together.</p>
<p>Valve say that while it shouldn't change a whole lot each day, it will evolve with time as the 8-week look moves on.</p>
<p>It's actually pretty great looking and quite a neat idea:</p>

      <title>THRASHER the mind-melting follow-up to Thumper releases November and Steam Deck optimised</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Previously only available in VR, THRASHER is the mind-melting follow-up to Thumper and it's confirmed to arrive on Steam on November 7th. It will come with full Steam Deck support and optimisations, with the developer noting it should run at a smooth "90fps".</p>
<p>The game has won multiple awards, so it should be interesting to see how it makes the jump from being VR-only to a flat-screen experience. To be clear though, the Steam release supports both VR and normal play. In the press release they noted "It has been reworked to capture the magic of the VR version but shine on traditional platforms. Swoop around the space eel with a thumbstick or your mouse and thrash through the chaos with the help of a new dash ability. The visuals have also been upgraded, taking advantage of the power of PCs" which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Game modes: Main Campaign (27 stages across nine worlds), Play+ mode (new!) and Time Trials (new!).</li>
<li>Steam Deck optimised: 90fps with gamepad and touchpad controls.</li>
<li>2D:  Mouse and gamepad controls.</li>
<li>2D: Improved visuals over the VR version.</li>
<li>PCVR: improved visuals over standalone platforms.</li>
<li>PCVR: controllers AND hand tracking support.</li>
<li>PCVR: new more responsive controls.</li>
<li>Leaderboards and Steam Achievements.</li>
<li>Master a unique comboing mechanic centered around creating circles with your space eel</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I read the press details, looked at the Steam page and watched the trailer and frankly I'm still completely confused by what I'm looking at here. How wild. </p>
<p>It looks like it <em>might</em> even have Native Linux support, although the system requirements only mention SteamOS / Steam Deck. Sometimes developers do this thinking they have to note Linux support to run on Steam Deck but they only have a Windows build to run in Proton. We'll just have to see at release.</p>

      <title>The Outlast Trials new PvP invasion mode is out now with Easy Anti-Cheat added</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Outlast Trials from Red Barrels has a huge new update out now that brings in a PvP invasion mode, and there's also now anti-cheat added into the game.</p>
<p>In the new Invasion Mode players can join your game as either a Reagent or an Imposter, but only a limited number of Imposters can invade any given Trial: while the others wait, they act as the the eyes and ears of their murderous teammates. Each Imposter will get a chance to invade the Trial, as their peers succeed in their sabotage… or die trying.</p>
<p>With the update they're also now using Easy Anti-Cheat, which has been disclosed on the Steam page as of today. Anti-cheat is rather problematic when it comes to Linux / SteamOS + Steam Deck, but in this case they do have it enabled for Linux platforms to be able to play. We were shared this message from a support ticket the developer replied to:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20575998371761062344gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20575998371761062344gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I've personally tested it just to be sure and it worked fine with a game being invaded on Desktop Linux (Proton 9). Nice to see, since it's a Steam Deck Verified game. Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> has now been updated to note this.</p>
<p>You can see the trailer for the new update below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QCCMkEwIsGU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9bd7c0bd06eef4aa4f259259370824b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QCCMkEwIsGU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>In case you also missed it, like I did previously, the developer also has an AI notice on the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="game_page_autocollapse_ctn">
<div class="game_page_autocollapse" style="max-height: none;">
<div class="game_area_description" id="game_area_content_descriptors">
<p>Throughout the development of our game, we may leverage AI-based tools to assist our team in content creation. Please rest assured that what you see in the game reflects the creativity and hard work of our team. Examples may include pictures and/or posters used in some of our environments.</p>

      <title>The incredible UTOPIA MUST FALL has a big performance upgrade and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>UTOPIA MUST FALL is absolutely one of the best arcade-styled base defense games made in modern times, and now it's massively better with a new update.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/utopia-must-fall-is-easily-one-of-the-best-modern-arcade-shoot-em-ups/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Previously covered here on GamingOnLinux</a> as I loved it so much, and another recent article on the Beta for this new release that's properly out for everyone now.</p>
<p>The game incorporates elements from retro arcade shooters, tower defense, roguelikes and beyond. Wrapped up in a slick laser-sharp bullet-purgatory arcade frenzy about Earth's last metropolis defending itself against a mysterious alien invasion. Currently rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam, I think more people need to check this one out. And now you can on Steam Deck too, as the new update had a focus on full Steam Deck support on top of all the performance improvements.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WeBkIYaJX30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34197bb6298b419f9158200cd76baac9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WeBkIYaJX30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've said now this update is done the next will focus on gameplay like new weapons, new enemies and some "big surprises" yet to be revealed.</p>

      <title>Valve doing more of a Steam Deck push with their Steam Deck Verified game pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are still pushing their Steam Deck ahead with many developers now adding their own special dedicated Steam Deck Verified page.</p>
<p>These special areas on Steam give an uncluttered page that highlights how well a game can run on Steam Deck, it's a really neat idea to help cut through the noise. Just the game, a trailer and a link to the store page for the Steam Deck and for the game. This gives developers an easy link to advertise that their game is fully supported on the Linux powered Steam Deck.</p>
<p>An example below is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong page</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8649374121761051223gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They've actually been around for a while, as far back as 2023 from what I can tell, as I've seen a few developers (and Valve) announce them for specific games. However, there's currently no normal link to these pages on Steam that I could find. It's mainly up to developers to show them off but you can just use "https://store.steampowered.com/verified/*APPID*" and it will work (but only if they're fully green tick Verified).</p>
<p>It appears that Valve have recently begun emailing more developers (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/datablob.studio/post/3m3p326k5gs2d" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>) if their game is Steam Deck Verified. As a result, I've been seeing a <em>lot</em> of developers suddenly post about their games being Steam Deck Verified across different social media sites.</p>
<p>Great to see more of a push from Valve again. Especially given how ridiculously costly other handhelds are, with the Steam Deck holding up well against the competition (aside from playability of the latest AAA games or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">those with anti-cheat</a>).</p>

      <title>Fight the nazis to rescue your dog in the new free shooter Darkenstein 3D out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by some of the classics like Return to Castle Wolfenstein and DOOM, the free shooter Darkenstein 3D has released and it's a rip-roaring good time. <em>Disclosure: their press team provided GamingOnLinux with a key.</em></p>
<p>No nazi trickery involved here, it's free to grab and keep on Steam. However, the developer did previously announce after teaming up with publisher MicroProse that they're going to be doing some DLC expansions but they promised they will "*not* be bite-sized and we will *not* nickel and dime you". A first smaller expansion will come first, with longer expansions to follow.</p>
<p>Like something out of John Wick only a bit more supernatural, you're on a mission to save your precious dog, snatched away by the evil Gestapo. Armed with nothing but your beard (okay, you do get weapons eventually), as the "Hobo Guy" you'll be firing and strafing like your own life depends on it. With some funny physics interactions letting you smash through things, along with plenty of bloody gore it's quite a highlight to run through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j0DYROVej84"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c59e4f46cd268053a360dc9d20ccd6b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j0DYROVej84" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game seemed to work perfectly with Proton 9 on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu).</p>
<p>If you love oldschool shooters that are a little bit silly, you'll no doubt enjoy this one. The slow-mo special power with your "Homicidal Rant" where you get health bonuses per kill was a nice touch. Some really fun design went into this one overall, with interesting level layouts and it can be quite brutal.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast, Old-School Gameplay - No cover, no aim assist, no handholding. Just movement, aim, and survival. Dodge bullets, strafe through firefights, and master the deadly rhythm of retro combat.</li>
<li>A Story of Desperation (and a Dog) - Rescue your kidnapped companion, Gunther, while unraveling strange mysteries hidden inside enemy strongholds.</li>
<li>13 Handcrafted Levels - Castles, caves, valleys, and desert towns; each packed with secrets, keys, treasures, and escalating danger.</li>
<li>Dynamic Rat Companion - Turn the battlefield into chaos with your vicious rat sidekick. Distract enemies, combo with grenades, and create absolute carnage.</li>
<li>Explosive Physics &amp; Gore - Enemies fly, gib, and ragdoll in spectacular firefights. Props shatter, debris scatters, and every bullet leaves a mark.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Want to avoid AI gen on Steam? This browser userscript might save your day</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With more and more game developers creating AI slop, or just using AI generation for stupid things in their games, we need more ways to avoid them.</p>
<p>The problem is for me, I'm so busy that it's just easy to miss. The AI notice on Steam page is buried is small writing at the bottom of a store page. Steam itself has no filters for it currently either, although the community site <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Btags%5D%5B0%5D=AI%20Content%20Disclosed" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> does and the list is a lot bigger than I expected. 12,284 games on Steam have an AI disclosure according to SteamDB at time of writing. I was going to say "that's a crazy number!", but it's not really is it? I'm sure many GamingOnLinux readers fully expected a lot of developers to end up pushing out slop with AI generation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, an <a href="https://github.com/seeeeew/aiwarningforsteam?tab=readme-ov-file" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">open source browser userscript</a> was pointed out to me on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mysterioushatch.bsky.social/post/3m3p3wargls24" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> (thanks!) which really makes it impossible to miss. It will work on any operating system with pretty much all major browsers. With that installed, when going to a Steam page that has an AI disclosure, you get this appear before you're able to actually do anything:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5984243841761042312gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I love how simple and most importantly how <em>effective</em> it is. The main thing is that doesn't stop you taking a look, it just makes sure you're fully aware of the AI gen use. Hopefully never again will I completely waste my time playing through a game, writing it up and then suddenly remembering - "Oh yeah, I have to check if they stuck AI generation in it".</p>
<p>I'm sure some readers might find my stance on AI generation a bit harsh perhaps, but when there's tens of thousands of games releasing every year — my time (and yours!) is a premium currency. Why would I want to spend my time with a game full of AI generation, when I could play one that had real actual people craft the work. I can just skip over a game with it for a different game without it. Some of the AI use just seems completely daft as well, one I saw earlier noted how it was used for "Icons + Artists Paintover for 5 icons, out of 100s of artist icons" (Kingdoms Reborn) and in that case I think like…why was it even needed at all?</p>
<p>Using this browser userscript, and remembering to check SteamDB, it's a genuine surprise to see just how many titles have now added an AI disclosure. To my surprise even games like My Summer Car, The Outlast Trials and Siralim Ultimate have the notice.</p>
<p>Hopefully you find it helpful. With tools like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/gaijin-announced-edenspark-an-open-source-ai-assisted-platform-for-making-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the recent EdenSpark announcement</a>, we're going to see more AI games.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.5 is out now with a number of highly-requested features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next big KDE Plasma release is here with Plasma 6.5 delivering a number of major new features, as the KDE team begin to show a lot more confidence. So much confidence in fact, the update page notes how they're "on the verge of making it big for the general public".</p>
<p>With this release you can set automatic theme transitions between light and dark based on the time of day, there's a better zoom tool that jumps into where you actually need it, and the KRunner search tool was also improved with a new fuzzy searching feature to help you out. Even the clipboard becomes more useful in this release, letting you pin items to keep referring back to them.</p>
<p>Fans of drawing tablets get some more additions too as you're now able to configure any rotary dials and touch rings in the system settings page. Along with a new warning if there's a custom driver interacting with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21251665521761041201gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21251665521761041201gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Another evolution is the Flatpak Permission page, which has been upgraded into a proper general desktop Application Permissions page. Here you'll be able to configure everything properly across all your apps.</p>
<p>Usability has also been a constant focus with an improved WiFi and Networking page, along with making connection messages clearer and providing the WiFi password along with a QR code when you're sharing to help others connect. The do not disturb mode was improved too, giving you a button to actually see all missed notifications. An addition for gamers too - the Game Controller page was updated with more info.</p>
<p>The list of improvements goes on and on with more accessibility improvements too like the Orca screen reader getting improvements for describing actions and keyboard shortcuts, along with telling you when the Caps Lock changes state. Plasma has also been through an audit to fix up all known cases of screen-flashing that could cause photosensitivity issues.</p>
<p>Thankfully, more work also went into the Discover software app to make it launch faster, and give you more info on what's holding it up along with support for "flatpak+https://" URLS.</p>
<p>So much more! Improved HDR content display, an experimental version of the Wayland picture-in-picture protocol was added, there's performance improvements and lots more.</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.5.0/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the release post</a>.</p>
<p>A few niggles aside, KDE Plasma is incredible as a desktop. It has long been my favourite and my go-to for Linux. Nicely bridging the gap between a mostly Windows-like setup but with lots of customization. I think KDE Plasma is still the absolute best way to get more Windows users to feel at home on Linux.</p>

      <title>Open source racer SuperTuxKart 1.5 out now, development moving onto SuperTuxKart Evolution</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SuperTuxKart is like a free and open source alternative to Mario Kart, with a brand new release out now!</p>
<p>This release brings with it three new egg hunt maps, three official new fields for the soccer mode. There's also a bunch of user interface improvements in this release too including a new display settings tab, a search option for karts and arenas, a new blog announcement system included in the interface, better font and UI scaling and lots of little fixes everywhere in the UI along with new themes.</p>
<p>Like a particular track? You can now mark it as a favourite, making them show up first for easier picking. There's also some audio improvements, several adjustments to the graphics settings by default to make it look better along with fixes to some graphical effects and some new effects were added too. There's even a new benchmarking mode included for testing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H1Lo7PlTGBk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0db8335386469a00aef9c34022671bdf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H1Lo7PlTGBk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>They're also doing a special donation pack, where you can get early access to two new tracks for $5 before they roll out to all players in a later update. Just a way to gather a bit more support for the project.</p>
<p>On top of all that, they announced back in <a href="https://blog.supertuxkart.net/2025/08/announcing-supertuxkart-evolution.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">August</a> that work has started on SuperTuxKart Evolution, the next major change for the free and open source racer.

      <title>Xubuntu website hijacked to serve malware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ouch, the Xubuntu website was recently hijacked and ended up serving Windows malware, and this isn't the first time the Xubuntu site was hit.</p>
<p>Back in September (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xubuntu/comments/1ndkotb/xubuntu_site_hacked/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>), it seemed the Xubuntu blog was briefly attacked to serve slot machine adverts, going by the comments in the Reddit post. This time though, it was a bit more nefarious with the downloads section (specifically the torrent) serving up some sort of crypto malware (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xubuntu/comments/1oa43gt/xubuntuorg_might_be_compromised/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Confirming the issue on Mastodon in reply to a question about it, Xubuntu contributor Sean Davis <a href="https://floss.social/@bluesabre/115401767635718361" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is. We’re working with Canonical IS to resolve. Since the servers aren’t owned by our team, there’s little we can do. We’ve since taken down the download page and will be expediting our static site development to replace our aging WordPress instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Wordpress being as popular as it is used across so many sites, anyone running it really does need to ensure it's constantly updated with regular security fixes.</p>
<p>The timing of it is interesting, with Windows 10 recently ending support, so likely the attackers were hoping to hit a few people attempting to move from Windows.</p>
<p>Right now, the Xubuntu website is quite broken with many pages leading to errors. Hopefully they'll be able to sort it out soon.</p>

      <title>Gaijin Entertainment announced EdenSpark, an open source &#34;AI-assisted&#34; platform for making games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EdenSpark seemed like a pretty exciting announcement for game developers and the open source community, until you read about the AI generation involved.</p>
<p>Announced today by Gaijin Entertainment they say it's the "first open-source platform that lets independent developers make their games accessible to console users hassle-free and truly own the code of their creations". A fair amount of the focus seems to be consoles but it will also support Windows too. However, since it's all going to be open source, I've no doubts people will quickly begin hacking away at the code to run it on Linux.</p>
<p>This also explains why Dagor Engine that's used in War Thunder, Enlisted and Active Matter <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/war-thunder-game-engine-dagor-engine-from-gaijin-now-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">became open source at the end of 2023</a> since this is powered directly by it. Clearly they had some future plans in mind like this.</p>
<p>They haven't said what license it will use other than being a permissive "FOSS" (Free and open-source software) license and so that developers using it will "retain full ownership of their games" so they can "self-publish independently and take their work anywhere". </p>
<p>All sounds pretty great, but as with everything nowadays, there's AI being advertised as a feature. The press release noted "newcomers can rely on AI-assisted tools to generate art, sound, and gameplay logic, or simply build worlds using plain prompts".<em> It's probably going to be popular with creators of AI slop.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J8JN9lKh5V4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/79610cadc0af7139f73e16da56f3e463.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J8JN9lKh5V4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The official site notes in big letters right on the landing page how it's an "Open Source AI-assisted platform for making games on PC and consoles".</p>
<p>Closed beta testing begins next month, with an open beta in February 2026 and a 1.0 planned for sometime in the Summer of 2026. However, their roadmap notes the project source code is not planned to be released until Fall 2026.</p>

      <title>Coal LLC has annoyingly absorbed my entire attention</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It doesn't look like much with some of the simplest pixel art around but Coal LLC is a like a black hole that freezes your life when you hit play.</p>
<p>A game that released on Steam back in September and made with <a href="https://godotengine.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, it puts a pickaxe in your hands and tells you to go off and mine coal to fill your ever-increasing quota. Each day brings a new mine layout, so you really have to think through all your upgrades. Starting off ridiculously simple with just you dashing about, as you madly try to mine as much as possible and make it back before the timer is up — eventually it expands into some pretty funny explosive chaos.</p>
<p>Especially good when you start getting into the later days in the game, as you spend your hard-earned cash on a mini army of NPC helpers to get mining with you. Thankfully, they don't seem to mind all the explosive weapons I keep using to make quick work of the blocks instead of mining every individual block by hand.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62-_MRFdQh4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd5a799b31980e8cdc91efd379cc138a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62-_MRFdQh4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's multiple game modes in it, with the standard mode based on a short timer as you do a mad-dash through the randomly generated mine. But, there's also a more relaxed mode with half the quota you need to hit (but no bonus cash) and also a peaceful mode if you just want to experience all the weapons and tools it has. That makes my brain happy, since the standard mode really is quite a challenge when you're first getting into it, I managed to fail quite a lot before deciding on a good path through the upgrades.</p>
<p>Inside the mines there's also various chests to mine through to open, with each having a different passive upgrade you can grab to power-up your run through. And, at times, a temporary buff that allows you to 1-hit smash through blocks which is great fun.</p>
<p>Some interesting unlocks available to with different characters, each having their own starting weapon and unique buffs. Along with different types of maps to unlock too. There's a number of hours of entertainment you can have with it.</p>
<p>One of the key points I found at least early on, is to focus on a single piece of equipment to upgrade at least twice, then add some more time to your day, before moving onto building up your little army of helpers. Eventually you understand the loop once you've failed a few times, and your brain keeps screaming at you for another run just to see how far you can get. The sheer panic I feel when that timer starts ticking down on those last few seconds though, it surprisingly gets the blood pumping as you race back to deposit your ores.</p>
<p>It runs perfectly on Desktop Linux with Proton 9 but the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3361510/discussions/0/601905007519895793/#c597412189643582848" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">might</a> be doing a Native Linux build later. Valve also rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>I picked it up on a whim, as I saw a friend playing it and thought it could be interesting and it is! Being impulsive paid of! Coal LLC is a great example of having a fun little gameplay hook and just going nuts with it. Great stuff.</p>

      <title>Made in the spirit of Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max, adventure game Splittown released recently</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed here on GamingOnLinux from earlier in the month, the classic comedy point and click adventure game Splittown had a full complete release. And it comes with Native Linux support, along with being optimized for the Steam Deck too. Recently Valve put it back through verification and swapped it over to the Native version from Proton.</p>
<p>Whats is it? Splittown resurrects the spirit of 90s point and click classics like Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road, bringing a blend of humour, puzzles, and nostalgic artwork. While it takes inspiration from the classic adventures, it introduces features you might find from classic CRPGs too with "branching narratives" and a "world and story that reacts to player choices" that's supposed to give a fresh spin on the genre.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rMTo4r-_zKA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/53245e411da3cfb4079a6fe1cdc7ec64.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rMTo4r-_zKA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Compared to the Early Access release in January, here's some of what's changed that they listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All new adventures with Otis. </strong>Many of you pointed out that Nimby's best buddy Otis felt underdeveloped during EA. Good news! There is now a whole DLC-sized chunk of content (in a new part of the city) where you get to unravel more of the secrets of Splittown with him!</li>
<li><strong>All-around beefier main story. </strong>With 40 new dialogue branches, 4 new characters and more than 700 frames of new animation, the adventure feels more polished and interactive than ever before.</li>
<li><strong>30+ achievements. </strong>Find easter eggs, hidden gags and cause irreparable damage to the citizens of Splittown all in order to satisfy your digital hoarding instinct.</li>
<li><strong>Item highlight and in-game hints. </strong>This was a tough one, but so many of you asked. Not everyone has the time for endless pixel hunting anymore (adult responsibilities, amirite?) Give the Wimp Phone a call when you are feeling stuck, or toggle on Wimp-Vision™️to highlight interactive items.</li>
<li><strong>Controller and Steam Deck support. </strong>New on-screen glyphs automatically update when switching between a controller and a keyboard. All puzzles have been adjusted to be completeable on a controller as well as the mouse and keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>Unlockable making-of content. </strong>Nearly a hundred pieces of early art, in-development screenshots and other curios for you to find. Collect duckies hidden around Splittown to unlock these extras!</li>
<li><strong>More hotkeys, more convenience. </strong>When playing on mouse and keyboard, you can now use WASD and the arrow keys to navigate menus and interactive scenes. Every inch of the UI has been made slicker and more fun to use.</li>
<li><strong>Native Linux, always.</strong> We heard our Linux fans loud and clear: no Proton shenanigans this time around!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Making retro DOS gaming simple - the standalone DOSBox Pure Unleashed is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DOSBox Pure Unleashed is a standalone fork of the classic DOSBox to run DOS games on modern systems, based on the libretro core. Giving you an all-in-one fully featured way to easily play the classics on modern Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>It was originally announced quite a few years ago, but on October 18th the developer announced "DOSBox Pure Unleashed 1.0 Preview 3" which is the "first public release of DOSBox Pure Unleashed based on version 1.0 Preview 3 of the core".</p>
<p>With an impressive and long list of features, this really should make playing classic DOS games near painless on practically any system. Especially with the easy menu interface to load up games from all sorts of file types, the on-screen keyboard, automated controller mapping, save states, major audio support and much more.</p>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="t4q8OMp15KA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1d8bac15b62ec8c6ec619c3eb18146a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/t4q8OMp15KA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really great to see this get a proper up to date release. However, it seems currently there may be some problems with the audio output on certain Linux distributions. Hopefully the issue can be tracked down and promptly fixed. Since it's all open source I imagine it won't take too long.</p>
<p>It's available via the <a href="https://github.com/schellingb/dosbox-pure-unleashed" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or the <a href="https://schelling.itch.io/dosbox-pure" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods app adds new context menus, Stardew Valley FOMOD support, and work towards Bethesda games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm getting more excited about the open source cross-platform Nexus Mods app, especially as we're getting closer to Bethesda games support. Going to be really great when it's more ready since this has Native Linux / SteamOS support, finally a good proper fully featured mod manager for Linux integrated with the biggest modding site around.</p>
<p>The latest update v0.19.4 brings in new context menus (pictured below) to make interacting with mods easier, and there's also support for Stardew Valley FOMOD installers baked into the app now too.</p>
<p>Even more exciting is the load order rework for Cyberpunk REDmods, which helps prepare it for load order in Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4838706811760953412gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4838706811760953412gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The full changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Context Menus Are Here:</h4>
<p>We've added the ability to open a <strong>context menu</strong> by right-clicking on items in the <strong>Loadout</strong> and <strong>Library</strong> pages. This streamlines your workflow by providing quick access to common actions like "Remove" or "View Mod Page."</p>
<h4>Stardew Valley FOMOD Installer Support:</h4>
<p>We've added support for running interactive <strong>FOMOD installers</strong> when managing Stardew Valley. This allows you to install more complex mods with configuration options directly within the app.</p>
<hr/>
<h4>Bug Fixes and Performance:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue causing Stardew Valley <strong>SMAPI to be installed incorrectly</strong>, which resulted in SMAPI crashing on start. <em>If you were experiencing this problem, please uninstall SMAPI from the app and install it again to fix the corrupted file.</em></li>
<li>Fixed an issue with <strong>Stardew Valley.exe</strong> not being backed up and restored correctly after uninstalling SMAPI.</li>
<li>Fixed a file-time comparison bug that caused <strong>performance slowdowns</strong> when applying a loadout.</li>
<li>Fixed errors that occurred when trying to <strong>unmanage a game</strong> while a loadout was actively applying.</li>
<li>Improved game updates and DLC changes detection without requiring a restart of the app.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h4>Under The Hood:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Our privacy policy and telemetry changed with this release. You can click the question mark in the top bar and go to the about page to read more about our privacy policy and to accept the changes.</li>
<li><strong>Load Order Rework:</strong> We reworked the Load Order backend used for Cyberpunk <strong>REDmods</strong>, in preparation for adding <strong>Bethesda Load Order</strong> support (required for games like Skyrim and Fallout).</li>
<li><strong>Settings Clean-up:</strong> Removed some development and experimental settings from the main Settings page to focus the user experience on stable features.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Atelier Ryza, Atelier Ryza 2 and Atelier Ryza 3 DX release November 13 and all Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From KOEI TECMO, the newer Atelier Ryza DX series is coming to Steam on November 13th and as of today all three of them have been rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>So they'll be nicely playable on other SteamOS / Linux systems too. The only compatibility note that Valve listed is that the three games don't default to external gamepads, so you may need to swap the controller order in the Quick Access menu in SteamOS.</p>
<p>The first game in this series originally released back in 2019, the second in 2021 and the third in 2023. All three have new content added for the DX Steam releases too. Plus improved graphics, an improved UI, new graphics options and more upgrades. KOEI TECMO say the DX releases are the definitive edition of the "Secret" series. The original version of each game is going to be delisted when the DX versions release.</p>
<p>The first in this series is actually the 21st entry in the Atelier franchise and was the first of the Atelier series to feature the same protagonist across multiple titles. The story follows an ordinary girl, Ryza, who discovers alchemy and embarks on a summer adventure with her friends, illustrating her growth through the experiences.</p>

      <title>Kaiju Cleaner Simulator will get you and friends to clean up massive titans together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's another game coming out that will have you clean up the bodies of massive creatures, with Kaiju Cleaner Simulator seeing you and friends team up for it. No battling here, it's all about the aftermath and what comes next.</p>
<p>I'll admit, I got a bit <em>confused</em> when this entered the GamingOnLinux inbox yesterday, because I actually thought it was one I had already covered called <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/youre-on-colossal-cleaning-duty-in-kaiju-cleanup/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kaiju Cleanup that was announced recently</a>. You'll see my problem there right? One is <em>Kaiju Cleanup</em> and this is <em>Kaiju Cleaner Simulator</em> and both only recent reveals. Oh my. Seems two different teams had near enough the exact same idea. This doesn't seem to be some copycat though, as this game seemed to have a Steam page being prepared even before Kaiju Cleanup that just happened to be announced first it seems.</p>
<p>With Kaiju Cleaner Simulator, it's not solo game since up to 4 players can get cleaning together. A bit more chaotic perhaps than the other game. The developers mention this will lean into the more humorous and absurd side of things. In their own words: "Unexpected situations and quirky monster designs bring lighthearted moments to the gritty tasks of cleaning up after kaiju rampages, creating a perfect mix of dark comedy and simulation fun".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below, which is a bit short on actual gameplay though:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YNHivYHib_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d80a9e41476415cf19fd7f6187f71085.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YNHivYHib_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interesting to see their no AI notice at the start, I think we're about to see more developers do such things since there's an increasing amount of AI slop out there. </p>
<p>From the press release: “After watching Kaiju No. 8, we thought maybe being a kaiju cleaner is even tougher than being their exterminator. It’s a job for real tough guys. Our game is for those who aren’t afraid to get their hands dirty and turn chaos into fun,” says One More Time. </p>
<p>A Steam playtest is scheduled to begin early next year. With a release planned sometime in Q2 2026.</p>

      <title>Deep colony sim Stardeus adds a huge new narrative-focused update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Because there was always going to be some drama in deep space right? Stardeus is a spaceship colony sim that just expanded in a huge way.</p>
<p>The Story and Drama Update brings with it a huge overhaul and expansion to the narrative systems. They said it includes "new levels of narrative depth, social complexity, and emotional storytelling to the colony simulation experience" which sounds quite fancy. You may find some colonists now might get a bit <em>stabby</em> towards another if they're annoyed enough with them — ouch. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14196197171760708438gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14196197171760708438gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Stardeus is just a overall lot more social now with lots more interactions between colonists like a bit of casual chat or even weddings, there's a lot that can happen in a run now.</p>
<p>What we get is a completely rebuilt story generation system, which is supposed to be more flexible to provide a vast range of dynamic story events. You'll also get to see a new raid management system with it being influenced by colony strength, recent losses, and other in-game factors along with new types of raids to up the challenge.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Update Overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Story Generation System.</li>
<li>New Raid System and Raid Types.</li>
<li>New Colony Drama System and Social Relationships.</li>
<li>Visible Eyes and Unique Faces.</li>
<li>New Story Events.</li>
<li>Ashes, Urns, and Mourning.</li>
<li>Scars and Cause of Death.</li>
<li>Fire and Explosions.</li>
<li>UI Improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>This might end up as one of the deepest strategy games around.</p>
<p>Stardeus has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>
