      <title>Thousands of years later, The Bible has arrived on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I had to do a double-take to ensure I wasn't seeing things: The Bible is now available on Steam in the form of a Kinetic Novel. Yes really, a developer going by "Bible Games" has actually put it on Steam. This release supports Linux with a Native build too (Ren'py engine) because of course it needs to reach all God's children — something like that anyway.</p>
<p>Not only does it provide the good book, it also comes with an original soundtrack and an voice over from beginning to end. On top of that, there's even a trivia section so you can really prove your knowledge,</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19312471391668625966gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19312471391668625966gol1.jpg"/></a><em>I don't think it really needs much of an explanation? Or maybe it does? I heard it's a bit unbalanced and gives lots of conflicting information that doesn't hold up well.</em></p>
<p>While some might think this is a little odd, or even a silly gimmick, it's managed a "Very Positive" rating on Steam so clearly some are enjoying their time spent in it with reviews like "I will become the greatest Bible player" and "atheists approved".</p>
<p>Even better, it has achievements, because as God knows, people sure do love earning things on Steam. Going by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/ymbhx3/comment/iv45eg9/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post, the developer mentioned they did this because other ways of reading it on a PC were apparently bad.</p>
<p>Again, yes this is a real Steam "game" release, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2167220/The_Bible/" target="_blank">see it over here</a>.</p>
<p>Oh they even made a little trailer for it:</p>

      <title>Retro inspired RTS Rusted Warfare adds shaders, new units and other huge upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rusted Warfare is a great RTS for people who love the classics. One I discovered years ago on Android and then it later had a PC release. A big new release version 1.15 adds in loads to it. A game built for <em>large</em> battles. If you loved Total Annihilation, you will love this too.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in 1.15 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shaders - Team colour shaders and shader effects like shockwaves, water ripples and more.</li>
<li>New unit - Heavy AA Ship.</li>
<li>New unit - Spy Drone.</li>
<li>Stats - game history shown with graphs on post game win/lose screen and Stats / leaderboard button in replays.</li>
<li>Mods can now replace the streaming resource system with something else.</li>
<li>A new decal drawing system - can be used for a lot of new things from selection interfaces, custom health bars, fake 3d effects, 3d voxel units, animations, etc.</li>
<li>Over "100% faster rendering on PC" with lots going on.</li>
<li>Big dynamic logic improvement for modding, with new dynamic numbers, unit and string types, dynamic text, arrays, memory, unit references, messages sending, events, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus quite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/647960/view/3389548848365069095" target="_blank">a lot more</a>.</p>
<p>One of their community did a nice overview of the changes you can see below:</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 gets a Movie Maker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> 4.0 slowly approaching release, the developers are still hooking up some huge features to this free and open source game engine like a <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/movie-maker-mode-arrives-in-godot-4" target="_blank">Movie Maker</a>. This is something other game engines have too, so it's nice to see it land in Godot. This should make it easier for developers to make trailers of games, and use Godot for other projects too.</p>
<p>From their blog post it could be used for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recording game trailers for promotional use.</li>
<li>Recording cutscenes that will be displayed as pre-recorded videos in the final game. This allows for using higher quality settings (at the cost of file size), regardless of the player's hardware.</li>
<li>Recording procedurally generated animations or motion design. User interaction remains possible during video recording, and audio can be included as well (although you won't be able to hear it while the video is recording).</li>
<li>Comparing the visual output of graphics settings, shaders, or rendering techniques in an animated scene.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some advantages they listed instead of just plain recording gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use any graphics settings (including extremely demanding settings) regardless of your hardware's capabilities. The output video will always have perfect frame pacing; it will never exhibit dropped frames or stuttering. Faster hardware will allow you to render a given animation in less time, but the visual output remains identical.</li>
<li>Render at a higher framerate than the video's target framerate, then post-process to generate high-quality motion blur. This also makes effects that converge over several frames (such as temporal antialiasing, SDFGI and volumetric fog) look better.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also showed an example video made with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e047PL2KyP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/81180860c14d197e1fca4d40211fcc16.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e047PL2KyP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Godot 4.0 is shaping up to be a truly ridiculously big upgrade for game developers. Earlier this month the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-4" target="_blank">4th Beta</a> of Godot 4.0 went out.</p>

      <title>Unreal Engine 5.1 rolled out with plenty of Linux improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games announced that Unreal Engine 5.1 is now available, and along with all the usual big new features, they continued improving their Linux support in this release. You can see the official release <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-1-is-now-available" target="_blank">post here</a>, release <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/unreal-engine-5.1-release-notes/" target="_blank">notes here</a>.</p>
<p>After quietly making the Linux Editor for Unreal Engine <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/unreal-engine-5-editor-quietly-gets-a-proper-linux-version/" target="_blank">properly official</a>, it's nice to see them continue to make developing games on and for Linux better. In their press email, they mentioned how over "half of all announced next-gen games are being created with Unreal Engine" which is quite a few.</p>
<p>Going over the changelog, here's what's new and changed for Linux in Unreal Engine 5.1:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Clang 13 Support</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clang 13 is now the required version when compiling for Clang-based platforms such as Linux.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux IDE Workflow Improvements</strong>
<ul>
<li>In UE 5.1, we improved support for VS Code as a default option for IDEs in Linux. Error handling and messaging is also present when you have multiple IDEs and the code accessor fails to find the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New / Fixed</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved process for exporting to Raspberry Pi 4.
<ul>
<li>Added a new vendor ID for Broadcom.</li>
<li>Split ASTC and ETC2 support into separate texture formats for Vulkan, as ASTC may not be supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>USD: Added support for the usdMtlx plugin on Windows and Linux The usdMtlx plugin included with USD adds a file format plugin for reading MaterialX documents and translating them into UsdShade shading networks.</li>
<li>USD: added support for the usdAbc plugin on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</li>
<li>Added .so and .dylib as files to consider as library files to help reduce relinking on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Implemented a quick workaround to allow munmaps to happen with Mutex unlocked. Currently, We can't define UE_ALLOW_OSMEMORYLOCKFREE on Linux as we'll deadlock with the OsAllocatorCacheLock.</li>
<li>Mutex locks Munmap calls on Linux can take quite a bit of time (few ms in some cases). This should allow these to happen without the Mutex and remove some hitching.</li>
<li>Updated Mac and Linux to use libcurl 7.83.1.</li>
<li>Enabled the experimental Unreal Cloud DDC on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added all files under Unreal Build Tool output directory to fix an issue running build setup on linux builders.</li>
<li>Added support for IsGamepadAttached on Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for Linux to search (using "which") for CLion outside of the default expected location.</li>
<li>Linux windows now have a reasonable minimum size, and no longer can be scaled down to 1 pixel wide/tall.</li>
<li>UE on Linux now locates any standalone Rider installation if it is either installed to the default location "/opt" (Rider Installation Guide), or anywhere else that is on the PATH.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where global shaders would get cooked for Linux Server platforms if it had any targeted RHIs enabled.</li>
<li>The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) library that powers the Web Browser Widget has been updated to use Chromium's "Ozone" rendering backend under Linux. As a result, the Web Browser Widget now renders correctly in Linux environments that lack an X11 server, such as desktops running Wayland without the XWayland compatibility layer, and headless environments such as containers.</li>
<li>Fixed missing quotes in GenerateProjectFiles.sh.</li>
<li>Fixed QMake project generator defines.</li>
<li>Added DumpGPU viewer script for Linux and Mac. Currently requires the Chrome Browser to view the dump files.</li>
<li>Fixed landscape not updating on changes to water on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>The GPU Dump Viewer now dumps both <em>.sh and </em>.bat so a dump can be opened either on Mac, Linux, or Windows regardless of the platform the files were dumped from.</li>
<li>Platform Linux for the LiveLinkOverNDisplay Plugin was whitelisted in nDisplay.</li>
<li>Changed the minimum driver version for Nanite on Vulkan, and also added a check for Linux.</li>
<li>DriverDenyList support was added to Linux.</li>
<li>Added DriverDenyList entries for Vulkan on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for OpenVDB and Blosc on Mac and Linux in addition to Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed audio crashing when outputting audio with Blackmagic on Linux.</li>
<li>Enabled ShotGrid plugin for Linux.</li>
<li>SwitchboardListener: Fixed expansion of %TEMP% in file destination paths on non-Windows platforms. This was causing a crash attempting to launch nDisplay devices running on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Fedora Linux 37 is out now with official Raspberry Pi 4 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bit of a delay due to security issues with OpenSSL, Fedora Linux 37 is officially <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-37/" target="_blank">out now</a> with all the usual assortment of major software updates.</p>
<p>Their main edition Fedora Workstation, continues using the GNOME desktop which bumps it up to <a href="https://release.gnome.org/43/" target="_blank">GNOME 43</a>. That along includes a lot of additions like the new Quick Settings menu, more applications upgraded to GTK 4, the Files app got refreshed, the Calendar / Contacts and Calls apps all got upgraded, Device Security Settings and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8144162721668529308gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8144162721668529308gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots more is new like official Raspberry Pi 4 support with working accelerated graphics, plus upgrades to various programming languages and system libraries as they continued to follow their "<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/#_first" target="_blank">First</a>" foundation (where they get stuff in early) like Python 3.11, Golang 1.19, glibc 2.36, and LLVM 15. It also includes Mesa 22.2.2 graphics drivers and the 6.0.7 Linux kernel.</p>
<p>For their other Spins that come with different desktops you get KDE Plasma 5.26.2, Xfce 4.16, Cinnamon 5.4.12 and there's other desktop environments available too.</p>
<p>With this release they slimmed the installation a bit, with Firefox language packs now as subpackages so you can remove the "firefox-langpacks" package if you don't need localization.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8962463541668529316gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8962463541668529316gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Fedora continues to be my go-to system, as it really works quite nicely on desktop. Hopefully my 36 - 37 upgrade will go smoothly but I usually wait a week or so to make sure any kinks are ironed out.</p>
<p>Do you use Fedora? Let us know in the comments what you're excited about in this release.</p>

      <title>Mixing factory management, Tower Defense and RTS - Mindustry 7.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best open source games around, Mindustry from AnukenDev just had a MASSIVE new release out that took quite some time to make. This update was in development for over a year!</p>
<p>It's like a mixture of Factorio with an RTS and Tower Defense blended in together, it's really quite something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7233548371668516603gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7233548371668516603gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in 7.0 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A whole new campaign that includes a new planet, with its own tech tree and 100+ new blocks to research.</li>
<li>15 new units to research and construct.</li>
<li>A new class of tank units.</li>
<li>A new variant of insectoid walkers.</li>
<li>Hovercraft units with unique weapons and abilities.</li>
<li>Various new forms of factory transportation.</li>
<li>Units can now be selected and commanded to positions or enemy targets, similarly to other RTS games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering how long it took, the developer mentioned they've burned-out a bit and so they will be taking a break from any feature updates for a couple of months but they will do smaller maintenance releases during this time to fix up issues as they appear.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support it, or grab it free on <a href="https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Popular Half-Life 2 mod Entropy : Zero 2 is getting full Linux support for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583720/Entropy__Zero_2/" target="_blank">Entropy : Zero 2</a> is a very popular and well reviewed Half-Life 2 mod, and the developer has recently <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1583720/announcements/detail/5025482135637312982" target="_blank">announced</a> the public testing of Native Linux support and Steam Input gamepad support. Available now in the "deck-testing" opt-in Beta, you can try it for yourself!</p>
<p>What is it? "The pessimistic, wisecracking, door-kicking zealot known as 'Bad Cop' is back.</p>
<p>Command a small army of Combine synths and soldiers on a Northern campaign to capture Dr. Judith Mossman.</p>
<p>Tread in the wake of Gordon Freeman at Nova Prospekt. Explore the mysterious 'Arbeit Communications' facility. Discover what lies beneath. Drive an APC through the arctic wastes. Confront the rebels on their doorstep and uncover a long-forgotten secret."</p>

<p>Why are they doing it this now? They're going for <em>full</em> Steam Deck support and they said having it run Native on the Steam Deck avoids various font issues they saw with Proton. Nice to see more developers, even on mods like this, opt for full direct Linux support.</p>
<p>Once it's properly ready, I look forward to giving it a full run through!</p>

      <title>YoYo Games open source the GameMaker HTML5 runtime</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one for open source fans and game developers, as YoYo Games have <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/html5-open-source" target="_blank">open sourced</a> their HTML5 runtime. It's now available on <a href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-HTML5" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, under the Apache 2 license.</p>
<p>The idea is to give developers a better idea of how it all works, plus it means that if there's something essential developers need, they can look to add it in themselves when creating their games. Open source (and even "source available") is just far better than hidden proprietary code.</p>
<p>YoYo Games will continue to update it, so it's not just a code-drop and forget type of deal. They are also encouraging others to create Pull Requests to improve it.</p>
<p>Their own Gurpreet S. Matharoo mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a developer, having access to the HTML5 source helps me understand how functions work behind the scenes, so I can get the most out of them.</p>
<p>I find the source easy to understand, as it’s written in JavaScript, which is similar to GML Code in terms of readability and usage. It’s a breeze compared to reading a source written in C or C++.</p>
<p>In addition to getting to look behind the curtain, I can now submit my own changes if I happen to come across bugs or functions that I can improve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like it makes it easy for game devs to tweak and test it too, with the GameMaker Beta allowing you to pick a different runtime and select your own downloaded version of the code. So you can easily test it locally for your own games, and before potentially sending fixes directly to the new GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Good stuff. Hopefully this is the start of more of GameMaker being open.</p>

      <title>Spider-Man: Miles Morales gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello web slingers! Good news for you, as Spider-Man: Miles Morales has been formally Steam Deck Verified ahead of the release later this week. Yes, it's releasing this week (November 18th), and I didn't realise it was that close either. Going to say goodbye to my backlog for a while again I think.</p>
<p>Sharing the news via Twitter, Nixxes Software <a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1592185956710453248" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21189211841668512354gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21189211841668512354gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see it get full testing, just like we saw with Spider-Man Remastered. I look forward to playing a good few hours in this one too.</p>
<p>Will you be picking it up? Might want to ensure you've got the space ready, as it will take up at least 75 GB (probably more for us, due to shaders and Proton files). So it might be time to pick a couple to remove ready, unless you have a nice big SD Card.</p>
<p>I'll be doing my usual video of such a big release, should be up later on release day.</p>

      <title>Rhythm Doctor now has Native Linux support in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After originally improving Rhythm Doctor for the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/popular-and-unique-musical-game-rhythm-doctor-gets-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">earlier this year</a>, they've now decided to do Native Linux support with it available now.</p>
<p>What is it? Save patients with your rhythm mastery! Rhythm Doctor is a rhythm game where you heal patients by defibrillating in time to their heartbeats. Learn each patient's unique heartbeat and defeat boss viruses trying to sabotage your rhythm, all set to heart-pumping, soul-soothing music.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/774181/view/3395178347899045124" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux compatibility:</p>
Added native compatibility with Linux! Make sure to disable “Force the use of a Steam Play compatibility tool” so Steam will download the native version. (big effort from huantian!)<br/>
 
<p>- Should work on most modern Linux distributions, but have only tested on Ubuntu, Arch, and NixOS. Requires GTK for file pickers and xdg-open for opening files, these should also be installed on most distributions.<br/>
- Note: True window dance on Linux has been disabled, as it doesn’t seem to work well with all Linux desktop environments or window managers. Window dance is set to Simulate by default instead.<br/>
- Make sure to keep an eye out for any Linux related issues or bugs, such as issues with the file chooser or explorer, or custom level saving and loading. If you find any, contact us via our discord server: <a href="https://7thbe.at/discord" target="_blank">https://7thbe.at/discord</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also included a sweet little update image for it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11338981668427066gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There was also quite a number of gameplay changes included, for anyone who already played it. Sounds like playing it might be a little easier now, with some frame offset issues solved plus various improvements to the level editor were also included.</p>
<p>See the official trailer below:</p>

      <title>shapez 2 an automation, management &amp; factory-building game announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of games like Factorio, the original shapez was a pretty fun take on the automation and factory-building genre and it's getting a bigger follow-up with shapez 2. It will include Native Linux support once again too.</p>
<p>It's going from 2D to 3D too, with the aim to be much bigger and have a higher production value this time. However, they will include the option to switch between 2D and 3D modes which could be quite interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20724308781668426545gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20724308781668426545gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The goal is the same as before: build up a huge factory in order to process increasing numbers, types, and colours of shapes. Build machines, place down long conveyor belts and design vast transport networks. However, this time it will spice things up with a layers system, letting you build across 3 layers you can swap between and build across all of them.</p>
<p>Not only that, the machines themselves will be more open so you can see them actually doing the cutting. Sounds like it could be pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Additionally, the maps will look to be more interesting. Instead of a basic flat map, shapez 2 will have island you need to craft to expand your building area. Linking in with that, mass transport that gives you access to a sort-of train like system to get goods everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6408518841668426627gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6408518841668426627gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No release date set yet.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Salt and Sanctuary gets Cloud Saves and OSK support for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Salt and Sanctuary has seen an update recently which brings with it Cloud Saves, along with better Steam Deck support. The update initially landed for the Windows version, but it has now been put into the Linux and macOS versions too.</p>
<p>Version 1.0.0.9 brings with it</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Saves.</li>
<li>Bigger inventory size.</li>
<li>Quite a few bug fixes.</li>
<li>Various gameplay improvements and co-op updates.</li>
<li>Support for automatically bringing up the Steam Deck on-screen keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloud Saves being the most important thing here, since now you can nicely switch between a PC and a Steam Deck, and continue your game from where you left it. Hopefully we will see more developers go back and add that into their games for a better player experience.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.4 rolls out in Preview for the Steam Deck - it&#39;s a massive upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has done another weekend drop here, with a Preview version of SteamOS 3.4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3383920059429575957" target="_blank">now available</a> for the Steam Deck. This is easily one of the biggest updates they've done to the system since release, and there's so many changes that improve the experiences across the whole device.</p>
<p>This includes massive upgrades to the Desktop Mode, an upgraded Arch Linux package base, the performance overlay was changed for Level 2 to show the details along the top of the screen instead of going down the left, external drive upgrades and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>New style of Level 2 for the Performance Overlay:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12409952431668247579gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12409952431668247579gol1.jpeg"/></a>Looking good!</em></p>
<p>Currently SteamOS 3.4 is using kernel 5.13 (with various Valve patches) and Mesa 22.2.0.</p>
<p>Words and pictures are great but here's a video showcasing some of the changes:</p>

      <title>WW1 shooter Isonzo gets performance improvements for the Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>M2H and BlackMill Games have released another update to the WW1 shooter Isonzo, this time it's better news for the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Along with their continued updates improving various parts of the game, as it did launch in a bit of a buggy state, although enjoyable they mentioned "Linux performance improvements" were part of this patch so if you're sticking with the Native Linux build you might have a better time now.</p>
<p>Since I last tried it, I have some other good news. They seem to have fixed shadows on the Native Linux build on NVIDIA GPUs too so everything isn't blindingly bright.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8031301771668176970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8031301771668176970gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>The full patch notes are below:</p>

<li>New first person bashing animation variants for pistols</li>
<li>New first person stabbing animation variants for bayonets</li>
<li>Improved speed and animation timing for melee attacks in first person</li>
<li>Player is now slightly higher in first person</li>
<li>Split Player tags and World tags visibility settings</li>
<li>Improvements to mortar aiming visibility</li>
<li>Improved info panels for mortar and overview map</li>
<li>Linux performance improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed players sometimes appearing like they are from the wrong team and therefore could be killed by teammates</li>
<li>Bots no longer use Static weapons if enemies are too far away</li>
<li>Headgear no longer clips through the gas mask</li>
<li>Fixed Villar Perosa sound or muzzle flash sometimes missing in third person</li>
<li>Fixed LMGs continuing to auto-fire while crawling</li>
<li>Fixed full-auto firing animations not always playing in sync with fire rate</li>
<li>Fixed animation snapping at the end of bayonet stab and revolver bash</li>
<li>Fix for field guns animation snapping when first deploying to one on a slope</li>
<li>Fixed fingers clipping through binoculars when looking through them</li>
<li>Fixed Werndl cocking bone not setting when interrupting reloads</li>
<li>Fixed bridge explosions replaying after switching graphics settings</li>
<li>Corrected size of some pistols and flareguns</li>
<li>Fixed Allow voice chat option not resetting to default</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect names for Gorizia and Sabotino Capzones</li>
<li>Sector outlines are now red when in cooldown</li>
</ul>
<p>Known issues:</p>
<ul>

      <title>Call of the Wild: The Angler gets updated to fix the launch crash on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Call of the Wild: The Angler from developer Expansive Worlds launched on Steam on August 31, and sadly it was broken but now they've fixed it. This is the same team that made the rather good theHunter: Call of the Wild, and while it hasn't been reviewing as well it's still good to see it getting updated.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck, it would just crash during launch. In Hotfix version 1.1.2, they said "It aims to fix the issues Steam Deck users were encountering when trying to launch the game. We knew how important it was for Deck players and we appreciate the patience you've shown while we worked on a solution.".</p>
<p>Additionally they seem to plan further improvements as they also said "While this is not full Steam Deck support yet, we're currently looking into making The Angler fully compatible with Valve's handheld in the future."</p>

      <title>A Plague Tale: Requiem gets Steam Deck support in a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck by Valve, A Plague Tale: Requiem from Focus Entertainment and Asobo Studio has a new update out to help.</p>
<p>Going by various reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1182900" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, it was possible to play it, but it wasn't a great experience so hopefully this update actually improves things as they claim.</p>
<p>They didn't go into any real specifics (annoyingly) on what's actually changed other than now being "compatible" with the Steam Deck. The full <a href="https://forums.focus-entmt.com/topic/64215/patch-notes-update-09-11-22" target="_blank">patch notes</a> are below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patch Notes common to all platforms</strong><br/>
<u>Changes &amp; Updates</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Balanced difficulty in “Nothing Left” and “Dying Sun” final arena fights.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Optimization</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized AI, rats, terrain and navmesh to reduce framerate drops and freezing issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Bug Fixes</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed HDR issues creating crushed highlights (not applicable to Nintendo Switch).</li>
<li>Fixed random crashes or blockers that could happen in some chapters.</li>
<li>Fixed blockers or animation bugs that could happen during some crank interactions.</li>
<li>Fixed issue during reaction between Ignifer pot and Odoris in specific cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a script issue that could make the pine cones thrown by Hugo in “Under a New Sun” invisible.</li>
<li>Improved cart collisions to prevent going out of the map.</li>
<li>Fixed minor visual bugs in some chapters.</li>
<li>Fixed unexpected change of audio language when changing other options.</li>
<li>Fixed minor issues in German language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patch Notes specific to PC</strong><br/>
<u>Changes &amp; Updates</u></p>
<ul>
<li>The game is now compatible with Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Optimization</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new graphics options to improve visual and performance customizations (Frame limiter, Resolution optimizer, SSAO, DOF, Screen Space Shadows, Motion Blur).</li>
<li>Improved auto setting graphic profiles to better match PC configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Bug Fixes</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed specular flickering issues with DLSS.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's likely with the optimizations they did, along with the graphics options settings, they're now setting them at sane defaults for the Steam Deck to make it have an acceptable performance level. An educated guess, but most likely what they've done. Still good to see even more developers actually fix things directly for the Steam Deck like this.</p>

      <title>Tetris Effect: Connected gets some fixes for Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/" target="_blank">Tetris Effect: Connected</a>, the reinvention of one of the most popular puzzle games of all time, has a big new update out that should solve some Linux and Steam Deck problems.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://twitter.com/parkerreed/status/1565097500293210113" target="_blank">pointed out</a> to me a while ago, that for some reason the developers had locked out the ability to change the game resolution when playing it through Proton. This seemed to affect people playing in desktop mode, docked to a monitor and on desktop Linux too.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it was a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1003590/discussions/0/3492004456593230612/" target="_blank">bug</a> and it has now been sorted.</p>
<p>From the V1.3.3 <a href="https://www.tetriseffect.game/2022/11/10/all-platforms-patch-1-3-3/" target="_blank">patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[STEAM DECK] Added support for selecting your LOCATION on a Steam Deck.  If you have not set your LOCATION yet, the setting screen will pop up when you select EFFECT MODES or MULTIPLAYER &gt; RANKED MATCH. This setting can now also be changed in OPTIONS &gt; GAMEPLAY &gt; LOCATION.</p>
<p>[STEAM DECK] Added support to change the GAME RESOLUTION settings on a Steam Deck when docked to a monitor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see developers pay attention and improve Steam Deck / Linux with their games. They even did their own Steam Deck video a while ago on it:</p>

      <title>Stadia refunds are starting to begin, no word on Controller Bluetooth yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google has announced that they've now begun the process to refund years of Stadia game purchases, as the service is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/google-gives-up-on-stadia-will-offer-refunds-on-games-and-hardware/" target="_blank">shutting down</a>.</p>
<p>In the updated FAQ entry, Google noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting 9 November 2022, Stadia will attempt to automatically process refunds for all purchases of games, add-on content and subscription fees other than Stadia Pro made through the Stadia Store. We ask for your patience as we work through each transaction and ask that you refrain from contacting customer support as they will not be able to expedite your refund during this time. We still expect the majority of refunds to be processed by 18 January 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google said if you don't have a Google account now, they will still process the refund. If there are any card issues (lost / stolen / new card), you should at some point receive an email giving you instructions on how to still get your Stadia refund. They also said some people may need to sign up with Payoneer to get their refund, in some special cases where they cannot process it directly.</p>
<p>The same date has been given for Hardware purchases which include the Stadia Controller, Founder's Edition, Premiere Edition and Play and Watch with Google TV packages but you keep the hardware after the refund.</p>
<p>Sadly though, it seems there's still no update on them enabling Bluetooth in the Stadia Controller so it's wired-only which is a pretty big shame if they don't do it. It's a really comfy controller to use but they are under no obligation to enable Bluetooth, since they're refunding the hardware completely. <em>At least I own a bit of weird computing history now…</em></p>
<p>As for moving progress from Stadia to elsewhere they said that <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575922767593078793%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575558847250411521%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575818132492636162%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">I/O Interactive</a>, <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/stadia/sp-technical/issue/1709/where-are-my-game-saves-located-1" target="_blank">CD Projekt Red</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsColourTV/status/1582853316727275522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582853316727275522%7Ctwgr%5Eafc6ee3e194990b1733f7c6ec8cea5cefe606d5f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Frockstarintel.com%2Frockstar-games-announced-transfer-progression-for-red-dead-online-stadia-players" target="_blank">Rockstar Games</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/10/20/elder-scrolls-online-stadia/" target="_blank">Bethesda</a> have already shared plans on that but it's down to each developer and publisher to sort it.</p>

      <title>dbrand issued an update on Killswitch replacements, Dock compatibility and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the recent issue dbrand had with their <a href="https://dbrand.com/killswitch" target="_blank">Killswitch</a> magnets causing issues with some Steam Deck fans, they've issued an update on how it's going and other changes due to Dock compatibility.</p>
<p>Firstly, for the Killswitch Case redesign, it sounds like it's going well. In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/yrryt8/project_killswitch_dock_compatibility_and_more/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, they showed off some fresh pictures of the new lock design without magnets, along with an upgraded kickstand that now includes Micro SD card holder slots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1819318081668166975gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1819318081668166975gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699528481668166976gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699528481668166976gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13414741071668166977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13414741071668166977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As a result of the changes, the kickstand they say is now "10% lighter" too.</p>
<p>When to expect them? They are on target for January 2023.</p>
<p>Remember when they said reservations would get free Portal Stick Grips that didn't happen? They apologised and said they've now had time to make more so if you did place the reservation and ordered, they will be sending them out.</p>
<p>The other subject is Docking Station compatibility. The Killswitch Case does not fit in a lot of docks, like the official Valve dock. So they're now going to be doing a USB-C extender so you can actually plug it in and a low-profile plastic "bucket" that serves as an adapter so it can actually sit in the dock with the case on. dbrand said they are not aiming to make a profit on those, as they will be "priced according to parts and labor" and that anyone who received the older magnetic version of the case would get them free in the upcoming reshipment of the new case. For everyone else, you can buy them standalone or add them to your order.</p>
<p>Here's how the USB-C extender and bucket look:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12004355141668166977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12004355141668166977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The bucket looks fine but wow that USB-C extender sure does look ugly and out of place, they probably can't make it much shorter though so it will have to do.</p>
<p>I do find it odd they only posted this on Reddit, and not in an email to actual customers though. I guess they assume they will reach most people there but if you don't go on Reddit, you would miss it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta improves on-screen keyboard and offline mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two areas that could use some love are being tweaked, with a new Steam Deck Client Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3383920059425809022" target="_blank">available now</a> with various fixes and upgrades. This is available in Beta and Preview. To change over you can find it in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Offline Mode especially has been a nuisance for a lot of people, just not working as expected in many areas so it's nice to see Valve make some more fixes there too.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed downloads page crashing when starting in offline mode</li>
<li>Downloads page now properly responds to online/offline status</li>
<li>Virtual Keyboard now has a maximum width, so that it doesn't stretch to an unusable size on large screens in Docked mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Desktop Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue preventing the Virtual Keyboard from accessing the clipboard and being able to perform paste operations</li>
<li>Fixed duplicate dialogs (e.g. uninstall dialog) after opening the standalone keyboard or controller configurator</li>
<li>Fixed regression where Browse Local Files was no longer working</li>
<li>Fixed circular download progress indicator being broken in game entry list</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the library UI would not render in offline mode</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where custom artwork and local screenshots were not found when running with -newbigpicture</li>
<li>Fixed issue where transitioning from Desktop =&gt; BPM =&gt; Desktop would cause the Friends List to be signed out</li>
<li>Fixed issue where advanced display settings were not visible outside of the Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the old Big Picture Mode was started when the checkbox in Settings =&gt; Interface specified that Big Picture Mode should be the startup UI, even though -newbigpicture was specified.</li>
<li>Fixed Virtual Keyboard not working properly when brought up manually or by automatically by the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve are also being odd with Deck Verified again. They've recently moved Battlefield 1 from Playable to Unsupported, even though on Proton Experimental it works amazingly well and I only just recently did a video (below) to show it off and I was really impressed by it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="esHemt9SSQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/590e52f8f39a7de87d451d48efe52a8b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/esHemt9SSQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Valve did the same for It Takes Two, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered and other EA games. So it's quite likely this is as a result of the recent switch from Origin to the EA app, despite them already fixing it in Proton Experimental — something they seem to have no problem setting by default for other games. I'm going to put this down to some sort of Deck Verified testing issue that isn't taking Proton Experimental into account.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 525.53 Beta is out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux, it's your time to test something new. NVIDIA have released a Beta driver with <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/194315/en-uk" target="_blank">version 525.53</a>.</p>
<p>As always with anything with a Beta tag: here be dragons. It may have issues that will be solved in the next Stable release, so if you want a solid experience stick to your current drivers. It's not usually too long before NVIDIA drivers go from Beta to Stable.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Dynamic Boost to not engage on certain Ampere GPU based notebooks.</li>
<li>Added support for Dynamic Boost on notebooks with AMD CPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that resulted in stutter when moving windows in GNOME.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless extension.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to prevent the creation of display layouts that exceed hardware size limitations when using the SLI Mosaic configuration page, and to display a warning if such a layout is created manually in the Display Configuration page.</li>
<li>Removed the hard dependency on GTK 2 when building nvidia-settings from source. nvidia-settings may now be built with support for GTK 2 only, GTK 3 only, or both GTK 2 and GTK 3.</li>
<li>Updated the open kernel modules to support Quadro Sync, Stereo, rotation in X11, and YUV 4:2:0 on Turing.</li>
<li>Updated an error message that nvidia-installer displays when kernel header files cannot be found to print full paths for the missing files.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to use "command -v" in place of depending on "which" to determine the availability and location of certain tools.</li>
<li>Implemented support for over-the-air updates in the Proton and Wine NVIDIA NGX build. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Updated the Vulkan driver so that the following extensions no longer depend on nvidia-uvm.ko being loaded at runtime:
<ul>
<li>* VK_KHR_acceleration_structure<br/>
* VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_query<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline<br/>
* VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur<br/>
* VK_NVX_binary_import<br/>
* VK_NVX_image_view_handle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow use of the "--add-this-kernel" feature by non-root users.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a more accurate progress bar when building the kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a warning message if a Vulkan ICD loader is not detected.</li>
<li>Reworked nvidia-installer's support for DKMS: the kernel modules will now be optionally registered with DKMS after the installer has already built and installed them on its own. nvidia-installer will now register the kernel modules with DKMS by default when the dkms(8) utility is detected on the system.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption in geometry and tessellation control shaders.</li>
<li>Added a new CUDA Debugger implementation for Pascal and newer architectures as a part of the driver package: libcudadebugger.so (previously released separately as "CUDA GDB Developer Preview").</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to correctly limit the allowed values for GPUTargetFanSpeed to match the existing valid fan speed ranges for supported NVIDIA GPUs. The valid ranges are 30%-100% for Ampere or newer GPUs, and 1%-100% for older GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs when starting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crash with Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vulkan-based D3D9, 10 and 11 translation layer DXVK version 2.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a>, the translation layer that converts Direct3D calls to Vulkan for use with Wine and Proton, has a big new release out with <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.0" target="_blank">version 2.0</a>. This is one of the ways that Proton performs so well for Windows games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For this, you will need to ensure you have up to date drivers, they said any Vulkan 1.3 capable driver and Wine version are required now. The new recommend versions are:</p>
<table class="table-stripes-tbody">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Driver</th>
<th>Required version</th>
<th>Recommended version</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>AMD (RADV)</td>
<td>22.0</td>
<td><strong>22.2</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nvidia</td>
<td>510.47.03</td>
<td><strong>520.56.06</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intel (ANV)</td>
<td>22.0</td>
<td><strong>22.2</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As for what's new? A lot! As expected from a major version bump.</p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>, that provides Vulkan support for Native Linux applications has now been upstreamed and merged into DXVK directly so that it "can be used as a drop-in replacement to port D3D applications without having to change rendering code". This is really great and for developers who are looking to port their games, it's breaking down another barrier.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting changes is to shader compiling. Unless games already have their shaders ready, like you see in Steam when it downloads them for you, there will often be a lot of stuttering as the game builds it up with DXVK as you play. That's now changed! If you have drivers that support what's needed, the "shaders will now be compiled at the time the game loads its D3D shaders, rather than at draw time" resulting in reduced or eliminated shader compile stutter. There's some caveats with this though like some games only loading their shaders as you play anyway, 32-bit games may stutter and NVIDIA uses more space.</p>
<p><em>I cannot stress how excited I am for the above on both Steam Deck and Linux desktop!</em></p>
<p>Other highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>D3D9</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the likelihood of running out of address space in 32-bit D3D9 games</li>
<li>Reading from an active render target in D3D9 games is now properly supported, which previously caused rendering artifacts on newer AMD hardware and required driver-level workarounds. This affects a number of games, including GTA IV.</li>
<li>The D3D9 alpha test implementation was changed to more closely match the behaviour of Nvidia's implementation, which fixes inaccuracies in various games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>D3D10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removal of some unused bits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>D3D11</strong>
<ul>
<li>DXVK now exposes D3D11 Feaure Level 12_1 with the following newly added features:
<ul>
<li>Tiled Resources up to <strong>Tier 3</strong>, provided that the corresponding Vulkan sparse binding and sparse residency features are supported</li>
<li>Conservative Rasterization up to <strong>Tier 3</strong>, provided that the corresponding Vulkan conservative rasterization features are supported.</li>
<li>Rasterizer Ordered Views, provided that the corresponding Vulkan fragment shader interlock features are supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closer to Windows behaviour for "immediate contexts and deferred contexts", might help "improve compatibility to third-party libraries and mods that hook into the D3D11 immediate context specifically, and reduces CPU overhead since some frequently used code paths are now more specialized for each context type".</li>
<li>More optimizations to reduce CPU overhead in games like Assassin's Creed: Origins and God of War.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also numerous game-specific bug fixes including issues solved for: Alan Wake, Alice Madness Returns, Anomaly: Warzone Earth, Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon Age Origins, Empire: Total War, Final Fantasy XV, Grand Theft Auto IV, Heroes Of Annihilated Empires, King Of Fighters XIII, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Sonic Generations, Spider Man: Shattered Dimensions, The Ship, Warhammer Online and Ys Seven.</p>
<p>Incredible work from all involved to make Linux gaming better than ever.</p>
<p><em>For Steam Deck users: you'll have to wait for SteamOS updates to bring in a new driver for support for all the features. Some of it is not yet ready in the Mesa GPU drivers for either desktop or Steam Deck.</em></p>

      <title>Fantasy strategy game Winter Falling: Battle Tactics now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Combining elements and being inspired by the likes of FTL and Total War, Winter Falling: Battle Tactics is a pretty unique strategy game. It released recently into Early Access and it has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Something I covered briefly back in 2020, the free prototype can still be played on <a href="https://rarykos.itch.io/winter-falling-price-of-life" target="_blank">itch.io</a> so you can get a feel for it but the new Steam release is much expanded and the developer said they plan to keep it in Early Access until at least 2024. It's a bit of an odd strategy game to describe that's a bit like an icon-view of Total War battles but with resource management too. A small and tightly designed strategy game that's worth a look if you love smaller experiences that somehow still feel grand overall.</p>
<p>Have a look at the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Soulstone Survivors might dethrone the likes of Vampire Survivors for me</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soulstone Survivors is a new Early Access game that arrived with Native Linux support on November 7th, it's also now already one of my favourite games. It works great out of the box too and it appears to be getting quite popular, with a Very Positive user rating and over 14,000 people playing it right now.</p>
<p>Styled like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and many other action horde-style games, you run around using various abilities taking down tons of enemies with completely over the top action. Here there are hundreds of skills, a lot of characters, a lot you can upgrade and they have plans to add in a lot more.</p>
<p>Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_CCubu42vF0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7bd364dca0eb2987bea5f47355831f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_CCubu42vF0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It works great on desktop Linux too! On Fedora Linux, even on max settings it never dropped below 60FPS while I had a video rendering in the background. Seems like they did a good job on the Native Linux build! Really impressed with the quality as well as the gameplay action.</p>
<p>While Vampire Survivors is fun, there’s no doubt in my mind about that and my many hours in it were great, this just has a much better gameplay feel to it and honestly, I prefer the graphical style here too a lot more. The game design just feels more coherent as a whole, although it’s not without flaws. Visibility is an issue, especially on the initial sandy level but no doubt they will work on it. The ridiculous amount of content on top of the satisfying loop will have me coming back often.</p>
<p>Current Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore almost 150 unique Active Skills (and growing!).</li>
<li>Unlock and play with 14 Characters, with many more to come.</li>
<li>Experiment with hundreds of Passive Skills and Runes to customize your characters.</li>
<li>Progress through the Skill Tree with your Soulstones.</li>
<li>Face and defeat powerful Bosses.</li>
<li>Choose Curses that increase your challenge in interesting ways.</li>
<li>Overcome extreme challenges to craft legendary weapons.</li>
<li>Complete dozens of achievements and unlock new powers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 2 had a major upgrade, and Native Linux support is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this was unexpected. Rogue Legacy 2 from Cellar Door Games just had a massive upgrade and they've announced Native Linux and macOS versions are on the way.</p>
<p>Inside the rather long <a href="https://roguelegacy2.com/patchnotes/v110" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even More for the Masses – Now that RL2 has been released on the Nintendo Switch, we're working on native versions for Mac and Linux that we hope to have ready soon. And as a sweet cherry on top, the game has been fully translated in Japanese!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seems game porter and FNA developer Ethan Lee had a hand in this, as mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1590422739873304576" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</em></p>
<p>This fresh update also overhauled the game engine behind the scenes that they said better performance was a goal, with no part of the game left untouched but the experience should remain the same (apart from being smoother overall).</p>
<p>If you've not played it the game is a "genealogical rogue-LITE", that has all the usual bits like randomized runs, changing characters and so on with persistent upgrades but it's all about family. Each time you die your heir rises to take their place and carry on your run, and each is different.</p>

      <title>FSR 2.1 is a game-changer for Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 from CD PROJEKT RED recently had a big <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/46420/patch-1-61-list-of-changes" target="_blank">1.61 patch</a> out, and with it came support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.1.</p>
<p>Previously CP2077 only had FSR 1.0 and the amount of improvements between 1.0 and 2.1 for FSR is crazy. The picture quality is massively improved, as shown with my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0Bgy5Eabw" target="_blank">Dying Light 2 video</a>, and for Cyberpunk 2077 the difference is quite striking. Picture quality pretty close to native resolution, with a vastly improved FPS and frame-timing. It's like a complete night and day difference.</p>
<p>Have a look at the comparison below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wvuDVGMPQNk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0f6152dd1ebf46b81bae8f7d13ad55b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wvuDVGMPQNk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm <em>amazed</em> by it. Until now, I was really struggling to get enough enjoyment out of Cyberpunk 2077 because it's such an intensive game on your system. On my Fedora Linux desktop, it's simply unplayable, as the controls don't work properly and my character keeps staring at the floor or ceiling and I've never figured out why. On Steam Deck though, it controls well and now thanks to this — looks and performs much better too. </p>
<p>Hopefully more developers will go back to add in FSR 2.1 to their games, it's awesome.</p>
<p>You can buy it for Linux / Steam Deck directly on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with text sizing in CP2077 on Steam Deck (and fixing some being distorted with FSR 2.1), here's a mod you can try:</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets Halo Infinite working again on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having issues with the latest major update for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240440/Halo_Infinite/" target="_blank">Halo Infinite</a> on Steam Deck or Linux desktop? Valve has already released a Proton Hotfix update to sort it.</p>
<p>The fix is available in "Proton Hotfix" which is a completely <em>separate</em> version of Proton compared with the default Proton 7 and even Proton Experimental. So if you have it set to Proton Experimental currently, which is where Valve initially got it working, you need to <em>unset</em> it (remove the tick in the compatibility menu) and so it will pick up the Proton Hotfix on Steam Deck. For <em>desktop</em> Linux, you will need to force it to Proton Hotfix manually. If you have any trouble, search for Proton Hotfix in your Steam Library to make sure it is installed and updated.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8ihZSkw_fOM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a59b5e53360f4c9ee89d4389a203361.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8ihZSkw_fOM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I tested Proton Hotfix on Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux desktop — works for both. Great job Valve and CodeWeavers on the compatibility fix there so quickly.</p>
<p>Some of the big stuff that's new in Halo Infinite includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Network Co-Op Campaign</li>
<li>Campaign Mission Replay</li>
<li>New Campaign Achievements</li>
<li>Forge Mode (Beta)</li>
<li>Progression Improvements</li>
<li>Winter Update Battle Pass</li>
<li>Upcoming Events</li>
<li>New Multiplayer Mode: Covert One-Flag</li>
<li>New Multiplayer Maps</li>
<li>Matchmaking Improvements</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Client Beta adds a new launch option for Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are working fast to clean up this New Big Picture Mode taken from the Steam Deck, with another Steam Client Beta for desktops <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948454656201" target="_blank">out now</a>.</p>
<p>There's now two different launch arguments you can use, depending on how you play with Steam. There's the original "-gamepadui" to launch directly into the newer Big Picture Mode but there's also now "-newbigpicture", which will start in desktop mode but allow you to launch into the new Big Picture Mode (so the button doesn't launch into the old one).</p>
<p>The full changes below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed inaccurate regions where clicking would allow dragging the Friends List</li>
<li>Fixed inaccurate location of context menus for the Friends List</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Added command-line argument -newbigpicture which will cause the Steam Client to use the New Big Picture Mode, while starting in Desktop mode. This is separate from -gamepadui, which will cause the Steam Client to start in the New Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues where UI would show in the main window instead of the Overlay</li>
<li>Added work-around for crash caused by older NVIDIA drivers that prevented showing additional information in the Settings =&gt; System panel</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>The Xbox extended features driver has been updated for Windows 11</li>
<li>Fixed hang when the Amazon Luna controller rumbles on macOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo controllers while streaming</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a few extra fixes in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3425577645381338803" target="_blank">Beta</a> update last night, which pulls in a few useful sounding fixes for the Steam Deck. This is available in Beta and Preview. To change over you can find it in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added error dialog for when the user clicks on a mailto link</li>

<li>Fixed issue in desktop mode that sometimes made it difficult to drag the Friends List</li>
<li>Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo Switch controllers while streaming</li>
<li>Fixed inaccurate location of context menus for the Friends List in desktop mode</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could prevent exiting offline mode in the same session where the client entered offline mode</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, I did a little video on Battlefield 1 on Steam Deck recently and I was quite impressed overall by how it runs and it's pretty fun:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA PhysX 5.1 SDK goes open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now under a BSD license, today NVIDIA put up the NVIDIA PhysX 5.1 SDK as open source which is great to see from team green.</p>
<p>Something they now use in NVIDIA Omniverse, their real-time graphics collaboration platform, it wasn't entirely clear if they would open it up like previous versions but now they have. Great for game devs and anyone else who wants to see what they're doing with it.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/open-source-simulation-expands-with-nvidia-physx-5-release/" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<p>“Having a powerful, open-source tool for physics like NVIDIA’s new PhysX 5 library is a critical part of the realism delivered by the Open 3D Engine,” said Royal O’Brien, Executive Director at the Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Digital Media and Games at the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>“As PhysX use cases spread to other important 3D domains like simulation and digital twins, we are excited to see NVIDIA working with open source, allowing everyone to harness the innovation and collaboration that these communities can bring,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p>What is PhysX exactly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PhysX is a library for representing three dimensional worlds made of discrete entities named actors which can in turn be composed of multiple shapes. PhysX lets the user create and destroy such actors, and tracks their explicit or proximity based interactions. Actors can either be static, be moved around by the user, or be moved by PhysX according to the laws of classical mechanics. PhysX’ dynamics simulation capability includes support for collision, joints and actuation using maximal and/or reduced coordinates. Furthermore, the world may be queried by the user using a number of different tools ranging from simple ray-casts to sweep and overlap tests. PhysX provides extensions for special purpose functionality such as vehicle simulation.</p>
<p>PhysX is designed to be robust, high performance, scalable, portable, as well as easy to integrate and use. These capabilities make PhysX suitable as a foundation technology for game engines and other real time simulation systems.</p>
<cite>NVIDIA Documentation</cite></blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA said in the announcement their plan is to also bundle Flow (combustible fluid, fire and smoke simulation) and Blast (a destruction library) which don't depend on PhysX, but they've decided to include that too under the same open source license.</p>
<p>Seems like NVIDIA plan to up open more of Omniverse too as time goes on.</p>

      <title>Nebula is a starship colony sim with RPG adventures styled like RimWorld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/inspired-by-factorio-and-rimworld-space-colony-building-sim-stardeus-out-in-early-access/" target="_blank">Stardeus</a> is not the only RimWorld inspired space colony sim around, with Nebula being another that plans to release in 2023. It recently finished crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chaossystematic/nebula-2/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with $87,290 from backers. You can support it still via their <a href="https://chaossystematic.myshopify.com/" target="_blank">SlackerBacker</a>.</p>
<p>In Nebula you build up your starship, and then guide it through space and explore "millions" of star systems and planets that feature "diverse factions and unique environments". So it's basically a blending of RimWorld and Stardeus together. See the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BTx19RQMki8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5df9ec48382be1f4e23ab77917d1881a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BTx19RQMki8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Certainly sounds and looks good, although it is very ambitious. With space and planet exploration, along with your colonists each having simulated physical and personality traits there's a lot going on. The quest system sounds like a lot of fun too having you do all sorts of things including retrieving valuable artifacts and defending locals from invasions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the amount of funding they gathered a few extras will be added in like animal taming, a full soundtrack, Z-Levels (underground exploration), moons, vehicles and more. Seems like it's worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>In the Kickstarter FAQ, they confirmed their plans for other platforms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the Early Access phase, we are also planning to bring Nebula to the Mac and Linux platforms.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Sonic Frontiers works on Steam Deck and Linux desktop although it has issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Frontiers is a big new release on Steam from SEGA and it does work out of the box on Steam Deck, although it has certain issues.</p>
<p>For starters, I noticed that unless I limited it to 30FPS in the game settings, the lighting would flicker and be unplayable. Searching around, I'm not the only one that saw this although some were lucky and did not. Hopefully either a game update or Proton update will eventually fix it for everyone. Shadows can be problematic as well, keeping that setting on Low solves any issues there too. Valve has marked it as Unsupported for now but it does work.</p>
<p>Using the latest GE-Proton, it also remains mostly smooth with the DXVK_ASYNC setting. Here's a video look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5NiAUGPAYIg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f291b292e481cd68109e3dc1129a28b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5NiAUGPAYIg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>For an example of the flickering, see <a href="https://youtu.be/qya0jTFZiRs" target="_blank">this unlisted video</a> (there's plenty of worse areas).</em></p>
<p>As for <em>desktop</em> Linux, it seems to be better there with an NVIDIA GPU on max settings. It definitely doesn't stick to 60FPS even with my 2080Ti and a Ryzen 7 5800X with plenty of drops down here and there at 1080p depending on what you're doing, but overall it remains somewhat smooth.</p>
<p>Here, the lighting issue at 60FPS still seems to be present but at times it can be easy to miss. When running around, you can see a brief flick between light and dark that doesn't happen often, whereas on the Deck, the flickering of lighting is <em>constant</em> unless in 30FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6055856081667917497gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6055856081667917497gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Sonic Frontiers on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>Seems like overall it needs a fair bit more optimisation, as a game like this performing like it does doesn't seem right. Playable and seems quite fun actually but performance is an issue, as are the graphical issues noted especially so on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sonic-frontiers?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237320/Sonic_Frontiers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells gets a free indie cross-over update, Terraria 1.4.5 will see Dead Cells content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two games are doing an indie crossover, with a Dead Cells update out now and the next Terraria update will also include some Dead Cells content.</p>
<p>For Dead Cells that's updated already, the developer added in quite a bit including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Terraria - 'The Guide' and the heavenly sword Starfury! Striking enemies with this gloriously pink sword causes fragments of stars to fall from the sky, dealing critical hits to other enemies around you. The drawback is that it's a relatively slow and static weapon, but chuck a few dodge rolls in there and you'll be fine.</li>
<li>Shovel Knight - King Scepter! Shovel Knight will be shoulder bashing your enemies to launch himself into the air, then spinning around the screen drilling enemies into the ground with critical hits. Bouncing on an enemy let's you charge again, so see how long you can keep the chain going!</li>
<li>Hotline Miami - Jacket and his trusty Baseball Bat are swinging into Dead Cells, with not one, not two, but three different masks. The Baseball bat crits on stunned enemies, so you're basically required to hit enemies while they're down... Look out for the damage number VFX pulled from Hotline Miami too!</li>
<li>Katana ZERO - Throwable Objects stun your enemies, allowing you to close the distance and get some shots in, or give you time to charge the katana's dash attack... You've only got 3 charges of throwable stuff, so you'll need to kill enemies to refill your stash.</li>
<li>Slay the Spire - The Diverse Deck translates each of the 4 classes from Slay the Spire into one complex skill. You will initially gain a passive power from one class. You can play with this passive for as long as you like, then activating it provides a one-off boost effect, and the skill moves on to the next class.</li>
<li>Risk of Rain - The Laser Glaive is irresistibly drawn to enemy after enemy, rebounding around the screen dealing damage to as many foes as possible. It gains damage after each extra enemy it hits and will start dealing crits after hitting multiple enemies. Not bad for crowd control...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the new trailer for more:</p>

<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Re-Logic have <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-is-coming-in-2023-including-terraria-x-dead-cells.116264/" target="_blank">announced</a> Terraria 1.4.5 will be coming next year, and with it some Dead Cells content. They're not saying exactly what though. Sounds like work on it hasn't begun yet so more details to come next year on that.</p>

      <title>Steam gets a whole lot of improvements for the new Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still not quite ready yet it seems but Valve are pushing out lots of changes for the new Big Picture Mode, taken from the Steam Deck. Released in a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948450355513" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a>, there's quite a lot of improvements and fixes this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/235584031667913529gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/235584031667913529gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some scaling issues that led to UI being offset slightly in various places</li>
<li>Center the Big Picture Mode window when not running in fullscreen mode (i.e. when -windowed is passed as a command-line argument)</li>
<li>Fixed issue where navigating to the Steam Store would sit at the loading screen (e.g. after exiting BPM to return to the desktop UI, and then back to BPM)</li>
<li>Fixed some issues where the UI would not navigate properly within the Overlay</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the controller configurator would not be displayed within the Overlay for some games that Steam calls to open it</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the incorrect Patch Notes were displayed</li>
<li>Fixed issue with the Virtual Keyboard also showing in the main window when it was invoked within the Overlay</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the footer would update in the main window when the user was navigating the UI in the Overlay</li>
<li>Removed Steam Deck specific dialog warning the user about running multiple games</li>
<li>When installing a game always show the install location picker if there is more than one library folder, and automatically focus the default library folder when the dialog shows up</li>
<li>Add a toggle to Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Advanced to force GPU accelerated rendering for GPUs that are in the embedded browser's blocklist</li>
<li>Fixed automatically switching audio devices on launch on Linux</li>
<li>Fixed the old version of Big Picture Mode opening when hitting the Steam/Guide button on the Steam window</li>
<li>Fixed issues where the main window would close and then be reloaded:
<ul>
<li>When selecting a friend in the previously or recently played</li>
<li>When selecting a guide in a game's Community Feed</li>
<li>When selecting the "Downloading" label on a game's detail page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Center the popup controller configurator window when viewing controller layout</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam would be unable to connect in some cases after suspend/resume</li>
<li>Fixed recently played games not showing up in the MRU list on the notification area icon or the Recent Games shelf in library</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bug where opening the Steam menu (at least on Fedora KDE Plasma + NVIDIA) shows what's behind the Big Picture Mode window is still present, annoyingly. Hopefully Valve will solve that one soon as well. Trying to open the Quick Access Menu (Xbox button + A for example) sometimes brings up the main Steam menu first too, it's a little too quick to react at times. Still, even in the rough state it's still in right now, it's going to be a lot better than the original Big Picture Mode.</p>

      <title>Surprising probably no one, most people use the Steam Deck as a handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, I ran two different polls to find out how people with a Steam Deck used their device (or if they didn't much) and the results are out now.</p>
<p>The key thing about the Steam Deck, is that while it is a handheld it's also a full Linux PC with a desktop mode. Many docks are available for it from different brands now and even the official Docking Station from Valve is out and has been for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">about a month</a> now.</p>
<p>So I was keen to find out how what percentage of people actually used it mainly docked, partly also because I use now the vast majority of my time with it docked. Turns out, not a whole lot of other people do.</p>
<p>From over 4,000 votes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">our YouTube Channel</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5824387571667836197gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5824387571667836197gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">our Twitter</a> from over 1,000 votes paints a very similar picture.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3946000081667836359gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3946000081667836359gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What a shock, over 70% of people using a handheld use it as a handheld. I know, it's not breaking news but I found it interesting, because of how much I use it docked myself and how I've seen a lot of comments of others doing the same. Turns out though, it's a really small amount of people overall.</p>
<p>I suppose it didn't help that the docked experience wasn't great at release, and it still has plenty of issues now, like I noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/thoughts-on-the-official-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">my article on the official Docking Station</a> not always displaying on my TV.</p>
<p>Another bit I wanted to highlight, was a really interesting comment on the GOL YouTube Channel about this from user "MechanicalMonk", which I <em>can't</em> link to as the original poll was <em>removed</em> to add an extra missed option. Anyway, they mentioned that people buying the Switch would have done so <em>anyway</em> because it's Nintendo and many people use it exclusively docked as it just happens to be a handheld (although, there is the newer handheld-only Lite). On the other hand, people would have been far less likely to buy the Steam Deck if it wasn't a handheld and so it favours that. Just an interesting thought.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? How do you use it?</em></p>

      <title>American Truck Simulator - Texas releases on November 15th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Soft have announced the big American Truck Simulator - Texas DLC will be releasing on November 15th.</p>
<p>A DLC no doubt many have been waiting for to take in the sights. One exciting element to it that SCS detailed in a previous <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/10/texas-space-industry.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, is that the Space Industry will be nicely featured in this DLC. They mentioned how "Texas is home to state-of-the-art development and test sites for multiple commercial space firms, and research shows that the space industry is big work for the state, bringing in 11 billion dollars per year in revenue and providing hundred of thousands of jobs. So it wouldn't be right for us to miss this out-of-this-world opportunity to include it in our upcoming Texas DLC for American Truck Simulator".</p>
<p>Thanks to their work you'll be able to see some pretty fun spacey things as you travel around, including a certain famous space centre that they said is really worth passing by in your trucks. </p>
<p>See their 3 minute trailer below:</p>

      <title>AMD becomes a &#39;Diamond&#39; sponsor of OBS Studio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a> announced that AMD have become a Diamond Sponsor of the OBS Project, helping fund future development. Great to see, as OBS Studio is easily one of the most popular free and open source applications around and something I use near-daily.</p>
<p>It was announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1588301361275441154" target="_blank">Twitter</a> with a short message just confirming it, with no other details.</p>
<p>What it means is that AMD are now funding OBS with at least $50,000 per year, joining NVIDIA and StreamElements at the same level. OBS also has many additional sponsors including YouTube, Logitech, Twitch, Facebook and others giving over plenty of funding and other help to the project.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This really is amazing to see. The last few years have seen so many positive stories like this for free and open source projects. Blender is another that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/volkswagen-begins-funding-blender-development/" target="_blank">keeps pulling in</a> more funding, Godot Engine just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/godot-engine-now-has-its-own-dedicated-foundation-for-funding/" target="_blank">launched their own Foundation</a> and even the Kdenlive video editor funding campaign I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/kde-are-raising-funds-for-the-kdenlive-video-editor/" target="_blank">mentioned previously</a> has reached over the original goal.</p>
<p><em>Good times for FOSS projects.</em></p>

      <title>Comedy point and click adventure Plot of the Druid is now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The point and click adventures just keep coming! Plot of the Druid has released featuring some more sarcastic British humour and classic, hand-drawn art. It's currently in Early Access, with Native Linux support. Another that was funded via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/plot-of-the-druid/plot-of-the-druid" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the developer receiving $32,303 to help make it real.</p>
<p>"A disgraced druid apprentice goes on a quest to prevent the world from going crazy by restoring balance to the forces of love, wisdom, and wealth. A mystical comedy adventure with sarcastic British wit, hand-drawn cartoon art, and an innovative shape-shifting ability for solving puzzles. Plot of the Druid is a classic-modern point-and-click game that’s reminiscent of Simon the Sorcerer, Discworld, and Harry Potter."</p>

<li>Beautiful hand-painted HD artwork in the style of old-school pixel art.</li>
<li>Dozens of wacky characters, ALL fully voiced.</li>
<li>Cool references to classic LucasArts and Sierra games.</li>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-39 released improving Overwatch 2 for Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> is the community-maintained version of the Windows compatibility layer Proton, not endorsed by Valve but it can get more games running on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. A new release version GE-Proton7-39 is out now.</p>
<p>Here's the change highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>proton-wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to git</li>
<li>overwatch 2 freeze fix added (may help other games)</li>
<li>pulled in upstream proton nvapi fixes</li>
<li>enabled gamedrive option for ESO by default</li>
<li>mono updated to 7.4.0</li>
<li>no-longer-required protonfixes removed for Sonic Adventures 2, Farcry 5 EAC, Origin (thanks Bitwolfies)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For those curious on how to set up Overwatch 2 on Steam Deck, I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/heres-how-to-play-overwatch-2-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">cover that before using the Bottles app</a> but since GE-Proton has some fixes in this release and the previous GE-Proton release, here's a video guide on how to do Battle Net and Overwatch 2 directly through Steam:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DTJ2dh_mv3Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/551f809ccdbd0011870592d8c007f403.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DTJ2dh_mv3Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download ProtonUp-Qt from Discover.</li>
<li>Install GE-Proton7-39 from ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Close and reload Steam.</li>
<li>Download the Battle Net launcher.</li>
<li>Add the Battle Net installer into Steam. Add Game (bottom left) -&gt; Non-Steam game, select it from the list in your Downloads folder (select All Files from the bottom of the file picker to see it).</li>
<li>Right click on it in Steam, go to Properties and select Compatibility. Tick the box and select GE-Proton7-39.</li>
<li>Install it and then remove the shortcut.</li>
<li>Add a new shortcut to the installed Battle Net launcher exe file. Again setting the compatibility on it to GE-Proton7-39.</li>
<li>Now you're done. You can load it and install Overwatch 2 or anything else from Battle Net and run it inside Steam directly without another app like Bottles or Lutris.</li>

      <title>Cemu emulator for Wii U now provides an AppImage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get the Wii U emulator <a href="https://cemu.info/" target="_blank">Cemu</a> working on Linux? It's now a little easier, as they've providing an AppImage with the latest release.</p>
<p>Version <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases/tag/v2.0-14" target="_blank">Cemu 2.0-14 (Experimental)</a> just went up and this is the first to offer the AppImage, which should work across various Linux distributions and perhaps make it easier on Steam Deck as well. Nice to see they keep improving it little by little, as they slowly move towards the full 2.0 release that's open source.</p>
<p>They're not yet providing a full changelog between the small releases of the 2.0 release, with these still being listed as the main changes since the last major release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cemu is now <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu" target="_blank">open-source!</a></li>
<li>Preliminary Linux builds are available <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases" target="_blank">on github</a>, but be warned that they are still very rough around the edges</li>
<li>Going forward, we simplified the versioning a bit by using shorter version numbers for stable releases (2.1, 2.2, 2.3..). This version (2.0) is an exception in the sense that it follows the pattern of a stable release but is very much experimental.</li>
<li>Updated all dependencies. Most notably SDL (input &amp; motion) and wxWidgets (UI)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the H264 video decoder. Resolves crash on Smash title screen</li>
<li>Made nsysnet a little less crash prone. Fixes crash in Call of Duty: Black Ops II</li>
<li>Fixed a logging related crash that could occur under very specific circumstances. Seen in Wind Waker if letting the game idle on the title screen for 2 minutes</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when the path to Cemu.exe contained unicode characters</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when loading .elf homebrew</li>
<li>The account list in the title manager save exporter is no longer empty</li>
<li>Latency for wiimotes should be a bit better now</li>
<li>Added symbol/function list to debugger + other small debugger/assembler improvements</li>
<li>Implemented API: coreinit.FSOpenFileExAsync (used by some homebrew)</li>
<li>Many more under-the-hood changes and fixes</li>
<li>Some more work towards a Stop&amp;Restart emulation feature. Not ready yet but we are getting there</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dota 2 set to remove OpenGL support, new hero announced and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out an <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3398555399443921912" target="_blank">update</a> for Dota 2 and there's some major changes coming, along with another new hero set to enter the fold.</p>
<p>As part of the 2022 Battle Pass: Part II update Valve announced that NVIDIA Reflex support has been added, and they've said that this is the last major update that will have OpenGL support as everyone will need to be using Vulkan on Linux after that. OpenGL removal was previously announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/dota-2-to-drop-opengl-and-32bit-vulkan-default-on-linux-and-ti-21-tickets-on-september-22/" target="_blank">back in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>For right now though Valve has added Diretide, their annual event with a new Candyworks game mode. This update also comes with a second Cavern Crawl map and the release of another round of rewards.</p>
<p>As for the new hero, they're named Muerta and they arrive in early 2023:</p>

<p>What else?</p>
<p>Oh, there's also a little sprinkle of Portal with a Cave Johnson (voiced by J. K. Simmons) announcer pack that had its own fun trailer that even pulled in Valve CEO Gabe Newell. Amusingly, Newell calls himself both "G-Money" and "G-Fat" during it.</p>

      <title>Star Labs new StarFighter sounds like a great Linux laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Labs announced their new <a href="https://starlabs.systems/pages/starfighter" target="_blank">StarFighter</a> a little while ago, but it seems it only just recently went live on their actual store with the full info on what to expect from it.</p>
<p>However, they don't seem to have quite settled on what screen it will have. Currently, it advertises a 16-inch 2560x1600 QHD 165 Hz IPS matte screen, but writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/starlabsltd/status/1587851541007982602" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it seems they are split between that or a 4K version and so the final build might end up with a 4K 60Hz screen instead.</p>
<p>It features a choice between Intel Core 12th generation and AMD Ryzen 7 processors, up to 64GB RAM, up to 18 hrs battery life, a removable webcam, a wireless killswitch, a backlit keyboard, a full-glass haptic trackpad, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C With Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 for charging and expansion, HDMI, 3 x full-size USB 3.0 port, Micro SD slot, coreboot and EDK II support, a 65 watts over USB-C charger and easy Firmware updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20034595371667563310gol1.png"/></p>
<p>As usual, you'll also be able to configure it with various Linux distributions including Ubuntu, elementaryOS, Linux Mint and more. It's not available for a few months yet with no exact date set it seems.</p>

      <title>Slay the Spire is getting an official Board Game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love Slay the Spire and want to take it into the real world? There's a Board Game being made for it.</p>
<p>As a big fan of the game with many hours in it on Linux, I feel like I need it but the price is a little on the steep side at $100 for the set. Popular though, as the crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/contentiongames/slay-the-spire-the-board-game" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> managed to get funded in only a few minutes and is currently sat pretty at close to $2 million USD in funding — wow.</p>
<p>It's a pretty intricate and luxury board game though, along with a smaller company producing it so the price does sort-of make sense when you take things into account. It's not Monopoly after all. Sure does look fantastic too! The co-op aspect of it sounds pretty fun too.</p>
<p>You can see an overview from YouTube channel The Brothers Murph below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KIorv0ZqEQg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e2c7abf03fc1c867072364d185ee019.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KIorv0ZqEQg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What do you think? Will you pick it up if you're a fan?</p>

      <title>Warzone 2100 version 4.3 is out now with a new &#39;Super Easy&#39; mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source RTS <a href="https://wz2100.net/" target="_blank">Warzone 2100</a> has a new release out, bringing with it a new difficulty mode if you struggled through the campaign. Quite a success story this one. Originally a fully commercial game developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive that was eventually set free. I wish more developers did this eventually.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1182895431667560040gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1182895431667560040gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Main improvements in version 4.3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New “Super Easy” difficulty for campaign.</li>
<li>Additional new “Aftermath” soundtrack (from Lupus-Mechanicus).</li>
<li>Add “LOD Distance” Graphics option, to adjust texture sharpness at distance (defaults to “High”).</li>
<li>Add new Video Options (“Minimize on Focus Loss”, “Alt+Enter Toggle”).</li>
<li>Add Flatpak builds (for Linux).</li>
<li>Support for bidirectional text using fribidi.</li>
<li>Improve Cobra AI yet again (balances against defensive / system research when 1v1 on high oil maps).</li>
<li>Show the rank a unit will have if it were produced next.</li>
<li>Add console message when limits change.</li>
<li>Update campaign balance (and fixes) for: Alpha 2, Alpha 6, later Beta missions, Beta-end, Gamma 2.</li>
<li>+ Lots of bug fixes and multiplayer balancing changes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>AMD announce RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT, plus FSR3 teased</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today at the AMD "together we advance_gaming" event, AMD revealed their new RDNA3 architecture along with the RX 7900 XTX and RX 7900 XT GPUs. Both of these new cards will be available on December 13th, and AMD threw plenty of shade at NVIDIA of the power use and connector issues during the event talking about how "easy" it is to upgrade to it and noting the power use. </p>

<p>They also teased FSR3, which will be due out next year but didn't go into much detail on it. According to AMD FSR3 is "expected to deliver up to 2X more FPS compared to AMD FSR 2 in select games".</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMD RDNA 3 Architecture</strong> – Featuring an advanced chiplet design, new compute units and second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology, AMD RDNA 3 architecture delivers up to 54% more performance per watt than the previous-generation AMD RDNA 2 architecture. New compute units share resources between rendering, AI and raytracing to make the most effective use of each transistor for faster, more efficient performance than the previous generation.</li>
<li><strong>Chiplet Design</strong> – The world’s first gaming GPU with a chiplet design delivers up to 15% higher frequencies at up to 54% better power efficiency. It includes the new 5nm 306mm Graphics Compute Die (GCD) with up to 96 compute units that provide the core GPU functionality. It also includes six of the new 6nm Memory Cache Die (MCD) at 37.5mm, each with up to 16MB of second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology.</li>
<li><strong>Ultra-Fast Chiplet Interconnect </strong>– Unleashing the benefits of second-generation AMD Infinity Cache technology, the new chiplets leverage AMD Infinity Links and high-performance fanout packaging to deliver up to 5.3TB/s of bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Memory and Wider Memory Bus </strong>– To meet the growing requirements of today’s demanding titles, the new graphics cards feature up to 24GB of high-speed GDDR6 memory running at 20Gbps over a 384-bit memory bus.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the pricing, they seem like pretty great value to me. Having a flagship under $1K is a very good move when compared to what NVIDIA are offering. If the performance is in any way comparable, it should sell quite well.</p>
<p>From the press release: “These new graphics cards are designed by gamers for gamers. As we were developing the new cards, we not only incorporated feedback from our customers, but we built in the features and capabilities we wanted to use,” said Scott Herkelman, senior vice president &amp; general manager, Graphics Business Unit at AMD. “We also realized that we needed to do something different to continue pushing the envelope of the technology, and I’m proud of what the team has accomplished with AMD RDNA 3 and the Radeon RX 7900 Series graphics cards. I can’t wait for gamers to experience the powerhouse performance, incredibly vivid visuals and amazing new features these new graphics cards offer.”</p>
<p>Full event can be seen below:</p>

<p>Also, it's still fun to see the Steam Deck picture on such events. AMD made the APU so it's only natural for them to highlight it but nice to see it again like this for a device that's helping to do so much for Linux gaming as a whole.</p>

      <title>Play one of the greatest co-op shooters free this weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up on Steam right now is a free weekend for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, easily one of the best co-op shooters around. It works out of the box on Linux desktop and it is Steam Deck "Playable" too. Also 67% off until November 17th.</p>
<p>I've got a ton of hours in this game and honestly, it's incredible. Even though it's tailored for online co-op play, doing it solo is still pretty fun too thanks to the upgradable helper drone you're given. The developer just launched Season 3 "Plaguefall" too adding in a new event, spikes that spread across the map, new tools to deal with the infection spreading, new types of grenades, new cave types to explore, and much more so it's a great time to jump in:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SfNWg_xbRfE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e4f6c9b335aaacf4324025f29041c38.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SfNWg_xbRfE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've shown it off across various livestreams and it's one of my most played games, if you've not tried it yet you've got nothing to lose since you can play free until the very end of the weekend on Steam. A GOL Livestream showed off more of it only recently and you can see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu_BXaiI92M" target="_blank">VOD here</a>. You can also see a full mission <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeeVEvcSjAE" target="_blank">play-through on Steam Deck here</a>.</p>
<p>Safe to say I'm going to be putting a lot more time into it with this update it looks awesome.</p>
<p>This is by far one of the best co-op shooters ever made, and I'm not exaggerating that. I've obviously played a great many shooters over the years and I will still happily keep coming back for more in this.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players specifically, I recommend putting it to Medium settings on all the presets and lock the FPS to 40 and you will get a pretty good time there. Desktop Linux obviously depends on your GPU and CPU but it's not a particularly hard game on resources so lower spec machines can perform nicely.</p>

      <title>Steam on Chromebook is now in Beta with AMD support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is exciting! Even more people will be able to play games on Linux from today, as Google announced Steam on Chromebook is now in Beta. For those less technically-minded reading, Chromebooks run ChromeOS, which is Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announce-alpha-quality-steam-on-chrome-os-is-now-actually-here/" target="_blank">Back in March</a> it was in Alpha, and it was pretty severely limited in what systems it supported and what it could play but that changes today. In the <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/steam-on-chromeos-beta" target="_blank">announcement</a>, it's mentioned that this stage brings with it "broader availability, an improved user experience, and better performance and compatibility for more of your favorite games".</p>
<p>Part of bringing it to more people is that it moves from ChromeOS Dev to ChromeOS Beta, meaning while Chromebook users still need to switch over to it they're likely to see far less system issues overall while testing. On top of that, Google are now supporting AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series and Intel 12th Gen Core CPUs and lowering the minimum CPU requirement to i3 / Ryzen 3.</p>
<p>Another big improvement is how they handle storage. Some games need to download additional data outside of Steam, so they entirely reworked that and this gave an additional benefit like improved filesystem access performance for Windows games in the Proton compatibility layer. Power management was also upgraded, adding in power notifications on top of full-screen games.</p>
<p>Tons of other improvements like DirectX 12 and Vulkan 1.3 support, improving shader storage and so on. The list of games they've tested and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/steam-on-chromeos/#game-list" target="_blank">recommend</a> has grown but still on the small side.</p>
<p>Full changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added various game-specific tweaks</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen 5000 C-series support</li>
<li>Avoid sleeping when game indicates activity via dbus</li>
<li>Changed shader cache format to reduce disk footprint</li>
<li>Initial DX12 support</li>
<li>Enable pointer lock by default (without the #exo-pointer-lock flag)</li>
<li>Fixed some cases previously resulting in GPU hangs</li>
<li>i3/R3 device support</li>
<li>Improved battery life from reduced CPU overhead in Vulkan and DirectX titles</li>
<li>Optimized display pipeline when scaling</li>
<li>Improved GPU rendering performance with transparent huge page support</li>
<li>Improved handling switching between apps and full-screen</li>
<li>Improved keyboard handling; for example, the launcher key now works when the Steam client is focused</li>
<li>Improved window management support</li>
<li>Include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai fonts</li>
<li>Increased size of shader caches</li>
<li>Intel 12th Gen core support</li>
<li>Low battery notifications</li>
<li>Mouse cursor fixes</li>
<li>New installer and splash screen</li>
<li>Revamped storage management
<ul>
<li>Fixes games that install additional content outside of Steam</li>
<li>Improves file access performance for Proton games</li>
<li>Note: alpha users will need to uninstall and reinstall Steam so these changes can take effect</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Device no longer sleeps while games are downloading in the background.</li>
<li>Shader caches persist until software update</li>
<li>Show all low-battery notifications while gaming in fullscreen</li>
<li>Vulkan 1.3 support</li>
<li>Vulkan and GL performance improvements</li>
<li>xshape support for games/launchers with transparency</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve has improved the new Big Picture Mode for Desktop quite a bit in a new Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a> for Desktop has been released, and Valve continue fixing up more issues with the new Big Picture Mode to have it make sense on Desktop. Some of the issues are because it was clearly taken directly from Steam Deck, but now they're getting some proper desktop tweaks in there too.</p>
<p>Reminder: to show the new UI, you need to launch Steam with "-gamepadui" as a launch option as shown <a href="https://youtu.be/ztW9LP8bmvg" target="_blank">in my previous video</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3487041261667492156gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3487041261667492156gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where uninstall dialogs were showing up twice (this may still happen after bringing up the controller configurator or standalone keyboard).</li>
<li>Fixed issue [where] exiting a game would bring up the new Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed virtual keyboard being scaled incorrectly inside its window</li>
<li>More improvements to reduce login time for users with large libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to Exit Big Picture Mode and go back to the regular Steam desktop client. In this situation, clicking the Enter Big Picture Mode button will enter the new Big Picture (only happens if you use -gamepadui)</li>
<li>Fixed some instances [where] focus was lost</li>
<li>Updated Steam Controller LB and RB button images</li>
<li>Force GPU acceleration for the UI</li>
<li>Fixed recently exported Controller Layout Templates not showing up in the Layout Browser</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They still haven't fixed it showing what's behind Big Picture Mode on a KDE Plasma Desktop with NVIDIA though. A bug I find thoroughly odd, since the overlay from the Quick Access Menu works just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4890583661667492155gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4890583661667492155gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Update —</strong> an additional Steam Client Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948436064009" target="_blank">update</a> went out today (November 3rd) with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed overlay not working properly in non-Steam games</li>
<li>Fixed scaling issue in the desktop UI when exiting Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed issues with some dialogs not showing in the Steam Overlay</li>
<li>Removed some options in the Quick Access menu that are not currently supported outside of Steam Deck</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the Friends List was not accessible after exiting Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the re-order controllers dialog stopped working from the Quick Access menu</li>
<li>Fix issue starting any game with multiple Launch Options</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>The controller overlay now respects the "Use Nintendo Button Layout" setting in the New Big Picture</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve fix new EA app in Proton Experimental for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, EA starting removing Origin from games on Steam and replacing it with the EA app <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/ea-begins-swapping-out-origin-for-ea-app-on-steam/" target="_blank">which as I noted before</a>, caused numerous issues. Now, Valve should have solved it in Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Some games just didn't work at all with the change, others needed a re-install, some needed a couple of re-loads and so on. It was a big nuisance and quite annoying that EA seemingly didn't work with Valve on it before pushing out such a big change. Anyway, should be all good now.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Edge Webview installer throwing an error when starting Vermintide 2 for the first time.</li>
<li>Fix the new EA launcher displaying a blank window.</li>
<li>Fix The Anacrusis not displaying video when joining a match (experimental regression).</li>
<li>Enable nvapi for: Red Dead Redemption 2, Red Dead Online.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder (for desktop), you now need Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer for Proton Experimental. On Steam Deck, Valve control the drivers for you so it's fine.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video that goes over the changes and shows you what to do on Steam Deck:</p>

<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Access your Amazon Prime Gaming library on Linux with the Nile Project</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon's<a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home" target="_blank"> Prime Gaming</a> service has been dishing out free-to-keep games to its subscribers for some time now, but accessing these games required running the Amazon Gaming client through Wine.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/nile" target="_blank">Nile Project</a> provides a native interface for your Prime Gaming library by interacting with the Amazon API to download and play your games from the command line. A nice advantage to using Nile is that you can change your Wine environment on a per-game basis, rather than installing a copy of Amazon Games for each. I spoke with project developer <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin" target="_blank">Linguin</a>, who also works on <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Launcher</a>, and he plans to incorporate Nile into Heroic in the near future, so if you aren't keen to use the command line you can consider this a quick sneak peek. The developer also mentioned it's not ready for Steam Deck yet and while possible it's not recommended, so this is for desktop Linux for now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20004241041667433213gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20004241041667433213gol1142.png"/></a><small>SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech running through Nile</small></p>
<p>The project is still in early days, and as such the documentation is a bit sparse. Let's take a look at using Nile to access some of those Bezos freebies. Most of this information can be found in the project's README.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Get Nile and dependencies</h4>
<p>Nile is not (yet) packaged for distributions, so grab it from the GitHub repository using git:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">git clone https://github.com/imLinguin/nile</code></p>
<p>You will also need the project dependencies, which you can install system-wide for Arch Linux like so:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">pacman -Syu pyqt5 python-pycryptodome python-zstandard python-requests python-protobuf</code></p>
<p>or or for Ubuntu like so:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pycryptodome python3-requests python3-zstd</code></p>
<p>If you are on a different distribution you could instead install the required python packages system-wide with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/" target="_blank">pip</a>, although personally I wouldn't recommend it. A better option is to make a virtual environment, then activate the environment before running Nile. To do this, run: <code>python3 -m venv env &amp;&amp; source ./env/bin/activate &amp;&amp; pip install -r requirements.txt</code>Note that the virtual environment will only be active for the terminal you ran <code class="inline-code">source ./env/bin/activate</code> on, so you will need to re-run it for new terminals before running Nile.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Download your Games</h4>
<p>In the Nile directory you downloaded from GitHub, run <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile auth --login</code>, which will pop open a window with the Amazon login. Once you have logged in, you can list your games with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile library list</code>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3991698761667433471gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3991698761667433471gol1142.png"/></a><small>Nile listing my Prime Gaming library</small></p>
<p>Choose the game you would like to install and copy the associated ID string, then run <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile install </code>, replacing with the string you copied. The download will start - there is no indication of download progress so you'll just have to be patient. You can verify that the game has been installed with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile library list</code>.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Play</h4>
<p>Once completed, you can launch the game using the default system Wine prefix with <code class="inline-code">./bin/nile launch </code>. A nice feature is that you can instead use one of your pre-existing Wine bottles from <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to run one of your Amazon games with GE Proton you could create a bottle using the Bottles GUI  or from the command line<br/>
<code>bottles-cli new --bottle-name ge_proton --environment gaming --runner GE-Proton7-38</code><br/>
Then use that bottle to play your game<br/>
<code>./bin/nile launch --bottle ge_proton</code></p>
<p>While it's still early days for this project, I think it's great how easy it's getting to access games on platforms besides Steam, and the Nile project moves us that little bit farther into the glorious Linux gaming future.</p>

      <title>JSAUX teasing a clear Back Plate for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX, maker of many Steam Deck Docking Stations, might be teasing a clear Back Plate they're designing for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>They seem to be never far away from releasing something new, with on Docking Station after another but now it seems they're onto something different. I'm surprised it actually took any company this long, as no doubt a clear Back Plate would be popular as we all know clear tech is awesome. I fondly remember my see-through Game Boy Pocket, what a glorious thing it was.</p>
<p>Anyway, on <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1587097997828988928" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, JSAUX teased "We are designing a new product, related to the shell on the back, let me see if anyone guesses correctly what it is.👀" with this image:</p>

<p>Would you buy one? I 100% would.</p>

      <title>Microsoft upgraded Xbox Cloud Gaming for Linux and ChromeOS (so Steam Deck too!)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On the community Reddit for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/play" target="_blank">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, an Xbox employee put up a small announcement about an upgraded experience for Linux and ChromeOS game streaming.</p>
<p>Something we've been waiting on for some time, as without workarounds you were limited to a low resolution. You could make it better by spoofing Edge on Windows for example. Even with that, I noticed it didn't perform as well as expected. Now, that should no longer be the case.</p>
<p>Xbox Cloud developer Jordan Cohen said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xcloud/comments/ykb1v1/performance_and_quality_improvements_on_linux_and/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi everyone! We've just released a set of performance improvements on Xbox Cloud Gaming for gamers playing via browser on Linux and ChromeOS devices. You can expect a higher resolution and smoother streaming experience. </p>
<p>These changes also complete a long journey of upgrading our browser gaming experience to a different streaming technology. You should now have a more consistent experience in the browser, no matter what device you use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it myself today on both desktop Linux and Steam Deck, and it does seem to work just fine.</p>
<p>Despite what Microsoft like to say, you <em>don't</em> need Edge and it works just fine in Chrome. Nothing extra is needed on desktop Linux, it's click and play. But for Steam Deck, you can set it up like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure Chrome is installed (available via the Non-Steam menu in the Steam Library), or via Discover in Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>In Desktop Mode enter this command into the Konsole terminal app: <code>flatpak --user override --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.google.Chrome</code><br/>
<em>This enables the Gamepads to work.</em></li>
<li>Load Chrome and go to Xbox.com/Play, and setup your login. It's easier in desktop mode.</li>
<li>If you wish to auto-launch Xbox Cloud Gaming with Chrome with no address bar, add this to the very end of the launch options (Properties menu on Chrome in your Steam Library): <code>--window-size=1024,640 --force-device-scale-factor=1.25 --device-scale-factor=1.25 --kiosk "https://xbox.com/play"</code></li>
<li>In Gaming Mode on Steam Deck, tap Chrome in your Steam Library and set Steam Input (the Gamepad icon on the right) into Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad. Also set the Right Trackpad as Mouse Click, as it helps you deal with any browser pop-ups.</li>
<li>Launch Chrome, and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>As a side-note, if you really do need or want to use Edge instead of Chrome, you can just change the end of point 2 to have this at the end com.microsoft.Edge instead of com.google.Chrome.</em></p>
<p>Here's a video reminder on how to do it along with some quick footage:</p>

      <title>Loading bigger libraries should be faster in the new Steam Deck Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available in the Beta and Preview channels, Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3425577645359615159" target="_blank">released</a> a new Steam Deck Client Update with a few useful little fixes. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some instances were focus was lost</li>
<li>More improvements to reduce login time for users with large libraries</li>
<li>Fixed issue where spotlighted games in the Whats New section could not be interacted with</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with trackpad typing</li>
<li>Updated Steam Controller LB and RB button images</li>
<li>Fixed Main Menu not adjusting size/position when adjusting UI scale</li>
<li>Fixed recently exported Controller Layout Templates not showing up in the Layout Browser</li>
<li>Fixed issue with sign in refresh UI when the user had already signed in once during the current session</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do find the initial login is still a little sluggish myself, with over 2,000 games it gets me into the Home screen fine but it's not very responsive still for a few more seconds. Hopefully they will keep at it.</p>
<p>Hopefully we shall soon hear more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steamos-34-beta-to-update-the-arch-linux-base-new-steam-deck-updates-out-now/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4</a>, as I'm exciting for all the software updates that will come along with it like a much improved version of KDE Plasma for desktop mode. What are you looking forward to?</p>
<p><strong>Update —</strong> an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3425577645362930709" target="_blank">additional</a> Deck Client Beta went out today (November 3rd), here's what changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where the re-order controllers dialog stopped working from the Quick Access menu.</li>
<li>Fixed issue in Desktop mode where the Steam Library was not loading properly.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection.</li>
<li>Fix issue starting any game with multiple Launch Options.</li>

      <title>Fun Steam Deck Verified &amp; Playable games from October 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the Steam Deck hit over 6,000 games marked as Playable and Verified together, so I took a little look at some of the entries across October to point out some fun picks.</p>
<p>Featuring games both new and old, games going through Deck Verified can be a fun reminder of what existing games are out there to go through your back catalogue. You can see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=DeckCompatDate_DESC&amp;deck_compatibility=3%2C2&amp;os=win%2Clinux" target="_blank">Valve's list here</a>, although they really need to upgrade it as sorting by the verification date ends up showing games that had a small tweak to their listing without a change to the verified status so it can confuse people.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vKs_kTg4B1Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47f8b7c583be6a57e6ac6a42b30f3521.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vKs_kTg4B1Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>My quick picks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337920/Serial_Cleaners/" target="_blank">Serial Cleaners</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/" target="_blank">UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684930/CULTIC/" target="_blank">CULTIC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1016920/Unrailed/" target="_blank">Unrailed!</a> (Native Linux)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank">Anger Foot Demo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/637090/BATTLETECH/" target="_blank">BATTLETECH</a> (Playable - Native Linux but Steam Deck uses Proton)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1647550/NEO_The_World_Ends_with_You/" target="_blank">NEO: The World Ends with You</a> (Playable)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2087030/Shatterline/" target="_blank">Shatterline</a> (Playable)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them should work on desktop Linux too thanks to Proton or Native Linux builds.</p>

      <title>PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe is Steam Deck Verified before release with a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe is the next Steam release coming from Q-Games and they've managed to get it Steam Deck Verified ahead of release. Originally released on Apple Arcade, it's getting a full Steam release at some point but there's no exact date on that yet.</p>
<p>Valve seem to be rating more demos recently, as they also did the same for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank">Anger Foot</a> but in that case only the demo is verified. Here it seems the entire game and demo has verification.</p>
<p>"In PixelJunk Scrappers Deluxe, clean up the streets of Junktown and trash anyone who gets in your way!</p>
<p>Take on the role of the Scrappers, a squad of robot garbage collectors working to clean up a grimy city in the not-so-distant future. Sweep the streets alone or form the ultimate team with up to 4 players. Time is money in Junktown, so stack that trash high and toss to your squad to boost efficiency for bigger rewards."</p>

      <title>Narrative adventure Where Birds Go to Sleep has a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love text-based narrative adventures that look a bit insane? Where Birds Go to Sleep is releasing next year and they now have a demo available. The game will also have Native Linux support, and the demo already does.</p>
<p>"Slip into the subconscious of Cormo, a primitive criminal sent on a mission to chart new, mystical lands shrouded in a mind-altering fog. You never directly assume control, but you will mould him through every decision and every sentence you put in his mind. Uncover the dark mysteries of the island and of the human psyche. Become what you hate in Where Birds Go To Sleep."</p>
<p>The developer mentions it touches on sensitive topics, and won't be suitable for a younger audience.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ms71dctwfNc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d25d96ac680a12d616bea0536de0f899.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ms71dctwfNc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introspect: Reflect on your actions along with the protagonist; exchange your thoughts on what happened; regret or rejoice, grieve or laugh together… or independently of each other.</li>
<li>Choices: There is no “Mission Failed”; saying “No” opens new avenues. There is no golden path.</li>
<li>Consequences: Lie to others, and you’ll be more likely to hide the truth from yourself. Fail to justify your actions and you might find your character not heeding your commands.</li>
<li>Narrative: Sprawling, naturally flowing dialogue: react in intense back-and-forth conversations.</li>
<li>Survive: You must prepare for every journey inland, anticipating the challenges ahead. The provisions are scarce… but the others need them less than you.</li>
<li>You’re NOT fully in control: you are the whisper in the back of the mind. Manipulate your crew-mates and your protagonist into doing your bidding… and deal with the mental toll.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer mentioned over email that the demo will remain up until the end of November.</p>
<p>Try it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1387640/Where_Birds_Go_to_Sleep/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine now has its own dedicated Foundation for funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source game engine Godot Engine continues to grow, and now the team behind it has formed a Godot Foundation to continue funding it.</p>
<p>Previously they teamed up with the Software Freedom Conservancy charity, who handled the donations and ensured it was used correctly but as they've constantly grown, they feel the need to run it themselves now. In <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godots-graduation-godot-moves-to-a-new-foundation" target="_blank">a blog post</a> from founder Juan Linietsky, they noted having their own organization gives them the "opportunity to explore broader funding sources" while mentioning crowdfunding like Blender and Krita do.</p>
<p>On top of that, a "highly requested" ability for users to be able to sell assets through some sort of asset library, with a share going to the new Godot Foundation. Having merchandise is also an option and other miscellaneous extra forms of funding.</p>
<p>Linietsky also believes that doing all this will "project a stronger image of the Godot Project, which will allow us to have stronger footing when negotiating big donations with donors". Additionally "we want the Foundation to serve as a home for community initiatives, by allowing it to have its own funding lines (this means, so they can raise funding on their own for a specific goal, but the Foundation receives and uses it according to what was agreed), such as initiatives to promote education, communication and diversity".</p>
<p>All sounds reasonable and just goes to show how popular Godot has become that they can now do this. This is all on top of the formation of W4 Games, which is their company to commercially support Godot that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/w4-games-raised-8-5-million-usd-to-support-godot-engine/" target="_blank">raised quite a lot of money</a> recently.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator recently had a big update with a free Graveyard level</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the most popular games of its kind on Steam, the co-op escape room puzzler Escape Simulator recently had a nice update.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1435790/view/5722411638188322462" target="_blank">Steam post</a> going over stats and plans, they noted they've seen over 1.4 million people try it out on Steam which is impressive. Plus, a Wild West DLC was announced that will release in December adding in 4 new official rooms, 4 new music tracks and new outlaw and sheriff outfits.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1309400171667387697gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1309400171667387697gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the recent free update it added in a free Graveyard room, which they added for Halloween and it came with a special soundtrack too and a new outfit. On top of that they said the update has "600 fixes and quality-of-life improvements for the game".</p>
<p>Have to say, their design in this game is pretty great and the Graveyard felt suitably spooky, although a little over the top with the fog perhaps. They also said they have a few more rooms to add still yet so that should be fun to see, as usually you get all the items to play with in the Room Editor too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13099232891667388907gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13099232891667388907gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Void Scrappers blends Vampire Survivors mechanics with a space shoot &#39;em up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Void Scrappers recently released with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. A pretty great game if you love the mechanics of Vampire Survivors but want something different. I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/void-scrappers-is-my-new-favourite-coffee-break-game-m-try-the-free-prologue/" target="_blank">previously took a look</a> at their Prologue but the full game is out now.</p>
<p>Joining the growing list of horde-survival games, you blast various types of alien ships into junk that you then collect to upgrade your ship and blow up more. Destroy bosses and take their weapons, unlock and equip powerful new abilities and you can permanently upgrade your ship stats between runs too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qq7i-Kb00WI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0cd971a262e18ba801c1f6b703f62406.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qq7i-Kb00WI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A note: it seems currently it has an issue on Steam Deck where you might see a black screen while docked, the developer hasn't figured out why it happens but it works fine handheld.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun with the Prologue, and that quickly became a favourite. This full release with expanded content will quite likely become a regular coffee-break game for me, or a quick run or two before bed. It's incredibly easy just to pick up and play, has good battery life on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005210/Void_Scrappers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.openttd.org/" target="_blank">OpenTTD</a> is a free and open source sim based on the classic Transport Tycoon Deluxe, and the team have announced a new release is coming with a first Beta. While based on TTD, OpenTTD had a wide array of improvements including bigger maps, better multiplayer, dedicated servers, better AI and so much more.</p>
<p>Version 13.0 has a first Beta release out with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build NewGRF objects over an era with click-and-drag.</li>
<li>You can purchase land multiple tiles at a time.</li>
<li>Wider rivers on map generation.</li>
<li>Improved handling of HiDPI and mixed-DPI screens.</li>

<li>Many bug-fixes (over 50 of them), tweaks, changes, and other additions.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the biggest and longest-running open source games, OpenTTD is simply magnificent for those that love the classics. A good reminder it exists if you somehow haven't heard of it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck pushed Linux to the highest share on Steam in years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh month, which means a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out. Looking over the October 2022 data, it appears we've hit a fresh high point.</p>
<p>At the end of October, Linux hit 1.28% on Steam against 2.23% on macOS and 96.50% on Windows. Going by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, where we've been tracking the Linux user share for a few years, it is the highest it's been in over 4 years now! Still tiny compared with Windows of course but it's some clear steady progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14921006971667370820gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14921006971667370820gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This growth at the moment is largely thanks to the Steam Deck, which you probably already guessed. That much is clear when looking over the Linux-specific data page on the Steam Survey which shows these as the top Linux distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 24.98% +7.94%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 12.27% -0.21%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.12% -1.45%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.92% -0.88%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.71% +0.90%</li>
<li>Other 40.99% -2.00%</li>
</ul>
<p>SteamOS (at least going by that list on face value) is the most popular Linux distribution for gamers on Steam, by a wide margin there too with the caveat being we don't know exactly what's in the "Other" category, which could be full of various forms of Ubuntu that could push it to the top when added together.</p>
<p>When checking further, in the GPU list for Linux, the growth is clear with it noting that "AMD Custom GPU 0405" (the Steam Deck) has hit 25.01% (+7.94%). I should note as well, that this GPU still doesn't even show up when filtering to just Windows and so it's clear that the vast majority of gamers on Steam Deck are sticking to SteamOS which goes to show just how good it is as an experience overall.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress releases December 6 on Steam and itch.io, Native Linux support later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress is finally getting the big Early Access release on Steam and itch.io on December 6, although the Native Linux support is to come along later. Many years in the making, with actual proper graphics and more, it's nearly here!</p>
<p>With Bay 12 Games at the helm and Kitfox Games publishing, no doubt it will be one of this year's biggest Steam releases. New trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2K7T5LXQPJI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50f94258d46f59c5096234037ff352bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2K7T5LXQPJI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About Linux (and macOS) they said this under the "Soonish" heading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also not able to approach Mac and Linux by ourselves, since we've never notarized a Mac build or managed Linux libraries, and will need to get help with that to do it properly. But obviously we'd love to get that whole pipeline working so people can play on non-Windows computers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an email to us, the publisher additionally noted "support for Linux and Mac is not planned for the initial release, but is relatively high in the priority list after the initial bug fixes/content updates are complete".<em> At release though, I will be surprised if a title like this doesn't work well in Proton.</em></p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not just generated geometry -- a whole simulated world. Generated rise and fall of civilizations, personalities, creatures, cultures, etc. Infinite hours of gameplay.</li>
<li>Now with beautiful pixel graphics!</li>
<li>Learn the basics with in-game tutorials</li>
<li>A lifetime “living” project - created/updated since 2003, with no end in sight</li>
<li>Generate your unique world and manage a bustling colony of dwarves, even as they probably mine towards their eventual demise.</li>
<li>A new endless hobby, just for you!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Beta update tweaks the new Big Picture Mode from Steam Deck for desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has today <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3379415101027242699" target="_blank">released</a> a new Steam Client Beta, which amongst other things tweaks the new Big Picture Mode that is also in a special Beta that was taken from the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For the new Big Picture Mode here's the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removed Steam Deck Rewards section from Account page.</li>
<li>Fixed issues interacting with spotlighted games under What’s New.</li>
<li>Forced GPU acceleration on for Linux users who may have disabled it a long time ago. This is needed for the UI to be performant. This can still be disabled with the command-line option -cef-disable-gpu. It can also be forced enabled via -cef-force-gpu.</li>
<li>Temporarily hiding System Info under Settings as a work-around for crashes for users with older NVIDIA drivers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a reminder: to use the new Big Picture Mode you need to launch Steam with "-gamepadui" as a launch argument as I showed in a previous video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ztW9LP8bmvg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9883a0e9dbe34964845eca4b22871e70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ztW9LP8bmvg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Other changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue where new Big Picture Mode notifications were showing up in desktop mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Sign In</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix a case where if the sign-in UI had cached credentials which had become invalid, it could get stuck and not accept valid credentials thereafter</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Gyro Enabling: The "Touch" option is now available to controllers which do not have capacitive touch sensors - Moving joysticks out of their deadzone now counts as a "Touch".</li>
</ul>

      <title>Competitive tactics game Duelyst is being revived with Duelyst II</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love competitive games? How about when they're free to play? Dream Sloth Games are reviving Duelyst as Duelyst II, with approval from Counterplay Games. A game that originally reviewed quite well, but it was shut down and delisted on Steam back in February of 2020. Duelyst II was originally started as a fan-game but it's now turning into a full complete sequel.</p>
<p>They say "The epic battles of Final Fantasy Tactics and Advanced Wars have been distilled into focused 10 minute PvP matches, where every decision you make can be the difference between victory and defeat.". It offers up the positional aspects of traditional turn-based strategy games, with "the deep customization and dynamic gameplay of CCGs". So it's a turn-based deck-building battler.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13704578761667313397gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13704578761667313397gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it will be free to play, they're aiming to keep it away from any pay to win mechanics with you being able to "quickly" build your collect by playing with monetization focused on cosmetic items.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SzvqzwIbTdk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e9b885a84b0f41bc61dd3d328f4e89f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SzvqzwIbTdk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Position your units on the battlefield and destroy the enemy General to claim victory in strategic, turn-based combat.</li>
<li>Construct a deck from hundreds of unique cards - use minions, spells, and artifacts to discover new strategies and devastating combos.</li>
<li>Choose from six powerful factions: Lyonar Kingdoms, Songhai Empire, Vetruvian Imperium, Abyssian Host, Magmar Aspects, and Vanar Kindred.</li>
<li>Climb the ranked ladder, compete in draft mode, challenge friends, and solve puzzles to uncover the lore of the world.</li>
<li>An all new Original Soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will have full Native Linux support and it is crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dreamslothgames/duelyst-ii/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the $25,000 goal not only hit they've managed to nearly double it and there's 10 days left on the campaign.</p>
<p>Their current plan is to have an Open Beta this year. They said "Q4" but we're already inside that and they haven't given a more clear date yet exactly. Likely shortly after the campaign ends.</p>
<p>You can also follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2004320/Duelyst_II/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>These were the most popular Steam Deck games for October 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1587193499174465536" target="_blank">revealed</a> <em>two</em> fresh lists of popular games for the Steam Deck through October, sorted by both daily average player count and time played overall.</p>
<p>The first is sorted by daily average user count of games released in October which are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659420/UNCHARTED_Legacy_of_Thieves_Collection/" target="_blank">UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1496790/Gotham_Knights/" target="_blank">Gotham Knights</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874490/Potionomics/" target="_blank">Potionomics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158160/Coral_Island/" target="_blank">Coral Island</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/261550/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord/" target="_blank">Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/" target="_blank">Victoria 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850510/TRIANGLE_STRATEGY/" target="_blank">TRIANGLE STRATEGY</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/" target="_blank">SIGNALIS</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The second, is sorted by hours played total across the whole month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/" target="_blank">ELDEN RING</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" target="_blank">No Man's Sky</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/Fallout_4/" target="_blank">Fallout 4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/" target="_blank">Hades</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/" target="_blank">Persona 5 Royal</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These lists both show just how amazing the Steam Deck is as a device. When it can play games released for Windows, through the Proton compatibility layer, often on the day of release like Persona 5 and UNCHARTED. They were never designed for the system and yet thanks to the work going into Proton, they work so amazingly well.</p>
<p>Then with the second list, you can see another great point, on how people are continuing to play their favourites that were released many years ago. The back catalogue you get access to with Steam and the Deck is just awesome. Just the very fact that some absolutely huge games like GTA V and Skyrim work on it still amazes me. Both lists also go to show just how varied the games are that people play on Deck, there’s seemingly no genre that’s bigger than the other.</p>

      <title>Missile Command: Recharged gets a revamp and relaunch on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari and Adamvision Studios have taken down the original Missile Command: Recharged, and replaced it with another Missile Command: Recharged of the same name but it has been upgraded. It's seen a bump in the price too.</p>
<p>Answering the question of why they decided to re-do it, they said: "To address the elephant in the room: there was indeed an original release of Missile Command: Recharged. Being the first title in the Recharged series' lineup, Atari decided to go back and upgrade the title with all they've learned after releasing six additional Recharged games. Atari's revamped Missile Command: Recharged equips the game with fresh content and a whole new gaming experience, drawing inspiration from later releases such as Gravitar: Recharged, Yars: Recharged, Black Widow: Recharged, Asteroids: Recharged, Centipede: Recharged, and Breakout: Recharged."</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power Ups:</strong> Don’t just target missiles – take aim at all-new power-ups that will give you special tool, including powerful missiles, shields, and even a screen-clearing special blast.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrades:</strong> In Arcade, use accumulated points you earn to upgrade defensive attributes that will keep you in the game longer – if you use them wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Local Co-op:</strong> Tag in a friend to play any mode in local co-op and coordinate to fend off enemies even longer.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards:</strong> Compete in global leaderboards and aim to claim bragging rights as the top missile commander.</li>

      <title>Open source kart racer SuperTuxKart 1.4 is out now with Vulkan in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source kart racing game, SuperTuxKart, has released a major new version with lots of fresh goodies to play with. Focusing on fun gameplay and not realistic physics, it could (and often does) get compared to Mario Kart, except it's made by volunteers but it is quite impressive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12307998961667303764gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12307998961667303764gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the big new stuff in version 1.4 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Lap Trial game mode.</li>
<li>Items and stars animation.</li>
<li>HiDPI support in SDL2.</li>
<li>Beta Vulkan renderer.</li>
<li>Balanced starting positions in all official soccer fields.</li>
<li>Lots of other smaller balancing changes, track updates and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap between the Vulkan and OpenGL renderer with a "--render-driver=vulkan" or "--render-driver=opengl" launch argument, and it seems to stick to the last one you picked. Currently, Vulkan doesn't seem to have a lot of the graphical effects present in OpenGL so it's very much a work in progress.</p>
<p>You can see a previous video I did on Steam Deck below:</p>

<p>The Wine hackers have put out a new development build of the Windows compatibility layer in Wine 7.20. This is part of Steam Play Proton, which allows you to play tons of Windows games on Steam Deck and Linux desktops. Once a year they make a big new stable release, and eventually Proton updates to it too.</p>
<p>Here's the highlights of <a href="https://www.winehq.org//announce/7.20" target="_blank">version 7.20</a> include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 7.4.0.</li>
<li>Font linking improvements.</li>
<li>A number of fixes for exception unwinding.</li>
<li>Support for dumping EMF spool files in WineDump.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>29 bugs were noted to be solved including issues for: Crysis 2, Tequila City of Heroes Launcher, Autonauts, Axiom Verge 2, Obduction, Shin Koihime † Eiyuutan 4 and more.</p>
<p>For those that don't know: Wine Mono is their version of Mono, meant to replace .NET (v4.8 and earlier) in Wine. The improvements in Wine Mono 7.4.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression in string formatting in WPF. The bug is in WPF code but was triggered by an implementation change in Wine's dwrite. (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53552" target="_blank">Winehq bug 53552</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed build on systems that have a "python3" command but no "python".</li>
<li>Fixed build error with glibc 2.36.</li>
<li>Updated the Vagrant build VM to Ubuntu 22.04.</li>
<li>Some work on System.Configuration tests.
<ul>
<li>Nunit tests now use .exe.config files.</li>
<li>Stand-alone System.Configuration tests now run as part of the test suite.</li>
<li>A default case was added to fix a failing test. It's not known if this helps any real application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IL code storing a 64-bit integer to a "function pointer" type field is now accepted. This fixes an Invalid IL error in Grounded.</li>
<li>Imported System.Speech.dll from .NET Core. This does not work yet with Wine's SAPI implementation, but allows for further development.</li>
<li>Updated SDL to 2.24.0.</li>
<li>Updated FNA to 22.09.01.</li>
<li>Updated Mono from upstream.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Video recording app OBS Studio v28.1 out with NVENC changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a> has a new release out now, and it comes with some changes for NVIDIA GPU owners who use NVENC. Some of the changes (as usual) only affect Windows, but there's still some goodies in there for Linux too.</p>
<p>Easily one of my favourites bits of FOSS software, couldn't imagine being without it now for video recording and livestreaming, well worth supporting directly!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18936427741667302669gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18936427741667302669gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When it comes to NVENC, in v28.1 they've changed the way you can configure it with quite a lot more options, so you can really tweak what your videos will look like now with this encoder:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Presets have been split into 3 different settings: Preset, Tuning, and Multipass mode</li>
<li>Presets are now P1-P7, lower numbers being lower quality, higher numbers being higher quality. Note that higher presets may incur higher GPU usage which could impact the performance of games running simultaneously with OBS. The number of simultaneous NVENC encoding sessions may be lower when using the highest presets. OBS will automatically map your current NVENC settings to the closest preset when upgrading.</li>
<li>Tuning is used to determine whether to prioritize latency or quality. It has three settings: High Quality, Low Latency, and Ultra Low Latency.</li>
<li>Multipass Mode is used to determine whether a second pass is used in encoding, and has three settings: Disabled, Quarter Resolution, and Full Resolution. Enabling this will give higher quality at the cost of more GPU resource usage.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9197958741667302603gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9197958741667302603gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Additional changes for all platforms include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Moved "Always on Top" to the View menu</li>
<li>You can now select a specific source for the Virtual Camera</li>
<li>Fixed Stats widget appearance issues</li>
<li>Fixed Blend Method in Studio Mode</li>
<li>Fixed case where video capture is darkened when both luma wipe and scale filtering are set</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.5 Beta adds Download Manager, external game / launcher installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> is growing with the 2.5.0 Beta version out now, putting it in competition with the likes of Lutris and Bottles a little more with the new features.</p>
<p>One of the major new additions is the ability to add applications from basically anywhere. Heroic is no longer limited to GOG and Epic Games, as you can just add anything in from Native Linux game installs to Windows games / launchers to then run through Wine. This is great since it's such a popular application on both desktop and Steam Deck and should perhaps even make certain launchers easier.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3012696731667235982gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3012696731667235982gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's now support for custom user themes, a Download Manager so you can queue up a ton of games to download and a "more robust online checking system". They also upgraded the version of Legendary they use, which is the magic behind the Epic Games support along with performance improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>I'll probably take a proper look in a video likely when 2.5.0 is out stable.</p>

      <title>Elon Musk completes Twitter takeover, Nextcloud to ship their own social network app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just a bit of big industry news to cover today, as an update to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/twitter-agrees-to-elon-musk-buyout-a-reminder-were-on-mastodon/" target="_blank">previous article</a> talking about Elon Musk and Twitter — as the sale has completed. Plus a reminder on Mastodon and Nextcloud doing some fun social stuff too.</p>
<p>To get one thing out of the way: no, this is not gaming news, but we've covered big industry stuff for years. In this specific case, we (or should I say <strong>I</strong>), use Twitter a lot for sharing our news and interacting with people, spreading info about Linux gaming, Steam Deck and more. Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GOL on Twitter here</a>, our account is not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>It's certainly going to be interesting to see what happens, with changes already underway. For one, Musk said Twitter is now <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792" target="_blank">building up</a> a "content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints" and that the verification process (where you get a blue tick) is also being <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586848033550934016" target="_blank">revamped</a> and they're even <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/elons-first-big-move-pay-to-remain" target="_blank">reportedly</a> looking at charging people to stay verified.</p>
<p>Seems like a good time to remind people of alternatives, like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>. We're on it too and have been for a long time now, you can follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GOL on Mastodon here</a>. It's a little different to Twitter since it's open source and federated, it works a lot more like email: you sign up anywhere, or host your own, and then chat with everyone.</p>
<p>Linking into that, Nextcloud <a href="https://nextcloud.com/blog/no-need-to-trust-musk-we-go-federated-with-nextcloud-social/" target="_blank">announced</a> their own "Nextcloud Social" platform which will ship in Nextcloud by default, and it will have support for the the Activity Pub standard and Mastodon directly too. That could be interesting, as they have quite a lot of people using it.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader for Steam Deck (plugin loader) gets fixed up for newer SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems each time Valve do a big update to the Steam Deck with SteamOS, it ends up breaking the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> plugin system but a fresh update is out now fixing it again. From what one of the developers said it now works well across the Stable, Beta and Preview update channels.</p>
<p>There's some known issues including Valve breaking some things on the Preview branch that may need you to restart Steam, if you open the Quick Access Menu right after booting / sleep you may not see the Decky Loader icon until you re-open the menu a couple of times and for people using the Animation Changer you need to re-run the installer.</p>
<p>What's Changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add timeout to get tabs request, wait for network online target before booting decky</li>
<li>Merge Tabs and Injection Fixes, bring back native Valve toaster</li>
<li>Systemd service updating</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've not seen it, check out my guide and intro below with a few plugins being shown off:</p>

      <title>Better Linux support for OneXPlayer coming, likely for SteamOS like Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We already know that OneXPlayer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">have it in their plans</a> to put SteamOS on their devices, and perhaps this Linux kernel work is a step towards it.</p>
<p>They have just launched the "<a href="https://onexplayerstore.com/products/onexplayer-mini-amd%C2%AE-ryzen%C2%AE-6800u-1920-1200?variant=41877371224244" target="_blank">ONEXPLAYER MINI PRO</a>", which comes with an AMD Ryzen 6800U and a 1920x1200 screen. Expensive though, especially compared to the Steam Deck with this 6800U model coming in at a minimum of $1,199 so it's a little eye-watering.</p>
<p>As for this new kernel work, this new driver allows the Linux kernel to deal with the fan controller and it is currently only supported on AMD chipsets. From the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/platform-driver-x86/20221029225051.1171795-1-samsagax@gmail.com/" target="_blank">patch</a> that was sent in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Platform driver for OXP Handhelds that expose fan reading and control via hwmon sysfs.</p>
<p>As far as I could gather all OXP boards have the same DMI strings and they are told appart by the boot cpu vendor (Intel/AMD).<br/>
Currently only AMD boards are supported but the code is made to be simple to add other handheld boards in the future.</p>
<p>Fan control is provided via pwm interface in the range [0-255]. AMD boards have [0-100] as range in the EC, the written value is scaled to accomodate for that.</p>
<p>PWM control is disabled by default, can be enabled via module parameter `fan_control=1`.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/OneXPlayer-Linux-Platform-Drv" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, gamepad support for the OneXPlayer was already sent in previously this month too. So it really does look like they're gearing up for Linux support.</p>

      <title>Classic Unreal Tournament lives on with a new OldUnreal upgrade, 64bit now on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unreal Tournament 99 is one of the all-time great first-person shooters, and it is being kept alive by the <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UnrealTournamentPatches" target="_blank">OldUnreal</a> team and contributors with a fresh release out now.</p>
<p>Version 469c has been released recently, and it remains compatible with all previous public releases of UT down to version 432. Some of the main highlights of this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the included FMOD Engine binaries for all clients to version 2.02.10</li>
<li>The Windows installer is now digitally signed</li>
<li>Removed libcurl from the patch. Server admins that use the MD5 anti-cheat protection feature and that have automatic updates enabled for the package list will have to manually download libcurl or use the version that came with the previous patch. This change should substantially reduce the number of false positive malware warnings triggered by our patch</li>
<li>Added native support for Linux/AMD64 and macOS/Apple Silicon platforms</li>
<li>Included an updated version of the UT PubSrc SDK</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Love seeing updates like this to such a great retro shooter. There's a lot more to it, that's just the basic highlights. Some awesome maps were in this game, and the feel of it continues to hold up very nicely. I had so many hours of fun playing this many years go. Nice that Epic gave it their approval too.</p>
<p>I previously showed off how to play it on Linux / Steam Deck using ProtonUp-Qt to install Luxtorpeda which then gives you access to the Native Linux release, which you can see a video on below as it makes the process quite easy:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aSXH3RwnqB4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2e598c13ffd8288b9556586cdfe0f73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aSXH3RwnqB4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It does need the original data files of course, which you can buy easily on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/unreal_tournament_goty?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/13240/Unreal_Tournament_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Great smaller and casual games for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Steam Deck is a great device for the bigger lot (AAA / AA), what about some quality choices for smaller and more casual experiences? Here's my current favourites, good for a cosy Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Okay, <em>casual</em> might perhaps <em>not</em> be the best word. However, my picks here are definitely on the smaller side of the gaming scene but they're really great to pick up and play on the Steam Deck. They're also not overly intense! Just click play and enjoy the ride. Keeping them as close to around £15 or under as I can.</p>
<p>First up, a little video going over each and links below in order:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lui9Us7hjSk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b79f55d1ce515a60a0d9bfe9bd9fa82f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lui9Us7hjSk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a></strong></p>
<p>This one was pretty obvious wasn't it? Much like a vampire, it will dig in and suck your life away while the sun goes down. Having a ridiculously cheap price attached is also pretty helpful here, a fantastic entry into gaming on the go.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748390/Rocket_Bot_Royale/" target="_blank">Rocket Bot Royale</a></strong></p>
<p>An online 2D Battle Royale, with jumping tanks. It's like a real-time worms or the classic artillery games. Quite satisfying to jump around and get a few frags in this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282730/Loop_Hero/" target="_blank">Loop Hero</a></strong></p>
<p>Another that will thoroughly hook you in for many hours. Watch as your hero loops around the screen, while you pause it to equip better weapons and armour and continue on. Then build up your little village, while you get a trickle of backstory.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863080/Beat_Invaders/" target="_blank">Beat Invaders</a></strong></p>
<p>It's like Space Invaders, with sleek neon graphics and some sick tunes. A classic re-invented for the modern age and a thoroughly great experience.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">Brotato</a></strong></p>
<p>Another a bit like Vampire Survivors, but with a sentient Potato that carries a lot of weapons as you face off against increasingly large hordes across various rounds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/" target="_blank">Into the Breach</a></strong></p>
<p>Small turn-based tactics that will leave you scratching your head. Difficult but great, from the creators of FTL. You control powerful mechs, against waves of creatures crashing through the floor that try to destroy various buildings. Try to think ahead.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/" target="_blank">Core Keeper</a></strong></p>
<p>A sweet 2D underground mining and crafting game that you can play in online co-op with others. Dig deep to find riches, do a little farming, discover secrets and take down plenty of creatures and bosses.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a></strong></p>
<p>I couldn't not include this right? Probably one of the most chilled and casual games ever made. Do a whole lot of farming, make some friends, possibly meet your lover and turn an overgrown mess into something beautiful and productive.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127500/Mini_Motorways/" target="_blank">Mini Motorways</a></strong></p>
<p>Build up a road map for a growing city. One by one you drag roads around to create a network, eventually coming to a rather busy metropolis. Traffic not flowing how you like it? Get redesigning and create the most sleek set of roads you can, help everyone get around.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/" target="_blank">Baba Is You</a></strong></p>
<p>Probably one of the cleverest puzzle games I've ever played. Combine logic blocks together, to change the rules of each level so that you can reach the flag to win. Turn yourself into things, make everything float or perhaps turn yourself into the flag itself to win.</p>
<p><u>A bonus</u>: <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/" target="_blank">PowerWash Simulator</a></strong></p>
<p>This one is a <em>bit</em> more expensive than the rest, but also one of the most relaxing game experiences I've personally had on Steam Deck. Make everything so shiny you can see your face in it, get down to your hands and knees and get scrubbing. Actually, don't, just pump some water at everything and hope for the best while you sip your coffee.</p>
<hr/>
<p>What games have you found to be great on the Steam Deck, that don't require a lot of thought that you can just sit back with? Bonus points if your picks are cheap too.</p>

      <title>Sackboy: A Big Adventure is another Sony port working well on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony and Sumo Digital recently put out another port, this time it's Sackboy: A Big Adventure an offshoot of the LittleBigPlanet series.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Sony releases, it didn't have a Steam Deck rating before release and still doesn't yet. The good news is that it works out of the box on both Steam Deck and Fedora Linux seemingly without any major technical issues. It does have some shader stutter, which smoothens out over time though (likely as it had no full testing before release).</p>
<p>With Proton 7, it's click and play on Steam Deck and Linux. Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WxdGZQ8ZpvE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bdb96f8c0f5d6d2dcf810f194b732449.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WxdGZQ8ZpvE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Very happy with how this runs. On my desktop, max settings produced a very smooth experience overall. On Steam Deck, keeping it on High settings, with the screen locked to 40Hz and TDP set to 10 — gave a really good feeling too with better battery life than the default (a good while over 2 hours).</p>
<p>On desktop, it seems it doesn't get along with MangoHud, which vanished every time on the initial loading screen so in the brief desktop bit in the video, you will see the normal Steam FPS counter in the top left corner.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sackboy-a-big-adventure?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1599660/Sackboy_A_Big_Adventure/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>VRR (external screens) and Allow Tearing options coming to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that both options for Variable Refresh Rate and Allow Tearing are coming to the Steam Deck in a future update (thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/yg0ou5/variable_refresh_rate_and_allow_tearing_options/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>), here's what that means.</p>
<p>Firstly, no, the Steam Deck itself will not have VRR, as the screen doesn't support it (As confirmed by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1586208015543578624" target="_blank">Twitter</a>). This will be for <em>external</em> screens when docking. The point of VRR is to have your screen continue to dynamically change the refresh rate to match the game, enabling it to remain smooth and tear-free.</p>
<p>As for the Allow Tearing option, this is due to the current way that Steam Deck Gaming Mode works with the Wayland display server, with it always forcing VSync. Once ready, this will allow you to properly have it off, and therefore reduce any extra latency it introduces and get some tearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8292577531667046667gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8292577531667046667gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - the new options in the performance menu.</em></p>
<p>Both of these are going to be pretty big and exciting additions, especially for those with VRR capable screens and for times where you really need that little bit extra input performance.</p>
<p>The options turned up in the Steam Deck "Main" updates channel, which is one of the extra update channels you can turn on via Developer Mode not actually meant for users. As with any in-progress developments, it can change at any point.</p>

      <title>Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds gets cross-play between Steam and Consoles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the more unique fighting games available on PC (Native Linux + Steam Deck Verified), Them's Fightin' Herds has launched on consoles and it now has cross-play. This means no matter the platform you want to fight on, you're good to go.</p>
<p><em>The game currently has a Very Positive user rating from 2,578 user reviews.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709471391666976058gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19709471391666976058gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Released as part of the 3.1.2 update they noted that players can find each other across the matchmaking queue, classic lobbies, and Pixel Lobbies regardless of platform plus some HUD elements were added to identify people on different platforms. However, account progress is separate between platforms. Consoles use Epic Online Services, while Steam is sticking to Steam netcode.</p>
<p>The Season 1 Pass is also now live as a DLC that gives you access to 4 new characters, an exclusive character palette pack and 4 exclusive Pixel Lobby accessories although not everything is out yet. The first of the new characters, Texas, was teased in a short trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oSM20gOntLM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e5ad30296488359d25d90b4a56570573.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oSM20gOntLM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, the update also fixed up hosting a custom Pixel Lobby server on Linux.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/thems-fightin-herds?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/574980/Thems_Fightin_Herds/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The third game in the popular Monster Prom series recently landed (that I missed) and this time, it's not a dating sim, instead it's all about survival in Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the dating sim style was never really for me. However, the original in the series <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/in-monster-prom-i-was-rejected-even-after-letting-a-princess-ride-me/" target="_blank">completely won me</a> over and it was a genuine delight to play. Flipping things around this time it keeps the great writing, quirky humour and multiplayer angle along with the diverse set of characters but you need to survive a roadtrip. Although, scoring a date is still possible but not the focus.</p>
<p>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip has you and up to 3 friend face "all kinds of wacky conflicts". Just like the previous entries, it has Native Linux support too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RWmddudktsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/169d768bdfba5d8a02ac79ca570ef71a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RWmddudktsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The signature style of the Monster Prom franchise: unique, charming characters and irreverent humor.</li>
<li>A co-op narrative adventure with survival mechanics.</li>
<li>You can play with friends both through local and online multiplayer!</li>
<li>YES! There's still the option of dating. This time flirting is not the core of the game, but you can still get a date with Polly, Scott, or one of the 10+ available hitchhikers by the end of the game!</li>
<li>TONS of beautiful art like you have never seen before in these series (seriously, there's A LOT of art packed in here).</li>
<li>Even if it's a co-op game, there's a social competitive aspect that will provide a thrill for the game. Choosing how much to seek your own benefit and how much to focus on the group goal!</li>
<li>Several brand new characters, and some beloved characters from previous games will be making a comeback!</li>
<li>Radio stations to choose from, with different music genres to build the perfect mood!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for monster-collecting game Cassette Beasts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Cassette Beasts is an upcoming monster-collecting RPG from Bytten Studio and publisher Raw Fury. The recent Steam Next Fest demo was pretty great and a new trailer is live now for <a href="https://www.mediaindieexchange.com/" target="_blank">The MIX</a> event.</p>
<p>An interesting idea for such a game, with you recording various creatures on retro cassette tapes and the fusion system allows you to create tons of unique and powerful monsters. New trailer below:</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?!</strong> Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li><strong>Fuse monster forms!</strong> Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li><strong>Explore a rich open world</strong> Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li><strong>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions</strong> Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li><strong>Master a deep battle system</strong> Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valheim gets an important bug-fix for Linux players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that the survival game Valheim had quite an unfortunate bug for Linux players, which has now been solved.</p>
<p>Players discovered a little while ago, that the ability to move saves between Cloud and Local might end up deleting characters or worlds. Ouch. At least it's fixed now. This update also brings the Jack-o-turnip seasonal decoration item since it's Halloween season once again.</p>
<p>Here's the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a Linux-specific bug that deleted characters/worlds when moving them back and forth between Local and Cloud</li>
<li>Prevent joining servers from the main menu if incompatible server version right away (instead of loading and then kicking you back out)</li>
<li>More PlayFab tweaks</li>
<li>Enabled Jack-o-turnip seasonal decoration item</li>
</ul>
