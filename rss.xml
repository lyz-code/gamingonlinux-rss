      <title>A sports brawler meets a MOBA in Sparkball with a demo coming to Steam Next Fest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love sports and fast-paced action, Sparkball will be one you need to check out with a playable demo coming in Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>What is it? Sparkball pits two teams of four in fast-paced, high-stakes matches where players brawl, block, and score in a futuristic arena. Matches are short, intense, and highly replayable, making the game easy to pick up but tough to master. The game celebrates versatility, rewarding both "ballin' and brawlin'", with the top players effortlessly blending them as each unique situation demands. Whether blocking shots, setting up plays, scoring goals, or simply out-duelling your opponent, there’s something to love for every type of gamer.</p>
<p>For the demo and release, I've been told there will be "no anti-cheat at this stage (regardless of platform)" and their focus is on Steam Deck support for it too. So looks like potentially another fun multiplayer title we can play with Valve's Proton on Linux systems.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EJ3t_1i7rZM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9cd9a701bcb872a77e96c1e3112a2fb7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EJ3t_1i7rZM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Created by Opti Games which has developers who previously worked on the likes of League of Legends, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and more. From the rather brief actual gameplay in the trailer, it looks very chaotic. Exactly my kind of thing.</p>
<p>Highlights from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Genre-Bending Mix – A first-of-its-kind multiplayer sports brawler where precision, teamwork, and quick thinking rule the field.</li>
<li>Short, Replayable Matches – Easy to pick up, hard to master — perfect for quick sessions, endless hours of ranked grind, and a rowdy Friday night session with friends.</li>
<li>Something for Everyone – Unique blend of gameplay ensures that no matter your primary genre of choice, you’ll find something to love in Sparkball</li>
<li>Steam Deck Compatibility – Built to play beautifully on the go.</li>
<li>Streaming and Esports Ready – Contagiously fun to watch casually with proven traction in competitive circles with C9, TL, FNC, and more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When the demo goes live during Steam Next Fest (June 9th), they will give out an exclusive in-game skin to anyone who plays the time-limited demo.</p>

      <title>Build a kingdom and watch overpowered tiny armies fight in 9 Kings</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>9 Kings is a fast-paced roguelike kingdom builder where you get to watch tiny armies fight and it's surprisingly absorbing of your time. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>This is not a kingdom / city builder like you may think. It's nothing like say Manor Lords, Crusader Kings, Civilization or anything resembling any of them. It blends in a weird mixture of a kingdom builder, with semi-auto battling and a sort-of deck-builder into something that just isn't like anything else. </p>
<p>You pick a king and then get given a plot of land to place your castle. From there, you have only a few squares to place down cards which form units and buildings to begin building your army. Each turn an enemy king sends their army to fight you, and the battles are mostly automatic apart from you using your castle ability (like throwing a big rock or lightning bolts) as units fight automatically on the field. It's a tug of war game, as you repeatedly expand your little kingdom gradually with more squares to place things down and power up your armies with various cards, to keep up with the next little invasion from an enemy king.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14967877751749223068gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14967877751749223068gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's very much another numbers-go-up type of experience. One where you build up the most insanely overpowered combination that you can, while also getting to watch little pixel people get crushed.</p>
<p>The game just goes on and on and on with each turn being a year, while you pick new cards and upgrades and eventually you'll have amassed a ridiculous assortment of troops of all kinds. From standard soldiers to flying demons there's a lot of variety in how you build your little pixel army. Eventually you come up against the boss battle and if you win it's game over, or you can choose to play endlessly with a warning how it's "experimental" so there will be issues.</p>
<p>As you progress you unlock more kings, each with a different set of cards for buildings and units. You can also level up each king, to put points into meta-progression perks like unlocking more plots at the start to build on or levelling up your castle to higher levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C3kInX4YNUY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eed52e47597f954112a471bc05156e7a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C3kInX4YNUY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another game that's very accessible too, since you pretty much only use the mouse and a single button. And especially nice is that each year (turn) you can just save, quit and come back to it anytime. Great for busy people and people with hours to spare alike.</p>
<p>It's in Early Access, and in my time playing it, there's been a few bugs that have forced me to reload it but it saves often so not a big problem. Hopefully as development goes on they can ensure it's stable. I've seen various reports from others on the same, so it's not Linux specific. Otherwise, it works just fine with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> on Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>A tentative recommendation because it's enjoyable but a little unstable and the balance needs constant work as they add more to it. I really like it though and think you will too. <em>Now if you'll excuse me my kingdom needs me. Time for another run.</em></p>

      <title>Sol Cesto is a super weird tactical roguelite with rad art all about luck and pulling teeth</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was the art style of Sol Cesto that first pulled me in, now I'm hooked on the roguelite slot-machine like mechanics of it. <em>Note: personal purchase. It's in Early Access so this is just an initial thoughts review.</em></p>
<p>Luck is the name of the game. You start off by choosing a hero and then descend ever deeper into a constantly-changing dungeon. The hook here is how the dungeon is presented, which is <em>very</em> much like a slot machine full of treasures and monsters. You click a row, and randomly drop into one of the squares and see the result. A chest? More money, a monster? Fight it and potentially lose some health. It's the whole risk versus reward situation having you constantly decide if another click in the current dungeon level is worth it. Pushing your luck can bring great benefits, or death.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3506304231749214546gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3506304231749214546gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While your movements are completely random, the way it's all presented is perfectly clear. You can tell easily at a glance what each creature can do to you, or any special abilities they have.</p>
<p>On each floor you have to do a minimum amount of successful movements to open the door, which allows you to move onto the next level of the dungeon. This may give you more slot-machine like picks or various other events like a bucket to drop money in to spend on permanent upgrades later, another has you stick your hand into a machine to gain more attack power and so on. I just love seeing all the artwork in this, it's awesome to look at in a creepy sort of way. The music in it definitely helps that uneasy feeling too.</p>
<p>The events system <em>initially</em> bugged me a bit though, since they're all locked behind a star progression system. Once I got the hang of it after a few runs though, their design became clear and it's all part of tickling your brain into wanting just one more run. The bucket event I mentioned, this is the key. When you lose a run and go back to the character screen, you get to spend money on the stars in the sky to expand the game and unlock more of the events system. It's actually a rather interesting progression system. But still, more events open from the start would just really help the experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18334209851749216001gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18334209851749216001gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Anyway, what's this about teeth? This game is thoroughly bizarre. One of the events you unlock early on is a statue that gives you a choice between two teeth to pull out, each having various run-altering effects that stack up as you build up your tooth collection.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4545988541749215146gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4545988541749215146gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20262587751749215145gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20262587751749215145gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can unlock various characters, each of which have different abilities to aid you in your dungeon crawling. For example: one character can use their ability to drop into any random square vertically, rather than just picking a row and going into any square horizontally. </p>
<p>There's also a shop and inventory system, where you can build up a few single-use items to help you on your run. Like an arrow to fire at a specific square to remove a monster, a health potion, a shield against a single attack and more. This is again where the risk vs rewards system comes into play. Do you save your money for the shop to get items so you can get further into a run? Or, do you put loads of money into the bucket to unlock some stars when you die? Lots to think about during a run even though it's all simple single-clicking (so it's quite accessible too).</p>
<p>The character death animation and voice-over really make me chuckle every time too. So insanely weird. I also love the way the enemy creatures have two different animated styles between them overpowering you and being an easy kill. There's a lot of little touches to love about Sol Cesto.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0X451SngYxY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/202a5a1ccdeee7e4ffc0dde5f38822fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0X451SngYxY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's absolutely mesmerising.</p>
<p>Sol Cesto is in Early Access and works great on Desktop Linux with the latest Proton 9.0-4. The Steam Overlay didn't work though, which is a common problem with games built using web tech.</p>

      <title>Net.Attack() is like Vampire Survivors but you program unique attacks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this is seriously cool! Net.Attack() takes the basics of Vampire Survivors, and gets you doing a little visual programming.</p>
<p>The basics are all here with you moving around an arena, taking down enemies and collecting XP gems to level up and gain some boosts. A major difference here is that your attacks are manually crafted using visual programming with little logic gates, which really makes it stand out in a now very crowded genre.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7600377051749207683gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>How it works — you move around the arena and collect money from hijacking various computer chips by standing on them for a certain amount of time. Then, you move into a node-based attack-building screen (available any time during a run), to buy new blocks and stick them all together. You do so by purchasing nodes, and then connecting them up from your initial OnTick block and then will all execute in order, which enables you to make some truly weird and wonderful combinations.</p>
<p>An example here (click the below image to make it bigger) is that I had an initial run set up to fire a single laser each tick. And, if I got a perfect hit to then fire another from <em>that</em> enemy to another enemy, which has a code block to split into three lasers and at the <em>same</em> time produce a circular electric shockwave from that enemy. The result was quite explosive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21218131101749209881gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21218131101749209881gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a few different characters with different starting code blocks too. I think the developer has an absolutely brilliant idea here, and I really can't wait to see more from this one on how many insane builds you can make with the mixture of nodes and level-up buffs.</p>
<p>I tested the demo on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> without a problem.</p>

      <title>Near-Mage is a gorgeous looking new hand-painted witchy adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Near-Mage is a brand new hand-painted adventure from Stuck In Attic, who also made Gibbous - A Cthulhu Adventure. One I somehow missed from the end of last month, it has Native Linux support just like their previous game and it really does look absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>Near-Mage is a dark yet heartfelt journey through a fantastical world inspired by the developers’ homeland. Featuring hand-painted visuals and traditional animation reminiscent of Ghibli films, classic Disney, and European comic books, the game blends whimsical storytelling with cosmic horror undertones.</p>
<p>You just turned 18. You’re far away from your parents. You just found out you’re a witch. What could go wrong? Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Craft your own spell inventory and magical build at the Transylvanian Institute for Magick, ensuring different outcomes with every playthrough.</li>
<li>Fully voiced cast featuring 100+ speaking roles.</li>
<li>Over 3 hours of lush orchestral original music.</li>
<li>Branching narrative and replayable magic system.</li>
<li>Customize your player character with plenty of clothes and hairstyles.</li>
<li>A modern take on point-and-click adventures, playable with mouse or gamepad.</li>
<li>A lived in open world where the adventure you embark on relies not on typical point and click tropes, but on getting to know the people and the places, and how much empathy you have for them.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dragon Lands is Forager meets a creature collector and it looks real sweet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One now on my radar is Dragon Lands, a sweet looking mixture of an incremental game about creature collection, farming, crafting and automation.</p>
<p>The developer noted in an email they think it's like a mixture of the game Forager and To The Core for the basics but with creature collecting too. That idea alone had me sold pretty quickly. They mentioned clearly in their email that Steam Deck is a supported platform for the game. So it should run with no problems on Desktop Linux with Proton too.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oqxOo6bOTtM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/024d37d9e04b8ee3f9505356cbe581fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oqxOo6bOTtM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And the main gameplay trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NP6bs4TXm88"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa4cb076cfa679c4b93599bfdf064bdd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NP6bs4TXm88" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You will start by gathering and collecting resources, from common stone and wood, to rare gems and even dragons! Use them to unlock and craft new buildings, skills and more.</li>
<li>Collect Dragons with unique abilities. As you progress through the game, you will use them to automate your farming and production.</li>
<li>Experiment with a vast crafting system to create tools, buildings, magical items, and more. Uncover rare recipes and push your production to the limit!</li>
<li>Explore the upgrade skill tree, learn new abilities and level-up your Dragons.</li>
<li>This game takes inspiration from masterpieces like Forager, Nova Lands, Outpath, To The Core and Nodebuster!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's quite some ways off though with a release planned for Q2 2026.</p>

      <title>Borderlands 2 is free to claim and keep on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a big Borderlands Franchise Sale on Steam, and you can get a free to keep copy of Borderlands 2 for a limited time. It's still one of the best co-op shooters around, even with how many years ago it was released.</p>
<p>All you have to do is go to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> page when logged in and hit the "Add to Account" button. You have until June 8th, 5PM UTC to claim it for keeps. It has an old Native Linux port and it also runs well with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/179828261749201232gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I wouldn't be doing my duty if I didn't mention the recent reviews situation, as users have pushed it into "Overwhelmingly Negative". A similar situation with other older Borderlands games on Steam with their reviews.</p>
<p>Why? It seems to be mixture of updates to the Terms of Service / <a href="http://store.steampowered.com//eula/49520_eula_0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EULA</a> by Take-Two Interactive (who own the publisher 2K), along with a <em>stupid</em> comment from Gearbox's Randy Pitchford on X/Twitter in <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> to a user concerned about the price:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2618464381749201732gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the EULA, I don't know exactly what's different and the games <em>haven't</em> been updated so aren't doing anything they weren't doing so before. It's mostly just the usual lawyer speak for companies to cover their butt, along with keeping up with newer regulations across different regions. Some of the claims I've seen about it being "spyware" are just over-blowing it into pure 100% exaggeration.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the games to claim from Prime Gaming for June 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh month and new games to claim via Prime Gaming for June 2025. Here's what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for June 2025 the list is actually quite <em>short</em>, and there's nothing included across the month from the Epic Store. So we might be seeing an end to Prime Gaming and Epic teaming up for giving away games like this. I've updated the table as it is for today anyway.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heroic-launcher-for-epic-gog-amazon-games-on-linux-steamos-v2-17-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>
<p><em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal more GeForce NOW titles for June including Dune: Awakening and FBC: Firebreak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Move over Stardew, it&#39;s time for Cattle Country</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for your next casual game after Stardew Valley? Cattle Country is a good choice with a big sense of adventure.<strong> </strong><em>Note: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love Stardew but I burned out on it long ago. It's a great game but I needed something new and fresh and Cattle Country thankfully fits the bill perfectly for me. From Castle Pixel, the team that also made the Blossom Tales series, it's a big mixture of things that will give you a whole lot to do. From tending crops, raising cattle, or rustlin’ up friendships with the townsfolk, there's always something.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qttnZq5qOb4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cc8557717bed734557cddc87afce9580.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qttnZq5qOb4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you've played Stardew Valley, Roots of Pacha, Fields of Mistria or any other 2D casual farming life sim, you'll know a fair bit of what to expect. Here though it's a wild-western adventure, with everything fitting quite nicely into the theme and of course that includes a few bandits along with way too. So perhaps a little bit less casual than others, but it's enough to spice things up a little to keep me interested. However, the game does have options when you make a new save to entirely turn off enemies — so you can play it entirely casually without fuss.</p>
<p>For fans of their previous series Blossom Tales, you'll be happy to see their familiar visual style has been kept here although they've clearly upped the production value on it somewhat, with textures that have a fair bit more depth and life to them. It's not quite as retro looking but still pixel art. Lovely though, my first thought when starting the game was just how sweet it all looked.</p>
<p>A nice introduction too, with you being walked to your plot and then given all the basic tools and tent that you'll need to survive. After that, you're basically on your own to do as you see fit, along with a few basic starter quests with more quests available the more you explore and talk to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3693734461749125465gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3693734461749125465gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8417097801749125466gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8417097801749125466gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully, your tools don't have any durability system as it keeps it all very chill so you can just keep on expanding as far as the land will let you. Although, there is an energy system for your character, with you not being able to actually do all that much in a single day before you'll start doing a rather sweet little yawn and eventually pass out if you don't make it to bed. I'll admit I abruptly laughed the first time my character passed out, the way it's done is just funny. Expensive though, you get hauled over to the doctor and have to pay for the privilege of being carried to their bed. Seems like they took some inspiration from the ridiculous US health system, extortionate pricing for the doc. Going to bed early is definitely the way to go, with no drawbacks I'm aware of.</p>
<p>There's also a health system which you'll need to keep an eye on or it will cost you. For both health and energy, there's various ways to increase them during the day via foraging, making food and more.</p>
<p>Cattle Country's world feels so darn alive too. Everywhere you go you're being watched by rabbits, birds, squirrels, deer and more. Of course there's a fishing mini-game too, which is all about tapping the button in the right places across a few staged to reel it in. Similar to the shooting, which is it's own little mini-game as well. They're not the only mini-games either. Oh, and those animals? Some don't like you very much, like what appears to be a Vulture that will come swooping down to scratch you. Taking them down is easy though, and gives you a few extra useful feathers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20125403001749125325gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20125403001749125325gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The progress system is a nice one here. After you go through the initial start, you can really do pretty much anything, as long as you've spoken to the right people to get access to what you need. But right from the start you get access to craft and buy as much of anything as you want (funding allowing of course). That said, as you do more and level up, you will get access to more to build and cook so there progression is sprinkled in but not too slowly. You'll also need to level up your relationships with a few people to access more too. So exploring and chatting is <em>necessary</em> here.</p>
<p>And, naturally, what's a good farming game like this without some mining? There's that too. However, unlike others, it completely swaps the viewpoint to be more like Terraria. Not just in style, the mining actually really does more resemble Terraria with platforms and torches too. I really wasn't expecting that, but it's a nice touch to make the game feel like it has that little bit more depth to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11474580041749123096gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11474580041749123096gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot more to it with events that happen as you progress through, which I won't spoil, but it's lovely how the game opens up as you go through it.</p>
<p>It came out of the gate a little rough, but the developers have been releasing update after update with lots of bug fixes and smaller little quality of life features that it now seems like it's in a great state to go and pick it up. </p>
<p>The Steam store page at time of writing this note only states "Partial Controller Support", but it works without problems with my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-is-a-top-premium-feeling-controller/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">8BitDo Ultimate 2</a>. Although, one little complaint, I really dislike the way you put down crops, water them and put down items, I find it seriously fiddly on a controller to get the right square lined up. </p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ranchin’ &amp; Handcraftin’</strong> - Roll up your sleeves and build your dream homestead from the ground up. Raise cattle, craft tools, and carve out your slice of paradise under those big blue skies.</li>
<li><strong>Swappin’ Stories</strong> - Meet a tough but kind-hearted community. Lend a hand, share a tale, and maybe find yourself a few lifelong friends.</li>
<li><strong>Beware of Bandits</strong> - Not all folks are friendly. Defend your ranch and keep an eye out for trouble brewing on the horizon.</li>
<li><strong>Rodeos to Romance</strong> - From bonds of friendship to sparks of love, get to know 18 romanceable characters and see where your heart leads.</li>
<li><strong>Buried Treasure</strong> - Grab a pickaxe and strike it rich! Explore mines full of rare minerals, secrets, and maybe a bandit stash or two.</li>
<li><strong>Trackin’ Wildlife</strong> - The wilderness is teemin’ with critters. Hunt for survival or simply roam and admire nature’s bounty.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cattle Country has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified. So you're good to go on other SteamOS systems too.</p>
<p>Overall it's a lovely game well worth your time that sticks quite close to the inspiration of other similar casual farming life sims, but thanks to the setting it does enough to keep things interesting with the wild west. Absolutely filled full of charm and an easy recommendation.</p>

      <title>Heroic Launcher v2.17.1 released - fixing games not launching on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher has a bug-fix released out with v.2.17.1 bringing some essential fixes, like games not launching.</p>
<p>A change to the way the launcher updated DXVK (Direct3D to Vulkan translator) was included in a previous release, which unfortunately caused a bunch of issues with launching games on Linux systems (like SteamOS / Steam Deck) due to it hitting GitHub's rate-limit and blocking it. This has been reverted since it was problematic, so now all games should launch properly again. </p>
<p>On top of that Proton is now listed first in the Wine list (since that's what most people will be using), and the newer game pages <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heroic-launcher-for-epic-gog-amazon-games-on-linux-steamos-v2-17-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">introduced in the big v2.17 release</a> have an enhanced responsive design.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10862599201749110715gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles announced for September 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix have officially announced FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles, which will be releasing September 30th. Yep, it's real and it's getting a Steam release so you'll be able to play the much-loved classic on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>More about it: originally released in 1997 for the PlayStation, later gaining a version in 2007 for the PlayStation Portable.  FINAL FANTASY TACTICS - The Ivalice Chronicles is a tactical RPG that tells the true history of a troubled land. Following the death of the king, a mere boy of two ascends the throne. That means whoever is named regent essentially rules the land. Two dukes vie for the position - Goltanna the Black Lion and Larg the White Lion. These powerful figures are destined to clash, and the resulting conflict would become known as the War of the Lions.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UKRoOtl7weI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19549066845115a060fdc1a23d3f0475.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UKRoOtl7weI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the original classic is included, this new edition will have some improvements for those who want it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A brand-new user interface</strong> - the game’s UI has been completely overhauled to make the game even more approachable and intuitive. It’s now quicker and easier to control your units, see turn order and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updated visuals</strong> - the game’s graphics have been reworked to look great on HD displays. The vibrant 3D battlegrounds and detailed pixel art have never looked so good!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Voice acting</strong> - The story now features full voice acting in English and Japanese from a talented cast, including Joe Pitts (Ramza), Gregg Lowe (Delita), Hannah Melbourn (Agrias), Timothy Watson (Cidolfus), Harry McEntire (Mustadio), Ben Starr (Dycedarg), and cameos by Cody Christian (Cloud Strife from FINAL FANTASY VII remake series) and Briana White (Aerith Gainsborough from FINAL FANTASY VII remake series).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tactical View</strong> - this new feature makes it easier to get the lay of the land and plan your actions across the battlefield.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Battle speed</strong> - Speed up battles to fly through them faster. It’s great if you want to blow through easy fights or quickly practice with different team compositions!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New difficulty levels</strong> - Do you want to really test your tactics, or are you in it more for the story? New difficulty levels let you adjust the game to your playstyle!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The Steam page is supposed to be live, but seems like they forgot to set it public, so it should be up soon. Looks like it will be about £50. Nice to see we're getting it on PC right away.</p>

      <title>DELTARUNE is now on Steam with Chapters 1-4 available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer tobyfox has released DELTARUNE on Steam, their follow-up to the smash-hit UNDERTALE and it's a game that's just insanely hard to describe.</p>
<p>Even the creator has a hard time talking about what exactly it is noting "I don't know what you call this kind of game. It's just a game you can play after you complete UNDERTALE, if you want to". Is it actually connected to UNDERTALE? Well, that's not entirely clear either. The developer said "It's a different world that might even have different rules. That doesn't mean there will be no connections at all though". Okay then. It's one of those you just have to play it to get it situations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yDzgiGdekas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/68a5be8e3468372eff6d263543189856.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yDzgiGdekas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's been such a long time coming and such a big event for fans, the developer in the latest newsletter basically told you to stay off social media if you don't want to see spoilers. </p>
<p>You won't get any from me though, I haven't even played Chapter 1. Both this and UNDERTALE just fly a bit over my head. Yeah, yeah — I know, I'm missing out. I'll get around to them one day. Our resident contributor Samsai is the UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE nut who said to me "I have awaited for this day for aeons". Perhaps now there's more of it, I might blast through it in one go, being patient (just kidding, it's a long backlog) sure does pay off.</p>
<p>So what the heck is it? A retro-styled episodic RPG, with battles that you can resolve peacefully or through violence. </p>
<p>It's playable with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> on Linux systems and Valve just today rated it Steam Deck Verified! As i was writing this the game hit 113,894 concurrent players on Steam — wow, that was fast.</p>

      <title>Monster Train 2 is a seriously incredible deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking all the good about Monster Train and just making it a whole lot bigger, Monster Train 2 is an excellent deck-building game. <em>Disclosure: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>I have far too many hours to count across many different deck-builders and yet, Monster Train 2 might now be my actual proper favourite in the genre because there's just so much about it to enjoy. Thanks to all the content and the way you play through it, along with the endless mode you really could just put this on that list of games you would take with you onto a desert island. It will keep you going on and on forever, with each play-through feeling thoroughly fresh and exciting.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of options you're constantly presented with and the brilliant way it blends different genres together. It's not just a deck-builder, it's also a bit tower defence too which is what really helps set it apart from the likes of Slay the Spire (that's also just brilliant). Monster Train 2 is all about keeping your train moving by protecting your Pyre at the top.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9um2KbFwHq8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c90333cdfd18267e8bf5f2e2d1f1daad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9um2KbFwHq8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In most deck-builders of this sort, you're given a few creatures and then your attack cards to battle across a single floor per level (think Slay the Spire again). Unlike others though, in Monster Train 2 you battle across multiple floors at the same time, positioning your creatures in each of them to prevent enemies boarding the train to reach your Pyre at the top. <em>So in that sense, it's a bit like you're playing multiple games at the same time.</em></p>
<p>The battles go on in multiple waves of enemies boarding your train, until their champion arrives for you to kill or be killed. The battle system itself is quite clever too.</p>
<p>At the start of your turn you can place down more creatures in each floor up to a cost limit, use a spell to take down enemy health, buff up a creature with an item and so on. Then when you end your turn, it’s like an auto-battler as each team fights and enemies move on up the floors towards your Pyre. Your Pyre has its own health and attack power, so it’s not the end if enemies get to the top (they will often), it’s about wearing them all down as much as you possibly can.</p>
<p>Between battles you'll be actually moving your train between stations. This is where you then get to pick between different tracks, each of which have their own set of locations to use like merchants to upgrade cards or purge cards, event locations to pick between options and plenty more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19050409961749052561gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19050409961749052561gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Monster Train 2 on Desktop Linux</em></p>
<p>The upgrade system is ridiculous, as you can really make some insanely powerful cards. A fun quick example is the Pyreclasm spell card that causes a lot of explosive damage. I upgraded it to give even more damage, then i paid to make it cost less to use but it would be consumed (only use once per battle), but then pay more again to remove the consumed status and so end up with a single very powerful card ready to help destroy a boss.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13575768091749050894gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13575768091749050894gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Monster Train 2 on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>And then, on top of all that, I was able to duplicate the card. I just love the masses of options and upgrades you can do.</p>
<p>Really, I'm barely able to scratch the surface of what the game features and what I think about it in this article. I don't really do hyperbole but I really do think it's one of the best deck-builders ever made. More than a little overwhelming at the start though, especially the way it just throws you in at the deep end with a few helpful hints, it's more like a trial by fire getting into it but it's absolutely worth it.</p>
<p>The greatest thing though? It has an undo button! Hooray! Begone miss-clicks of doom! It winds back to the start of the current turn, giving you a chance at a do-over. Lovely.</p>
<p>If you loved the first game, you'll feel right at home with this as it's basically a no-brainer to go and pick up. For everyone else who just like deck-builders, you can forget about being on the fence — you'll love it too. Works to perfection on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> and is a thoroughly good time on Steam Deck too (Valve rated it Deck Verified). Haven't had any crashes and performance is perfect.</p>

      <title>VacuumTube is the best way to watch YouTube on Steam Deck, SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Watching YouTube on Steam Deck / SteamOS? You need to grab VacuumTube which makes the whole experience a lot nicer. This is <em>not</em> a custom client, instead it wraps Google's own "YouTube Leanback" that's used for consoles and smart TVs in Electron and pretends to be the official YouTube app (as Google block it on PCs).</p>
<p>Quite a clever solution, although one Google is probably not particularly happy to see. Especially since it has a built-in adblocker too. The result is that for Steam Deck, SteamOS and any other media centre PC you just get an overall better experience when compared with running YouTube via the web browser.</p>
<p>It's available on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/rocks.shy.VacuumTube" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, so you can install it in Desktop Mode via the Discover store. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-extra-software-apps-and-games-on-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my guide on installing extra software</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18596156551749045309gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>When you've added it to Steam and launch it in Gaming Mode, it feels like it was made for the Steam Deck / SteamOS systems. Controller support out of the box too, making it the perfect YouTube companion for you.</p>
<p>It just goes to show how easy it would actually be for Google to do directly. Just like how we have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an official GeForce NOW app for the Steam Deck</a> too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17830482031749045399gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The code is on <a href="https://github.com/shy1132/VacuumTube" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, it's open source.</p>
<p>Hope you find it useful! I certainly do.</p>

      <title>Ricave is a quirky first-person 3D roguelike dungeon crawler with some fun interactions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ricave is a thoroughly quirky and unique first-person, 3D roguelike dungeon crawler, now available in Early Access and worth a look. <em>Disclosure: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>From Polish solo developer Piotr Walczak, it's quite impressive what they've built here with all the systems that work together. You will do a big mixture of exploring, fighting, looting, swimming, spell casting, trap setting, discovering secrets and more across various randomly generated dungeons.<em> It's all about outsmarting your enemies in this one.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UPFXckCbqL0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ebdd94e7bab02e4b92cfbf1e4d811321.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UPFXckCbqL0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's entirely deterministic, which is a full utilised feature so you can rewind time to try something else and doing the same thing will always provide the same result. As they said, there's no cheesing your way through this one. Well, I'm sure I'll still find a way to do plenty of stupid things.</p>
<p>The combat and health tracking are quite fun and interesting in this one too. You can directly target body parts during combat, but so can your enemy. Damage to your eyes causes blindness, missing arms limit item interactions, a missing leg will slow you down and so on. And then there's also various status effects from illnesses to starvation. Ricave certainly has a lot going for it.</p>
<p>At its core, it's a roguelike though, and so it can be a thorough challenge. However, it's quite inviting with that challenge thanks to the accessible interface and colourful design. That, and a full tutorial that will teach you the basics properly but naturally there's a lot you're left to discover through trial and error, especially when it comes to all the different items and enemy types.</p>
<p>If you enjoy a good dungeon crawler, it's time to give Ricave a go and see what you think. It has Native Linux support now in Early Access. A game that clearly deserves a lot more attention and sales.</p>

      <title>Tempest Rising is truly an RTS worth your time for C&amp;C fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tempest Rising is a thoroughly great RTS that's worth picking up, giving us a modern classic that all Command &amp; Conquer fans will love. <em>Disclosure: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Especially me! After growing up with Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert and Tiberian Sun I was itching to play through Tempest Rising and when it comes to the single-player it does not disappoint. Thanks to Valve's Proton, it also runs just perfectly on Desktop Linux. A true love letter to the classics, welcoming to newcomers and veterans of the genre alike that's crammed full of action. With an easy to understand UI, along with a campaign that starts slow to ease you in with the controls.</p>
<p>All parts of it truly feel like they took the original Command &amp; Conquer series, and just made it a whole lot more modern with a familiar but still unique story. I could go on and on about how it looks and feels like C&amp;C and that to me is a good thing, it's a genre that just isn't anywhere near as popular as it once was, and many developers have tried to mix up the gameplay mechanics and often fail. Here it just feels like home to me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L_w9CLj8P5E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8563d50f68f8c9944798ab9d18b381f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L_w9CLj8P5E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Set in an alternate timeline (of course it is) and now in 1997 where the world has been torn apart by the Cuban Missile Crisis, which just kept escalating and so plenty of nukes were fired. What you get is a post World War 3 era that is now being overrun by a mysterious thing called the "Tempest". It looks like a plant, appears to spread like one, but it's not and it has some rather peculiar properties. I don't want to spoil too much of it, but it again goes back to the C&amp;C roots with a bit of mystery and eventually someone else comes knocking at Earth's door.</p>
<p>There's even various optional mission intro cut-scenes, but no real-life actors like the cheesiness from the classics. The animated characters do <em>look</em> great though, the developers did a good job on them but they're not overly interesting or attention-grabbing. However, I did like that you can talking to them and ask a few questions to get a bit more insight into the lore of the world. Thankfully, the actual gameplay is a real blast. I do like the distinctness of the sides too from the units to the cut-scenes, they're very different feeling.</p>
<p>With a clear gameplay loop of base-building, harvesting resources and then sending off your units to go destroy the enemy, it's all very clear-cut in the missions. Like any good base-building RTS, it starts off rather simply as it introduces you to the mechanics but will rapidly expand your arsenal and you'll have a lot to think about.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7848830981749041284gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Partly due to all the different unit abilities and the population cap you have to keep an eye one when building units, sprinkling in a little Starcraft into the mixture which really does add nicely to the experience, and will ensure it constantly keeps your undivided attention. The construction system is a nice touch on it too, instead of clicking through buildings in the side-panel and waiting to place them once money has been put into them, you can place them right away and they'll build one after the other in order as your money ticks down. So you can do a little planning.</p>
<p>With thanks to all the unit abilities, it's not just a straight up attack-move into combat game. It does take time to learn how to best use each individual type of unit, so there's more actual strategy to it all. Rather than just click, move and wait it's more about searching your surroundings and thinking on what unit and abilities will work best - so it's just that bit more interesting. However, that said, it's also not even strictly necessary, you can still treat it like a meat-grinder if you wish, it just might take a bit longer to get through.</p>
<p>On a technical level, the game does perform really well. Surprisingly so for an Unreal Engine game too. It's not a particularly intense looking game graphically, but don't get me wrong the overall design is fantastic. Performance has not been an issue with it smoothly sailing over 100FPS for me on the highest settings. No issues at all with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p><em>I haven't tested online play these thoughts are just from the solo campaign.</em></p>
<p>With two different campaigns to play through that give quite a number of hours of gaming, Tempest Rising is fun and explosive base-building strategy in pure form and I loved every second of it.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic RTS base building with fast and fluid hard-hitting combat.</li>
<li>3 asymmetrical factions, (2 playable at launch), each featuring distinct economy and play styles.</li>
<li>Each faction offers a unique roster of units.</li>
<li>2 epic single player campaigns with between-mission cutscenes.</li>
<li>Skirmish, custom games, and ranked multiplayer matchmaking with Glicko-2 rating.</li>

      <title>Re-establish a haven for the lost dwarven civilization in Regions of Ruin: Runegate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Regions of Ruin: Runegate has just been announced from Gameclaw Studio, a fresh explorative RPG hack-and-slash adventure full of dwarfs. It was originally going to be called Regions of Ruin 2 by the looks of it.</p>
<p>More about it from the dev: "Regions of Ruin: Runegate - an explorative RPG hack-and-slash adventure where you attempt to re-establish a haven for the lost dwarven civilization. All that remains of the once-glorious people is dust, scattered exiles, and monster-infested landscapes. Journey across varied lands, help those in need, gather resources and fight off goblins and monsters as you slowly rebuild a home for your fellow dwarfs".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r7q3I3rdwAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f4c3b4181599ab2cfeeedd80ab210be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The former land of the dwarves is as diverse as it is vast, filled with rich veins of resources, loyal allies and fearsome foes. Journey through lush environments, treacherous weather, glowing crystal-filled caverns and more in your pursuits for riches and information. And be prepared to carve your path through relentless enemies, hell-bent on sending the last of the dwarves into extinction.</p>
<p>On your travels, you will encounter dwarven allies in need of assistance. Come to their aid, enlist their help and create a safe haven for your people by rebuilding a civilization. By gathering resources and meeting skilled adventurers, you will be able to unlock new facilities and technologies, furthering your pursuits.</p>
<p>Shape your dwarven hero from their appearance to their preferred style of fighting, through a range of weapons, gear and skill trees for you to explore and experiment with. Approach each encounter as you deem best: Dive straight into the fray with a spear in hand or sneak up close and stab a goblin in the back. Just remember - stay vigilant while fighting, for enemies will adapt to your actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous games Meeple Station and Regions Of Ruin have Native Linux support and it appears this will too.</p>

      <title>Dandelion Void from Project Zomboid modders will offer up plant-based horrors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originating from a team of Project Zomboid modders, Manzanita Interactive announced Dandelion Void featuring deadly plant-based creatures. It definitely has a sort of Zomboid style, which I think is quite charming actually and from the trailer it looks like it works well for the setting.</p>
<p>This is a single-player game, with you trying to survive on the starship<em> </em>Pergola which was supposed to be a "civilization in a bottle". Obviously, everything went wrong and now it's quite a bit overrun with greenery and some of it appears to be quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Keeping to their roots, it will be very moddable. The developers will be providing a map editor and a "robust Lua API for modders". So you'll be able to "Create and modify maps, import custom clothing and weapons, or dream up whole new Lua scripted scenarios and biomes".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rdZQb8uFx-Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/82e72d981981d07bef61dcf68f3055e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rdZQb8uFx-Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cut through jungle corridors</strong> in search of crafting supplies, exotic weapons, and rare decorations.</li>
<li><strong>Pry open long sealed bulkhead doors</strong> — just pray the void of interstellar space isn’t waiting for you on the other side.</li>
<li><strong>Patch up rotted spacesuits</strong>, lead lined radiation gear, and other protective garments to traverse dangerous new areas.</li>
<li><strong>Stockpile </strong><strong>for the next cold snap;</strong> life support is on the fritz after centuries of neglect, and you can never be sure when it might fail… for days or even months at a time.</li>
<li><strong>The jungle is alive</strong>, and extremely hostile. Will you chance a run through the serrated tendrils of crawling plant life, or barricade up and hide somewhere safe?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll need Proton to play it on Linux.</p>

      <title>SaveState is an open source versatile game save backup manager - now with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We already have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/ludusavi-seems-like-a-pretty-good-open-source-game-save-backup-tool/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ludusavi</a>, but now we also have SaveState, another attempt to create a user-friendly and versatile game save backup manager. About two weeks ago, the developer released version 1.4 that noted "Full Linux Support" that has been "Rigorously Tested".</p>
<p>A useful tool for games that don't support Steam Cloud (or if you just want to be extra careful), and for everything else you'll install outside of Steam including Minecraft and various emulators it can detect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18255665251749034969gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Just some of the features it has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backup &amp; Restore:</strong> Perform compressed <code class="inline-code">.zip</code> backups for selected profiles with a single click. Restore from any available backup.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Backup Management:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Configurable number of backups to keep per profile (automatically deletes the oldest).</li>
<li>Configurable backup compression level (Standard/Recommended, Maximum, or None/Stored).</li>
<li>Optional check for minimum free disk space on the backup drive before starting a backup.</li>
<li>Optional check for maximum source folder size to prevent accidental backup of huge folders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Steam Integration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Scans for Steam installation and libraries.</li>
<li>Automatically detects installed Steam games.</li>
<li>Attempts to identify the correct Steam User ID (resolving profile names if the optional <code class="inline-code">vdf</code> library is installed).</li>
<li>Suggests save game paths based on Steam UserData conventions.</li>
<li>Configure backup profiles for Steam games directly from the detected list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Drag &amp; Drop Profile Creation:</strong> Drag a game's shortcut (<code class="inline-code">.lnk</code> file) onto the main window to automatically extract the game name and installation path, then initiates a background search for the save location.</li>
<li><strong>Manual Profile Creation:</strong> Easily add any game by specifying a profile name and the path to its save folder.</li>
<li><strong>Minecraft Java Edition Support:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Automatically locates the default <code class="inline-code">.minecraft/saves</code> folder.</li>
<li>Lists all installed worlds, reading the world name from <code class="inline-code">level.dat</code> if the optional <code class="inline-code">nbtlib</code> library is present (falls back to folder name otherwise).</li>
<li>Create backup profiles directly from the detected world list.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Shortcut Creation:</strong> Create <code class="inline-code">.lnk</code> shortcuts on your desktop for specific profiles. Clicking the shortcut runs a silent backup for that profile using <code class="inline-code">backup_runner.py</code> and shows a desktop notification.</li>
<li><strong>Emulator Support (Experimental):</strong>
<ul>
<li>Automatic detection and profile creation for supported emulators' save data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Interface:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clean and simple graphical interface built with PySide6.</li>
<li>Switchable Dark and Light themes.</li>
<li>Profile list showing name and basic backup info (count, last backup date).</li>
<li>Settings dialog to configure paths, limits, theme, language, and more.</li>
<li>Dockable Log Console displaying detailed operation status and errors.</li>
<li>Basic internationalization support (Italian/English currently included).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Pulp adventure thriller The Drifter looks amazing and releases July 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Drifter from Powerhoof is an awesome looking adventure thriller and it just got a new trailer, along with a release date reveal of July 17. Native Linux support is confirmed for the release too.</p>
<p>Inspired by the works of Stephen King, John Carpenter and Michael Crichton — it features some fantastic pixel-art and fast-paced gameplay that will work just as well with a mouse and keyboard, as it will with a gamepad. They've even put a demo up for Steam Next Fest so you can check it out right now.</p>
<p>Before you do though, have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dAJ1LQVqWWE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9d1a9280c8998bc8334b1c73222e5af.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dAJ1LQVqWWE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->A classic 2D point and click adventure with the brake-lines cut - <em>The Drifter</em> plunges players headfirst into a web of shadowy corporations, conspiracy, murder, and the thousand year obsession of a madman.</p>
<p>Mick Carter's been drifting a while now - moving from job to job, never staying one place long. Jumping a box-car to his old home town, he witnesses a violent murder, is pursued by hi-tech soldiers, thrown in a reservoir and drowned.</p>
<p>Just before his consciousness is ripped away, it is thrust back into his body. Alive again, seconds before his death. Mick is framed for the killing he witnessed, tormented by his own past, and haunted by the feeling that something followed him back from the other side…</p>
<p>The Drifter takes its cues from modern revival of the adventure genre and focuses on serving up a tight, razor-sharp narrative - propelling the player through the story - while grounded, unobtrusive and satisfying investigative puzzles act as the sinew between punchy narrative beats.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into The Grid is a cyberpunk roguelike deckbuilder and dungeon crawler from Flatline Studios, with a fresh demo up ahead of Steam Next Fest. <em>Time to go crack open some firewalls and destroy some robots.</em></p>
<p>With this big upgrade to the demo they<span style="font-size:16px"> "overhauled most of the graphics, animations, SFX, and VFX, added new mechanics, and rebalanced others". They also said it only contains one of the five planned characters for the game, but the demo will still give you lots of hours to play.</span></p>
<p>There's also a new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PQJvJnP04w0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67fce18ef009d108230ae3d4f3271e7e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PQJvJnP04w0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>An exciting blend of deckbuilding, card battler and dungeon crawler</strong> - Into The Grid introduces a map exploration system to the genre that’s a breath of fresh air. You will need to be tactical and strategical not only in the way you put together your deck and play your cards, but also in how you explore the map and manage your limited resources to find and reach your goal before The Grid kicks you out, sends a private security force to your location, or worse.</li>
<li><strong>A unique dual resource system to diminish RNG and leverage “dead draws”</strong> - Into The Grid introduces a novel combat mechanic called “Commands”, skills you can activate during combat by spending a resource that almost every card in the game generates just by playing them. Commands are designed to have supporting effects that help to play around RNG by letting you, for example, draw or fetch cards from specific places. Their varied effects also enable different archetypes within each character, creating a new fan of possibilities as you change your Commands in between battles and adjust them to your current deck.</li>
<li><strong>5 Characters and Factions to discover the deep lore of the “2112 Universe”</strong><br/>
	​Into The Grid takes place in the year 2112, in a universe that Flatline Studios has been developing for even longer than the game itself. This universe is full of characters and entities with their own agendas and motivations. In gameplay terms, the full game will include 5 different characters, each one belonging to a different hacker Faction that determines the hacker’s ethos and their reasons to be outlaws.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support for the demo and will for the full game. The release is due sometime in Q3 2025 for Early Access.</p>

      <title>Castle Cab looks like Crazy Taxi but with an unhinged horse and silly customization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crazy Taxi delivery sim but with a horse and carriage, plus some over the top physics? Castle Cab really does look like a lot of fun. I'm all for a bit of chaos and the horse customization looks ridiculous too.</p>
<p>Going into more details the developers explain it as: "Castle Cab puts you in the horseshoes of a sentient, indestructible horse running a delivery service in a whimsical medieval kingdom. When wizards enlist your help to overthrow a king bent on banning magic, you’ll find yourself at the heart of a revolution that could lead the kingdom down an unpredictable path. Complete quirky quests, race through winding roads, and uncover hidden secrets."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o1u0smmioMk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7114369c56d2f361cbd40715fa3812f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o1u0smmioMk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Castle Cab's development has been a wild ride full of fun, hard work, and laughter," shared Royal Reign Studios' studio director Jacob von Appen. "Seeing kids light up while playing it has made it all worth it! We’re so grateful for the love so far, and we can’t wait for more people to jump in, have fun, and share in what’s ahead!"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cooperative Campaign</p>
<p>Join forces with up to 3 other players to navigate the bustling medieval world as a team. Work together to pick up patrons, deliver them (hopefully in one piece), and overcome outrageous obstacles. Collaboration is key—but so is laughing at your friends’ spectacular fails as carts flip, horses stumble, and chaos unfolds.</p>
<p>Competitive Mayhem</p>
<p>Prefer to leave teamwork in the dust? Switch gears and compete against your friends in a variety of riotous modes, where your goal is to outsmart, outrun, and outmaneuver your opponents. Sabotage their deliveries, steal their patrons, or simply cause as much carnage as possible to claim victory!</p>
<p>Deck Out Your Horse and Cart</p>
<p>It’s not just about getting the job done—it’s about looking hilariously good while doing it! Give your hardworking horse some flair with a variety of comically oversized hats, silly costumes, and vibrant patterns. Ever wanted to see a knight’s steed wearing a wizard’s hat? Now you can!</p>
<p>And why settle for an ordinary wooden cart when you can deliver patrons in style? Choose from an outrageous selection of carts, including a giant onion, a sleek sports car, or even a fully functional toilet on wheels!</p>
<p>Fun for All Ages</p>
<p>Designed with simplicity and fun in mind, Castle Cab is a game that everyone can enjoy, regardless of age or experience. The controls are intuitive and straightforward, making it easy for kids, casual players, and first-time gamers to jump right into the action.</p>
<p>At the same time, the chaotic physics and creative gameplay ensure there’s plenty of challenge and depth for experienced players to master. Castle Cab caters to everyone. Its humor, visual style, and gameplay are designed to entertain players of all generations.</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening will get Private Servers at release but with limits</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news for Dune: Awakening, Funcom have announced it actually will have Private Servers you can rent and sort with friends.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546736546679621439" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam post</a> published June 2nd the developer noted "We’ve previously communicated that private servers are for post-launch, but we’re happy to share that progress has been faster than expected". However, it's a bit complicated since it is at its heart a proper MMO so the game as a whole won't be <em>entirely</em> private.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is how the game works. There's many different servers, and a few of them contain different parts of the game. They said that "each server belongs to a World consisting of several other servers, and each of those share the same social hubs and Deep Desert" which "allows us to retain a neighborhood-like feel to the Hagga Basin and provide persistent, freeform building, and other server-demanding mechanics you typically see in survival games". Moving all of this to a private server model "has not been trivial".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10924759871748954547gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Rather than probably incorrectly paraphrasing it due to the mechanics involved, here's what the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>How private servers work</h4>
When you rent a private server, you essentially rent a server containing one Hagga Basin, just like the official servers. Here you have the full Hagga Basin map, and you can do everything you would do on an official server.<br/>
<br/>
Your private server will belong to a World consisting of other private servers, and you can choose a World for your private server when you rent yours from a provider.<br/>
<br/>
That means that you will still be able to take full advantage of Dune: Awakening’s large-scale multiplayer content and mechanics, including visiting the social hubs and the Deep Desert, to meet and play with people from any private server in the same World.<br/>
<br/>
Players do not rent or control social hubs nor the Deep Desert. These are provided by the server hosting company, who ensures each private server’s World has them.<br/>
<h4>Private server settings</h4>
So, what settings will be available for your private server?<br/>
<br/>
Because your private server will belong to a World of other private servers, and you will be meeting and playing with other people in the social hubs and the Deep Desert, you won’t be able to control every aspect of how your private server works.<br/>
<br/>
Which settings you can configure for your server is ultimately up to the third-party server provider, but these are the settings we are making available:<br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Zones:</strong> you can disable security zones entirely, making all parts of Hagga Basin PvP enabled, or you can choose to have pockets of PvP like on official servers</li>
<li><strong>Taxation:</strong> you can disable taxation on your server</li>
<li><strong>Sandstorms:</strong> you can disable sandstorms, making them not appear on your server</li>
</ul>
<br/>
You will also be able to name your server and set a password for it.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that private servers do not have an admin control panel nor character transfers presently. We will evaluate this functionality post-launch.<br/>
<h4>Visiting other private servers</h4>
<p>Just like how you can visit another server in your World when playing on official servers, you can do the same with private servers.<br/>
<br/>
All you need to do is select the other server in the server selection menu and put in the server’s password when prompted. You can take with you everything on your character, and you are free to do anything you would like on the server. You can even claim land, something you can’t do when visiting official servers.<br/>
<br/>
When you arrive on the other server, you will appear at Griffin’s Reach trade post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really does sound complicated and still a little bit confusing. But you essentially get your own private area, that's linked to a much bigger more public area.</p>
<p>Some other good news - their press team has approved my key for it. So I'll be taking a look to ensure it works properly on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck. I don't anticipate many problems, especially since they already <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/dune-awakening-will-have-battleye-enabled-for-linux-steamos-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed to GamingOnLinux that BattlEye would be enabled</a>. <em>Check out more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is out now, great for XCOM and strategy fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is the latest game from Trese Brothers, bringing some excellent squad-based tactics and it's out now. After tons of updates during Early Access, what we have is an impressive and feature-filled strategy game that blends in elements of XCOM and stealth games.</p>
<p>The game also takes on some of the spirit of other great games like Shadowrun and Invisible, Inc., so if you like the sound of those too you'll feel right at here. As a Cyber Knight fitted with a powerful cybernetic spinal implant, you lead a crew as you continue building up your reputation and connections and go on various heists. Featuring grid-less movement, environmental cover, specialised overwatch, initiative manipulation, independent enemy unit AI and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bzToChIOp2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/09b347f0ef1dc3aa101e6521f86fe9be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bzToChIOp2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot to enjoy with this one, especially with the depth of all the characters to upgrade and set up your squad exactly how you want. I've been looking for something to scratch the itch left by XCOM and this very well may be the one. You're in great hands with the Trese Brothers.</p>
<p>The full release comes with a second origin story to play through, new game character options, a new map, a raised level cap and a few bug fixes.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Steam Deck, SteamOS will now stop bugging you to install updates multiple times</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh Steam update for Steam Deck / SteamOS and additionally a Beta update too, both of which solve some annoyances.</p>
<p>The first to be released was the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529847413482980683" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Beta</a> update with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This update was re-released with the following additional changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare case that could result in multiple prompts to install the same update.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare case that could result in re-triggering the out of box wizard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added in-game keyboard shortcuts to open the Main Menu and Quick Access Menu.
	<ul>
<li>Default Main Menu hotkey: Shift+Tab</li>
<li>Default Quick Access Menu hotkey: Ctrl+Shift+Tab</li>
<li>Customizable in Settings-&gt;In Game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved steam client update installation speed. In some pathological cases this operation could take minutes to complete, when the expected completion time is seconds.</li>
<li>Fixed events showing blurred images in the library for games with adult content.</li>
</ul>

<p>And then the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529848048073838040" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Stable</a> update:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare case that could result in multiple prompts to install the same update.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare case that could result in re-triggering the out of box wizard.</li>
<li>Fixed the 'Battery Charge Limit' option showing on devices that currently don't support this feature.</li>
<li>Fixed events showing blurred images in the library for games with adult content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen the issue where system updates in Gaming Mode repeatedly appear, asking you to apply them when you've already done them. Hopefully this really will be the end of it now.</p>

      <title>Freaky incremental dungeon crawler Horripilant gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horripilant is a thoroughly unusual dungeon crawler that will make you feel quite uneasy blending in some elements from idler, puzzle and autobattler games. It will have Native Linux support at release built with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/godot-engine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a> and the first public demo is live now.</p>
<p>This is one you need to try. I just love how thoroughly unusual it is, can't think of another dungeon crawler that has a mixture quite like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BzHhzFOaIyw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce75adfa576bd4c9ff55cd25f896ab2e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BzHhzFOaIyw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incrementally gain and collect materials.</li>
<li>Combat horrific foes in the dungeon.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and explore the depths of your camp.</li>
<li>Upgrade your gear to venture deeper.</li>
<li>Meet god and gain strong boons.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You awaken. An old, battered knight, lost in the darkest corners of an abandoned dungeon, with no memory of how you got there. The stench of decay permeates the thick air. The walls seem to whisper your name.</p>
<p>As you stir, a strange tree sprout catches your eye. You hit it, for the voice demands it of you; a twig breaks off onto the ground. With your newfound resource, you seem to be able to ameliorate your equipment. Distorted moans echo from an empty staircase. The voice calls to you again, beckoning you. You must go down. It is your purpose...</p>
<p>Encounter bizarre characters, solve cryptic puzzles, and survive the horrors that lurk in every shadow. Will you escape this living nightmare, or will it consume you?</p>

      <title>Chilled factory-builder shapez 2 gets a massive upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>shapez 2 was already good and now the huge Dimension Update is out now, it looks like it's going to suck away plenty more hours of your time. Truly a wonderful factory building sim, that really has a clear focus on just letting you chill with it without the hassle of any kind of enemies. Just build the coolest looking shape-cutting thing you can.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The newly launched Dimension Update has some big new features like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>3D Platform Building:</strong> Build platforms, space belts, space pipes &amp; rails on multiple layers just as you do with buildings.</li>
<li><strong>Trains Rework:</strong> Quick &amp; Wait stops, transfer stations, multiple packages, new colors and more.</li>
<li><strong>Variable Launchers:</strong> Belt launchers, fluid launchers and wire transmitters now have variable range.</li>
<li><strong>New Layouts:</strong> Re-added old T, Cross and L-platform layouts, and added even more!</li>
<li><strong>Space Belts</strong> got a 400% throughput increase.</li>
<li>Allow <strong>searching</strong> for shapes on the map.</li>
<li>Added overflow splitter.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Global Wire Transmitters:</strong> Global Wire transmitters now have two inputs/outputs, one for the channel ID, one for the actual signal. This gives you basically infinite channels and replaces the old color-based system.</li>
<li><strong>Operator Shape Receiver:</strong> To be able to receive the operator shape definition, there is now a new Operator Shape Receiver building.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out their new 7 minute video on it:</p>

      <title>XWVM is a modern Unity engine to play STAR WARS - X-Wing, first Alpha out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>XWVM is a re-implementation mod for STAR WARS - X-Wing made in Unity, allowing you to get a better experience on modern platforms. A first Alpha build has been released for Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>Unlike OpenMW for Morrowind, it's not a <em>full</em> game engine remake. They do supply a HD asset pack though, so you can make it look a lot fancier and more modern, but it's entirely optional. The main point is just to preserve the classic to easily run it on modern platforms. As the mod developers describe on Mod DB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XWVM is a facilitator app to play Star Wars X-Wing from Lucas Arts and Totally Games. We are re-implementing the executable to extend the game beyond its original hardware support. The app requires the player to own and have installation of the original X-Wing game, or have the GOG or Steam versions of X-Wing Special Edition (either the 1993 floppy, the 1994 CD, and/or 1998 Windows edition). The team of fans developing XWVM is not associated with Lucasfilm Ltd or Disney, and XWVM is not an official Star Wars product. XWVM isn't a standalone game, or total conversion, but a tool to play the original product. XWVM neither contains nor distributes any copyrighted material. All game resource files (missions, voice overs, SFX, MIDI music, in-game graphics and 3D models, etc) are loaded from the player's copy of the original game, or are replacements originally created by our team, where the original resources are considered inadequate for today's standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see some comparisons in the videos they put up:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2pMmNYz4k_o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/86c91bdd10529bfc159de3dc75bee7ef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2pMmNYz4k_o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AMlzysP0cn4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee9199b9fe681b9ff8b8f3fb39848c9c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AMlzysP0cn4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">You do need the original game to supply the files it needs. You can buy it from:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_wars_xwing_special_edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/354430/STAR_WARS__XWing_Special_Edition/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And grab the project itself from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/games/star-wars-x-wing-special-edition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mod DB</a>.</p>
<p>Wonderful to see another classic reborn.</p>

      <title>Rock Crusher is an incremental clicker with a huge transformational skill tree</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have, admittedly, spent far too long playing the demo of Rock Crusher. An upcoming incremental clicker with Leaf Blower Revolution vibes.</p>
<p>Quite a simple game when you first start it that sees you do nothing more that throw your mouse around the screen, to crush rocks and use your blower to push gems off the screen. You have limited health that goes down as you drill rocks, and limited energy. Over time though, you build up into something quite ridiculous with helper drones and all sorts thanks to the rather large skill tree that lets you continually expand.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UldMIgK7UDI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3aa4990a64afa7ce6125fda1e578700e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UldMIgK7UDI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's an odd, slow and very therapeutic game. Although, it does get a bit nuts the longer you play of it.</p>
<p>There's some sort of story to this one too. You're on a mysterious planet and eventually you'll have some combat encounters, and when you beat all the bosses you'll get an ending which will reveal the secret of the planet apparently.</p>
<p>Try the demo that's live on Steam. It has a Linux version.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure The Mystery of Doomsday Valley confirmed for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another good one for fans of point and click adventures, keep an eye on the upcoming The Mystery of Doomsday Valley.</p>
<p>In development by True Ascension, Doomsday Valley is a mystery point-and-click adventure game that should appeal to players new and old to the genre. It's seeking funding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/trueascension/the-mystery-of-doomsday-valley" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the initial small goal met and there's 9 days left to help it reach some stretch goals to expand it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qdtEYoPJSRU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c213052e8f04efcc2939b1ad8d3a1ae3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qdtEYoPJSRU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game takes you to a remote town where unsettling events have left the locals on edge, where a doomsday cult once operated. You need to uncover the mystery by exploring strange locations and talking to interesting characters in order to find out what's really going on here. At the heart of the story is a discourse about news, fake news, conspiracy and truth.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hand-drawn HD artwork and traditional frame-by-frame animation.</li>
<li>Simple one-click interface.</li>
<li>In-game hint system, hot-spots and fast-travel.</li>
<li>Suspenseful and atmospheric soundtrack.</li>
<li>Inspired by classic adventures from the 90's.</li>
<li>Languages: Fully voiced in English and subtitles in English and German.</li>
<li>At least 4-6 hours of varied gameplay.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo available on Steam with Linux support.</p>

      <title>Ace shooter Selaco gets improved performance and a spiced-up randomizer mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco continues being one of the best upcoming shooters, with the latest Early Access update making it smoother than ever.</p>
<p>In the v0.90 Update the developers have detailed numerous performance improvements done to the game, with a new particle system to take better advantage of your hardware along with particles looking better. There's some additional upgrades to the effects for smoke, floor decals, blood and even improved AI enemy logic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1383342151748863194gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1383342151748863194gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally, the "Special Campaign / Randomizer" game mode now has some presets you can pick, instead of having to set everything manually (although that's still an option). There's some new enemy types added in this update with Ammo and Armor Bearers, that will drop what their name suggests on their death. Both enemy types are rare though, so don't expect to see them too often. A Heavy Gunner was also added that are bigger and meaner, a random encounter rework and lots more tweaks for it.</p>
<p>It's quite a long list of what they've done for this release including better swimming, more reactive explosions, interactive bullet casings, some brand new visual effects and so on. My favourite addition though? The Save Scumming mutator, letting you save and reload anywhere.</p>
<p>You can also now disable view bobbing if it was annoying you or causing you issues, along with improved camera tilting on gamepad.</p>
<p>As for what's next? A lot.</p>
<p>They're looking into a Contrast Mode for visually impaired players - nice. They've formally announced a Modding SDK will be coming shortly after the launch of Chapter 2, and they've just released the level editor <a href="https://github.com/fhomolka/UltimateSelacoBuilder" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">source code</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly the story update and Chapter 2 are still some ways off, but they said both are now progressing well, although they said how they've been "underestimating just how much work it takes to make this game".</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade works well on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellar Blade recently had a demo released and thankfully, it does seem to run well enough on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck. Great news for the upcoming release, which is soon! The game in full arrives June 11th.</p>
<p>With the demo, progress will carry over to the main game and once you finish the demo, you'll also unlock an additional mode. The developer also worked to remove the region block, so thankfully it's another PlayStation Publishing title that will be available in more locations.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux</strong></p>
<p>My testing with the demo was using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>, and there doesn't seem to be any problems. It looks great, seems to perform well on the defaults too. With the Very High graphics preset with AMD FSR 3 set to Quality it's been smoothly over 100FPS at 2560x1440 on Kubuntu Linux 25.04 with my Radeon RX 6800 XT.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15831390941748859137gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15831390941748859137gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19900044891748859139gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19900044891748859139gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15335175821748859140gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15335175821748859140gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16134124941748859140gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16134124941748859140gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For <strong>Steam Deck</strong> there's a dedicated graphics setting, which mostly sets everything down to low except for Character Object Detail they've put to Medium. The main problem with it are the visuals on Steam Deck, FSR3 gives quite a lot of distortion around characters during movement.</p>

<p>Performance though seems pretty reasonable. You're not going to get 60FPS even with the special Steam Deck setting, with lots of it hovering around the 40-50FPS mark on the Steam Deck LCD model. These shots below were on the Steam Deck default preset:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17583831211748860015gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17583831211748860015gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12755565291748860265gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12755565291748860265gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>What was surprising was turning <em>off</em> AMD FSR 3, the game on Steam Deck is <em>still</em> very much playable and you do get a vastly clearer picture during combat and heavy action. The performance obviously drops a fair bit, but still actually above 30FPS. I would much prefer the clear picture and locking it to 30FPS. Thankfully, the developer did not lock the graphical settings so no workaround or launch commands needed.</p>
<p>These shots below are with the Low graphics preset but with Character Object Detail bumped up to Medium with TAA. You can see the FSR distortion is gone, so the picture is much cleaner and enjoyable. Although, you will sacrifice some battery life for it. Either way, you'll only get about an hour.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16010316161748861414gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16010316161748861414gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3984833371748861415gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3984833371748861415gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Appears that developer SHIFT UP actually did a pretty good job on optimising the game across different hardware. But the default trying to push it to 60FPS on Steam Deck just feels silly. Drop it down and enjoy it more. I am genuinely very impressed by how it runs on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Looks like it has a decent set of accessibility options too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11607207151748859141gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11607207151748859141gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I went into this completely blind, intentionally staying away from videos on it and all the social media chatter around the original release, so I'm quite excited for it. The demo actually was pretty good too so I think I might be sold on it.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-4 brings updates for winewayland, AMD FSR4 and more game fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 10-4 for running Windows games on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck has released with numerous fixes and AMD FSR4.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about all the different Proton versions be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read my guide</a>. And my guide on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to install GE-Proton</a>. My usual advice is to stick with Valve's official Proton, unless there's something specific you need in GE-Proton as there's less support and testing with it.</p>
<p>The main changes in this release are listed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed broken cursor issue with DOOM Eternal, DOOM Dark Ages, and Rocket League in winewayland (Thanks OOOOOF123/Etaash)</li>
<li>Added a stub implementation for amdxc64.dll to enable FSR4. Use FSR4_UPGRADE=1 to upgrade FSR3.1 games to FSR4. Again thanks to Thanks OOOOOF123/Etaash. Instructions: <a href="https://github.com/Etaash-mathamsetty/wine-builds/releases/tag/fsr4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Etaash-mathamsetty/wine-builds/releases/tag/fsr4</a></li>
<li>import upstream proton changes</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix libcuda for star citizen</li>
<li>remove deprecated fixes for daedalic games</li>
<li>remove deprecated fix for Once human</li>
<li>add fix for The Chronicles of Myrtana: Archolos</li>
<li>add fix for Colin McRaie: DiRT</li>
<li>add quartz protonfix for Tree of Savior</li>
<li>remove deprecated fix for LOTRO</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see that AMD FSR4 support for Proton on Linux systems is coming along!</p>

      <title>Linux user share hits a multi-year high on Steam for May 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux user share on Steam has been slowly but steadily trending upwards, with May 2025 showing the highest point in years. At least since 2018, this is the highest it has ever been in a long time. When you take into account how Steam is always growing, it's showing that the amount of Linux users on Steam continues to grow nicely too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Overall user share for May 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 95.45% -0.65%</li>
<li>Linux 2.69% +0.42%</li>
<li>macOS 1.85% +0.23%</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15817071271748857369gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="GamingOnLinux.com Steam Tracker" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15817071271748857369gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>See more on our interactive <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker page</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Even with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3 now being a little more widely available</a>, the rise was not from SteamOS directly. Filtering to just the Linux numbers gives us these most popular distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 30.95% -2.83%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.09% +0.64%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 7.76% +1.56%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.42% +1.01%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.63% +0.01%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 64 bit 4.30% -0.14%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 2.54% +2.54%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.44% -0.02%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 2.43% -0.18%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.17% -0.06%</li>
<li>Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) 64 bit 1.99% -0.28%</li>
<li>Other 23.27% -2.27%</li>
</ul>
<p>One likely reason is how Simplified Chinese as a language option on Steam went down for May 2025, which does usually bring the Linux numbers up too. <em>Linux with Steam in that region just isn't particularly popular.</em></p>

      <title>CRSED: Cuisine Royale devs confirm end of Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CRSED: Cuisine Royale is a battle royale from Darkflow Software / Matter Team and Gaijin Network Ltd, and now it's unplayable on Linux / Steam Deck. <em>Previously the game was known as CRSED: F.O.A.D.</em></p>
<p>Earlier in May, they updated their anti-cheat to BattlEye, whereas previously it used Easy Anti-Cheat. Both of which <em>can</em> be enabled to work on Linux platforms including SteamOS / Steam Deck. It seems in this case with the swap and the removal of the Native Linux build, the developer has decided <em>not</em> to enable BattlEye.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility page</a> was updated when the change happened.</p>
<p>In a post on Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/884660/announcements/detail/546735912086668872" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear players!<br/>
<br/>
We’d like to inform you that CRSED: Cuisine Royale is no longer supported on the Linux operating system.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for any [inconvenience] and recommend switching to play on other available platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="CRSED: Cuisine Royale screenshot" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7892685421748611758gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified, so that will need to change soon.</em></p>
<p>Compared with the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends removing support</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online also shutting Linux out</a>, this is not quite the same kind of loss considering CRSED: Cuisine Royale barely hits 208 players online each day. Still, it does only further highlight the ongoing anti-cheat problem for Linux gaming. One issue I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steamos-moving-from-steam-deck-to-more-handhelds-gives-me-hope-for-better-anti-cheat-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">truly hope Valve can solve</a> now that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3 has seen a wider release</a>.</p>

      <title>ACTION GAME MAKER devs exploring Linux support for the editor and exports</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ACTION GAME MAKER, the upcoming game making toolkit from Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker series) are exploring Linux support now. The tool is currently scheduled to release on Steam on June 17th.</p>
<p>Much like their previous tools, the idea is you don't need to write out lines of code. They say it "provides access to professional level functions without any programming required", with their previous game making kits being very popular tools. Their previous tools include Pixel Game Maker MV, RPG Maker MV, RPG Maker MZ, RPG Maker VX, RPG Maker 2000 and so on.</p>
<p>In an update posted on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2987180/announcements/detail/535477547601756842" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Linux Editor Support</h4>
<p>Due to a large number of requests, we have been testing both running the ACTION GAME MAKER editor on Linux as well as testing the Linux export function. As the tests are not finished yet, we will update everyone as soon as our testing is finished.<br/>
<br/>
However, we have confirmed that Wine or Proton can be used to run the Windows build on Linux without issue. Regardless, use of the Windows build on Linux is outside of official support – so proceed with caution!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This time around, it shouldn't <em>hopefully</em> be too difficult for them, since they're using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> which is cross-platform and open source.</p>

      <title>Pixel-art RPG adventure Quartet releases August 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following a successful Kickstarter back in 2021, pixel-art RPG Quartet has a new trailer and release date set. The developers have confirmed a launch for Linux, macOS and Windows on August 26th.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of the classic JRPG style of retro games, this looks like one not to be missed. Great style to it and a fun list of features too.</p>
<p>About it: "A series of train robberies leads to evidence of a government conspiracy. A mysterious deck of cards gives a young girl a vision of another world. A fleet of deadly airships burns a path across the Imperial frontier. The world’s unlikeliest hero manifests tremendous magical power. These stories intertwine in the world of Quartet. Before it is all over, the eight heroes will uncover how a secret, centuries-old conflict literally reshaped the world. Then they will have their own decision to make about the destiny of magic.</p>
<p>Quartet begins with four separate stories, playable in any order. Those stories come together, giving the player a final party of eight characters. In combat, the player can deploy four of those characters at a time, with the ability to quickly swap in any of the four “reserve” characters. When a character swaps in, they immediately take their turn. While characters are in the reserves, they regenerate their AP at an enhanced rate. This allows clever players to hit the enemy with a never-ending stream of their best attacks, by swapping characters in at just the right moment."</p>
<p>There's also a full new trailer you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YLGgByWNfe0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1dec3e77d76dc443c84cfe8acdd7cdf0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YLGgByWNfe0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Combat is fast-paced, turn-based, and full to the brim with TONS of special abilities to use. Each character and enemy turn are shown in the turn queue on the right, allowing the player to plan devastating and timely tactical strikes.</li>
<li>Players can unleash multiple elemental and physical abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses.</li>
<li>AP automatically regenerates after a hero's turn. So don't be stingy—spam those spells!</li>
<li>In Quartet, you control 4 characters on the front line, with the other 4 ready to jump into the action at any time. Ready to bring out your heavy-hitter or an emergency healer? Swap in seamlessly from the reserve party! Swapped-in characters take their turn immediately, with no penalty.</li>
<li>While characters are in the reserves, they also regenerate their ability points (AP) more rapidly, making swapping a crucial element of combat.</li>
<li>From the steampunk-inspired streets of Leornin to the forests on the barbarian frontier; from the cursed marshes of Tyche to the underworld warehouses of Seren, Quartet offers lots to explore.</li>
<li>Exploration is absolutely worth your while. With eight party members to equip, you need lots of gear, and a lot of it comes out of a treasure chest.</li>
<li>We have a hippo as a playable character.</li>

      <title>Random chaotic puzzle-platformer Mosa Lina gets a big free expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mosa Lina is a crazy game, one that sometimes the levels don't exactly work right. It's all part of the fun in this random puzzle-platformer.</p>
<p>As the developer originally explained it: "This game is a response to the current trend of Immersive Sim design, where every ability is perfectly suited to solve a specific problem in the game. In order to counter this "Lock and Key" philosophy, Mosa Lina is aggressively random".</p>
<p>The Second Layer update brings 24 new tools, 189 new levels, 30 new boss level parts and 38 new music tracks. All in a free update to the game for all players. There's also 10 new languages supported too. You may want to grab it now while it's on sale until June 11th, when the price will go up. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HF4EJCYFUXE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8ab0edc26644ee50845aa3324d109f37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HF4EJCYFUXE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game also recently had a Nintendo Switch port, with the level-editor working cross-platform so players on all platforms can play everything made by the community. Nice.</p>
<p>While they're saying (again) the game is actually done now, they still seem to plan some updates like more modding support and bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Kabuto Park is a short cosy bug-catching and battle game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Like collecting creatures but don't have a lot of time? Kabuto Park is the one for you. With a short overall run time at only a few hours and a cosy vibe, it's the perfect weekend game. It's out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The developer said to "Expect 2 to 4 hours of serene bug catching, exciting little battles and summer vibes". Offering simple game mechanics with catching bugs, little bug battles with deck-building gameplay and a light upgrade / level system to boost your favourites.</p>
<p>It's a smaller bite-sized game so it doesn't offer exploration or a big adventure. Short and sweet. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="33WncF0JPx4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7539dedff57fd1c296172e7ceb6ba2e1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/33WncF0JPx4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Coming from the same team that made Minami Lane and Froggy's Battle. </p>
<p>So far it's being well received on Steam with a Very Positive overall user rating.</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 gets a rough level editor and Steam Workshop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2D BOY / Tomorrow Corporation have updated World of Goo 2 to include their developer level editor, along with Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>Don't expect perfection though, they've been clear this was never planned to be released. In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3385670/view/517462514506661937" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said: "We built the editor just for us, and did not originally plan to share it. It's unpolished, unsupported, and gloriously unbeautiful - but it built all the levels in World of Goo 2 - and now it's publicly available for brave players to build and share their own levels". They've updated the game to include it along with Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>They also included a custom level highlight video from a player on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwlBIWKrVP4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> to show off some of them.</p>

<p>The game has a Native Linux version and Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS gets improved Intel GPU support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical recently announced Ubuntu 24.04 LTS has been upgraded to improve support for modern Intel GPUs. <em>This version of Ubuntu is supported until 31st May, 2029.</em></p>
<p>Writing in <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/advanced-intel-battlemage-gpu-features-now-available-for-ubuntu-24-04/61812" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Ubuntu Discourse forum from Canonical developer Shane McKee, this is still only a Preview and so it does "not come with the same guarantees as the Ubuntu archives, is intended for testing and validation purposes only, and is not recommended for use in production environments".</p>
<p>A collaboration between Intel and Canonical to provide early preview of kernel and userspace support for new Intel GPUs with this introducing "comprehensive functionality enablement within userspace packages essential for AI, compute, and media stacks".</p>
<p>When testing it out you can find these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Performance optimizations, updates, and bugfixes.</li>
<li>Introduction of the new CCS optimization in compute-runtime.</li>
<li>Enable debugging support for discrete Intel Xe GPUs.</li>
<li>oneAPI Level Zero Ray Tracing improves AI/ML workload speeds via Embree on SYCL.</li>
<li>Improved GPU + CPU ray tracing rendering performance in applications with Intel Embree support, such as Blender (v4.2+). Ray tracing hardware acceleration on the GPU gives 2x to 4x speedup for the ray tracing component of rendering and 20% to 30% improvement on the entire frame rendering.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Escape Simulator drops the Linux build to focus on supporting Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pine Studio released a new update for their popular game Escape Simulator, dropping the Linux version to focus on Proton.</p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1435790/view/505077615531394446" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> originally their statement read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve decided to stop maintaining a native Linux build. With recent Steam Deck updates, we’ve encountered too many issues. The good news is the game runs great on Proton, and this allows us to focus on new content for everyone. Thanks to our Linux community for understanding ❤️</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they've since changed it to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve decided to stop maintaining a native Linux build. :( We supported the native Linux version for nearly 4 years, even though it’s always been under 0.5% of our players.<br/>
<br/>
Proton now runs the game more reliably than the native build with fewer crashes, better performance, and most Linux players already switched to it.<br/>
<br/>
As a small team, maintaining the native build across many distros was taking time away from developing new content (we just released our 50th room!). So we’ve decided to focus on supporting Proton, which continues to work well on Linux and Steam Deck.<br/>
<br/>
We understand this change is frustrating for some, and we truly appreciate everyone who supported us on Linux. &lt;3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's hard to argue against their reasoning. Proton runs Windows versions of games often incredibly well on Linux platforms, to the point you usually cannot tell the difference. It's only usually an actual problem if the game has some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">annoying anti-cheat that blocks Linux</a>.</p>
<p>As for the new update it includes a new noir-themed room called Detective's Office, new detective outfits, a soundtrack update and they confirmed another DLC is on the way.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 575.57.08 released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released the new stable driver 575.57.08, as part of their New Feature Branch for Linux systems. This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/nvidia-575-51-02-beta-driver-brings-nvidia-smooth-motion-support-to-linux-geforce-rtx-5060-series-announced/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">575.51.02 Beta driver released back in April</a>.</p>
<p>The full list of changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highlights since R575 Beta Release, 575.51.02</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlights from R575 Beta Release, 575.51.02</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended the __NV_DISABLE_EXPLICIT_SYNC environment variable, which was available to EGL applications, to also apply to GLX and Vulkan applications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Marvel Rivals to crash on startup or when loading levels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the applications that use the VK_KHR_present_wait extension to hang on Wayland.</li>
<li>Added support for GLX front buffer rendering on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Minecraft to crash on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME Render Offload from working correctly when using NVIDIA GPUs as both the render offload source and the render offload sink.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which prevented VRR from working when overriding an EDID through the /sys/kernel/debug/dri/*/edid_override interface.</li>
<li>Added support for the DRM plane properties COLOR_ENCODING and COLOR_RANGE.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Default TGP and Max TGP values from being reported in the nvidia-settings control panel while running notebook systems on battery power.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to display freezes on some systems when toggling Night Mode with GNOME on Wayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause graphics applications to not render correctly after a system suspend/resume cycle, if using the nvidia.ko kernel module parameter NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations=1.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
<li>Added support for NVIDIA Smooth Motion. See the "NVIDIA Smooth Motion" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Extended the nvidia-powerd daemon to also support Dynamic Boost while a notebook is running on battery power. See the "Dynamic Boost on Linux" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-modeset driver to trim trailing whitespace from the product name passed to the GPU's audio device as part of the EDID-Like Data (ELD).</li>
<li>Dropped support for NV_PLANE_BLEND_CTM, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_TF, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_LUT, NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_LUT_SIZE, and NV_PLANE_DEGAMMA_MULTIPLIER DRM plane properties on Linux kernels earlier than 6.8 to avoid exceeding DRM_OBJECT_MAX_PROPERTY.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could cause render-offloaded applications using KDE Frameworks 6 to crash.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve give Steam developer and publisher pages a little extra visibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have done a couple of small but useful tweaks to developer and publisher homepages, resulting in hopefully a little more visibility.</p>
<p>Don't know what I'm talking about? When you click a developer or publisher name on Steam, if developers have actually set them up, you'll go to their fancy page. They're actually pretty important for the reach of games, since anyone logged in on Steam can directly follow a page to get notifications about new game releases. Easy for players to keep track of their favourite developers and publishers.</p>
<p>Like this example below for Hooded Horse:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21138445341748536852gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Valve have tweaked the pages to enable developers to add various social media links, so they will show up at the top.</p>
<p>Additionally, these pages will also now show up every time you go through the checkout process on Steam, to show the pages for all the developers and publishers involved. Example below for 9 Kings (look to the bottom right):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6731095551748537046gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On top of that, Valve made even it easier for developers to link games to these homepages so nothing gets missed. As developers set up a new store page for a new game, they can link them up right there whereas before it was an entirely separate page.</p>

      <title>REMATCH is working well on Linux / Steam Deck in the Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REMATCH is an upcoming Football game from Sifu developer Sloclap, that feels very much like Rocket League but actual Football. <em>A Beta is live now on Steam which you can request access to via the Steam Playtest.</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, it appears that Easy Anti-Cheat is fully enabled for Proton so players on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck will be able to play. I've had no issues getting into games today to test it out. Which is great, because there's a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">number of popular games with anti-cheat</a> that block Linux platforms. REMATCH could easily be the next big multiplayer game, so this is awesome to see.</p>
<p>However, to keep expectations in check, this currently working status could change between the Beta and full release (we've seen that happen a few times). I did reach out to the developer and publisher and their PR team and no one has replied to me on it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EFMw23F-KbA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2448948162c80f1261086ef1efdb3431.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EFMw23F-KbA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) there's been no problems. It's incredibly smooth and looks great. A little challenging to learn though, quite a few different controls but genuinely seems like a lot of fun to play.</p>
<p>Playing it on Steam Deck with default (all Low) visuals, in a 3v3 match it seemed to keep a near solid 60FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11360347871748535293gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11360347871748535293gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Testing a 5v5 (the max player count) on Medium settings on Steam Deck, it was still surprisingly playable, although the performance was a fair bit lower at around 40-50FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1950780791748536171gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1950780791748536171gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully the anti-cheat will remain enabled once it's out fully on June 19th. Will keep you updated on any changes.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu gets monthly snapshot testing releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To aid testing and ensure future Ubuntu (and Kubuntu etc) releases are in good shape, Canonical have announced monthly snapshots.</p>
<p>Canonical's VP of Engineering, Jon Seager, wrote a post on the official Discourse Forum going through the details. Talking about how things have changed with more rolling-release distros, immutable distros and so on with the goal here to "build a release process that takes advantage of modern release engineering practices, while retaining the resilience and stability of our six-monthly releases".</p>
<p>To be clear, they're <strong>not</strong> replacing their current normal releases, this is more about getting more automated testing done. However, it also makes it easier for testers to get their hands on upcoming releases for regular testing too.</p>
<p>As Seager said "Starting in May 2025, we’re introducing monthly snapshot releases for Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Ubuntu is not “moving to monthly releases” or adopting a rolling release model; we’re committed to our six-monthly releases with a Long Term Support (LTS) release every two years. That doesn’t mean that our release process should be exempt from the same scrutiny that the rest of our engineering processes are subject to."</p>
<p>As part of this, they've also recently formed a new 'Canonical Ubuntu Release Management Team' to help develop the process for all this to work alongside the main Ubuntu Release Team. Part of it is to help the team get away from "deep institutional knowledge, and toward clean well-documented automated workflows that are transparent, repeatable and testable". With their current model "failure modes are not detected until they’re urgent and blocking an imminent release" so this gives more opportunities to avoid that.</p>

      <title>GeForce NOW app for Steam Deck has arrived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have today officially released their GeForce NOW native app for the Steam Deck, to give a better experience than using a browser with more features.</p>
<p>They said "The app is now available, and gamers can stream titles on the Steam Deck at up to 4K 60 frames per second — connected to a TV — with HDR10, NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Reflex technologies on supported titles. Plus, members can run these games at settings and performance levels that aren’t possible natively on the Steam Deck. To top it off, Steam Deck users can enjoy up to 50% longer battery life when streaming from an RTX gaming rig in the cloud."</p>
<p>This is for playing games you already own, or free to play games.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6tDvIATtQrI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bca08b4769b79722adcca54bcaa8bbf2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6tDvIATtQrI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To get it you need to be in Desktop Mode. Via the STEAM menu -&gt; Power -&gt; Switch to Desktop:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7266339311748529396gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7266339311748529396gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1994181761748529416gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1994181761748529416gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Then download it from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their website</a> in your browser. Installation <em>should</em> be easy, with the supplied installer they provide that walks you through it. You'll find it in your Downloads folder. Simply double-click it, hit Execute and then Continue and it will pop up with the installer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10390225431748531063gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10390225431748531063gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2522377151748531171gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2522377151748531171gol1.png"/></a></p>

<p>After which, you can simply go back to Gaming Mode and find it in the Non-Steam section of your Steam Library.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19595850781748531300gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19595850781748531300gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19424065511748531353gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19424065511748531353gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>NVIDIA gave early access to a whole bunch of other sites but did not send anything to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Even though it has been announced and "released", the download page at time of writing has not been updated to the new app. So looks like they either forgot, or it's going to be updated sometime today. <em><strong>Update 2:24 UTC</strong> - the download link has now been corrected to the new app.</em></p>
<p>This will be really great for playing games where the developer has not enabled <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the anti-cheat</a>.</p>

      <title>Another dev gone, EA cancels Black Panther and closes Cliffhanger Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The rough time for the gaming industry continues, with a report that EA have cancelled the Black Panther game along with closing Cliffhanger Games.</p>
<p>Only recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-and-codemasters-no-longer-making-wrc-world-rally-championship-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA's Codemasters also dropped the license</a> for the WRC games, with it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/fia-world-rally-championship-wrc-games-return-to-nacon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moving to NACON</a>. We also had the announcement recently where EA also cancelled <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-cancels-multiple-projects-from-apex-and-titanfall-developer-respawn-with-more-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple projects with layoffs at Apex developer Respawn</a>.</p>
<p>Another blow for a whole lot of developers, as per the report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a> who saw an email from EA Entertainment president Laura Miele. According to the email EA will focus mostly on a smaller set of franchises including Battlefield, The Sims, Skate, and Apex Legends. That and their upcoming Iron Man game, another Star Wars: Jedi game and Mass Effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11880471741748524401gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I do hope the developers who now have to find another job will find something soon.</p>
<p>EA didn't respond for comment.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN launches today and works on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN arrives today by FromSoftware and thankfully it will work on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck even with the anti-cheat.</p>
<p>The game uses Easy Anti-Cheat and additionally also has GuardIT DRM and seems neither are causing any problems. It's now noted on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a> so keep an eye on it for any changes. Our friends at <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/game-reviews/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> did an overview of it directly on Steam Deck. Really great to see such a big release working on Linux platforms.</p>
<p>Additionally, the developer has put up new trailers. One of which brings us back to the days of AMV's being super popular, with Evanescence:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ot6j_qqYQaM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0561beda19c77e988674c36fd51af1ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ot6j_qqYQaM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Are you going to be buying it? I don't play enough co-op games to make this one actually worth my time, so it's one I'm personally going to be skipping over. Also, I was never particularly fussed about ELDEN RING myself. Great design, but the punishing side of it just wasn't for me.</p>

      <title>Watchword gives the Balatro treatment to an anagram word game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Watchword is an anagram roguelike, pulling in some clear energy from Balatro as you play with words using rule-breaking synergies and combos. The game will have Native Linux and Steam Deck support, with a demo now available to try made with Godot.</p>
<p>I love how it's another game that takes a known genre of classics and twists it into something entirely new. The developer said how "A good vocabulary will certainly help, but it will mostly take careful planning and strategy to beat each trial" as you make crazy new words and try to fill up that score.</p>
<p>The demo worked perfectly for me on Kubuntu Linux (25.04). Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TaBdBq5k_PQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8467a6df66ff83e4e1159d2683e14fbb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TaBdBq5k_PQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full game features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>120+ Unique book relics</strong>: No two powers are the same. Add infinite repeat letters to words with "The Good Book" or focus on using new words with "Thesaurus". Each book has a unique strength that combos well with other books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hundreds of piece variations:</strong> Every letter in the alphabet + custom bigrams (Two-letter tiles like QU, CH, or EE). You can even find mysterious Symbol tiles like "!", "?" or "&amp;" that have strange abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>100,000+ Possible Watchwords:</strong> Try to spell a special word to expand the size of your board to make room for more powerful words in future trials.</p>

      <title>Retro dungeon crawler Brany Skeldalu gets a Linux version and source code re-release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gates of Skeldal (Czech: Brány Skeldalu) originally released in 1998 and recently it gained a Native Linux version along with a source code re-release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8965636621748429143gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The original MS-DOS game was ported to Windows back in 2005, then made freeware in 2007 with a source code release back in 2008. As of May 20th this year, they did a re-release of the source code as the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3533830/view/507328875549689075" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gates of Skeldal source code has now been released under the MIT license.<br>
<br/>
This isn't entirely new, as the source code was publicly available even before its Steam release, but we hope this formal release will help increase its reach.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/ondra-novak/gates_of_skeldal" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ondra-novak/gates_of_skeldal</a><br/>
<br/>
Now you can modify the game, improve it, help with bug fixes and testing, compile it on all sorts of weird hardware, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
Please note that only the source code is released under the MIT license, not the graphics, game design, sound, or other assets, and definitely not the brand!</br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days later, a Linux version was then released on Steam too. Nice little win for game preservation.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore the Mysterious Island of Rovenland</strong></p>
<p>This mythical island is home to the ruins of ancient civilizations, treacherous dungeons, and forgotten temples brimming with magic.

<p><strong>Assemble Your Party and Engage in Tactical Turn-Based Combat</strong></p>

      <title>SteamOS massively beats Windows on the Legion Go S</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to YouTuber Dave2D who managed to get their hands on the Lenovo Legion Go S, the SteamOS version destroys Windows in performance and battery life. That's a nice win for Valve's Linux platform, and only continues to show how drastically Linux has improved thanks to all the work on GPU drivers and the Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release of SteamOS 3.7</a>, this has only just begun. We're about to see a lot more of this.</p>
<p>Have a look at the performance difference and this is just on the Z2 Go chip as well:</p>

<p>When it comes to battery life, SteamOS was yet again a <em>very</em> clear winner in this with even demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 having 1 hour 31 minutes on Windows and 1 hour 54 minutes on SteamOS. In less demanding titles like Dead Cells the difference is absolutely insane jumping from 2 hours 47 minutes on Windows to 6 hours 12 minutes on SteamOS. Again for Hades at only 1 hour 58 minutes on Windows and 4 hours 17 minutes on SteamOS.</p>
<p>Dave2D also talks again about just how good the sleep system is on SteamOS, with you being able to just tap the power button on the Legion Go S and tap it again to pick up right where you left off which just doesn't really work on Windows. Seems like it's just win after win for SteamOS compared to Windows for handheld gaming (apart from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">games with anti-cheat</a>).</p>
<p>See their full video on it below, Dave2D does some really nice work:</p>

<p>I did ask Lenovo if we would be able to get a review unit but the emails didn't really go anywhere, so it seems most likely we will not be getting one.</p>

      <title>Steam Workshop support comes to Civilization VII in June with a new update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis are still working to improve Civilization VII, with a big update coming in June and a smaller update out now. Recently, the game unfortunately hit Mostly Negative on all the recent reviews, so they've got their work cut out for them.</p>
<p>For the June update, it's going to be a big one and includes lots of features that really should make more players happy with it. Some of what they've revealed includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Large &amp; Huge Map Support.</li>
<li>Steam Workshop Support.</li>
<li>Improved Game Setup Options.</li>
<li>New Religious Beliefs and Balance.</li>
<li>New City State Bonuses and Balance.</li>
<li>New Town Specializations and Balance.</li>
<li>Specialist Balance.</li>
<li>Treasure Fleet Improvements.</li>
<li>UI &amp; Quality-of-Life Improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17374843851748427612gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>With the v1.2.1 update that's <em>out now</em> there's a Linux and macOS fix noted "Adjusted rendering resolution when launching in fullscreen mode" and for Steam Deck they "Addressed reported UI issues during multiplayer games". On top of some new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pangaea Plus Map Type</strong></p>
<p>Added a new map type: Pangaea Plus. This map type features a single large central landmass that all civs start on. Surrounding islands are Distant Lands to all players and are home to Treasure Resources in the Exploration Age.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Multiplayer Player Limit</strong></p>
<p>Increased the maximum number of human players on all maps in Antiquity and Exploration. The max number of players in these ages now matches the number in Modern. Max human player numbers in Antiquity and Exploration are now (Tiny: 4; Small: 6; Standard: 8).* Note that the Standard map size is not available on Nintendo Switch, but the expanded player counts for Tiny and Small map sizes do apply.</p>
<p>Dev note: Players who would not fit on the Homelands are instead spawned in the Distant Lands and can make progress to the Legacy Paths in Antiquity and Exploration. Their progress is now tracked in the Legacy Path screen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot of balance changes too, AI improvements, controller input adjustments, narrative fixes and so on you can see in the full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/498322216088241231" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>Putting Team Fortress 2 inside Half-Life 2, Lambda Fortress is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The big cross-over mod Lambda Fortress that puts the Team Fortress 2 mercenaries into Half-Life 2 and other Source campaigns is coming to Steam. More goodies thanks to Valve releasing TF2 code into the Source SDK.</p>
<p>I'll admit I must live under a rock when it comes to certain bigger Valve game mods, because I've never heard of it until now and it sounds hilarious. From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lambda Fortress is a mod for Team Fortress 2 that brings the mercenaries to the gritty world of Half-Life 2 and other Source Engine Campaigns! Play solo or cooperatively across iconic worlds with a unique twist.</p>
<p>Fight your way through City 17, have a lunch break on the coast, or race to White Forest all with your friends!</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>

<li>Additional weapons, game modes and campaign support over future updates!</li>

<p>Quite a surprise. 1047 Games recently launched the free to play Splitgate 2 in Beta on Steam, initially with their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/splitgate-2-gets-a-beta-on-steam-works-on-steam-deck-but-not-other-linux-systems-for-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat RedKard blocking Desktop Linux</a> but allowing the Steam Deck with SteamOS. Now they've tweaked it to allow Desktop Linux players in.</p>
<p>They've been dealing with some big server issues since the May 22nd launch, which seems to be getting smoother now.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2918300/discussions/0/599653731153219060/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam titled "The State of Splitgate 2" they noted these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Purchases have been restored &amp; the system is working<br/>
- If you're still missing items contact Support (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.splitgate.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">http://support.splitgate.com</a>)<br/>
- XP is now active (we've also turned on Double XP)<br/>
- Sometimes XP is delayed but it is still going through<br/>
- The Beta now supports players on Linux thru Proton<br/>
- We're working on a Free Survivor Pack for all Beta Players (more info to share in the coming days)<br/>
- Challenges are our next priority, when they're back up, we'll be increasing the tickets earned so people can still complete the Battle Pass in time<br/>
We're still working hard, &amp; we won't stop until we make things right. Thanks for your feedback, patience &amp; continued support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing out the Beta on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with the latest Proton 9.0-4, there was no mouse movement in matches but a controller did work. However, mouse movement did work in the menus, so that's an odd one.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have launched the Zombies vs Vampires Fest on Steam running until June 2nd 5pm UTC. There's a number of nice games discounts, so here's some suggestions to go for that will work on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck. There's also numerous demos featured during the event too and a couple of new items in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Points Shop</a>.</p>

      <title>Play as a virus inside Winnie the Pooh in Winnie&#39;s Hole - demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Pooh now in the public domain, of course we're going to get some weird Winnie the Pooh games. Winnie's Hole sounds a bit…you know, but it's actually a clever sounding game from Twice Different who made Ring of Pain.</p>
<p>Here you're fighting Winnie from within, as a virus attacking the body and mind. Poor old Pooh. You use various blocks to spread a virus in randomly generated inner worlds. The developers say it's a "union of fast-paced, turn-based gameplay which looks beyond common roguelite conventions to create a challenging new format". Additionally they say it's a "Holesome dark comedy inspired by old-school Nickelodeon cartoons" that is actually a "charming, original story with characters inspired by A.A. Milne’s classic Winnie the Pooh reimagined in a world of dark science, and styled like a Brothers’ Grimm fairytale made by Nickelodeon with an unhealthy serving of Cronenberg body horror".</p>
<p>Alrite, you've sold me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qDpm_CMpy6A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46a939143ab029aa6c62f3ed914831d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qDpm_CMpy6A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Evolve with each run - Unlock new Perks, Mutations and Virus Strains.</li>
<li>Mutate your host as a symbiotic virus.</li>
<li>Bodybuilding in the worst way.</li>
<li>A storybook narrative which reimagines Winnie in a world of dark science.</li>
<li>A fresh take on exploration, replacing the typical roguelite node map with strategic, turn-based building using a set of tetromino-like virus blocks which you can evolve and reshape.</li>
<li>Dynamic battle system where each turn is an action combo for fast-paced gameplay.</li>
<li>Holesome horror comedy with gritty art inspired by old school Nickelodeon and Brothers' Grimm fairytales.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've tested the demo working great on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. It's thoroughly weird but actually quite funny, as well as being ever so slightly horrifying on what they've done. Interesting game mechanics though</p>

      <title>FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) games return to NACON</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the news recently that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-and-codemasters-no-longer-making-wrc-world-rally-championship-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA Codemasters were pausing development</a> plans on future rally titles, we now know who will continue the series with it being back with NACON.</p>
<p>NACON are no stranger to the series, with them now owning KT Racing (Kylotonn) since 2018 who developed multiple entries in the series from WRC 5 to WRC 10 and WRC Generations. Their new license gives them control from 2027 through 2032 and they will now begin developing an all-new WRC game series that will have official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors and will be a "complete reboot of the franchise".</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to renew our collaboration with WRC Promoter. This iconic license provides an exceptional playground to build a highly refined driving experience that lives up to the expectations of rally fans,” said Alain Falc, CEO of NACON. “Between 2015 and 2023, we had the opportunity to work closely with the championship’s official teams and many drivers, allowing us to gain solid and unique expertise in translating rallying into a video game experience. This new venture marks a major milestone: a fully reimagined project driven by a passionate and specialized team, with a clear ambition to elevate rally games to new heights.”</p>
<p>“After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with NACON,” expressed FIA World Rally Championship’s Chief Marketing Officer Arne Dirks. “Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned.  We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today.”</p>

      <title>Indie puzzle game Cogs from 2009 gets a remaster</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cogs from Lazy 8 Studios originally released back in 2009, and gained a Native Linux version back with the Humble Indie Bundle 3 in 2011. Now, 16 years or so later, the developer has give it a small remaster. <em>This is all starting to make me feel really old now. The third Humble Indie Bundle was really 14 years ago?</em></p>
<p>In a news post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/26500/view/542231772987917376" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> titled "Cogs Remastered!" the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently took some time to port Cogs over to an entirely different code base -- from a custom C++ engine I wrote 16 years ago to C# on Unity. Thanks to a few folks on the forums who have helped me hunt down some launch-day bugs and encouraged me to support the legacy Cloud Save data.<br/>
<br/>
This version should be better in just about every way -- snappier, higher-resolution, and more aligned with modern APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the original trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lZzWVkJ5fZk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/547597974677418ed3287bdc6c65f225.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lZzWVkJ5fZk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A little about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cogs is a puzzle game where players build machines from sliding tiles. Players can choose from 50 levels and 3 gameplay modes. New puzzles are unlocked by building contraptions quickly and efficiently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventor Mode:</strong> Starting with simple puzzles, players are introduced to the widgets that are used to build machines  gears, pipes, balloons, chimes, hammers, wheels, props, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Time Challenge Mode:</strong> If you finish a puzzle in Inventor Mode, it will be unlocked here. This time, it will take fewer moves to reach a solution, but you only have 30 seconds to find it.</li>
<li><strong>Move Challenge Mode:</strong> Take your time and plan ahead. Every click counts when you only get ten moves to find a solution.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamOS Manager for BIOS updates, TDP and GPU clock controls now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On Valve's official public GitLab, they've recently put up SteamOS Manager under the open source MIT license following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.7 release</a> for more devices.</p>
<p>What is it? SteamOS Manager is a "system daemon that aims to abstract Steam's interactions with the operating system". Valve's goal with it is to "have a standardized interface so that SteamOS specific features in the Steam client, e.g. TDP management, can be exposed in any linux distro that provides an implementation of this DBus API".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the features it enables includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPU clock management.</li>
<li>TDP management.</li>
<li>BIOS/Dock updates.</li>
<li>Storage device maintenance tasks.</li>
<li>External storage device formatting.</li>
<li>Max battery charge level.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And more.</em></p>
<p>Seems like this will be useful for other hardware vendors to hook up and test SteamOS integration. And probably other Linux distributions aimed at handhelds too (Bazzite, ChimeraOS and so on).</p>
<p>Here's the fun thing: in their full specification, it includes a feature named "EnterDownloadMode" which the code comments notes, "Enter a low power mode for downloads and get a handle that will keep this mode active until all obtained handles are dropped".</p>
<p>It's not clear if this is something used by SteamOS already, or if it's the feature that has been requested by Steam Deck owners again and again and again to download while the screen is off (sounds like it could be related). I've emailed Valve to see if they want to comment on that.</p>

      <title>Into the Restless Ruins gets you to deck-build a dungeon and then explore it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Into the Restless Ruins is a rather different dungeon crawler, one where you build the dungeon over time with a deck of cards you continue to gather and upgrade.<em> Disclosure: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Inspired by Scottish folklore, what you get is a thoroughly interesting experience when it comes to the exploration, since you start off with nothing but a single blank exit room and a few dungeon room cards. You place down these cards to build the dungeon to explore, with many of them having different functions to help you (like healing, increasing your damage etc). As you explore your torchlight gradually fades, making it more difficult to explore since there's no mini-map so you have to learn your own layout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13080620971748276814gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13080620971748276814gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That torch I mentioned? You need to get out of the dungeon and back to the initial exit room before it completely goes out or you're a bit screwed as the darkness will rapidly drain your health. So it's also in part an extraction game, with you running around your creation to collect and explore, before getting back to the exit, to then build even more.</p>
<p>The idea here is that you start off with a limited space to build, as you're trying to connect up your rooms to various special areas with a Seal inside that allow you to unlock more of the map to continue build up towards the end of the level. As you progress you unlock more and more cards and eventually you can upgrade your cards as well. Some upgrades give cards more doors to make connecting them all up easier, other upgrades will increase the buff you get from certain special rooms. Like a Campfire room, that adds more time to your torch to explore further.</p>
<p>When you extract from a run each time, you gradually build up a corruption meter, which ends up giving you curse cards which can make things a little bit more challenging. So you do want to explore as far as you can, as quickly as you can in as little runs as possible. If you meter gets full, it's also game over.</p>
<p>It's also an auto-battler. As you run around your dungeon various enemies will spawn and come floating towards you, with your character auto-attacking them all. As you take down enemies, you collect XP in a Vampire Survivor-style progression system which gives you an additional card on level-up.</p>
<p>The combat in it is where the game falls pretty <em>flat</em>, because it's really quite lifeless and <em>uninteresting</em> which is a shame. All that matters for the combat is your positioning, since you swipe most enemies away automatically with a single auto-swing of your weapon. Once you get another weapon, it makes it even easier, there's just pretty much no challenge at all to the combat. If they had expanded this even just a little bit, the game would have been vastly better. As it is, the combat is so simple it's <em>boring</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YGWr9wCshho"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/05a534a576ae7e72fd3edb035f40034e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YGWr9wCshho" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's another problem big with it though. As much as I truly like the dungeon creation, you can <em>break</em> the game entirely with it and have to restart. There's no way to remove a room you've placed, so if you accidentally block access to one of the special Seal rooms and carry on building and exploring, you'll have to just restart since that is the only way to expand the map and keep going. The developer said you just need to avoid that, but to me that's simply <em>not good enough.</em> If the game allows you to get completely progression blocked - that's simply bad design and feels like it wasted my time when that happened.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> the dungeon creation side of it. The way you build up a deck and then craft the dungeon to explore, along with the torchlight mechanic make it quite a challenge and it is a genuinely great set of game mechanics. Aside from the progression blocking issue (that they really should sort). It's also let down by lifeless combat. So overall I don't really recommend it. Some nice ideas and I get their vision for it but not good enough on the implementation of them.</p>
<p>Into the Restless Ruins perfectly on Desktop Linux / SteamOS with Proton. Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>3rd person narrative horror MEGANAUT from the dev of Lorn&#39;s Lure gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of the exploration climbing game Lorn's Lure is working on a new game named MEGANAUT, a 3rd person narrative horror and now there's a demo available with Linux support.</p>
<p>It's set in the same universe as Lorn's Lure and while the setting is quite different being a horror game, it also brings its own unique floating movement mechanic. From the press details I was sent they said it's "Inspired by Dead Space's zero gravity sections and Abzu's swimming mechanics; it allows for the slower paced tension of horror, combined with the 3D traversal that the megastructure affords".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EzM92ffKk7o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/698ec543431f49cf658d05028c03c432.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EzM92ffKk7o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About the full game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your friend Seija, went too far beyond the habitat walls and is now missing in the deep structure.</p>
<p>As a Scavenger, you have some expertise beyond the walls.</p>
<p>You volunteer to search for him.</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Float through a mysterious megastructure with <strong>6 degrees of freedom.</strong></li>
<li>Thick with oppressive and <strong>creepy atmosphere.</strong></li>
<li>Simple environmental <strong>puzzles that don't take you out of the atmosphere.</strong></li>
<li>Some <strong>jump scares.</strong></li>
<li>Discover <strong>deep lore</strong> beyond the main story arc.</li>
<li>Concise experience, roughly<strong> 2-3 hours of play time.</strong></li>
</ul>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls: Arena remake gets Jolt Physics and big new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenTESArena is an in-development open source game engine remake of The Elder Scrolls: Arena, with a big new release out now as the developer continues working towards making it actually playable.</p>
<p>Being fully playable is still a while away though, going by their current progress a lot of the main gameplay mechanics simply haven't been put in yet. Another fun project for preserving another classic though.</p>
<p>Speaking about the release the developer said: "This release brings greatly-improved player movement thanks to the addition of <a href="https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Jolt Physics</a>. The player can now climb out of chasms, jump, and swim. Other baseline gameplay features such as hit registering, killable enemies (w/o AI), item pickup, and using keys on doors allow the starting dungeon to now be considered minimum-playable. Rendering performance is still below average and more optimizations are planned."</p>
<p>Check out their release overview video below:</p>

      <title>After their publisher was banned from Steam, Bioprototype returns and it&#39;s free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometime in 2024 a publisher called BD Games was banned from Steam, taking with it numerous smaller games. Bioprototype from Emprom Game recently returned to Steam without a publisher, and it's free to claim and keep for a while.</p>
<p>In a post on Steam the developer explained a bit more about situation, apologizing for their own poor handling of it, and so to make up for it the game is free to claim and keep until July 20th while they work on the sequel Bioweaver.</p>
<p>What is it? A Vampire Survivor-like auto-shooter with a unique evolution system where you add and change your organs to keep on getting stronger. You end up chaining together various different types of abilities, that all work together to build up some seriously crazy attack-patterns. It's definitely an interesting take on the survivor-like genre and worth a go. The amount of customization you get from it is quite impressive.</p>

      <title>Brickadia is like Roblox and LEGO combined and it arrives July 11</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Brickadia has been an interesting project to follow, that combines some elements of Roblox with powerful creation systems along with an LEGO styled building system to create all sorts of things. They just announced that it's going to enter Early Access on July 11th.</p>
<p>More about: "Brickadia is a next-generation sandbox game with immense flexibility. Every creative tool - building, scripting, and more - is used right in the game, in real-time multiplayer. Build massive worlds, intricate physics contraptions, and entirely new game modes together with your friends without ever leaving the action."</p>
<p>Check out their new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RPAnrTAAjMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc961351e06b1347155f7fa84c95d532.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RPAnrTAAjMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In regards to Linux support, they decided to <em>drop</em> the Native Linux version and instead rely on Valve's Proton compatibility layer. I spoke with their team over email who mentioned to me they removed the Linux version "not because we don’t want to support Linux, but because running the Windows version through Proton performs vastly better". They continued "We didn’t want people to use the native version, expecting it to be better, only to get a much worse experience just because Epic hasn’t bothered to optimize their Vulkan renderer". So it's again a problem of the game engine, Unreal Engine, just not having great Linux support.</p>
<p>As for any <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> annoyances, they told me "The game runs great on a Steam Deck and we’re planning to support it on Early Access launch. There won’t be anti-cheat, it’s not a competitive game" and that they're not going to do anything to break Proton support intentionally.</p>

      <title>An Amazing Wizard is a Dead Cells-like where you mix spells out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out now in Early Access with Linux support, An Amazing Wizard brings an interesting spell mixing system to a Dead Cells-like action platformer. <em>Disclosure: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>The initial release seems really promising after playing through a fair bit of it, and I really do enjoy mixing together all sorts of spells to make something completely ridiculous. The game is frantic and fast but very clearly takes a lot of the world design from Dead Cells.</p>
<p>You run through each generated area of platforms stitched together as you try to get through all the different doors, while smashing through all the enemies in your way to find new spells and combine them. Then face off against huge boss monsters and just keep upgrading as much as you possibly can. If you die, you return to a special area to do other meta upgrades and challenges, to run do a fresh run of combining spells and fighting monsters again.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mqzMXPyUvIE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4cc14a0c8899ce3c5b12f97836db89b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mqzMXPyUvIE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I do like what I'm seeing, but there's just a little something about the combat that makes it feel nowhere near as satisfying as the likes of Dead Cells, but I can't put my finger on exactly what. The combat isn't bad, just not terribly exciting either. It's less about the combat, and more about just blasting your way through to become as stupidly powerful as possible, so in that way it's more akin to the survivor-like games that have appeared wearing the skin of Dead Cells.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD - Explore a unique world every time you play.</li>
<li>ACTION ROGUEVANIA - This means permanent deaths where you lose everything you have found, but there are lots of permanent upgrades available.</li>

<li>7 PLAYABLE ELEMENT WIZARD – Wheel the power of seven unique elements, each offering distinct abilities and combinations to match your playstyle.</li>
<li>ENCHANT YOUR SPELLS - Search for Astral Forges to add enchantments to all your Spells and Magic Weapons to add some special effects to them!</li>
<li>200+ UNIQUE ARTIFACTS - Every artifact has it's own special use. A lot of them change your Basic Spell behavior or add special abilities. Literally countless combinations.</li>
<li>120+ POWERFUL SPELLS - Cast Fire Balls or Tornados, Summon Creatures, Slow Time, Create Gravity Zones and many, many more...</li>
<li>DOZENS OF MAGIC WEAPONS - Use one of many Magic Weapons to help you survive!</li>
<li>50+ CHALLENGES - Test your skills by completing the trials of the Goddess of Death!</li>

</ul>

<p>I should note that the developer has been using generative AI. The Steam page notes "A portion of the Steam community assets and marketing materials are generated using AI". Speaking to the developer, they told me previously they also used an AI voice in the game but they have since removed it and so "Nothing in the game is AI" now.</p>

      <title>CoreCtrl app has entered maintenance mode with no new features coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CoreCtrl is a popular Linux app designed to let you get more control over your GPU and CPU. Sadly, the creator has put it into maintenance mode with no new features coming.</p>
<p>Recently the official readme on <a href="https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitLab</a> was updated to note "CoreCtrl is in maintenance mode. This means no new features or hardware support will be added, and development will focus solely on bug fixes and maintenance-related changes".</p>
<p>So it will continue working with all the features it has but may not work with any upcoming hardware. A shame, as it has some great features but since it's open source anyone could decide to fork it and continue it on like we've seen with various other projects in the past.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental update enables gamepad input for all game launchers on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a brand new and exciting update to Proton Experimental for Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck gamers. This brings some new fixes, as well as an interesting change for their Xalia integration.</p>
<p>Xalia, if you've not heard of it, is an open source tool that brings a gamepad UI for traditional desktop applications. Especially useful for Valve's Proton, since it can make working with launchers on Steam Deck, SteamOS and any Linux system playing games via Steam Big Picture Mode a lot simpler since you won't need to change any inputs. It's not just launchers though, some games have prerequisite installation steps which Xalia enables you to click through with a gamepad too.</p>
<p>For quite a few releases Valve have been tweaking how they use Xalia, gradually adding more supported games and updating Xalia itself from the upstream project. However, the Proton Experimental update for May 23rd simply enables it by default now. So it's not set on specific games, as Valve feel it's at a point where it will "work with most launchers using builtin Win32 controls".</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wider release of SteamOS 3.7</a> for more devices, this seems like a great step for Windows game compatibility.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">All the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enabled NVAPI for The Last Of Us 2.</li>
<li>Fixed games not starting when upgrading from a removed Proton installation.</li>
<li>Enabled <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/xalia/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Xalia</a> by default instead of only for selected titles. It should work with most launchers using builtin Win32 controls.</li>
<li>Improved situation with Once Human having bad stutter on certain setups.</li>
<li>Fixed Black Desert launcher rendering all black on Nvidia + Wayland setups.</li>
<li>Fixed Dead Island 2 not detecting Epic Online Services and not allowing cross-play.</li>
<li>Fixed Cornerpond not rendering transparency correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed Monster Jam Showdown not being able to link Epic Games account.</li>
<li>Fixed The First Berserker: Khazan displaying driver version warning with Intel and Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed DLSS frame generation options being disabled in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Valve</a></em></p>
<p><strong>How to get it?</strong></p>
<p>It will show up as an update in your Steam Downloads, if you already have it installed. If you don't, just search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library to install it. It will also download automatically if you go to run a game that Valve have set to use it.</p>

      <title>StarVaders is deck-building meets grid-based tactics and it&#39;s basically perfect</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>StarVaders from developer Pengonauts is a colourful and action-packed mix of a deck-builder with fast grid-based tactical combat and it's a thoroughly great time. I've never seen another game so smoothly blend these two together. <em>Disclosure: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Here you pilot a mech to fight off swarms of alien invaders across a rogue-lite campaign, and the tight design of it shines right on through. It's a game that doesn't take you particularly long to blast through either at about an hour a run, which is part of what makes it so great. That, and just the overall fab design of it with multiple characters and lots of ways to build up your decks. Even the tutorial was good in this, with it getting you right into the action!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hd_wWZvVCNI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/08e56a3e2daef0f5c1ef69fdde429030.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hd_wWZvVCNI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The combat, while challenging, is not overly punishing. However, it definitely is a tough one to get through even on the initial difficulty level with the first character. But, there's tons of features and little touches that make it worth pushing through. Getting hit by enemies for example won't end up destroying you, not directly anyway, as you just build up useless junk cards in your pile.</p>
<p>Your main things to worry about are how many turns you've used, since most battles have a turn limit and how far down the grid the enemies are getting, which is the main point of the combat. These aliens are trying to get closer and closer, moving a step each turn and It's your job to use up all your cards and move around the grid to prevent that. If the invaders manage to get to the bottom 3 rows you'll start to build up Doom, if you build up too much Doom it's all over. Doom carries over between missions too, which is where a lot of the challenge comes in. If you hit the turn limit, enemies will build up Doom no matter where they are — so you need to take them out fast.</p>
<p>With lots of different enemies that have different abilities, strengths and weaknesses along with the boss battles that are their own little mini-game due to the boss creatures having their own special mechanics it sure does keep you on your toes.</p>
<p>Enemies have a big mixture of behaviours between shooting at you, spawning more enemies or obstacles, shields you need to take down first (with some becoming invulnerable the turn the shield goes down), firing rockets across a whole area making them hard to avoid and so on. There's lots to think about but it's never overloading on your brain.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14724096921748009369gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14724096921748009369gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10939017671748009371gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10939017671748009371gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I especially love how clear and accessible the game is to get to grips with thanks to the neat design. The battles are all across a small grid, and you can hover over anything to get a readout on what it is (including enemies and their abilities). On top of that, you get the chance at a do-over too. Did you mess up spectacularly? Well, you can spend your limited Chrono Tokens to wind back time to the start of your turn and see if you can do better. You can also earn back more of these tokens during combat by destroying certain types of enemies too and they get refreshed when you finish an Act.</p>
<p>You start off with one character and one mech (the Gunner) to choose from. Even just by itself, that would have been a great game due to the <em>heat</em> mechanics of the first mech. Heat is its card cost system, or mana that you might see in other deck-builders. Each card has a heat cost, and you have a maximum amount of heat you can build up per turn (it resets each turn). However, you can also go over your max heat to <em>overheat</em> and still use another card but you'll burn up that card and be unable to use it for the rest of the battle. A nice change compared to other similar deck-builders that allows a little wiggle room but with that big drawback. Remember those junk cards mentioned earlier? You can satisfyingly burn them up to get rid of them too.</p>
<p>However, once you manage to complete a full run the game will expand and open up to give you more characters with their own set of initial cards and uniqueness, and two other mechs that <strong>completely</strong> <em>change</em> the way you play the game which was a <em>huge</em> surprise. So to be clear: you pick a character with their own set of initial cards, and then pick a mech which comes with their own game mechanics for the battles. These layers add tons of replay value to the game to keep you going for hours.</p>
<p>The other two mechs you unlock replace the heat system from the Gunner with an energy system for the Stinger and a Mana system for the Keeper. The Keeper is the most different to the other two, as you're not inside a mech, instead you summon entities and haunt them moving them around the board. It's like three versions of the game in one.</p>
<p>However, one issue I have with it is how <em>long</em> it takes to unlock the two other mechs, which can be quite a while depending on how good you are at the game. However, leaning back into how accessible it is, there's options to skip the progression systems entirely to just play it your way with everything.</p>
<p>Like any good deck-builder, after each successful battle you'll be rewarded and here you can build up your deck to give you new tactical options during battles. There's some really fun cards here with lots of different combinations that become possible, which is why playing through it multiple times stays fun. Much in the same way that Slay the Spire had a firm grip on me, this very much did too.</p>
<p>As for the campaign, it's also nice and simple on the layout. You battle across the world, picking between nodes on the map that have different encounters in terms of enemy types and rewards. Initially you don't know exactly what will be inside until you've played through them to discover the enemies, and then picking between them gets a little easier.</p>

<p>Tested on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu Linux 25.04) with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> it was flawless. Valve gave it a Steam Deck Playable rating noting it has small text and sometimes doesn't show the right icons. I've played a bunch on Steam Deck too and while some text is a bit on the small side, it's mostly fine. I didn't notice any gamepad or icon issues. It's a great fit for the deck with gamepad controls and I really enjoyed playing it on the go too.</p>
<p>Overall it's an absolutely wonderful game that's a seriously easy recommendation. The style of it is just wonderful. Even though it's turn-based with cards, it somehow almost feels like an arcade game, at least a little. With the crunchy sound design too it's all just fantastic. Really unique and inventive and absolutely crammed with content even though runs are short, I'm absolutely hooked on it. Go and grab it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Craft the ultimate deck from the 400+ unique cards and artifacts available.</li>
<li>Choose from 3 powerful mechs, each with completely distinct playstyles and mechanics.</li>
<li>Master 10 diverse pilots, each adding new cards, mechanics, and a personal backstory.</li>
<li>Use Chrono Tokens to rewind time, undo mistakes, or land that perfect combo.</li>
<li>Battle through the multi-part story campaign and uncover a secret finale.</li>
<li>Endless replayability with ascending difficulties, daily runs, and challenge modes.</li>
<li>Designed for clarity and intuition—no long tutorials, no wiki required, just pure tactical deckbuilding.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 gets NVIDIA DLSS 4 improvements and a Steam Deck / SteamOS fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 from Insomniac Games, Nixxes Software and PlayStation Publishing LLC has Patch 10 out now with some NVIDIA upgrades along with a fix for some Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, if you initially tried loading it while offline, it would result in a persistent PlayStation Network account linking error and wouldn't let you play. Patch 10 has solved this, thankfully. You still need an internet connection to play it for the first time but at least now it won't prevent you playing in future.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The rest of the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Release Notes (1.520.0.0)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Integrated NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Transformer model for upscaling and Multi Frame Generation for supported GPUs.</li>
<li>Added option to toggle between Legacy and Transformer models for NVIDIA DLSS upscaling.</li>
<li>Added Max Generated Frames option to control the number of generated frames when using Multi Frame Generation on NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where in particular Steam Deck players who performed the initial boot while offline encountered a persistent PSN account link error message, preventing them from starting the game.</li>
<li>Stability improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dune: Awakening will have BattlEye enabled for Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the release of Dune: Awakening, my one major concern with it has been swept away by the sands. Thankfully, the BattlEye anti-cheat will be enabled for players on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck to play it.</p>
<p>I've been trying to get a clear response on this for a while, even before we knew what anti-cheat system it would use. Thankfully, one of my press contacts today was able to speak to the developer directly to confirm "I'm pleased to say that that is indeed the plan" and that "Funcom are working with Steam to make this happen so rest assured".</p>
<p><em>Check out more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>
<p>Excellent news. Would be a shame for players on Linux systems to miss out on what could end up being the biggest MMO for some time.</p>
<p>In other news, Funcom will be showing off the mid-to-end game in a livestream on May 28th across <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSo4SPH3nA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, starting around 4PM UTC.</p>
<p>The most recent video, Dune: Awakening — Schools of the Imperium | The Mentat, shows off "A secretive and insular organization, the Order of Mentats conditions their adherents to store and analyze vast amounts of data at superhuman speeds. In Dune: Awakening, you can learn to condition your mind in this fashion to analyze the battlefield and become a master tactician and assassin"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FU9FxpHu-Ko"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4c5c2b69643ea569c5a5b84f0c7d3f6b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FU9FxpHu-Ko" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More info:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some of the Mentat’s early skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sentinel: Deploy a suspensor buoyed dart projector that uses motion detection to cover a field of fire. Trigger a second time to activate.</li>
<li>Poison Capsule: You have a hidden dart dispenser that fires off a specially prepared capsule filled with poisonous spores. On impact, a cloud of poison appears, building poison on all who remain within.</li>
<li>Shield Wall: You deploy a half-height Holtzman shield that provides cover during combat for you and your allies. It will also slow enemies who attempt to pass through it – giving you time to take them down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first Mentat trainer is Samin Moro, who you will find at Riftwatch, a Harkonnen base. Show her you have what it takes to create and administer poisons and she may teach you the ways of the Mentat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do have a key request in, so hopefully I'll be able to take a look close to or after the release to see how it runs in the full game to give you a clear report.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II gets a first trailer and you can get a free copy of Gladius</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more Warhammer news for you coming out of the Warhammer Skulls event. We have the first trailer for Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II. Plus, you can get a free copy of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War to keep and the original Mechanicus has a big discount.</p>
<p>Over on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War</a> is free to keep if you claim it before 26th May, 5PM UTC.</p>
<p>As for Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II, the first trailer can be viewed below. As well as familiar faces, you will encounter the Leagues of Votann for the <em>first</em> time in a Warhammer video game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_7ig-tH4yyM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f37e744d2c2ac29550d3515c2111a2ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_7ig-tH4yyM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After millennia of slumber, Vargard Nefershah mobilises her dynasty’s legions to annihilate the Adeptus Mechanicus interlopers who unknowingly settled upon her world. Across the galaxy, Magos Dominus Faustinius is summoned to bring his hard-won expertise to bear and ensure the Necrons do not succeed. The conflict soon becomes a crucible of unanticipated significance, drawing to it external actors stranger and more deadly still.</p>
<p>Two playable factions, two narrative campaigns, two highly unique play-styles and one important choice – who will you lead to victory in this arcane technological war of cold metal hatred?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game had a Native Linux version but it appears the sequel will not. So you'll need to play it with Valve's Proton. I've reached out to ask, but I fully expect it to not have a Linux port this time, the last game from Bulwark Studios didn't either.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for May 23rd, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</img></img></img></p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heroic-launcher-for-epic-gog-amazon-games-on-linux-steamos-v2-17-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on.
