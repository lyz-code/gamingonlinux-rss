      <title>doesn&#39;t exist - a modern text adventure is one you need to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>doesn't exist - a modern text adventure, is an in-development game from LUAL Games KIG that's a love letter to the origins of adventures and gaming. Inspired by the likes of The Beginner's Guide, Stories Untold, Buddy Simulator and Zork it's one for those who love a classic adventure with some nice modern touches.</p>
<p>The developer is going for a modern theme with this too with it exploring themes of isolation, mental health and control. Not only that but they've introduced a clever sounding conversational AI, so you don't have to memorize and repeat exact words needed to progress.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2E074oVGPO4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/385d6d30580d63b84299ed0f39b72978.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2E074oVGPO4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the first act being like a classic text adventure much like Zork, the developer makes clear they don't want you to read endless walls of text, and they're sticking to their design rule on that plus there's plenty of great looking animated pixel-art to help convey the story to you. Plus you're also getting treated to a full musical score for it too.</p>
<p>For the second and third parts though, they plan to expand the scope and mix it up a bit noting that "the story will branch off a bit more and won't be so rule-based anymore" but they don't want to spoil the surprise so they're not going into great detail on that.</p>
<p>You can try the demo on <a href="https://lulatschia.itch.io/i-doesnt-exist" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943420/I_doesnt_exist__a_modern_text_adventure/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>It's also seeking <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/i-doesnt-exist/i-doesnt-exist-a-modern-text-adventure" target="_blank">funding on Kickstarter</a> where the developer hopes to raise at least 10,000CHF (around £8,654.86).</p>

      <title>OpenRCT2 the re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies have arrived for <a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> the open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Although it's fully playable already, the developers of this FOSS project continue to improve it a lot. This is another project that helps to keep a real classic game alive on modern systems, while also continually improving various features to make it feel just that little bit more modern.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16287382281657102302gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of the new additions in version 0.4.1 released on July 4th include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Alpine Coaster track type.</li>
<li>Option to show ride vehicles as separate entries when selecting a ride to construct.</li>
<li>FLAC and OGG/vorbis as supported audio formats for ride music objects.</li>
<li>Add vehicles for the Hybrid Coaster, Single-Rail Roller Coaster and Classic Mini Roller Coaster.</li>
<li>More natural looking shorelines in map generator.</li>
<li>Parks can now be resized into rectangular shapes from the map and map generation windows.</li>
<li>Tree placement is more natural during map generation.</li>
<li>The maximum price for the park entry has been raised to £999.</li>
<li>Weather no longer resets when converting a save to scenario.</li>
<li>Music Style dropdown is now sorted by name.</li>
<li>Transparency can be enabled directly without needing see-through enabled first.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus around 37 bug fixes were noted to make the game much more stable overall.</p>
<p>You need the data files to play it so buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it running on Linux is nice and simple too since they offer an official AppImage and there's also a Flatpak available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Forgotten World free update out for Monster Sanctuary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The creature battling metroidvania Monster Sanctuary has an expansive new free update out with The Forgotten World which is the largest update to the game yet. Adding in a new area, skills, items, new game modes and much more.</p>
<p>About it: "Delve deep into the Metroidvania inspired world of Monster Sanctuary, explore the expansive lands and call upon your monsters to lend their aid in and out of combat! Use their unique skills to fly, ride and brute force your way through environmental puzzles and precise platforming! The world is yours to traverse as you see fit, are you ready to take on the Sanctuary?"</p>
<p>Instead of The Forgotten World being a DLC, they decided to release it free to avoid any separation of the online PvP mode (optional) between people who have it and don't. Seems like a sane idea and gives everyone a bigger and better game. They've also added a "tip jar" on the <a href="https://monster-sanctuary.com/" target="_blank">official site</a> for anyone to donate if they want to support the developer thanks to the free upgrade.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H2e_Vw-ru3U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4354343c787cb397a973a34423efbb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H2e_Vw-ru3U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the full highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new area, larger than any other area of Monster Sanctuary. Forgotten World is meant to be explored in the late game - either before you step foot in the Abandoned Tower, or after you finished the main story. You can find the entrance in the lower area of Horizon Beach. You will need a certain late-game exploration ability to enter this area.</li>
<li>Ten new Monsters.</li>
<li>Nine of them can be found in the Forgotten World. One of the ten new Monsters is a new secret Champion in Blue Cave - which might help you enter the Forgotten World earlier.</li>
<li>New Monster type: Ancient.</li>
<li>Many of the new Monsters have this type. There are also some older Monsters that have gained this type.</li>
<li>Level cap raised to 42 from 40.</li>
<li>All skill trees in the game have gained some new skill nodes. In some cases, we made extensive changes to older Monsters' skill trees.</li>
<li>A lot of new weapons and accessories.</li>
<li>Two new player costumes.</li>
<li>Some new rooms and treasure chests have been added to older areas of the game as well.</li>
<li>Some new exploration abilities have been added to the game as well. Some of the exploration abilities of older Monsters have been updated.</li>
<li>On top of three new Champion fights, there is a new super-secret Champion fight that can only be found by Keeper Masters. It is the most difficult fight in the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to buy Monster Sanctuary you can do so on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/monster-sanctuary?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/814370/Monster_Sanctuary/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>winesapOS is another way to get something like SteamOS on desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has still yet to produce an official installable image of SteamOS 3 for desktops, as always the community provides and another worth looking into is <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS</a>. Another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/holoiso-brings-valves-steamos-3-from-the-steam-deck-to-everyone/" target="_blank">I covered is HoloISO</a>, which tries to stick quite closely to SteamOS 3 but winesapOS aims to be a bit more than that.</p>
<p>Originally called the "Mac Linux Gaming Stick", the aim was to give macOS users an easy bootable disk to run Linux to get expanded game compatibility but it rebranded a while ago to expand the scope for many more users.</p>
<p>From what one of the developers told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our ultimate goal is not to provide the exact SteamOS experience that the Steam Deck provides like HoloISO does. We are focused on the desktop experience and expanding support for SteamOS by making the operating system work on a wide range of hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In keeping with that goal, they have expanded hardware support on desktops / laptops and of course Apple Mac systems too. They also have much more up to date software compared with SteamOS, it supports UEFI and legacy BIOS, encrypted filesystem support, has the Pamac application for installing / updating other software and comes pre-installed with plenty of software like Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, and PolyMC while still keeping the look and feel similar to SteamOS 3.</p>
<p>A big new release with version 3.1.0 went up recently with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch Linux packages upgrades</li>
<li>Graphics driver upgrades with support for Intel, NVIDIA and virtual machines</li>
<li>Improved controller support</li>
<li>An improved upgrade procedure</li>
<li>A fork for the PlayStation 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Organ swapping FPS &#39;Wrought Flesh&#39; gets a huge free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wrought Flesh is a game where you run around and pinch the organs of downed enemies to upgrade your body. It's pretty weird and a big content update is out now.</p>
<p>"Rip out enemies organs and equip them in your own body. Fight biopunk monsters and drugged-up space bandits. You are a Gajeshian Cultist: A near-mythological being built from the bodies of long-dead saints. You have arrived on the partially terraformed planet of Chrisembourgh on a temple-ordained mission to find and kill someone. Explore the planet and trace your victims steps to the end."</p>
<p>The 'Purple Sands of Cumulun' update adds in a reworked oasis area, tons of new quests, new guns, new music, a new monster, reworked AI, new achievements and they had "an actual writer" rework the text too. Seems like a lot of work went into this update.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Starve Together big Curse of Moon Quay update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Curse of Moon Quay is the latest major update for the Native Linux survival game Don't Starve Together and it sounds like a great one. They also updated it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/klei-fixes-up-dont-starve-together-for-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">Steam Deck support</a> recently too!</p>
<p>Easily one of the best survival games you can play on a Linux desktop or Steam Deck, as it's just such a fun game and the style of it is simply magnificent. One of the greatest games Klei has made for sure, but then I like pretty much anything Klei make.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eligdVVedDU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/813cba69f1fea5e25f29441b43ffe0c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eligdVVedDU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features includes:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_ExpandSectionBody_2sCNL">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Moon Quay Island and inhabitants.</li>
<li>Ocean Privateers.</li>
<li>New upgrades for boating:
	<ul>
<li>Grass Boat</li>
<li>Kelp Bumper</li>
<li>Shell Bumper</li>
<li>Cannon and Cannonballs</li>
<li>Rudder</li>
<li>Trawler</li>
<li>Polly Roger's Hat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docks</li>
<li>Nautopilot and Nautopilot Beacon</li>
<li>New perspectives on life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the new content, they also tweaked some existing features like making map controls and zooming much more intuitive and just make more sense. Zooming for example now focuses on the cursor for the map and will be smoother, rotating the map will also be done around the current location and not the player and controllers will see a better directional panning experience.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> where it's 66% off for the 2022 Summer Sale. Absolutely worth getting.</p>

      <title>Quirky murder mystery adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates releases July 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lord Winklebottom Investigates is an upcoming adventure from UK-based developer Cave Monsters, and they've recently confirmed it will release on July 28th. This game will be coming along with full Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from British literature icons such as Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes, Lord Winklebottom and his tea-drinking hippo companion Dr. Frumple will enjoy a journey full of intrigue and secrets that will apparently keep mystery fans gripped. The developer said it's a game with plenty of heart, featuring a script and setting full of bizarre characters and humour that wouldn’t be out of place in a Monty Python or Blackadder sketch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XxxK5ygYBGo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d30f4dd2279933598095d34d70e1f01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XxxK5ygYBGo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign it's set in the 1920s where the world’s foremost detective is about to embark on his most challenging case yet. Set on an isolated island where there's a grisly murder, it's a race against time to track down the killer.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full English voice acting.</li>
<li>An original 1920s inspired soundtrack featuring live instruments.</li>
<li>Play as a gentleman giraffe!</li>
<li>Unique 2D hand painted artwork.</li>
<li>Animals of all shapes and sizes!</li>
<li>Streamlined point and click interface.</li>
<li>Collection of bizarre characters to interrogate!</li>
<li>Dozens of puzzles to solve!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1024160/Lord_Winklebottom_Investigates/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Last Call BBS, the final game from Zachtronics is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Zachtronics moving on from game development, their last game is now out in Early Access with Last Call BBS although it's actually not just one game.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics! The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is actually a game pack that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>20th Century Food Court:</strong> Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio:</strong> Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path:</strong> Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sawayama Solitaire:</strong> It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams:</strong> Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional:</strong> Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>HACK*MATCH:</strong> The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire:</strong> Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They will also be doing an <a href="https://askmeanythi.ng/ama/Ll5HypQmU79a" target="_blank">AMA (Ask Me Anything)</a> on Reddit on Thursday where you can fire off those burning questions.</p>
<p>It's a shame to know they won't be making any more games (it really is the last), with Zach moving onto a teaching job that was <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1454395489?t=00h12m36s" target="_blank">confirmed</a> during a recent Q&amp;A livestream.</p>
<p>Available to buy with a Native Linux version from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and soon on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/last_call_bbs" target="_blank">GOG</a> too.</p>

      <title>Feartress is a new incremental city-building RPG in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feartress is a bit of a quirky one. Blending together elements of an idle RPG with some small city-building that sees you go through different dimensions. I'm really not sure on the best way to describe this one, it's just odd but it has a pretty nice idea to play through.</p>
<p>"A new take on the genre of incremental games where you go on a journey to collect all the 21 elemental pearls and restore balance to the universe. You build up a settlement in each world and destroy enemy structures to find loot and unlock new perks. Collect epic and legendary gear to help you venture into new worlds with increasingly powerful enemies."</p>

      <title>Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A second bundle (yes there's two) supporting people in the USA following the overturning of Roe v. Wade is live on itch.io with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1471/worthy-of-better-stronger-together-for-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle</a>. The other is the Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/itchio-are-hosting-a-big-indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 24th, 2022 was a harrowing day for civil liberties. In the United States, basic human rights are being stripped away. It is a stark reminder that even after 50 years of legal protection, equality can be so easily lost. To say nothing of the dangerous precedent this decision sets for other civil rights protections, we believe that the right for a person to pursue safe and legal abortions is more than enough reason to stand up and take action. This decision does not only effect those capable of becoming pregnant. It is a determination of what rights we as a society choose to hold sacred. It is a question of  who is deemed worthy of protecting. The fabric of our society is woven by every single member, to erode a single thread unravels us all. We must all take a stand and demand that our rights and bodily autonomy are federally recognized</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a charity bundle as well with all proceeds being split between these two charities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://now.org/" target="_blank">National Organization for Women</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/about-us/" target="_blank">Center for Reproductive Rights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can pay $10 (or more) to support it and gain access to 169 different items spread across games, tools and more including some gems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Away Team</li>
<li>Aground</li>
<li>Not Actually A DOS Game</li>
<li>Sally Face</li>
</ul>
<p>The bundle is up for the next 11 days.</p>

      <title>Desktopia is a city-builder that runs along the bottom of your desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Desktopia: A Desktop Village Simulator seems like quite a unique idea for a city-builder, also a fun distraction to have open on your desktop. Instead of giving you a big full-screen window, the game sits along the bottom of your screen allowing you to carry on with whatever you're doing while also keeping an eye on your little people.</p>
<p>"Like any city-builder, you get to make the big decisions, while also being able to take control of your own sword wielding character. You can join in the battles, harvest resources, put out fires, or interact with your villagers. In Desktopia, you can be as active, or as idle, as you want!"</p>
<p>You can see the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cGCWSWy4Jnk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6b5806ae2efc9f04fc8548642c6cf9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cGCWSWy4Jnk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also, as a basic demo of how it would work on your actual desktop, they have a video on that too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uw7sz1pA9Ys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/460346435f22a746d343f4fd4924c8c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uw7sz1pA9Ys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A completely original approach in PC gaming: designed with functionality in mind, Desktopia allows you to use your PC for multiple purposes on a single monitor.</li>
<li>Clever UI: with resizeable pop-out windows which can be arranged anywhere on your screen.</li>
<li>A playable character which levels with your village, so you can jump into the action whenever you want.</li>
<li>Detailed logs and statistics arrayed in beautiful charts and graphs.</li>
<li>Spy Mode: focus the camera on any villager, any time, and watch as they live their life.</li>
<li>Resizeable game world, with the option to have it 'always on top' of other windows.</li>
<li>From nothing: grow a series of villages along a dangerous and treacherous road: from a single house to a bustling metropolis.</li>
<li>Construct a range of facilities (inns, libraries, post offices, temples, blacksmiths etc) and watch villagers move in independently.</li>
<li>Keep your villagers happy to collect gratitude, and use it to host festivals which bedeck your village in bunting!</li>
<li>Recruit and upgrade soldiers to defend your village from undead, bandits, fairies, and demons. Join them in battle if that's your thing!</li>
<li>Hire heroes to lead the charge against your foes and destroy their strongholds.</li>
<li>Decide on building low-tech villages with few needs, or risk it big by aiming for high-tech villages with needy villagers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Denuvo announced Denuvo SecureDLC to protect DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Denuvo is not exactly something any gamer I've ever seen be happy about and now it's growing and will likely appear in more games, with the announcement of Denuvo SecureDLC.</p>
<p>Irdeto said in the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2471835/0/en/Denuvo-by-Irdeto-launches-Denuvo-SecureDLC-the-industry-s-first-solution-to-protect-downloadable-content-against-piracy.html" target="_blank">press release</a> it's "the first of its kind in the gaming market and provides opportunities to extend the revenue tail for developers and publishers past the initial launch window".</p>
<p>The main target here appears to be free to play games that offer up DLC and micro-transactions to unlock various features, cosmetics and so on with SecureDLC being positioned to protect against piracy there. So Irdeto are hoping that developers will pick SecureDLC to deal with it apparently becoming "easy to bypass the existing barriers that try to secure DLCs on popular gaming platforms like Steam and Epic" as they found "players can automatically generate and install programs that access downloadable content without paying for it".</p>
<p>According to Reinhard Blaukovitsch, Managing Director at Denuvo by Irdeto, the new technology is already being successfully used with the current Denuvo Anti-Tamper clients: “Denuvo has become a one-stop shop for game developers to ensure the safety of their game against cheating, tampering, and piracy and to protect the gaming experience. Our current clients, big and small, are ecstatic with the results and we are happy to help them maximize revenue and also enable new business models for these games they spent so much effort building.”</p>

      <title>Play as a sarcastic cow in the comedy adventure A Trail of Ooze </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Trail of Ooze is an upcoming comedy adventure where you take on the role of a sarcastic cow who attempts to find their missing human farmer. It honestly sounds quite hilarious and the story sounds like something that I feel I need to play through.</p>
<p>"Majros, the cow, lives on a small farm in the middle of the Swedish forests oblivious to the struggles of the outside world - until genetically engineered chemicals spread across the farm. All animals and plants mutate and gain human-like consciousness and the farmer, who witnessed it all, is kidnapped by agents from the evil agrochemical corporation. So, Majros sets out on a rescue mission following a trail of the chemical ooze. On her adventure she unravels conspiracies, battles social injustices and comes face to face with environmental disaster. Forced to leave her safe bubble, Majros learns that no cow or story is only black and white and that she cannot make it alone against the insidious corporation."</p>

      <title>itch.io are hosting a big Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade in the USA that threatens to remove access to abortions a bunch of indie developers have pulled together to make an <a href="https://itch.io/b/1472/indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds" target="_blank">Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</a> on itch.io.</p>
<p>Much like itch.io did with previous charity bundles like for Racial Justice and Equality, Palestinian Aid, Ukraine Relief and others all the funds will be going to select charities and you can donate while also grabbing a big bunch of games, game assets, physical games to print and much more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>100% of the proceeds from this bundle will go to the National Network for Abortion Fund's <a href="http://nnaf.org/collectivepowerfund" target="_blank">Collective Power Fund</a>, which moves money <em><strong>directly</strong></em> to abortion funds across 20+ U.S. states, with a particular focus on the South and Midwest (where it is often most difficult to get access to abortions). NNAF’s partnerships with these abortion funds provide direct resources and funds to many of the people most impacted by Roe v. Wade, towards immediate action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's included is pretty great too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haque</li>
<li>Pushamo</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw</li>
<li>Bleed</li>
<li>Bleed 2</li>
<li>Buck Up and Drive!</li>
<li>Calico</li>
<li>…and the list goes on</li>
</ul>
<p>It has a minimum payment of $10 but you can donate more and they will be adding more items to the bundle up to July 6th. The bundle runs for another 9 days.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 515.57 and Vulkan Beta 515.49.06 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Multiple driver updates have been released by NVIDIA for Linux recently so here's a look at what's new in each.</p>
<p>First up, for those of you sticking with the "Latest Production Branch" <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/190425/en-uk" target="_blank">version 515.57</a> went up on June 28th which is mainly just fixing up some issues and getting them working nicely. Here's what's new:</p>
<div class="tabcontent" id="tab1_content" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some graphics applications to crash when they are started while nvidia-drm.ko is not loaded.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where NvFBC could return an incorrect frame if a capture request timed out.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where NvFBC direct capture would wait for multiple queued frames to finish rendering, instead of returning the next rendered frame.</li>
<li>Added support for NvFBC direct capture to composite the mouse cursor onto frames.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Vulkan direct to display could not drive more than 4 displays from a single VkInstance.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-settings from accurately reflecting changes to some configuration properties.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, we missed covering that NVIDIA also updated the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> during June. Version 515.49.05 on June 17th added support for the new open source kernel modules (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">more on that here</a>) plus these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier</a> [Linux]</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fix the depth and stencil clear color for dynamic rendering</li>
<li>Fix possible corruption when the shading rate image is changed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 2nd version 515.49.06 also went up with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with image copy when one of the formats is a single-plane interleaved video format</li>
<li>Fixed issue with vkCmdResetEvent on compute queues</li>
<li>Fixed regression with tessellation mode set be the tessellation control shader</li>
<li>Fixed issue with underestimate conservative rasterization sometimes not working correctly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want a stable experience, just stick with the mainline drivers as the Vulkan Beta is aimed at developers who need to test out the latest Vulkan extensions.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.12 is out now for improving Windows compatibility on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another two weeks have gone by so the Wine hackers have put out their latest development work with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.12" target="_blank">Wine 7.12</a> now available.</p>
<p>This is the Windows compatibility layer that allows you to run various applications and games on Linux (and forms part of Steam Play Proton). Once a year or so, a new stable release is made but the development versions are usually fine to use.</p>
<p>Wine 7.12 highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Theming support for Qt5 applications.</li>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.4.</li>
<li>Improved effect support in Direct2D.</li>
<li>QWORD support in registry tools.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the bug fixes for this release include issues solved for Star Citizen, Shogun Total War 2, Argentum 20, Wireshark and others.</p>
<p>Recently they also had the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/news/2022062201" target="_blank">vkd3d 1.4</a> release of their Direct3D to Vulkan translation library (not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton) which included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many improvements to the HLSL compiler.</li>
<li>A new descriptor heap implementation using the VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing extension.</li>
<li>A new fence implementation using the VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore extension.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux share on Steam hits highest peak in years thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out for June 2022, putting the Linux user share at one of its highest ever points and likely thanks to the rise of the Steam Deck and SteamOS. As shown on our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>, it's been trending upwards for quite a while but this latest figure is a pretty good showing.</p>
<p>As of June 2022, Linux is sitting at <u><strong>1.18%</strong></u> of the Steam user share.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119921521656754277gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119921521656754277gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Now, that doesn't sound like a lot on paper, but it puts the monthly active Linux user count at around 1,557,600 at least (based on when Valve last gave the monthly active user count).</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of the most popular Linux systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 11.42% -1.43%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 10.11% -0.98%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 9.90% +1.86%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 9.73% -2.02%</li>
<li>"SteamOS Holo" 64 bit 7.58% +2.35%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 6.45% +0.48%</li>
<li>Description:Freedesktop.org 21.08.14 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.05% +6.05%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.79% +4.79%</li>
<li>Other 33.96% -11.11%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So you can pretty plainly see that the Steam Deck with SteamOS is already rising up the ranks, as one of the most popular Linux gaming systems on Steam's survey with it already making up well over 7% of Linux players which is a nice increase from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/steam-deck-already-hits-over-5-of-linux-users-on-steam/" target="_blank">5% from May 2022</a>.</p>

      <title>Crypt of the NecroDancer gets a BIG surprise update with more to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer from Brace Yourself Games is a truly wonderful mix of dungeon crawling and a rhythm game that released back in 2015. It just got a huge surprise update and more is on the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer is an award winning hardcore roguelike rhythm game. Move on the beat to navigate an ever changing dungeon while battling dancing skeletons, zombies, dragons, and more. Groove to the epic Danny Baranowsky soundtrack, or select songs from your own MP3 collection!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A no beat mode, to make it easier for some players.</li>
<li>Save and Quit anytime.</li>
<li>Reduced loading time.</li>
<li>Improved controller support via Steam Input, with gamepad-specific button symbols and Steam Deck support.</li>
<li>An overhauled custom music system supporting MP3, OGG and FLAC formats.</li>
<li>Linux gets a Native file-picker for custom music.</li>
<li>New and Improved Co-op.</li>
<li>A new level editor.</li>
<li>Added a fully redesigned mod loader and modding menus.</li>
<li>And loads more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that this is only the start, I'm very curious to see what they have cooking up as they said " this is a precursor to something bigger coming your way, and we want to make sure that we address some of the community’s most significant feedback before we get there".</p>
<p>Since I love the game (although I am horrible at it), I wanted to see how it was on the Steam Deck now so here's a little attempt at it today:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XsnzdN0J6Qo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d0247f465b2c68af9d257e4be86b093.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XsnzdN0J6Qo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Don't judge me, I'm rubbish but it's such a gem.</em></p>
<p>There does seem to be a bug with the Steam Input configuration though. I had to pick a different profile, then back to the new official one for it to actually detect input. Apart from that it seems great on Deck.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/crypt_of_the_necrodancer" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crypt-of-the-necrodancer?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GOG finally remove the false &#34;in progress&#34; note about GOG Galaxy for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems at some point over the last month or two, GOG finally removed the "in progress" notice for GOG Galaxy coming to Linux.</p>
<p>Something that was a bit <em>overdue</em>, since they clearly have no plans to actually bring GOG Galaxy to Linux despite it being the <a href="https://www.gog.com/wishlist/galaxy" target="_blank">most voted-for</a> feature request for many years. GOG and CD Projekt never really took it seriously though, with even the official Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1012760227148587009" target="_blank">trolling</a> "We can assure you: it‘s not us. We are the driving force behind 'add Linux support for GOG Galaxy' though" in reply to GOG post about showing 2077 gameplay.</p>
<p>Every time I've spoken to the GOG team over the last few years, they just repeatedly told me it wasn't planned, despite the wishlist entry still listing it as "in progress" and their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2014/06/gogcom-announce-galaxy-their-optional-client-linux-support-to-come/" target="_blank">original announcement</a> mentioning it would come to Linux too and that it was "being done with PC, Mac and Linux in mind" (so much for that huh?).</p>
<p>At least there's applications like the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> that can help you manage your GOG games on Linux. Still, it would be nice if GOG at some point put some more resources into improving their Linux support. Plus, if you're going to be using a Steam Deck, buying from Steam just makes a lot more sense when it's far easier to access so I imagine that's eventually going to cost GOG a few more sales too and they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">not exactly doing well</a>.</p>
<p>It is a shame for those that want the Galaxy client, as I actually love what GOG do. The main idea that you can just log in and download a full offline installer is great and their repeated revivals of old games is wonderful too. But without Galaxy, some games end up missing features for Linux or just skipping a Linux build entirely on GOG.</p>

      <title>AK-xolotl mixes the incredibly cute with the deadly in this rogue-lite shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AK-xolotl is an upcoming rogue-lite that answers the question of: what happens if you gave an axolotl an AK? Someone must have asked that somewhere.</p>
<p>Currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter with a few days left, it appears to be rather popular and it was initially funded in only 4 hours. The developer is planning full Native Linux support too so I've no idea how I missed this one originally because the idea is nuts and it looks gorgeous too. Mixing together procedurally generated biomes with handcrafted layouts, it seems like it will have a lot of replay value too. You also get to unlock various powers and the game evolves as you progress through it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oPOn8iu354o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/976c9443785829468ccd8fac47ebafa4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oPOn8iu354o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Core Keeper hits 1 million sales in only a few months</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pugstorm and Fireshine Games have announced that their game Core Keeper has managed to hit 1 million sales only a few months after entering Early Access. This follows on from the rather large Sunken Sea Update that released in the middle of June.</p>
<p>Nice to see another fully supported Native Linux indie game doing so well. Here's what they said about the impressive milestone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re delighted to announce that, shortly after the launch of The Sunken Sea Update - our first major content update - Core Keeper hit 1,000,000 sales. This is a momentous occasion for us as developers and for our publisher, Fireshine Games. In fact, Core Keeper previously set the record for being Fireshine Games’ fastest-selling digital game of all time by selling 100,000 copies within its first two days of Early-Access launch.<br/>
<br/>
We’re truly overwhelmed by the fantastic community response that Core Keeper has had, and we’re thrilled to have hit this milestone so early on in the games’ development. Launching in Early Access has given us a unique opportunity to involve the community in major game decisions and collaborate with them on improvements and optimisations.</p>

<p>Remember all that talk about the indiepocalypse? We seem to be hearing more and more about games doing so well, and a lot of them come from smaller teams like this too. Just like Valheim managed to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/valheim-is-absolutely-smashing-it-with-10-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank">sell over 10 million copies</a>, it just goes to show that some good marketing and an actually good game will clearly sell.</p>

      <title>Free and open source arena shooter Xonotic 0.8.5 now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love some fast-paced first-person shooting action? Xonotic (a fork of the original Nexuiz) has a brand new release available with tons of improvements.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big release for the project touching on nearly every part of the gameplay, with some big tech changes behind the scenes too. Thousands of changes for better and more refined gameplay, new and updated maps and player models, new sound effects, much more dangerous bots, a new HUD, more translations and so much more.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't play online, the changes to bots will be most welcome. Not only have they tweaked their difficulty but various bug fixes came in like underwater navigation, they will no longer get stuck in bad spots, they can properly jump and crouch, they have an improved ability to avoid danger while running and bunny hopping and they're better at chasing enemies down too.</p>
<p>It should be a bit easier to pick out players / bots from the maps to actually shoot them too thanks to improved visibility, plus new and improved primary shirt and secondary glow colouring on some models and they fixed primary and secondary colours getting mixed up.</p>
<p>Two new maps made it in too with Bromine by <em>packer</em>, a rusty styled map for large games!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14047883451656668217gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14047883451656668217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Opium by <em>cityy</em>, a medium sized level with plenty of vertical action!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17338397121656668236gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17338397121656668236gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Various other maps saw updates, there's refreshed weapon and item sound effects to help you better distinguish them during combat and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>A massive release overall and you can see all the changes in the <a href="https://xonotic.org/posts/2022/xonotic-0-8-5-release/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two big updates have rolled out for the Steam Deck which includes an opt-in Beta SteamOS 3.3 upgrade, plus there's also a Steam Deck Beta Client update.</p>
<p>First up, the Beta <u><strong>Client</strong></u> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3323108691056012032" target="_blank">update</a> brings in these fixes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Added support for game-bundled Virtual Menu icons in the in-game Deck UI</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Re-enabled the Adaptive Backlight feature.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for SteamOS 3.3 Beta itself <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3410929607716145819/" target="_blank">here's all</a> that was added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Fixed audio output with some 32-bit games that use ALSA</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like Valve have been hard at work to improve much of the experience overall on the Steam Deck, this makes me very happy since I boot mine up every day without fail, it really is my main gaming machine now outside of times where it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>In other Steam deck news, here's a few recent big bits you might have missed:</p>

      <title>Anti-cheat work on Warhammer: Vermintide 2 for Steam Deck &amp; Linux &#39;on hold&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's supposed to be relatively easy for games with anti-cheat like BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat to get working on Linux and Steam Deck, some developers are having issues like Fatshark with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/" target="_blank">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>.</p>
<p>This particular game uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which is supposed to be a case of ticking a few boxes and making sure things are in the right place to allow EAC to work with Steam Play Proton but it turns out it might not be that simple for every game. A shame, but not a big surprise, as if it was truly that simple for every game more would have done it by now, and considering how big game projects and code are, there's likely plenty of smaller gotchas developers need to deal with.</p>
<p>A rep from Fatshark posted on the Steam forum to give an update on the work to get Warhammer: Vermintide 2 playable and it's not good news. Despite chatting to Epic and Valve, they couldn't figure it out and now their team is working on the upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=26#c3419936604888208895" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we have performed all the requisite steps to have this work. We've ticked the boxes in the EAC portal, included the files in the appropriate places. Problem is, as you can see, it doesn't work in this scenario. We've been in touch with both third parties (in this case Epic and Valve), but we're at a bit of a roadblock truth be told. Those who would work on really digging in to the weeds on this are indeed digging in to Darktide weeds, so aren't able to spend sufficient time liaising with Valve and Epic to figure out what's causing the 'simple steps' to not be as simple as they sounded.<br/>
<br/>
In short, work on this is on hold for now. We'll bark up this thread should things spin up again.</p>

      <title>Strategy-survival game Dice Tribes: Ambitions gets a Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dice Tribes: Ambitions is a pretty interesting looking strategy survival game mix, where you move dice around to keep your tribe and village going. It might not sound or even look like much but it seems like it might surprise you with the mechanics involved.</p>
<p>It's not a particularly well-known game and so far it only has around 23 Steam user reviews, but they are 100% positive. If you're after something different, perhaps this is one to give a go? The developer also just recently updated the game to provide a Native Linux build too. The developer describes it as a "dice worker placement game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VZHV0iOyxHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46012b5a36967e70483f21db02319ce0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VZHV0iOyxHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with a small number of villagers, you will need to manage them and grow the tribes in order to complete one of the ambitions. Opportunities and Dangers lies ahead and you will need to dispatch your villagers to take care of them. Prepare your villagers as you attempt to complete one of the ambition to win the game.</p>
<p>Key Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose from one of 6 tribes, each with their own village building.</li>
<li>Choose from more than 15 different structures and construct them to aid in your Ambition.</li>
<li>Choose from one of many ambitions to complete, including hidden ones.</li>
<li>Draft mode that forces you to adapt to different restrictions and challenges.</li>
</ul>

<p>So officially <u>73</u> of the top 100 will work on the Steam Deck currently. Any game that is playable on Steam Deck will be playable on Linux desktops too (minus perhaps some very rare exceptions). However, if you take into account ratings also from <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and some personal testing, the number will be likely a little higher especially for those Valve has not yet tested.</p>
<p>Here's the full list below, which is a snapshot taken today (June 30th, 2022). Since it's based on player-counts it fluctuates but not massively so, and it's more the bottom few that move in and out the rest just switch positions.</p>

<p>As pretty much expected, the biggest culprit of what's not playable is issues with Anti-Cheat. Despite Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye supporting Linux and the Steam Deck, there's still a lot of issues there with developers either not updating or having trouble with the integration so it's an uphill struggle there.</p>
<p>For games that are listed as Playable some of the biggest issues there are a mixture of things like: launchers being a nuisance, on-screen keyboard needing to be pulled up manually, no gamepad support and text that's too small. For developers, it often doesn't take much to bump up from Playable to Verified and lots of them have been putting in the effort, which you can see across many articles in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">the Steam Deck tag</a>.</p>
<p>Some games tagged as Unsupported may also appear to work fine, but there's a few cases where they can end up very unstable later on (like Forza Horizon 4). So even if you might think an Unsupported title is wrong, it might not be.</p>

      <title>AOKZOE are the latest to attempt a Steam Deck rival with the AOKZOE A1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AOKZOE will be jumping in the handheld ring with their upcoming AOKZOE A1 AMD Ryzen 7 6800U portable that will offer either Windows 11 or SteamOS to perhaps rival the Steam Deck. They're a rather new company, so everything they're talking about and showing off should be taken with a rather large pinch of salt.</p>
<p>To go against the Steam Deck though they're not only going to have to be able to ship a lot of units, but actually have a price-point that isn't ridiculous like some other vendors. Considering Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">ramping up shipments now</a>, how is a brand new vendor going to cope?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAeZ8ABXx8s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d58a898743dbba90abc99a7ff8f58712.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAeZ8ABXx8s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The specifications they list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A combo of AMD Ryzen 7 6800U | Radeon 680M | LPDDR5X (Freq. 6400)</li>
<li>8-inch IPS Screen, sRGB 100％, 1920 x 1200</li>
<li>Windows 11 or Steam OS</li>
<li>RGB Breathing Lighting</li>
<li>PD Charge</li>
<li>Gyroscope</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zMMbfJ_JXos"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9b5e819013ed03e12f0baa888934cdd9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zMMbfJ_JXos" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said it will go up for pre-order in July and it's scheduled to start shipping in September.</p>
<p>I'm pretty skeptical of this, since they just popped up out of nowhere but perhaps worth keeping an eye on. Price is going to be the biggest question and currently they're not telling. Even so, if it was reasonably priced, trust is perhaps the second biggest question with such a new vendor.</p>

      <title>Some Steam Decks ship with an x2 SSD instead of an x4 SSD</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve made a change to the specifications of the top two versions of the Steam Deck last month, which it seems plenty of people (including me) completely missed. It's not a massive change but still one to be aware of as not all Decks are the same.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is split across three models either with a 64 GB eMMC, 256 GB NVMe SSD or a 512 GB NVMe SSD (and the top model has the anti-glare etched screen too). Sometime around May 28th though, the SSDs shipping in the Steam Deck changed and now come in <em>two</em> possible editions and you won't know what you have until you get it and check.</p>
<p>On the specifications page, it now lists this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>64 GB eMMC (PCIe Gen 2 x1)</li>
<li>256 GB NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*)</li>
<li>512 GB high-speed NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With Valve noting "*Some 256GB and 512GB models ship with a PCIe Gen 3 x2 SSD. In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4".</p>
<p><em>You can see the change thanks to the Wayback Machine on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220527060926/https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection_24468" target="_blank">May 27th</a> and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220528095946/https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection_24468" target="_blank">May 28th</a>.</em></p>
<p>Really, it shouldn't make all that much of a difference, especially considering the Micro SD slot can load and run even some of the highest-end games just fine. This is quite likely one of the ways Valve has been able to ramp up production to ship <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">more than double each week</a>, along with the two different fan models you might also see.</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a first gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Return to Monkey Island, the continuation of the story from he Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge now has a first gameplay trailer. With a return of series creator Ron Gilbert and developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, it's certainly an exciting game to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Today, Devolver Digital released the first trailer you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="p3mxq44HhnU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8beb1ca0f98b70fcfed7ee8998cddbf2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/p3mxq44HhnU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.<br/>
<br/>
Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't quite know what platforms it will be on yet as it's all "TBA" (to be announced).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Pocket Wheels looks like a fun toy-car playground that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocket Wheels looks like what you could imagine in your mind when playing with toy cars as a child and it's on the way to Linux with Native support.</p>
<p>A mixture of a 3D platformer and a racing game, inspired by "90s collectathons". In the game you control a toy car that can jump, glide and there's even a grappling hook. The idea is to give you a big playground to race and fly through, just like you always dreamed of right? You get various vehicles to unlock too and there's a number of different rooms each with their own race tracks, objectives and collectibles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZFJocKALaQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b312d3d04043a78170792670e626c55.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZFJocKALaQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This looks like pure joy. Reminds me a little of classic Micro Machines games!</p>
<p>Speaking on the Steam forum, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1129360/discussions/0/5755024051061146444/#c3419934814486215419" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that while it works with Proton already they are "working on a native Build for the future" and they're testing it on the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Onsen Master blends Overcooked with Spirited Away and releases soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending the frantic action from the Overcooked series with inspiration taken from Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away, the upcoming Linux Native game Onsen Master looks like fun.</p>
<p>Onsen Master features arcade-style single and two-player co-op, where players must manage the customers of their hot springs, and prepare and put together the correct ingredients to cure their ailments. Running around the hot springs, wrangling wandering customers, and putting the right concoctions into the right baths can be hectic enough already, but troublesome yokai look to impede players' service as well.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also sent out recently that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BhyerDH382k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2804f7d21f00dac49b9481ae1e558a0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BhyerDH382k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Spring Fling:</strong> Experience a short and sweet story for up to two players, and unveil the island of Izajima in a visual novel style narrative with a cute anime aesthetic.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>The Customer is Always Right: </strong>Skip the story and dive right in with Arcade Mode! Choose one of the six hot spring levels to put your customer service skills to the test.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>The Heat is On: </strong>Take on others in a competitive couch multiplayer mode where players must each work to manage their customers within the same hot spring.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Spa Music: </strong>An original soundtrack full of tunes akin to a Feudal fairytale, composed by Dorrell Ettienne.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left">How did the idea come about? The concept for Onsen Master dates back to 2015, when Waking Oni Games founder Derrick Fields was inspired by their regular rewatches of Spirited Away, specifically a section of the film in which the protagonist is working with spirits at a bathhouse. This formed the basis of Onsen Master’s hot spring customer management gameplay, and also the Japanese setting and aesthetic of the game. After five years of development, a successful Kickstarter campaign and beta period, and the partnership with Whitethorn Games, Onsen Master is finally ready to release "this month" they said (although it's now the end of June and a date hasn't actually been given yet).</p>

      <title>Fech The Ferret is an upcoming vibrant parkour rhythm-platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your musical games and want to get into the rhythm? Fech The Ferret looks like a pretty clever blending of ideas.</p>
<p>It's a fast-paced parkour platformer with seriously vibrant and inviting colours. The hook here is that the faster you go, the better the music gets. A mixture of high speed 3D platforming and rhythmic subtones inside of a colorful open world. The developer emailed in about it, making it clear they fully support Linux with a Native build and there's also a demo available to try right now.</p>
<p>"Fech The Ferret especially caters to those who gotta go fast and would rather climb walls than do precise platforming, but you can also enjoy it at your own pace and explore this rich world in search of secrets, or perhaps chat with some Marmocleans."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qft8MGMVnLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5b8aa18f4e95bbe0420a59896e1cd2ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qft8MGMVnLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like a fun idea, so will be keeping an eye on this one. If you do give it a go, let us know what you think in the comments, it's fun to see more music games come along for sure.</p>
<p>You can try out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382980/Fech_The_Ferret/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> and also <a href="https://raoulwb.itch.io/fech-the-ferret" target="_blank">follow on itch.io</a> too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a set of nice bug fixes in a new client update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Deck Client Update is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3323108691045398493" target="_blank">out now</a> pulling in some rather useful sounding bug fixes. They've actually slowed down a little on the updates now, which is actually good to see so hopefully there's something a little bigger cooking in the Valve oven once again.</p>
<p>Here's what's new from the June 28th update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where clicking in-game links when offline would get Steam Deck into a bad state</li>
<li>Fixed navigation issues in the game EULA dialog</li>
<li>Fixed crashing issue when deleting a screenshot</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator failing to load when Steam Cloud is disabled</li>
<li>Fixed configurator failing to load when encountering corrupted controller layout files</li>
<li>Fixed controller virtual menus being limited to 4 active menus</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing the touchscreen to occasionally be stuck in mouse-emulation mode when accessing the configurator in-game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there anything specific you're wanting to be added or fixed on the Steam Deck? Let us know in the comments. I'm off to go update mine now…</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, from Thursday June 30th Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">will be doubling</a> the number of Steam Decks going out each time as production has ramped up. A designer at Valve also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-designer-warns-people-not-to-put-2242-m2-drives-in-their-steam-deck/" target="_blank">warned against</a> sticking in SSDs that are too big.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we say goodbye to Q2 and hello to Q3, Valve has confirmed that production of Steam Deck units has increased to the point where they're going to be sending out a lot more.</p>
<p>Today is one of the usual days for emails to go out (so check your inbox) and Thursday is the other day where it happens. From <em>this</em> Thursday (30th June), things will be just a bit different. Confirming the details on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1541459263444332544" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the official OnDeck account said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th. Production has picked up, and after today we'll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!</p>

<p><em>You can check your reservation status on the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck page</a>.

      <title>Kingdoms and Castles gets Steam Deck and gamepad support, VR version coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little castle building and AI conquering on the go? Kingdoms and Castles already worked great on Linux with the Native version and now it should be great on the Steam Deck too. Only recently they put out a huge update to the game with AI Kingdoms too.</p>
<p>The developer said they "worked hard to implement intuitive gamepad controls that make it easy to build and manage your kingdom and we've tweaked the UI to work well for the Deck's screen size". It won't mess with anyone using a mouse so no worries there but it also means on PC overall you get gamepad support if you want it. You just need to tick Console Controls in the options (default on Deck).</p>
<p>Here's a short demo of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rDJthIdBdac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce09dcce60ad7c41abdc7a671fc527ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rDJthIdBdac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they've teased these are coming next for the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Fixing bugs - you may have noticed a few small hotpatches over the past few weeks, more to come soon.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">New stuff for the AI Kingdoms based on your feedback so far (for example, getting that pesky aggressive AI to stop asking for tribute after defeating them in a war, and being able to demand tribute yourself).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">VR version of the game - this is well underway and feels really cool. We'll have some progress to show here soon.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>CorsixTH the modern game engine for Theme Hospital v0.66 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CorsixTH is the absolute best way to play the classic Theme Hospital on any modern system and version 0.66 is now out.</p>
<p>While there's the newer Two Point Hospital from some of the original team, you're simply never going to beat Theme Hospital in my heart since not only is nostalgia at play but it remains a highly enjoyable sim thanks to it being such a great game at the time. CorsixTH keeping it a live with plenty of enhancements helps too of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10003537161656342269gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10003537161656342269gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in v0.66-beta1 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Direct Zoom has been improved and is now enabled by default</li>
<li>Nurses can now leave the ward without disturbing her patients</li>
<li>Patients with Serious Radiation now glow a beautiful shade of green</li>
<li>Patients with Jellyitis now wobble wobble wobble</li>
<li>The Hotkeys menu has been overhauled to make it easier to use</li>
<li>You can now reset your zoom level by pressing '0'</li>
<li>A new fax code cheat has been added!</li>
<li>The replace machine prompt will now tell you the new strength before purchase (can be disabled in configuration settings)</li>
<li>A machine's dynamic info will tell you the strength a machine can be upgraded to if you replaced it (can be disabled in configuration settings)</li>
<li>Improved pee and vomit conditions</li>
<li>Patients will no longer queue for reception until nearby</li>
<li>The Adviser will no longer queue repetitive messages</li>
<li>Dropdown menus will now close when clicked outside of</li>
<li>Non-visual diseases can now be delayed in the level config of a custom game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus the usual assorted bug fixes. It's mostly the same as the Beta release I covered back in May, plus a few additional fixes that were discovered during testing. Not many changelogs will give you the likes of improved peeing and vomiting but here we are, what a gem.</p>

      <title>Pokete is a Pokemon-like game for your terminal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy catching some creatures? How about directly in your terminal window? Pokete is a free and open source Pokemon-like. Just like the classics it features various creatures across different types like Plant, Water, Fire and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>It's currently in active development but it's already quite playable with a long list of features. In the last month it only just had another major release adding in smarter NPCs, achievements, fights with multiple Poketes, in-game time for day and night Poketes encounters and you now get transported to safety if all your Poketes faint during a battle just like a certain other game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7022901491656337431gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7022901491656337431gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5252310631656337431gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5252310631656337431gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pretty fun idea for a terminal game really, can't wait to watch it evolve.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/lxgr-linux/pokete" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.lxgr_linux.pokete" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>Spaceship building game Reassembly goes 64bit, gets Linux and Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reassembly is a highly rated game that mixes spaceship building, exploration and intense combat. It's quite a little gem and has a big update out now. One I was somewhat addicted to back when it originally released in 2015.</p>
<p>With a lot of variety on the parts available to build you ships, it's a little like snapping together LEGO. If you love space combat and building, it's one to check out. Quite amazing to see it still continue to be updated this long after release. As on June 24th here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Tactical 2D RPG &#39;Arcadian Atlas&#39; has a new trailer, releasing in 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If the big upcoming update to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/into-the-breach-advanced-edition-releases-july-19th-as-a-free-update/" target="_blank">Into the Breach</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/gorgeous-turn-based-tactics-game-tyrants-blessing-releases-in-august/" target="_blank">Tyrant's Blessing</a> wasn't enough tactics for you, how about a little Arcadian Atlas. Another that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter with $95,204 this one definitely needs to be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>"Arcadian Atlas is a unique, narrative-driven isometric tactical RPG set in Arcadia, a nation tearing itself apart via political and familial factions, nefarious plots, treacherous alliances and clandestine intrigues just as ancient evil forces begin to awaken. With a queen willing to do anything to ascend to the throne, no one is safe."</p>
<p>You build up a party from more than 12 custom classes, with each having their own unique skill types and equipment. It's very character-driven, with the developer explaining that every action during battle will count as "just one wrong move could tear your family, its political alliances and the land itself apart for good".</p>
<p>Have a looksie at the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Low-poly 3D rail shooter Ex-Zodiac hits Early Access on July 21st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice little early birthday present for me, Ex-Zodiac is a low-poly 3D rail shooter (think like Star Fox) that now has a release date. It's going to release with Native Linux support on July 21st, following on from the successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2020.</p>
<p>With the initial release it will have 6 main stages and 6 bonus stages, which the publisher said brings "the 80's/90's nostalgia to a new level".</p>
<p>See one of the original trailers below but there's a newer sneak-peak on <a href="https://twitter.com/BenHickling/status/1539275535301353474" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style</li>
<li>12 main levels (plus secret areas and side-paths)</li>
<li>Multiple routes to complete the game</li>
<li>Major bosses at the end of each level, each piloted by a member of the Zodiac</li>
<li>A 16-bit style soundtrack by +TEK combining FM and wavetable synthesis</li>

      <title>Valve designer warns people not to put 2242 M.2 drives in their Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, one <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1539296261613944833" target="_blank">modder</a> decided to stick a bigger 2242 M.2 SSD into their Steam Deck and after many other bigger PC sites picked it up — a Valve designer has warned people not to do it.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck was designed to specifically fit the much smaller 2230 M.2 and while it appears the 2242 can work, this appears to be a case of being so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. <em>To completely pinch a quote from Jurassic Park.</em></p>
<p>Designer Lawrence Yang said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1540809830000013313" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__nly0s773drk" lang="en">Hi, please don’t do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved. In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for. This mod may appear to work but will significantly shorten the life of your Deck.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The modder <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1541160087900901376" target="_blank">replied</a> to agree too.</em></p>
<p>Remember, Valve did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/get-a-look-inside-the-steam-deck-in-valves-latest-video/" target="_blank">their own</a> teardown of the device but repeatedly told people to leave things to the professionals. However, they also teamed up with iFixit to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">offer spare parts</a> too.</p>
<p>Best to stick to the smaller 2230 series if you really wish to open it up and put a bigger one in, <em>or</em> just put in a good Micro SD that works well and still loads everything quickly. Don't go following every crazy idea you see online, even when big sites report on it.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells gets a huge free accessibility upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells is a great game. Not only does it look great but the action is awesome. However, it is rather difficult and for some nearly impossible so the developers have put out a huge free upgrade to help more people play it.</p>
<p>A rather admirable update really, as accessibility should never be looked down upon and during their testing the developer said they received "pretty much zero negative feedback on the general options that we're introducing". However their new Assist Mode that gives multiple lives, auto-hitting and adjustable trap damage did receive community "pushback". Addressing that in an update they made it clear the whole point is to "let people to enjoy the game who would otherwise be excluded from doing so" and it's entirely optional.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Loads of new options to improve accessibility, such as adjustable font type &amp; size, input customisation and individual adjustment of sound effect volumes</li>
<li>Assist Mode including customisation of enemy health/damage, trap speed/damage and parry window. Plus options for multiple lives, auto-hit with primary weapon &amp; full map reveal</li>
<li>Big reduction in cell cost of early-game weapons</li>
<li>7 weapon reworks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Can't wait to dive back in with all this, sounds amazing.</p>

      <title>Grim Horde is chaotic and there&#39;s a good game hiding in there</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grim Horde is a game that released into Early Access with Native Linux support and it's another fast-paced rogue-lite hell in a slightly similar way to the chaos found in Vampire Survivors only you control a horde of minions.</p>
<p>You float around as a demon lord, lead armies and crush various villages and take on the pesky people in a sort-of auto-battling way. Since you mainly just control your demon lord, your army is running around doing the damage while you're trying to avoid arrows and all sorts.</p>
<p>Once you die you rise again and keep going. It could end up as another fun little game to keep coming back to once it has been further developed but there's a good idea for a game here I'm just not entirely sure on the execution of it just yet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZM0bVNjSsI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f1410a779e92cfcdbe2bbd59624593b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZM0bVNjSsI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly rough around the edges and needs some work so I'll be keeping an eye on it.</p>

      <title>Gorgeous turn-based tactics game Tyrant&#39;s Blessing releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from their successful Kickstarter campaign, Tyrant's Blessing now has a release date and a brand new trailer and it's looking rather good. Seems like a fun blending of styles from Final Fantasy Tactics and Into the Breach! It's confirmed to be launching on August 8th with Native Linux support and there's a demo available on Steam.</p>
<p>"Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LaFT1xdd_4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eae9b67780c2e015a2fa51c32829d3b9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LaFT1xdd_4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Decide whether to fight, rescue the living from the Undying, or gather your strength. Every choice matters throughout every day of the Uprising.</li>
<li>As you fight your way across the face of Tyberia, face off against random encounters that force difficult decisions. Do you intervene and fight highwaymen, putting your warriors at risk? Do you try to save a child, risking valuable time and resources? Only your morals and ideals hold the answer.</li>
<li>Pick your heroic roster carefully. Screeg, the elder wizard advising the Uprising, can only teleport three heroes and a pet at once: Do you send your elite warriors in? Or rookies to train and hold the line? Are they up to the task? Can you handle the consequences?</li>
<li>Enlist twenty hallowed heroes, each with a distinct set of abilities that can dramatically alter the course of any battle.</li>
<li>But stay mindful: Not all heroes appear in a playthrough - and not everyone is guaranteed to make it to the finish line of this quest.</li>
<li>Pick the right team for the task. An assassin may thrive in confined spaces, while an archer will suffer in close quarters. Some heroes may even bring their pets along, who might provide just enough leverage to win a battle for the group.</li>
<li>Even if heroes fall, they can still be freed from the Tyrant's grasp. Track them down, defeat them in combat, and restore them back to their stolen life!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve continues tweaking Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh update to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and they continue focusing on Steam Input improvements, to make playing it with a controller and the Steam Deck a better experience.</p>
<p>Seems they're trying to help controller players catch up at least a tiny bit with those using a mouse, with plenty of working going into changing how gyros work. Quite a small patch overall though but it sounds like some pretty fun and welcome changes, although Gyros Akimbo does sound somewhat hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck now allows other game controllers to be connected via Steam Input. All connected controllers combine inputs. (You can play with Gyros Akimbo if you are very cool).</li>
<li>“Pitch and Roll Combined” is the new default Gyro conversion on Steam Deck. All other controllers default to “Yaw”</li>
<li>Radial menus (in particular, Quick Buy radials) no longer persist when dying.</li>
<li>Some glyph fixes in Spectator mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I did try out CS:GO on Deck myself and was tempted to video it but lets just say it was embarrassing. It's a very tough game to really get into on a controller of any sort. If you have a Deck, have you been playing CS:GO on it? Let us know what your experience has been in the comments.</p>
<p>You can play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank"> free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>With a quick script you can run Steam Deck Desktop Mode inside Gaming Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're going into ridiculous territory of tweaking now and the possibilities are seemingly endless on what you can do with the Steam Deck. You can even run the Desktop Mode inside of Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uddyat/desktop_mode_within_gaming_mode/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a>, the script is pretty simple and only needs you to add the commands into a text file, set it as executable and add it to Steam as a Non-Steam game. From there, you can launch and switch between desktop mode and games running in the background and it actually works. It's far from perfect with some issues where the desktop mode may freeze up so you need to quit it with certain games, and sometimes the mouse won't go to the very bottom but hey — this is the kind of awesome stuff you can do with Linux right?</p>
<p>Here's a brief demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3uJeqafjwsc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dfa99ec6e4a2899d865f1a40f46e2dcc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3uJeqafjwsc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Love it. If you try it, don't blame me if you break something. Just wanted to highlight something mildly amusing and also somewhat useful too.</p>

      <title>Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop devs detail their support of Proton and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/Alien_Swarm_Reactive_Drop/" target="_blank">Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop</a>, a community updated and expanded version of the free Alien Swarm originally by Valve continues to see lots of improvements. The developers also explained their clear support of Linux with Proton and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Released by Valve originally in 2010, Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop continues the much lesser-known Valve title with an impressive set of extras. It doesn't have Native Linux support like other Valve titles and the Reactive Drop Team has explained it likely never will due to the specific Source engine build used. However "making the game run well on Proton was and continues to be a priority" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/4932019356819234637/" target="_blank">they say</a>.</p>
<p>A bunch of improvements also came along for gamepad and Steam Deck users including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved controller navigation order on several menus.</li>
<li>Made several in-game menus including the briefing menu navigable using ControllerFocus (the red/yellow flashing border).</li>
<li>Added controller button prompts to several places, including the game instructor.</li>
<li>Redesigned some menus entirely, such as the mission selection screen.</li>
<li>Enlarged the main font size on smaller resolutions.</li>
<li>Added a new radial menu system for selecting marines with the d-pad.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said to let them know if you have problems on Linux / Steam Deck in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/4932019356819234637/" target="_blank">this thread in the forum</a>.</p>
<p>It's nice to see more developers do direct support like this. Here's a short video to show it working well:</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets Paladins working on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh upgrade for Proton Experimental on June 22nd which brings even more game compatibility to Linux desktops and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Listed as now playable as of this update includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rising of the Shield Hero: Relive The Animation</li>
<li>Paladins</li>
</ul>
<p>Paladins is an interesting one, as it was sort-of playable for a while using a few workarounds and an older version of GE-Proton but now having it in the official Proton is going to make it so much easier.</p>
<p>This update also solves Tekken 7 crashing at launch and more work has been done on video playback, with many games that previous requires special hacks in Proton no longer being required including: The Long Dark, Trailmakers, Surviving the Aftermath, Haven, TOHU, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, V Rising and more.</p>
<p>The changelog can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a> at any time.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>

<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's also a quick video overview and a short look at Paladins running on the Steam Deck. It's not perfected yet with a few issues remaining but it's starting to get there and performance seems good.</p>

      <title>AMD publishes the source code for FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As they promised they would, AMD has now officially published the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2" target="_blank">source code</a> for FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2) under an open source license. With it under the MIT license, developers can pretty much go nuts with it.</p>
<p>This tech is their newer and more advanced temporal upscaling solution, supporting the Vulkan and DirectX 12 graphics APIs, it's fully supported on Linux and works on different vendor GPUs (not just AMDs). AMD say it "uses cutting-edge temporal algorithms to reconstruct fine geometric and texture detail, producing anti-aliased output from aliased input". Developed from the ground-up, it's quite a big difference from FSR 1 to provide even better performance and clearer images. Developers can even use both since they're so different.</p>
<p>FSR 2 features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Temporal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivers similar or better than native image quality using temporal data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-aliasing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Includes high-quality anti-aliasing.
	<ul>
<li>FSR 2 replaces any TAA within the game frame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High image quality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher image quality than FSR 1 technology at all quality presets/resolutions.
	<ul>
<li>Different quality modes available.</li>
<li>Dynamic Resolution Scaling supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No machine learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does not require dedicated Machine Learning (ML) hardware.
	<ul>
<li>More platforms can benefit.</li>
<li>Gives more control to cater to a range of different scenarios.</li>
<li>Better ability to optimize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cross-platform</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boosts framerates in supported games.
	<ul>
<li>Wide range of products and platforms, both AMD and select competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cyberpunk point and click adventure Born Punk is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Born Punk is a brand new cyberpunk point and click adventure from developer Insert Disk 22. It just released on Steam on June 18th and now a Native Linux version is also available. Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign, it's nice to see a trickle of games still coming from the crowdfunding platform.</p>
<p>"In Born Punk, the player slips into the role of three people (well, two people, depending on your stance on artificial lifeforms) living on the island: Eevi, a corporate combat hacker turned bartender down on her luck; Mariposa, the CEO of Bornholm's biggest corporation; and a malfunctioning android who calls himself Grandmaster Flashdrive.</p>
<p>The three characters have one thing in common: they all, one after another, get possessed by strange entities of unknown origin and even less known intentions. They must work together - and sometimes against each other - to find out of the nature of those beings, what they want, and why they seem to think that their 'mission' is of vital importance for the future of humanity."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cBJ5mo_rDTk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64100af9ee33066cb1850240479715f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cBJ5mo_rDTk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A classic point-and-click adventure experience:</strong> we're very proud to feature our own distinct style, but we are also definitely influenced by games like Monkey Island or Beneath a Steel Sky and try to please both veteran afficionados of the genre and newcomers alike with a traditional pixel-art appearance and a streamlined, modern approach to game design</li>
<li><strong>Movement everywhere:</strong> you won't feel like you're walking through a still life painting; Born Punk's world is alive and full of animation, soundscapes and small details to discover</li>
<li><strong>Choices and consequences:</strong> often, it's possible to approach dialogues and puzzles from different angles. As a result, interactions and dialogues with other characters, the difficulty to overcome certain obstacles, and the results of many actions will vary greatly depending on what the player chooses to do</li>
<li><strong>Full voice-overs:</strong> every character in Born Punk and every line is voiced by professional voice actors. Yes, that includes the cat.</li>
<li><strong>Bombastic music:</strong> the main theme and various other tracks are composed by Jeff Kurtenacker, composer of Wildstar and choral arranger of World of Warcraft. Jeff is joined by a merry band of synthwave musicians to create a genuine and emotional cyberpunk/sci-fi soundtrack with a Nordic twist</li>
<li><strong>Let's be serious, it's funny:</strong> Born Punk is science-fiction with heavy cyberpunk influences; but we're also boasting a hopeful, often humorous undertone. Point &amp; click adventures without at least a bit of humour are unthinkable to us!</li>
<li><strong>A comprehensive universe:</strong> there's a slew of background info to read and experience, all of which becomes available in your PDA as you interact with the game world. Sometimes, in-game lore will also serve as an optional gameplay mechanic.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets a surprise update fixing many problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Valve are getting back into fixing up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, which has been a long-time coming and after fans have been campaigning to get Valve to do something.</p>
<p>TF2 has had so many problems with bots over the last year or two, that it became largely unplayable most often as bots would just repeatedly ruin games. There were other issues but that was the biggest. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/valve-say-they-will-look-into-fixing-up-the-bot-problems-in-team-fortress-2/" target="_blank">Valve said back in May</a> they were listening and would do something about it.</p>
<p>On June 21st a fresh update was released that fixed quite a few exploits like being able to clear the in-game text chat and players could use cheats on secure servers amongst other annoyances. There's various bug fixes too like projectiles sometimes colliding with teammates too early / late and the Spy using the incorrect weapons when disguised.</p>
<p>Another addition in this patch is an updated voting system that should also help that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both teams can have a kick vote running at the same time</li>
<li>Can have a global vote running at the same time as a kick vote</li>
<li>Fixed sometimes not being able to vote on maps at the end of the round</li>
</ul>
<p>Really great to see Valve giving TF2 some love. It remains as one of the most popular games available on Steam and it appears this patch has bumped the player numbers up once again.</p>

      <title>Inscryption from Daniel Mullins Games now supported on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The mixture of a deckbuilding roguelike with escape-room style puzzles and psychological horror in Inscryption is now officially available for Linux with a Native build. Developed by Daniel Mullins Games and published by Devolver Digital, this very popular and well-reviewed game originally released back in October 2021.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the developer noted that while working on the Linux (and macOS) ports that they "came across some issues that have existed in the Windows version since Kaycee's Mod" so thanks to the porting work the game will be improving for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WDAJ10sjpPI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/856b0175cdbdf8372ac9250eb50eb631.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WDAJ10sjpPI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creator of Pony Island and The Hex comes the latest mind melting, self-destructing love letter to video games. Inscryption is an inky black card-based odyssey that blends the deckbuilding roguelike, escape-room style puzzles, and psychological horror into a blood-laced smoothie. Darker still are the secrets inscrybed upon the cards...</p>
<p>In Inscryption you will...</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire a deck of woodland creature cards by draft, surgery, and self mutilation</li>
<li>Unlock the secrets lurking behind the walls of Leshy's cabin</li>
<li>Embark on an unexpected and deeply disturbing odyssey</li>
</ul>

      <title>Meet me at NooN is a sweet new puzzler with time-loop mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Meet me at NooN is the first game from the duo at Pandaroo Interactive and quite an impressive entry to the puzzle genre.</p>
<p>In the game you control two spirits that create time loops of their day. So each move you do is recorded and played back, while you're controlling the other. It's pretty fun to see in action and while simple, quite an enjoyable little experience to watch and learn and go through the levels. The good thing is that this is a game with no pressure. There's no way to actually lose and no timers so you go at your own pace. If you go wrong you can just adjust the timeline and go back.</p>

      <title>RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent gets a great looking roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a pixel-art RTS that resembles some of the classics like Age of Empires. It's currently in Early Access with Native Linux support and their new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1674820/view/5967847045493589913" target="_blank">roadmap</a> looks great.</p>
<p>Inspired by real history of the Near East Bronze Age era, TFC utilizes classic RTS elements while offering a unique perspective for the genre. One big change is how Food is not just used for building up your army but also changes how your population grows, and how quickly you can gain Knowledge Points to do research. It's a very interesting system that feels quite different to others like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z6qLkWwHx4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02477f4d339ac25c54e11aec5b3f3e1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z6qLkWwHx4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their new roadmap shows that across this year they plan to add in more single-player skirmish options, the ability to play against AI with friends online, an online co-op horde mode, neutral settlements, hotkey customization and unit stances. That's only for this year. Next year they have some other big updates planned too like new civilizations, new technologies, new map types like oceans and rivers, multiplayer matchmaking and more.</p>
<p>All sounding pretty great and it's easily worth playing right now.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the awesome GZDoom game engine, Hands of Necromancy looks like another solid choice for those of you (like me!) who absolutely love retro shooters. Made in the spirit of the classics like Heretic, Hexen, Doom and Quake it does look pretty good.</p>
<p>"You are a Necromancer: a lone sorcerer who seeks to grow ever more powerful and learn new forms of dark magic. You search for challengers to fight, so you can hone your wicked craft. You destroy many monsters and wild creatures, yet none of them seem truly worth the fight...</p>
<p>However, one day, suddenly more creatures entering your world. You know something bad is happening, but maybe this is an opportunity to prove your might and show the world that you are the truly fearsome mage you always knew yourself to be."</p>

<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore many beautiful environments - a country side, a forest, a cemetery, a castle, an ice cave, a volcano, and more - all teeming with danger to prove yourself against, as their denizens try to destroy you.</li>
<li>Get weapons, use magic spells, and learn transformations to fight your enemies, using their own abilities against them and bending nature to your own will.</li>
<li>Use the Tornado Spell to toss your enemies away with wind, or the Ring of Ice to freeze them solid, or even an Unholy Hand Grenade to blow them to smithereens!</li>
<li>Gain transformations as you grow in power - become the Swamp Serpent who can slither into tight spaces while breathing underwater, or the Stone Breaker Golem that smashes walls into tiny bits, the Hell Burner Demon that safely walks on lava, or even a flying Wyvern!</li>
<li>All of them are your key to defeating the many creatures in this metroidvania, as you explore the 21 maps in 3 giant and exciting hubs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>3,500 games now Steam Deck Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great milestone has been hit for the Steam Deck, with Valve's popular Linux-powered handheld now having 3,500 games rated as either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Back on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/new-steam-deck-verified-titles-now-over-3200-playable/" target="_blank">June 7th</a> it only just hit 3,200 so the rate continues at a nice steady pace. As a reminder though, Deck Verified is just the formal verification system. Plenty of games that haven't been tested work just fine, and some that are listed as Unsupported also work fine (or can do with one or two tweaks). You also have access to emulation and retro gaming, external launchers and much more. The Steam Deck is incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>The numbers right now at time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified: 1755</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable: 1803</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported: 1505</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some recently fully Verified games include:</p>

      <title>Erannorth Chronicles gets fixed up for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Erannorth Chronicles, what the developer says blends together an old-school card game with tabletop RPG-like progression recently had an upgrade to make it work nicely on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A game all about freedom, with some pretty deep mechanics allowing you to build up your character and your deck of cards while you explore a giant sandbox world with many different locations, challenges, and treasure hunts. There's no big story to follow, so the game is very much what you make of it. The intention from the developer appears to be giving you a big playground to have a run through and see what you can create and conquer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828555721655815984gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828555721655815984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently tagged as Unsupported by Valve on the Steam Deck, a new release went up on June 12th aiming to fix up some issues so hopefully this will bump it up to at least Playable officially.</p>
<p>Here's what they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a check if the game is running in Steam Deck to set the resolution to 1280x720 instead of 1280x800. As the game only supports that.</li>
<li>Settings for the Steam Deck will be stored in a separate file. The corresponding settings will load based on whether you are running the game on Steam Deck or your PC.</li>
<li>The split effect wasn't displaying in the non-Damage cards, which could be confusing as to why it appears if a Damage effect was added to them.</li>
<li>Chaotic effect in Split cards didn't have a visual indication that its damage would Split. It will now display both elements.</li>
<li>Updated Unity to v2021.3.4.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Looks like Valve are gearing up for a new &#39;Deckard&#39; VR Headset</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've sort-of known for a while that Valve were working towards a next-generation VR headset to succeed the Valve Index and we've now seen a lot more supporting evidence that it's getting closer.</p>
<p>Plenty of this is thanks to the tireless work of XR Hardware Analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley" target="_blank">Brad Lynch</a>, who had been keeping an eye out for anything interesting that pops up. The codename of the device appears to be "Deckard", and a lot of the information is actually thanks to SteamDB who constantly track updates to Steam code on their <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-SteamVR" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where you can see a lot of the text strings being added in preparation.</p>
<p>You can see Lynch go over plenty of the leaked info in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ovlbXVwoN8s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a31ac79f35ae73506de165abfa36c975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ovlbXVwoN8s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a huge fan of the Valve Index, which I took a look at some time ago, the idea that we might be able to play without wires hooked up to a PC is thoroughly exciting. Even more exciting, is that it's quite likely in any standalone mode that it would use Linux, which is again a good reason for Valve to continue working on Proton outside of the use on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Then there's also the <a href="https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20220187609&amp;IDKey=62CCF93BD70F" target="_blank">recent Patent</a>, which shows off a possible new design of Valve's upcoming VR headset. The patent was filed in December 2021, and went public on June 16 2022. The patent is focused more on the fitting with the strap system, rather than going into technical details on how it will function. Still, we do get a little hint as to what it may have with the patent mentioning "the rear housing may house wireless transceivers, a battery, microphones, input/output devices, processors" and it also mentions the front may have "antenna(s)" and a few other references that do indicate wireless play.</p>
<p>Obviously it's not a confirmation that one will actually be released but still fun to see and clearly Valve are working on something big.</p>

      <title>Missed your Steam Deck email? Valve confirms a grace period to still get one</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Given how busy some of us are, it can still be quite easy to miss that Steam Deck email coming in to make your purchase through the reservation system. The good news is, you do actually have a few extra days after the timer is up.</p>
<p>The way the system works is that you put down a reservation (only one per Steam account at a time), and <em>eventually</em> you get the chance to buy a Steam Deck. This has helped against scalpers buying them all up and allow Valve to have time to produce enough. Once you get your final purchase email, you have about 72 hours to actually pay for it otherwise it's supposed to go onto the next person in the queue. The purchase email even clearly says " If you don't complete your purchase by this time, we will automatically cancel your reservation.".</p>
<p>However, Valve has now officially <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1538949772010086400" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that's <em>not</em> quite the case.</p>
<p>If you do <em>miss</em> that window of opportunity to buy your Steam Deck, there "is a grace period of a few days" where you can reach out to Steam Support who will hook you up. All you need to do is go to the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamDeck" target="_blank">support page</a>, and hit "Contact Steam Support".</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve are giving people more than one opportunity to ensure they get their Deck.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 17: The Llama Master</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-16-we-are-all-doomed/" target="_blank">Part 16: We Are All Doomed</a></strong></p>
<p>While first person shooters dominated the Linux gaming scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was still more than a place for the venerable strategy genre; it should be remembered that the first game Loki Software ported over to Linux was the then latest iteration in the <em>Civilization</em> series. From this foundation other strategy titles soon followed, with Ubi Soft entering the fray thanks to the work of Linux friendly Philos Laboratories.</p>
<p><em>Theocracy </em>is a mix of real time and turn based strategy that sees you leading an Aztec tribe in the century leading up to the arrival of Hernán Cortés, with the ultimate goal being an alternate history scenario where the Aztecs are able to fend off the Spanish conquistadors. Beyond this the game is fantastical, inventing tribes, magical sects, fabled heroes, and featuring a whole host of fauna alien to Mesoamerica, including dragons, llamas, chickens, and the most inaccurate, pigs.</p>
<p>The game overall has an admirable depth of well crafted lore only brought down by the Hungarian developer's occasional lapse into broken English; the worst offender being the use of the word "Wary" to mean belligerent in the Diplomacy Panel. The narrator for the tutorial and scenario briefings also has a way with words that can be at best described as memorable, with his use of the phrase "llama masters can be educated in the llama lair" being a particular earworm. </p>
<p>Unlike with games from Loki Software or similar porting houses, Philos Laboratories bundled the Linux version alongside the Windows retail release, making <em>Theocracy</em> that much easier to track down. On the first CD-ROM you can find a directory containing a text based linux.inst installer, which sets the file paths and copies over the relevant data files. From there the game can be ran using the /usr/games/theocracy binary as long as the second disc is mounted.</p>
<p>The Linux version demands the game be launched at 16 bit colour depth and shows at a fixed 800x600 resolution, either in windowed mode or borderless fullscreen. Cutscenes meanwhile are displayed at 640x480 without any kind of scaling. The option for grabbing the mouse inside the game window only applies while in Province View, and I was unable to have the game recognize the keyboard from Blackbox, forcing me to play <em>Theocracy</em> from Gnome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376340911655670281gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/376340911655670281gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10974161811655690882gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10974161811655690882gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Released in March 2000 with a historical theme and similar art style, <em>Theocracy</em> was most often compared to and was largely overshadowed by <em>Age of Empires</em>, even though they are very different games. In terms of my tactics I actually found more in common with Infinity Engine titles such as <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and <em>Icewind Dale</em>, with the emphasis on choke points, crowd control, magical buffing, experience leveling, and war party formation while in combat.</p>
<p>I do not think I ever won a battle by outnumbering the opposing army; instead, most of my success came from causing the enemy troops to trip over themselves, often aided by the game's ropy path finding. The sheer scale of the rival forces and the lack of difficulty modes make <em>Theocracy</em> more intimidating than it needs to be, but with effort I was able to defeat both the Iztahuacans and Teotitlans in 30 years in-game and had a close to clear run to the Spanish.</p>
<p>In the end it was not the game's difficulty that felled me, but an unfortunate bug. Upon exceeding 52 saved games from the same campaign <em>Theocracy</em> will start corrupting your save files, a laughable ceiling given how much trial and error is required to progress through the game. Some have reported being able to get past this point by correcting the number overflows in the save file using a hex editor, but I have not managed this feat myself at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Apart from this though <em>Theocracy</em> only froze for me once, although the performance at times left something to be desired. Despite the boast on the back of the box of "an amazing game engine" that can display "up to 50000 units on the screen without any slowdown", the game would still lag even with my hardware exceeding the recommended specifications. This was even worse under Windows 98, with the Linux version running noticeably smoother.</p>
<p>All of these things can make <em>Theocracy</em> feel as if it has been lost to time, much like the Aztecs themselves. There has been some success in getting the game running in a dedicated X session on later versions of Linux, but few games benefit from having access to retro hardware as much as this. I still have unfinished business with <em>Theocracy</em>, and I am not waving the white flag just yet, but for now I am in the mood for something lighter, and much less time consuming.</p>

      <title>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved on Steam Deck is absolutely awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved on Steam Deck, a classic from back in the Xbox 360 days has a version on Steam and it works so beautifully on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is a true bit of nostalgia hitting for me, as I continue to put hour after hour into various games on Steam Deck, I keep coming back to the classics. Geometry Wars was originally a mini-game in Project Gotham Racing 2 it was later turned into Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved as a standalone title and went onto become one of the most downloaded Xbox Live Arcade games.</p>
<p>Once again thanks to Steam Play Proton, it works out of the box as a Deck Verified title. You only need to go into the settings and put it to the correct resolution — and then dive in for many hours of blasting away various shapes with a good 6 hours easily on the battery life with it at 60FPS. It look simply amazing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r9FcR1i5WnQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba13fc019c9c035343fb23bdec83ae68.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r9FcR1i5WnQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This to me, really shows how incredibly the Steam Deck is. Not only will it play some of the latest AAA games (although often in lower visuals and 30/40 FPS), you can emulate tons of other systems but also get back into classics like this that you can enjoy wherever you are.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/8400/Geometry_Wars_Retro_Evolved/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Westwood classic RPG &#39;Nox&#39; lives on with the OpenNox game engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Westwood Studios made quite a lot of games like Dune II and the Command &amp; Conquer series but they also made an RPG called Nox, that now lives on with the <a href="https://github.com/noxworld-dev/opennox" target="_blank">OpenNox</a> game engine. OpenNox just recently had a new release, and the project is now open source too under the GPL!</p>
<p>Released originally in the year 2000, Nox was received very well by the gaming press at the time and lives on in the hearts of many gamers. Thankfully now though, OpenNox gives you a fresh way to play it on modern platforms like Linux and Windows. OpenNox is a fully-featured game engine reimplementation too supporting the original features plus plenty of enhancements including: improving modding support, higher resolutions, much better online play and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12232063751655724692gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12232063751655724692gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like other open source reimplementations, it does not include copyrighted assets and so you do need to own a copy of the game to play it which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/nox" target="_blank">buy on GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton and Wine updater ProtonUp-Qt now shows anti-cheat status</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another update to the free and open source app <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> giving you a proper user interface for downloading GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda, Wine-GE and others for Steam Deck and Linux. It works with Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and Lutris.</p>
<p>Version 2.6.5 brings the ability to see the anti-cheat status in the game list you can open. A pretty useful little addition, since a previous version also added showing Steam Deck compatibility too so now you can get it together all in one list. Additionally this update will also show what games using Lutris too in the compatibility info.</p>

      <title>Microsoft chucks GNOME $10,000 from their FOSS Fund</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everyone knows that Microsoft absolutely loves Linux right? Well, that's debatable but hey they did just reach down the back of the sofa and chuck GNOME some cash.</p>
<p>As part of their ongoing <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund" target="_blank">Free and Open Source Software Fund</a> (FOSS Fund for short), part of their Microsoft Open Source Programs Office, Microsoft engineers participate in selecting various projects they feel could benefit from a little extra help. No strings attached, no big fancy marketing of Microsoft trying to do something nefarious, just Microsoft workers voting to give out some money to free and open source projects they find interesting.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago it was announced that GNOME was the latest winner of $10,000. Previous winners include systemd, OpenStreetMap, QEMU and various others.</p>
<p>Every month they start a new selection process, which results in a new project getting the $10,000 bonus which is usually paid in 10 monthly installments of $1,000. There's only a few requirements to be considered including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The open source project must be used by Microsoft.</li>
<li>Project is actively prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion.</li>
<li>The project must have an <a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank">OSI-approved open source license</a></li>
<li>Needs to have a way to receive funds that our procurement and legal teams are happy with (<a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is great!)</li>
<li>the project cannot be owned by a Microsoft employee</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a side-note, it's quite interesting to see that even Microsoft see the OSI as the go-to for proper open source licenses.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II reimplementation gets big audio improvements and AI speedup</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine reimplementation, fheroes2, has another great new release out continuing to be the absolute best way to play this classic on modern platforms.</p>
<p>The developer emailed in to let us know about some big changes. Firstly, it's had a huge overhaul to the audio code. Not only will it properly resume audio from where it was stopped (like the original game), it will also now update the surrounding sounds on the map on every step on the hero. Plus fixes to some incorrect sounds and rocks in water with seagulls now have their own sound. On top of that, a 3D Audio feature was added for objects on the map to give it a whole new depth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11426023961655719942gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11426023961655719942gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>AI is now smarter (yes, again!) and even faster at calculations than before making the whole game feel smoother and play better.</p>
<p>New Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduce music resuming while switching tracks for MP3, FLAC and OGG music formats</li>
<li>Add 3D audio option for objects on Adventure Map</li>
<li>Fix all map lose / win conditions and make AI be aware of them</li>
<li>Add Campaign High Scores</li>
<li>Improve German, Polish, Ukrainian, Romanian translations and add Belarusian, Spanish and Swedish translations</li>
<li>Speed up AI by average 10%</li>
<li>Fix rendering of Red Tower of Sorceress castle</li>
<li>Rework "No interface" option</li>
<li>Over <em><strong>40</strong></em> bugs are fixed since 0.9.15 release</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to download on <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You do also need to grab the data from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <title>The Cycle: Frontier works nicely on Steam Deck and Linux desktops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Initially an Epic Store exclusive, you can now play The Cycle: Frontier free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/868270/The_Cycle_Frontier/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and thanks to Proton — on Steam Deck and Linux desktops.</p>
<p>An interesting point about this game, is that it uses BattlEye but it appears the developer has it fully online for Linux. You only need to ensure you install the "Proton BattlEye Runtime" in your Steam Library and then it will just work with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">latest Proton 7.0-3 release</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? A mixture of player versus player first-person combat, with it blending in environmental dangers from various creatures and a big storm too. The idea is that you jump in solo or with a crew, loot away and do missions and attempt extraction whenever you want to keep your goods or die trying and lose a bunch. It's a lot of fun actually and while not perfect, the developer seems to have a clear plan to keep improving it and it's already one of the most popular games on Steam.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it on both Steam Deck and my Fedora 36 desktop:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck back to being the global top seller (by revenue) on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a brief stint at number 2 thanks to the popularity of V Rising, the Steam Deck has moved firmly back into place at number 1 on the top sellers list.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> tracking it, we can see that the Steam Deck has been the top seller by revenue for the last 3 weeks. We don't know how many units that is though, since Valve don't allow anyone to see. This means that overall, the Steam Deck has been at least number 1 or number 2 on the global top sellers for around <u>15</u> weeks now.</p>
<p>While we don't know the number, we know it's going to be quite high. When you take into account that V Rising hit over 1.5 million sales, Elden Ring still sits in the top-ten and has sold multiple million and…you get the idea. While the Steam Deck costs a lot more, it still means it has sold quite a lot. So the Steam Deck is very much a <strong>big</strong> success for Valve overall.</p>
<p><em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Faster Zombies to Steam Deck: The History of Valve and Linux Gaming</a></em></p>
<p>It quickly became my own number 1 way to play games. The convenience of it is just simply amazing. I fully expect it to continue flicking between number 1 and 2 for another year yet, which will depend on what big releases appear on Steam to push it down momentarily.</p>

      <title>Arthurian legend merged with sci-fi horror, The Hand of Merlin is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another turn-based RPG with some rogue-lite mechanics, with the addition of a pretty strange storyline? The Hand of Merlin is out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The Hand of Merlin is a turn-based rogue-lite RPG in which Arthurian legend clashes with dark and foreboding sci-fi horror. This unusual merging of genres introduces a wholly unique sci-fi element to its storytelling. Utilizing both squad-based and turn-based combat, players can employ tactical cunning to use cover, set up ambushes and coordinate attacks with ranged, melee and spell-casting combat to conquer both human and unworldly abhorrent creatures and other enemy characters they encounter on their quest.</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Throughout Early Access we’ve committed a lot of time and energy into community feedback with a series of updates that have really embellished the games features and replayability based upon what the community was telling us, we’re extremely pleased with the results and the work the team has done to make The Hand of Merlin a truly competitive rogue-lite RPG.“ Said Robert Sajko Creative Director at Room C Games.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-hand-of-merlin?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/600610/The_Hand_of_Merlin/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE arrives on Steam — plus it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE has officially landed on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the good news is that it works on Linux plus it's Steam Deck Verified. Seems Valve were well aware to get it Deck Verified status right away, looks like we know why <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-3 released recently then</a>!</p>
<p>You know the Steam Deck is getting noticed, and clearly <em>important</em> to the gaming industry, when the Final Fantasy VII series Executive Produce at Square Enix mentions it directly in the 25th Anniversary Celebration video that you can see below. I think the importance of moments like that cannot be overstated. The Steam Deck mention is at about 3:40.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wohQiEysqIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9184c75108971fa4977a83531f04ede1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wohQiEysqIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a big one, and one I was hoping to eventually play personally, I decided to dive in and take a quick look. Since it's Steam Deck Verified, every part of it <em>should</em> work well but that does depend on how thorough the verification system is, for such an expansive game.</p>
<p>Here's a fresh video for you (personal purchase from <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="okmu4ra0f1I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8de22a1d2522cd3e38d869c7101eb133.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/okmu4ra0f1I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the Steam page this is what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE contains the following content:<br/>
- FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE full game<br/>
- DLC "FF7R EPISODE INTERmission" (New episode featuring Yuffie Kisaragi)<br/>
- Weapon: Cacstar<br/>
- Armor: Midgar Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Shinra Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Corneo Armlet<br/>
- Accessory: Superstar Belt<br/>
- Accessory: Mako Crystal<br/>
- Accessory: Seraphic Earrings<br/>
- Summon materia: Carbuncle<br/>
- Summon materia: Chocobo Chick<br/>
- Summon materia: Cactuar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now. <em>You save a little extra if you're a Humble Choice sub too.</em></p>
<p>The next game in the series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, is confirmed for 2024 but will be exclusive to the PS5. Well, for now anyway, eventually it's likely to come to Steam just like other PlayStation games have been. Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion, a remake of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 for PSP, is also confirmed to be coming to Steam "this Winter".</p>
<p>Oh and if you missed it, we're even getting Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817070/Marvels_SpiderMan_Remastered/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in August. So hopefully Proton will be ready for that too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An absolute gem of a game this and now perhaps a good time to go back and spend some proper time with it, as the rather large The Sunken Sea update is out now.</p>
<p>Blending elements and a feel of the likes of Minecraft, Terraria and more it's a great underground exploration and crafting game that's currently in Early Access. It continues to do well after selling 500K in two weeks.</p>
<p>The new biome can be accessed once you've defeated the first three bosses, which brings down the wall that separates the sections of the game. There's also the sub-biome Forlorn Metropolis, a new boss, a new side-boss, 5 new enemies, a fishing merchant, boats, a new workbench type, portals you can craft for teleporting around, 10 new weapons including a bow, new food and fish types and lots more. Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wrQNpT6QNQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22c933b365cc37743f1ced94584f366d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wrQNpT6QNQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking forward to digging more into this one. Works great on desktop Linux and Steam Deck with the Native Linux build that's Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Epic Online Services gets free cross-play tooling that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games just announced a <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-online-services-release-free-pc-crossplay-tools?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank">big upgrade</a> to Epic Online Services, which will now include a full toolkit to enable developers to do cross-play.</p>
<p>Currently, the initial release of the new tools in the EOS SDK supports "PC" (they mean Windows), but they fully plan to support Linux and macOS as well. They already support Epic and Steam directly with more stores coming and consoles / mobile support coming later. EOS includes a special overlay (like the Steam Overlay) that brings together Steam and Epic friends and all the integration into a single list.</p>
<p>For game developers, this sounds thoroughly useful.</p>
<p>What it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All friends, one place.</strong> Steam and Epic Games Store friends merge into one overlay allowing players to see all friends in a single list.</li>
<li>Integrated game invites. In-game, players can search and send invites to friends across Steam and the Epic Games Store, making connecting and playing together easy.</li>
<li><strong>Account linking.</strong> Onboarding without emails or password prompts. With just a few clicks, Steam players can jump into a game while an Epic Games account is created under the hood for their Steam account.</li>
<li><strong>Update-free improvements.</strong> When games are installed, the crossplay features are distributed via a self-updating in-game overlay. Players can enjoy new features and improvements without needing to update anything themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-and-play SDK.</strong> Each Epic Online Services toolset is self-contained, so developers can mix and match the services they want to implement, incorporate the things they want, and leave the rest. Crossplay tools are no different.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully people will use this over Vivox, which still doesn't support Linux and can be quite problematic with Proton too. Even if you don't particularly like the Epic Games Store, what they offer with Epic Online Services seems pretty great.</p>

      <title>Starship Troopers: Terran Command on Steam Deck and Linux — a quick guide</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Terran Command [<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>] just released from The Artistocrats and Slitherine Ltd. but getting it on running on Linux desktop or Steam Deck requires a few steps. Video steps at the bottom if you prefer that.</p>
<p>Technically, on a Linux desktop it works out of the box with Proton but the videos don't play. For both Steam Deck and Linux you will need the community made GE-Proton. To grab GE-Proton you can use <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, which I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">a previous tutorial on</a>. No doubt an official Proton update will come to help but this will get you going right now.</p>
<p>Once you have ProtonUp-Qt and then use it to download GE-Proton, set the game to use GE-Proton in the Compatibility menu in the Properties (restart Steam for it to show up). On Desktop:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you will need to add this as a launch option otherwise while the videos play they don't look right at all:</p>
<p><code>WINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>To do the launch option, it's in the Properties menu of your game on Steam. On Desktop simply right click -&gt; Properties and then enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11181144691655404269gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11181144691655404269gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck. Pick the game in your Library, go to the Cog icon on the right and go to Properties and enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An extra fix needed for the <u>Steam Deck</u> specifically, is to have the launcher close when you hit play. Otherwise you just get a black screen! Find the "Launcher.exe.config" file in your installed folder, open it with a text editor and line 76 will have this:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="false"</code></p>
<p>Change it to:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="true"</code></p>
<p>Now it will work properly on Steam Deck too. Another case of a random launcher being a nuisance.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An immersive storyline campaign featuring unique missions, characters and a lot of Starship Troopers flavor.</li>
<li>Dozens of unique unit types, each with their own special abilities.</li>
<li>Terrain elevation, True Line of Sight &amp; True Line of Fire provide deep tactical gameplay.</li>
<li>Capture and hold vital radio stations, construct base defenses to repel Arachnid attacks and deploy technology buildings to unlock new weaponry.</li>
<li>Heroics, explosions, gore, and Bugs. Lots of Bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the game, so far it seems reasonably good. I love the attempt to capture to cheesiness from the original movie. We don't talk about the two sequels.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dudes! Beat &#39;em up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get punched with nostalgia and eat some pizza? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is officially out now along with Native Linux support and it's looking good on desktop and a Steam Deck too. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge features groundbreaking gameplay rooted in timeless classic brawling mechanics, brought to you by the beat ’em up experts at Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4) and Tribute Games. Bash your way through gorgeous pixel art environments and slay tons of hellacious enemies with your favorite Turtle, each with his own skills and moves - making each run unique! Choose a fighter, use radical combos to defeat your opponents and experience intense combats loaded with breathtaking action and outrageous ninja abilities. Stay sharp as you face off against Shredder and his faithful Foot Clan alone, or grab your best buds and play with up to 6 players simultaneously!"</p>
<p>This is basically a massive homage to classic beat 'em ups, TMNT, old cartoons and retro gaming all in one and I firmly welcome it. It's absolutely gorgeous but wow it will make your thumbs ache. That intro video as well, wow, what memories from my childhood! Launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ozKsDzumb0c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d95df53e619596267131012c5405d57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ozKsDzumb0c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconic 80s inspired retro Turtles brawling action on modern platforms </li>
<li>Six player local &amp; online co-op, featuring April O’Neil and Casey Jones’ playable debut in a TMNT beat-em-up</li>
<li>Attributes, moves and animations tailored to each fighter, channeling their personality and granting a unique edge in battle</li>
<li>Gorgeous pixel renders of signature locales like Dimension X, Coney Island and more</li>
<li>Absolutely bangin’ OST composed by Tee Lopes featuring cultural icons Ghostface Killah and Raekwon</li>
<li>Expertly crafted platform brawler gameplay from the teams who brought you <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> and <em>Panzer Paladin</em></li>
<li>Bodacious replayability from the challenge to master all seven characters with gameplay that makes each run feel totally radical</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it's a beat 'em up, there's quite a lot of moves to learn. As you first get into the game, there's 21 animated in-game slides of various moves to learn. Naturally you can't be expected to learn them all right away but a good bit of button-bashing is often all your need to make your way through and enjoy these types of games. Thankfully, you can access to move list from the pause menu at any point.</p>
<p>Want to see how great it is on Steam Deck? Check it out below:</p>

      <title>The Frogs will take you through a humorous renaissance artwork adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making use of public domain renaissance artwork, The Frogs is an upcoming comedy point and click adventure. A demo is available and now they're on Kickstarter. Very similar in style to what was done with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/04/the-procession-to-calvary-is-a-brilliantly-funny-adventure-of-renaissance-paintings-stitched-together" target="_blank">The Procession to Calvary</a> (different developer), and actually inspired by it. More of this sounds great because it's such a unique way to make a game.</p>
<p>"Join Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, ecstasy, and (most importantly) theater on a journey to Athens and subsequently the underworld in a comedic romp that pays homage to Aristophanes and his brilliant work, The Frogs! Over 15 hours of snark, satire and absurdity await as Dionysus must solve puzzles, convince people that he is a fun drunk and not just annoying, and find a replacement for the horrible poets and playwrights that are plaguing his festivals."</p>

<p>Just recently it went live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1792467505/the-frogs" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, where they have 58 days to hit $8,500 in funding.</p>
<p>What the developer says it will feature includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Innovative Point-and-Click Interface</li>
<li>Ancient Humor Circa 405 BCE</li>
<li>Choices That Matter</li>
<li>Multiple Solutions to Puzzles</li>
<li>Renaissance Artwork</li>
<li>Classical Music</li>
<li>Hidden Optional Content</li>
<li>Tons Of Interactive Elements and NPCs</li>
<li>References So Niche You'll Wonder Why I Bothered</li>
<li>Multiple Endings Whether Aristophanes Likes It Or Not</li>
<li>What's He Gonna Do? Come Back From the Dead and Get Me?</li>
</ul>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III released for Linux with a port from Feral</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Total War: WARHAMMER III is the latest Native Linux game to officially land, with Feral Interactive once again delivering. The Linux version has the latest 1.2 update along with the hotfix from late in May.</p>
<p>WARHAMMER III plunges players into a cataclysmic power struggle between mortals and daemons with each aiming to save or exploit the power of a dying god. Featuring seven diverse playable races - including the video-game debuts of Grand Cathay and Kislev - alongside ground-breaking new features such as the Realm of Chaos campaign, eight-player multiplayer, and the customisable RPG-like Daemon Prince Legendary Lord.</p>
<p>Currently though, it seems to be the lowest rated in the series, with even Total War: WARHAMMER II regularly seeing double the amount of players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="senV4ZCKm4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c79920b934e7a6ad20ce08a66bc631e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/senV4ZCKm4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sadly, it's <em>another</em> port from Feral that has multiplayer locked per operating system. We repeatedly asked them to clarify it before release but they wouldn't say. Today at release they confirmed via <a href="https://twitter.com/feralgames/status/1537443725478985728" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our version of the game allows online multiplayer between players on the same Operating System only.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you play the Linux port from Feral, you can <em>only</em> play other Linux port players. So if you want to play friends on Windows, you will still need to use the Proton compatibility layer to run the Windows version. A pretty big sore spot for a Linux port in 2022.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Their new Linux and macOS trailer is below:</p>

      <title>The last ever game from Zachtronics releases July 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No doubt plenty of puzzle fans will be sad, as Zachtronics will be hanging up their development hat and moving on after the release of Last Call BBS. Entering Early Access on July 5th, it's technically multiple games in one.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics!</p>
<p>The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<p>This isn't some marketing gimmick either, Zach has taken up a teaching job and really is moving on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The games included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>20th Century Food Court</strong>: Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio</strong>: Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path</strong>: Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li><strong>Sawayama Solitaire</strong>: It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams</strong>: Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional</strong>: Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li><strong>HACK*MATCH</strong>: The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire</strong>: Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. Early Access will only last a couple of month to get any issues ironed-out and perhaps another mini-game before it's finally time to move on.</p>

      <title>LightSpeed Studios (Tencent) joins the Open 3D Foundation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LightSpeed Studios, owned by Tencent, has joined up with the Open 3D Foundation who oversee the <a href="https://www.o3de.org/" target="_blank">Open 3D Engine (O3DE)</a>. They've joined as a Premier Member joining the likes of Adobe, Epic Games, Microsoft, Intel and others. This means they will be giving resources to the Open 3D Foundation to further development of the Open 3D Engine.</p>
<p>On top of that though and I'm sure this will raise some eyebrows, Tencent Senior Project Manager, Lanye Wang, will join the Open 3D Foundation's Governing Board.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are very excited to join the Open 3D Foundation, especially for the opportunity to leverage the connection with all of the other members to dive deep into the graphic technologies and build a top-level open source 3D engine community,” said Lanye Wang, representing LightSpeed Studios. “We look forward to working with you.”</p>
<p>“It has been amazing to see the rapid growth of the O3D ecosystem, and we’re elated to welcome LightSpeed Studios to our community,” said Royal O’Brien, Executive Director of Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. “LightSpeed Studios has achieved a strong reputation as a leading global game developer, offering high-quality gaming experiences to hundreds of millions of users worldwide, and we are excited to collaborate with them as we enhance O3DE’s capabilities for global 3D developers.”</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher has a bug fix release AND a huge new overhaul Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two goodies for fans of the open source Heroic Games Launcher today. Those sticking with the stable release get some fixes, and those who want some fun can try out a huge new Beta.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.9" target="_blank">v2.3.9</a> stable release the developers added in some fixes for GOG games that use DOSBox and ScummVM, further increasing the compatibility as Heroic will properly handle the configuration files for them now. Always great to see!</p>
<p>Heroic <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta" target="_blank">v2.4.0</a> Beta is where the fun begins. This is a huge change to how the app looks and works. The biggest changes include a new collapsible sidebar that stays open so you get access to many quick-functions like accessing your library, store pages, settings, the wine manager, download list and download status and more. It's actually really useful and makes Heroic feel a lot better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5126101381655312855gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5126101381655312855gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3740439701655312851gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3740439701655312851gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You will also notice that the library is now unified into one list, although you can filter it per-store. Game cards will also now always show the game title and buttons for play, settings and updating.</p>
<p>Plenty of other changes like an option to change the game language if supported, a fix for GOG games using DOSBox and ScummVM (just like the stable release) and much more.</p>
<p>You can still swap it to a list if you prefer it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6425215761655313080gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6425215761655313080gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What do you think to the changes?</p>

      <title>Build cities on the back of a giant animal in The Wandering Village — coming to Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village, a city-builder set on the back of a giant animal is now confirmed to be having Native Linux support at the Early Access release. Created by Stray Fawn Studio, the same team behind Nimbatus - The Space Drone Constructor, Retimed and Niche - a genetics survival game.</p>
<p>"In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a small group of survivors seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call 'Onbu'. Become their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with the creature to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world that now surrounds you."</p>
<p>They don't have a really up to date trailer, with their Xbox reveal being their newest:</p>

<p>I spoke to the developer some time ago and they weren't sure if they were doing Linux support or not. Their plans have changed, with confirmation to me via email that it will have full Linux support including at Early Access. A Linux build is already their for their Closed Beta and they continue improving it.</p>
<p>For players interested on Steam Deck, they do have plans for gamepad / controller support on PC / Linux but that will come later in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Wilderness survival sandbox Vintage Story has a massive upgrade out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I really haven't spent enough time with because it's great, Vintage Story is a blocky survival game that's thoroughly challenging and a huge upgrade is out now. Inspired by lovecraftian horror themes, it's definitely one of the more unique open-world survival games around.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/de-jank-and-game-juice-update-1170-pre1-r322/" target="_blank">Version 1.17.0</a> is now in testing, so it's not fully released, and comes with absolutely tons that's new. A big tech overhaul too that should improve RAM use, starting a world should be twice as fast, multiple improvements to overall performance and improvements to creature AI too. Heck, there's even a fancy new water system that allows water to flow through most blocks that aren't solid.</p>
<p>New trailer is below and it's seriously impressive:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NJjifFq1NGY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b3f37c76902ca800d5e216fd58d7c49d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NJjifFq1NGY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Other new additions include lightning strikes, 200+ new blocks, big visual upgrades to the temporal storms that happen, armour can now be repaired, 300 types of shield (a 30-fold increase), more and prettier flora, new and improved fauna like the addition of brown bears, black bears, sun bears, pandas and a gazelle, deserts storms are in, bamboo and straw hats and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Vintage Story doesn't get enough credit for being such a thoroughly interesting and massive game.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/vintage-story?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://tyronx.itch.io/vintage-story" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and the <a href="http://www.vintagestory.at/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Mixing action-adventure and tower defense, Dwerve is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwerve is a bit of an odd one, blending together elements of a dungeon-crawling action adventure with tower defense and it's out now. Created by Half Human Games, they previously made the space shooter Blacksea Odyssey. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>"Dwerve is a tower defense dungeon crawler RPG where you play as a young dwarf tinkerer who adventures into a ruined kingdom and unearths the lost technologies of the ancient warsmiths: turrets and traps. These are the only weapons that can protect the dwarves from Witch-Queen Vandra and her army of bloodthirsty trolls and monstrous creatures hellbent on conquering the surface."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="02WPEagu_Yc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/17b4e8e9dcd2fd51c8919fb1beb6dfc1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/02WPEagu_Yc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A concept that isn't original (what is now?), with other games doing this mix too like Sanctum. However this is not a 3D shooter mix, instead giving you some pretty wonderful pixel-art. It blends together story-based adventuring, with real-time battles where you place down various towers wherever you want and watch as the action happens. Since you're a living character in this, you will be constantly running around.</p>
<p>Unlike more traditional tower defense games, towers and traps have a limit amount of health, so you will be repeatedly running back and forth between towers to pull them down when they're about done (or destroyed) to put them back up and continue your defence.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, plenty of it was a bit <em>too</em> slow when I initially played it and the developer has received a lot of feedback on this, to the point that they've released some patches to make it feel a little faster. Simple things like movement speed being too slow, which has been buffed up and the result is a slightly smoother feeling game now that I feel is easily worth a go if you want a slightly different take on tower defense.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15420166791655296667gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15420166791655296667gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once it really gets going, it can be surprisingly challenging too. Not only are you watching your tower health closely, but you also need to take into account the different enemy types too (some towers can't hit certain enemies) and once your towers are down — they will come for you. So it can be a little frantic to reposition your towers and get to safety. In a way, the battles feel a little like a 2D version of Orcs Must Die! somewhat.</p>
<p>I love the way it uses the area you're adventuring through in the story for the battling too. No special stages, no changing levels, you just keep exploring and place down towers whenever needed. Overall it's a pretty fun take on a mix of genres.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Tower defense combat!</strong> Build turrets and traps to fend off swarms of monsters!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Dungeon crawling!</strong> Explore a ruined kingdom brimming with hidden secrets and puzzles!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Upgrade your turrets and traps!</strong> Each has its own upgrade tree with 100+ upgrades in all!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Fight epic boss battles!</strong> Use strategy, wit, and fast reflexes to out maneuver massive monsters!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Discover powerful artifacts!</strong> Dragonfire Boots, Lionheart Shield, Gurrakk's Hammer, and more!</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Embark on an adventure!</strong> Meet friends, travel throughout the mountain, stop the Witch-Queen!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In my playthrough, the Native Linux version worked great, no obvious issues and controller support worked fine too with my current-gen Xbox pad.</p>

      <title>BeamNG.drive gets experimental Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the new 0.25 release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/284160/BeamNGdrive/" target="_blank">BeamNG.drive</a>, the developers have now put up an experimental Native Linux version for you to try and give feedback.</p>
<p>What is it? BeamNG.drive is a driving sim based on realism. They have spent a long time on their sim, along with their soft-body physics engine simulating all parts of their vehicles in real-time that they say results in "true-to-life behavior". It's a huge game on Steam, with an Overwhelmingly Positive review score from over 100,000 users.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://www.beamng.com/game/news/announce/experimental-linux-support/" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the release of 0.25 we are including <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong> support for BeamNG Linux. We know that this is something a number of you have wanted for some time, and it seems the time has come to give our players the chance to experiment with this.</p>
<p>Since this is an experimental work in progress product, we do not offer customer support for BeamNG on Linux. This product may be buggy, crashy, unstable or all of the above, but if you are a Linux enthusiast we encourage you to try it out.</p>
<p>Your feedback will be invaluable in helping us get a properly supported version of BeamNG for Linux. In case of questions, <a href="https://www.beamng.com/threads/86422/" target="_blank">please make use of this thread</a>, but make sure to read the guidelines first.</p>

      <title>Check out Striving for Light if you love endless character-building skill trees</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Striving for Light is a new Native Linux release from Igniting Spark Games, one to check out for ARPG fans who love building up crazy characters.</p>
<p>One of the unique selling points on this one is that the skill tree is ever-expanding, allowing you to just keep on going and they say it's actually "infinite". Not just that, the visuals are certainly on the different side for such an action-RPG with them all being hand-drawn and it doesn't really look like any other I've played.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T39yA5Bwhxc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/49f0b5c825c00f12ff13043d63a64c23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T39yA5Bwhxc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems to work quite well on the Steam Deck too, although the dialog text size when chatting to NPCs is a little on the small side. Apart from that it seems to run just fine and great on desktop Linux too. With it being in Early Access it's not quite finished yet, with a good few months still go for the initial year they suggested it would be there.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dive into a dark, mysterious world full of dangers</li>
<li>Everything is hand drawn</li>
<li>Explore a big variety of random generated maps</li>
<li>Unique soundtracks for each environment</li>
<li>Level up and utilise a unique random generated and infinite expanding skill tree</li>
<li>Unlock new skills and weapons</li>
<li>Endless progression system</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine manager Bottles gets a bit of a makeover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, the fantastic and fast-moving free and open source application for managing the Wine compatibility layer has a new release out with a new code-name and a refreshed look. It's such a big release internally, they're now calling the releases by Brescia instead of Trento. So, what's new? A lot, as usual.</p>
<p>The backend has been bumped up to GTK4 + libadwaita, which has resulted in some tweaks to the styling along with overall performance improvements with it using more modern toolkits. Along with this, the onboarding experience was changed to look a bit fancier:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14971699381655291575gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14971699381655291575gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some other tweaks include changes to the Bottle screen with a reorganised utilities list, with the most-used items easier to access. A few others have been put under a Legacy menu together, which contains various Wine tools they haven't implemented directly into Bottles just yet. Some performance upgrades have been done for the way the Programs, Dependencies, Versioning and Installers screens are populated to reduce loading time too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19419184121655291777gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19419184121655291777gol1.png"/></a>Image Credit - Bottles team</em></p>
<p>Launch options were improved too, which now allow you to override some preferences from the Bottle. Which in some cases may allow you to avoid creating a whole new Bottle when one app inside needs a specific option (useful!).</p>
<p>A new notification system has been added, to alert you to what the application is doing to keep you informed. Loads more like high-resolution application icons, listing games installed via launchers like Steam in Wine and eventually other launchers too like Origin and Battle.net, an option to disable mouse acceleration, they added 14 new Windows dependencies plus various fixes.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.25 is out now, here&#39;s some of what&#39;s new</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get the latest and greatest from the KDE team? The awesome <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.25.0/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.25</a> release is officially out now. This is the desktop environment used on the Steam Deck when in Desktop Mode! Hopefully Valve will update it at some point.</p>
<p>One of the big new additions is the extension of what you can customize. Accent colours for example, can be automatically picked based on your background making everything fit nicely together. It's optional of course, you can set the colouring however you like. You can also now have floating panels, that will gracefully stop floating when you maximise a window and it looks pretty slick.</p>
<p>Switching between windows and workspaces is now a breeze, thanks to the new Overview affect that's shipped. This gives you a good look at everything you have open, allowing you to also search through apps, documents, and browser tabs with KRunner and the Application Launcher.</p>
<p>There's also masses of upgrades and new additions to touchscreen input and gestures on a touchpad. Oh, and the Discover Software app had the application pages redesigned to give you access to more and better info on what you're downloading and plenty of upgrades to their Flatpak handling.</p>
<p>See their flashy release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Az8NcYe3t70"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a382799996316b8475f66eccf1c1a425.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Az8NcYe3t70" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also absolutely loads (hundreds!) of improvements and fixes for Wayland support too.</p>

      <title>Turbo Golf Racing could be the next multiplayer hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo currently available in Steam Next Fest, the racer game Turbo Golf Racing is one to watch. Tested on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with Proton 7.</p>
<p>You can be in a match with up to eight players and you can go solo, or create a party. The idea is simple, from go you power as fast as you can into your personal ball and keep smashing your car into it until you get it into the hole at the end of the course. While racing, there's various power-ups you can collect and areas of the track that can give you a boost too.</p>
<p>Here's some footage of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AOdzgBXq4rM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b42cb46f7b42e9cdc948b0896b7eb294.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AOdzgBXq4rM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One bit does concern me though with Power Cores, special additions to your vehicle that can enable you to have an abilities boost that could create some messy balancing.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely hooked on this already though and I think if they do it right, this could easily be the next big multiplayer experience. Nice to see it working so well with Proton even before release too! It will not be free to play though, so it will be interesting to see how it does.</p>
<p>The developers say it will have free regular upgrades with new courses, cosmetics and more.</p>
<p>Try it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1324350/Turbo_Golf_Racing/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It enters Early Access on August 4th.</p>

      <title>Monster collecting game Cassette Beasts shows off the powerful fusion system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is an incredibly exciting looking upcoming monster collecting game, one that will offer a rather unique take on the genre and a new trailer is up showcasing the fusion system.</p>
<p>It's on the unique side, since you're not collecting these creatures or using them in a traditional way. Instead of throwing them out of some kind of ball, you turn into them. The fusion system is where it gets real interesting though, allowing you to combine two forms into something unique. The developers say it will be able to generate "over fourteen thousand unique fusions that will allow you as a player to fully customize your team to fit your unique style".</p>
<p>During the Guerrilla Collective digital games showcase a new trailer was shown below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H_TebiMOPvw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a416fe4f64476fded9c0358cd918d393.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H_TebiMOPvw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it will have a Native Linux build at release.</p>

      <title>20 Minutes Till Dawn is like Vampire Survivors with guns — goodbye free time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>20 Minutes Till Dawn is what you get when you take the basic action-survival idea that Vampire Survivors made popular again, makes it really dark and puts a gun in your hand. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>I am thoroughly loving this return to simple, cheap and engrossing experiences that we've had recently. It's only £2.09 on Steam and you can get a ridiculous amount of time out of it and it's only going to get bigger since it's in Early Access right now. 20 Minutes Till Dawn is a rogue-lite survival action game, where you run around defeating an increasing number of weird creatures and collect little pips that drop when they die to level up. When you level up, you get to pick from a random list of upgrades to create a ridiculous character.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton, it works out of the box perfectly on Linux desktops, and with a Steam Input adjustment it can feel great on the Steam Deck too. Here's a look at it on the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ogCLZ9MfF-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/42892aae2a84dbd24a31965df092fb8f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ogCLZ9MfF-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not just guns though, there's a few different characters to unlock and they each have different weapons to unlock too as there's plenty of persistent progression to keep you going.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 50 different upgrades too choose from for a unique experience every run!</li>
<li>Wide cast of characters, with more to come post-launch.</li>
<li>Casual quick 10-20 minute play sessions, for busy gamers.</li>
<li>Rune System helps you become stronger</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think and hope they add some visual aids for people with poor eyesight though, because I can imagine it being a little difficult to see. That's part of the fun for me though, and certainly makes it on the tougher side to play through and keeps me coming back for more.</p>
<p>Right now, I think it's instantly become my new favourite game to blast through when taking a break.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966900/20_Minutes_Till_Dawn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>I spoke with the developer today who confirmed that not only will it have Native Linux support, they also mentioned that they "develop primarily on Linux, so it'll stay supported". Another fun point, is that they plan to open source their code for their in-house game engine.</p>

<li>Beat 250 individual, hand-crafted rooms</li>

</ul>

<p>You can try out a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1261430/Kandria/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> right now for Next Fest and support it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. The crowdfunding campaign has 29 days to hit at least 10,000CHF (Swiss franc), so it's about £8,246.</p>

      <title>Arctic Awakening is an upcoming cold narrative-adventure mystery</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With an initial setting that seems a little like The Long Dark, the upcoming Arctic Awakening seems like a thoroughly interesting story-focused exploration adventure.

<p>Arctic Awakening is a first-person narrative adventure set in the mysterious Arctic North where you and your robotic companion, Alfie, must search for your co-pilot... and a way home."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crazy animal fighting game Them's Fightin' Herds has a huge 3.0 update out now, bringing with it some new super abilities and some DLC pulled into the main game for everyone.</p>
<p>This 3.0 update gives "cinematic level 3 supers", a new universal character mechanic completing the move-set for all characters. The developers note many balance changes were done for this release, to really fine-tune the experience. The update is also coming in "hot", as a lot of the backend was updated too so there may be some lingering bugs. On top of that the character Shanty and all of their DLC content is now free in the base game for everyone.</p>
<p>New trailer below:</p>

<li><strong>Streamlined Combat</strong> - 4-button fighting mechanics, magic system, enhanced super attack, and juggle decay to prevent infinite combos.</li>
<li><strong>Story Mode</strong> - An episodic adventure filled with exploration, combat challenges, minigames, and boss fights!</li>
<li><strong>Local Versus and Online Crossplay Matchmaking</strong> - Fight opponents offline or battle across the globe with GGPO’s powerful rollback netcode.</li>

      <title>AMD announce Radeon Memory Visualizer support for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD <a href="https://gpuopen.com/radeon-memory-visualizer-on-linux/" target="_blank">announced</a> yesterday that they're now supporting the Radeon Memory Visualizer on Linux, as a result of "the rising popularity of gaming on the Linux OS".</p>
<p>This is a tool to help game developers solve some complex issues and analyze video memory usage on AMD Radeon GPUs. A good step, as it's not just enough to have games working well on Linux, we also need to pull in more game developers so we can eventually have great direct-support.</p>
<p>Starting with the June 2022 release of their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/tools/" target="_blank">Radeon Developer Tool Suite</a>, developers can analyze Vulkan applications on Linux. Officially, they're supporting Ubuntu 20.04 but other distributions will likely also work but may need some different dependencies installed. AMD say the experience is largely the same as the Windows version too.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest: June 2022 is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A celebration of upcoming games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest: June 2022</a> is now live for you to smash that download button on various demos to see what you think. Much like previous events, there will also be various livestreams on the official event page and on pages for individual games for you to speak to developers and see some footage.</p>
<p>Valve also created a little trailer for it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gnu-nh4NI0Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e643aa18c5e957adea0f9668d6598bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gnu-nh4NI0Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The event runs from June 13th to June 20th.</p>
<p>Here's just a small hand-picked selection of the demos that offer up Native Linux support and look interesting:</p>

</ul>
<p>Not only do you get to try some games, Valve has also added special badges you can earn during the event for playing various demos. So if you love collecting things on Steam for your profile, it's a nice bit of added fluff to get you to play more.</p>
<p>Since I've been excited for this one, here's some Linux gameplay from the FPS game Selaco:</p>

      <title>Initial thoughts on the HP Dev One laptop with Pop!_OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HP and System76 teamed up for the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a>, and for a little while now I’ve been using it as my main machine for everything possible for GamingOnLinux related and otherwise. Here's my initial thoughts, with more to come when I've had more time.</p>
<p><u>Note</u>: this was a review unit sent directly by HP. I’ll preface this with a clear note, that initially I was offered a payment to review it. I denied the offer, since I <em>never</em> take payments for reviews and was later told it was a mistake by the PR firm involved. System76 has since said I can <em>keep</em> the device but that does not affect my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>Available for $1,099, you can have it with the System76 Launch Configurable Keyboard (which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">reviewed previously</a>) and a HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse as optional <em>extras</em>. Not only is the hardware a thing of beauty but the operating system is pretty slick too, as it comes with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS</a> from System76. This was also my first <em>real</em> test of Pop!_OS for more than just messing around for an hour and it’s really easy to get along with.</p>
<p>Built for "developers", which is a pretty ambiguous way to describe who it’s really for, it’s actually a pretty solid all-rounder that just glides through most of what you can throw at it. Except playing the latest games at 1080p, although it does quite well at lower resolutions. It’s a powerhouse when it comes to the CPU but not the GPU.</p>
<p><strong>Main Specifications</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4924067471655137414gol1.jpg"/></p>

</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20619634371655460609gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20619634371655460609gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18599703941655460610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18599703941655460610gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since this is an AMD unit, which is still quite rare with Linux vendors, it does mean you get open source drivers with it too so that's a nice bonus for Linux and FOSS enthusiasts. This is also not a case of a rebrand for Linux, this was a Linux-first endeavour and you can feel it and see it all the way through.</p>
<p>Is it really a Linux hardware review if you don’t Neofetch it?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3175648691655130029gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It ships with a pretty standard proprietary firmware / BIOS. Coreboot was being evaluated but they simply didn't have time to get it onto it ready for production. The good news though is that it fully supports the <a href="https://fwupd.org/" target="_blank">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a>, so you can easily get updates directly on the machine without ever needing Windows.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2316521241655134138gol1.png"/></p>
<p><strong>System76 and HP together?</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the most surprising part of the laptop and quite an important one to think on. Since System76 are a hardware vendor with their own laptops (and lots more), on top of making the Pop!_OS distribution, it's a great way for both System76 and HP to expand who is using Linux to the benefit of them both in the long run. Fantastic for us consumers too, as more choice for Linux is never a bad thing.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the experience here with Pop!_OS is great too, especially as they haven't filled it full of fluff. It's largely a generic standard Pop install because it has such a wide target for Linux enthusiasts. A few of the tweaks include a different wallpaper by default and their own special selection to pick from, an EULA to accept on install and opt-in analytics for HP to get info to improve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/846734461655131342gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Access to software out of the box is great, with the Pop!_Shop software centre having both the standard repositories and <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> enabled together so the amount of extras you have access to should enable you to find anything you could possibly need and Flathub is growing all the time.</p>
<p>There are some things that makes it "special" according to HP like an integrated support panel within the OS, HP have specially trained their support teams for the device and HP also do a full QA certification for every kernel and firmware update for it. Safe to say they're making sure people who buy it are well supported. They even collaborated with AMD on suspend/resume support.</p>
<p><strong>The Dev One experience</strong></p>
<p>The screen, wow, where do I start? It’s glossy, so it has a few reflections in certain lighting conditions but apart from that, it’s absolutely <em>gorgeous</em>. The brightness is actually seriously impressive, somewhat blinding at max setting even. I’ve spent almost my entire time with it at 50% brightness but could easily go lower, it’s just that clear. Pretty great viewing angles from each edge too, I don’t think anyone is going to have any issues with the screen for sure.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise initially was the audio from the speakers. Not only is it crystal clear, it’s also incredibly loud. At 50% audio level, I could hear it pretty clearly in another room across my house so that’s pretty great. Putting it up to 100% audio level was really where the audio truly impressed me though, it still remained impeccably clear which is kind of ridiculous for its size.</p>
<p>How is the fan? When really pushing the device, I was amazed at how quiet the fan remained. It’s not silent by any measure but it is quiet, you only really hear a gentle muted blow out of it that puts to shame some other devices I have (including my own personal laptop). Fan noise can be stupidly distracting but here it was easy to tune it out completely. I fully expected to hear it start ramping-up when I pushed it to the limit but it remained quiet which I was genuinely astonished by.</p>
<p>A great keyboard too, and it even includes a trackpoint (otherwise known as a nipple) for those of you who loved that on the ThinkPads.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19009311121655132659gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'm glad they chose a muted colour for the nipple though, so it doesn't overly stick-out against the the unit. Fits in quite well as a fun extra for those who like using one.</p>
<p>The keyboard as a whole feels great to use. It's quiet, which seems to be a nice theme with this unit so you won't have distracting clicks while you're working away, same goes for the built-in mouse buttons which are very quiet although the touchpad can be clicked in too but that's quite a nice muted sound. From what they say it's spill-resistant, although I don't dare to test that. The keyboard is backlit too, which has a few levels of brightness as well as having the backlight off so you can work under different lighting conditions.</p>
<p>A nice privacy feature they have, which took me a while to even notice, is that you can slide a privacy screen over the webcam. I absolutely love that and I honestly think every laptop should have this. Directly above the webcam is a tiny slider that you just pull across.</p>
<p>This is probably the nicest laptop I’ve ever used. Not something I say lightly either, practically everything about it feels <em>just right</em>. I would have vastly preferred a matt screen but that is about the only issue I’ve personally had with it. Due to the screen, working outside with it is not really possible. Shot below is in the shade on max brightness:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20111906061655309893gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20111906061655309893gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And then sat in the sun on max brightness:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17934988981655309844gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17934988981655309844gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Yeah, you're not going to be working outside with this at all. Again though, that is about my only complaint with it and I never work outside anyway. However, think an anti-glare matt screen will do much better anyway? It won't do a whole lot of good outside that's for sure but does look better inside — as long as it's not pointing at a light. For comparison here's it up against the Asus VivoBook S510U inside and then outside:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18827625551655310911gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18827625551655310911gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722301141655310958gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722301141655310958gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I have to hand it to HP and System76 here, together they’ve managed to craft a truly great machine to work with. An impressive device overall when thinking about every angle of it.</p>
<p>No problems encountered with anything either. WiFi worked exceptionally well even when pushing it hard with downloads and streaming together, with it maxing out at 167 Mbps download and 26 Mbps upload with my Google Mesh WiFi which is actually great — more than enough for the vast majority of uses.</p>
<p>Also, another small but very welcome tweak is that the Power button has is tougher to push down so there’s less of a chance of hitting it accidentally. I hope more hardware vendors do this.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, it's pretty great actually. When you really push it, you're not looking at more than 2-3 hours but this is a developer-focused machine so coding with music playing, you're looking at nearly a full day of battery life but of course that also depends on things light screen brightness, audio levels, bluetooth on and more. Battery testing is always a tough one because people use such devices very differently. I'm impressed with it though and it's been more than enough to get lots done without needing a charge. Charging is pretty quick too, with it able to get up to at least 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Currently it’s U.S. only but it sounds like they might have plans for expanding shipping in future, which was mentioned during a Q&amp;A session but no ETA.</p>
<p>While doing the review I also used the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/products/hp-935-creator-wireless-mouse" target="_blank">HP 935 Creator Wireless Mouse</a> they supplied as my main mouse too, and found that to be a truly comfortable experience as well. It’s really light, and has a perfect shape to nicely fit my hand. Seems HP keeps impressing me. The battery life on that has a claim of 12 weeks and so far it hasn't needed charging. As a great extra, they also built a Mouse Configurator (that's <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/mouse-configurator" target="_blank">open source</a>) just for using it with the Dev One.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13962661691655134588gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some good attention to <em>all</em> the details here.</p>
<p>Right now, I can see absolutely no reason not to recommend it if you're in the market for a laptop around the $1,099 price-point as not many will be able to match the quality for that.</p>
<p>If you’re after a really wonderful laptop that comes with Linux, the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> is an absolutely brilliant unit that shines and I'll have more to say after spending a while longer with it. If I'm not at my desk, this is my go-to laptop now.</p>
<p>To readers: what would you love to see tested on it? Do let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Techland ends support for Dying Light, 7 years after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland are moving on from the original Dying Light, after giving it 7 years of free updates and expansions. Not many developers support their games for that long, if they're not some sort of live-service thing. Techland certainly did well overall with it.</p>
<p>While it won't see any major updates now, they will still be trickling in a steady "reroll" of previous events into the game for people to play but their main focus is now shifting over to Dying Light 2.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UrneVfMZt30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cea514b760eec6a7462aa8e2cdf4031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UrneVfMZt30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Dying Light also now only has two editions, to make it less confusing. There's Dying Light Enhanced Edition and the new Dying Light Definitive Edition, both of them on a heavy discount on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>To go along with it, the Harran Tactical Unit Bundle DLC has been made free to claim for two weeks. People who owned the Platinum Edition were also upgraded to the Definitive Edition free. This is after they also gave away The Following expansion to all previous owners.</p>

      <title>System Shock remake gets a brand new flashy trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>The upcoming System Shock from Nightdive Studios is still coming, and a brand new trailer was recently shown off during the PC Gaming Show 2022. We don't know when it will release though.</p>
<p>Originally released in 1994, this remake was crowdfunded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and it hasn't been without trouble with development at one point being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/development-on-the-new-system-shock-has-been-paused/" target="_blank">paused</a> but it seems they're close to the finishing line now. Linux support for it was a stretch-goal at $1.1 million USD that was hit, so hopefully they will come through with a good version of it.</p>
<p>You can see the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Microphone noise suppression app NoiseTorch returns with a new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/noisetorch/NoiseTorch" target="_blank">NoiseTorch</a>, a popular real-time microphone noise suppression app recently had a possible <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/developer-of-popular-noise-suppression-tool-noisetorch-has-dev-machine-compromised/" target="_blank">security issue</a> but it's been reviewed thoroughly and it's back.</p>
<p>"NoiseTorch is an easy to use open source application for Linux with PulseAudio or PipeWire. It creates a virtual microphone that suppresses noise, in any application. Use whichever conferencing or VOIP application you like and simply select the NoiseTorch Virtual Microphone as input to torch the sound of your mechanical keyboard, computer fans, trains and the likes."</p>
<p>In the new version 0.12.0 they completed a review of the code, and no issue was found. To help against any future issues, they're no longer using a separate update server and instead they will be using GitHub releases so it's all more transparent. For added security, they're also now using more GitHub features to validate the code too.</p>
<p>On top of that the new release also has some code cleanups, and the actual filtering status will be clearer now so it should give a better user experience.</p>

      <title>Usagi Shima is an idle bunny collecting game that I simply need</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Usagi Shima, from developer pank0 (aka Jess Yu), is an upcoming idle bunny collecting game I've been following for quite some time and the first-ever short gameplay trailer just went up. Shown off as part of the recent Wholesome Direct 2022, it's nice to finally see more than screenshots and tiny gifs on their popular <a href="https://twitter.com/_pank0" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account.</p>
<p>"You’ve been tasked as caretaker of an abandoned island — as you decorate it over time, curious (but adorable!) bunny visitors start to appear! Buy toys, plants, and build structures on an abandoned island to entice curious bun tourists to pay your island a visit. Discover, take photos, and make friends with a variety of bunnies that visit based on how you’ve decorated and arranged the island."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7dTT7c94xzk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/169f5f5c5bc565b114ea29a7ceac6d48.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7dTT7c94xzk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what it will feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover and record 30+ rabbits with unique looks and features!</li>
<li>Over 100 items to decorate with, some even interactive!</li>
<li>Hand-drawn and traditionally animated art style</li>
<li>Pet and engage with a variety of activities with the bunnies to build friendship</li>
<li>Receive keepsakes from bunnies you’ve become best friends with, and even invite them to stay on your island.</li>
<li>Synced with real time, experience the island ambience matching your time of day</li>
<li>Relaxing idle gameplay – no time limits, no stress, enjoy the ambience and play at your own pace!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Playing OXOGO could land you a big real-life prize that increases with its sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of OXOGO are hoping to entice some people to play their retro-styled adventure, with the added excitement of the possibility to earn a real-life prize.</p>
<p>OXOGO is an adventure styled like games from early 90s handheld consoles, so it would fit right in on the Game Boy. In OXOGO your dog has been kidnapped, and you end up in some sort of prison. An adventure about finding your dog but also a real treasure hunt at the same time. The developer is putting a small amount of each sale into a pot, to give away to whoever can put together all the clues to find a password.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bu-9cORkWHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9acd1b7b45343aa73d6addb0a75a95f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bu-9cORkWHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If no one claims the prize by December 2025, any of the <em>extra</em> (not the whole thing) they added to the initial pot will be donated to free software development projects.</p>
<p>The pot started at €5,000 and they said they will update their <a href="http://oxogo.info/" target="_blank">website</a> once a month for how it's doing.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://oxogo.itch.io/oxogo" target="_blank">buy on itch.io</a> as pay-what-you-want and get treasure hunting.</p>

      <title>Phasmophobia gets new Voice Recognition to work on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you been itching to play Phasmophobia? Well, you no longer have to wait for Wine and Proton to be upgraded as the developers have ripped out the Windows-specific stuff.</p>
<p>In their latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/739630/view/3339995286952592740" target="_blank">update notes</a>, they mentioned how they "are no longer relying on Windows' speech systems, meaning it supports many more languages and platforms, such as ‘GeForce Now’ and Steam Deck, with no setup required (and fixes that pesky tab-out bug)."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Phasmophobia is a 4 player online co-op psychological horror where you and your team members of paranormal investigators will enter haunted locations filled with paranormal activity and gather as much evidence of the paranormal as you can. You will use your ghost hunting equipment to search for and record evidence of whatever ghost is haunting the location to sell onto a ghost removal team.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose to support your team by monitoring the location with CCTV cameras and motion sensors from the safety of the truck or head inside and get your hands dirty with the ghostly activity that will get increasingly hostile as time goes on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This should hopefully bump the game up on Steam Deck from Unsupported to Verified.</p>

      <title>AMD tease roadmap for Zen 4, Zen 5, RDNA 3 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the recent Financial Analyst Day, AMD revealed a little bit more about their upcoming roadmap and there's plenty to be excited about for their next-gen CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>Some of the points that were mentioned for desktop and laptop users, those were interested in here include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zen 4 CPUs later this year as the "world's first" 5nm x86 CPUs. AMD say it will give an IPC uplift of 8-10% and more than a 25% increase in performance-per-watt and a 35% overall performance increase compared to Zen 3 when running desktop applications. We can also expect Zen 4 with V-Cache, and a Zen 4c revision and some will be on a 4nm process.</li>
<li>Zen 5 "Granite Ridge" CPUs planned for 2024, which is being built from the ground-up. Zen 5 will have both 4nm and 3nm designs.</li>
<li>AMD RDNA 3 "Navi 3x" will bring a chiplet design, which will also have their Infinity Cache tech with a 5nm process which they claim a 50% boost in performance-per-watt compared with the previous generation. AMD said to expect Navi 3x GPUs later this year.</li>
<li>A new "Phoenix Point" mobile processor coming in 2023, which will have Zen 4 along with RDNA graphics followed up by the "Strix Point" processor in 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even the Steam Deck got a passing mention, with AMD patting themselves on the back for their position amongst the main consoles since they power the Steam Deck, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV: By Blood Alone expansion announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have plenty more coming with the Hearts of Iron IV: By Blood Alone expansion announced, although there's no date yet they've teased it.</p>
<p>In By Blood Alone you chart the course of Mussolini's regime in Italy <em>or</em> subvert Italy's historical path in one of many new alt-historical paths in the new Italian focus tree, driven by the constant involvement in war from the beginning to the end of the game. This includes a new expansive focus tree for Ethiopia and one for Switzerland too. Plus you get to design your own planes which sounds thoroughly interesting.</p>
<p>As always, it will also release alongside a fresh free upgrade for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="owqpUZy6Gbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91c4f87ece0b50c61bc918513a009572.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/owqpUZy6Gbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What it will offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Italian Focus Tree: Follow the historical path of Mussolini’s Italy or rewrite history by restoring power to the monarchy, leading a Communist revolution or promoting democracy.</li>
<li>New Ethiopian Focus Tree: Defy the odds to defeat the Italian invader or resist the conqueror from abroad using unique Government in Exile abilities.</li>
<li>New Swiss Focus Tree: Surrounded by France, Germany and Italy, the mountain nation of Switzerland finds strength in its neutrality, balancing competing factions and overtures from the great powers.</li>
<li>New Peace Conference Options: Demilitarize zones of the map or entire nations, bid on the capital ships of defeated powers, or claim control of enemy resources or factories as reparations.</li>
<li>Aircraft Designer: Design and build your own planes, from nimble interceptors that prioritize speed to durable bombers crafted to unload tons of destruction from high above.</li>
<li>Unit Medals: A log of each division’s accomplishments lets you track their performance, and even allow you to award medals to those that have performed well.</li>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to get Steam Deck and Gamepad controls in Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get a better Minecraft experience on Steam Deck or with Gamepads as a whole? Thanks to a new mod, it's easily possibly with the latest versions of Minecraft.</p>
<p>The new mod is named <a href="https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/MidnightControls" target="_blank">MidnightControls</a>, a fork of the old and unmaintained LambdaControls and it's open source. The developer who has taken it on has made sure it's cleaned up and working again, along with adding in support for the Steam Deck and in my own testing it works rather nicely. For this, I used the <a href="https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC" target="_blank">PolyMC</a> launcher available easily for Linux and Steam Deck. You can see a previous guide on PolyMC <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/getting-minecraft-and-mods-on-steam-deck-is-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">in this article</a>.</p>
<p>First up is the video example on how to do it followed by the text guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zvj-6iUwdQI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/429eb50e87933d2dee689b40c6a1cb2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zvj-6iUwdQI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>First with PolyMC, set Steam Input into Gamepad with Mouse, and set the right trackpad to Left Mouse Click.</li>
<li>Open PolyMC, add a new instance and set the mod loader to Fabric and click Okay.</li>
<li>Now hit the View Mods button and then Download Mods.</li>
<li>Pick the Fabric API, MidnightLib and MidnightControls.</li>
<li>Once downloaded, load up your new Minecraft instance.</li>
<li>Go into the Options -&gt; Controls -&gt; Controller.</li>
<li>Set the Mode to Controller and under Appearance set Controller Type to Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Now you're all set and it will just work.</li>

      <title>How to play The Elder Scrolls Online on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Elder Scrolls Online is currently noted as Unsupported on Steam Deck but don't let that stop you. Getting it running is actually pretty simple.</p>
<p>I'm not surprised it's noted as Unsupported though, considering how quirky the initial install actually is. You're not just downloading from Steam, you're also using their launcher to install an update and that is the main cause of the problems. A launcher being a nuisance — where have we all heard that before?</p>
<p>First up a video example, below that is the text guide:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B3ahI0_czYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/26e29603491e6da845f63bb2258225e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B3ahI0_czYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the game in your Steam Library, hit the little Cog icon on the right and go to Properties</li>
<li>In the launch options text field, add this: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_SET_GAME_DRIVE=1 %command%</code><br/>
<em>This basically sets up a fake drive in Proton for the game in your Steam Library that the launcher can read correctly</em></li>
<li>Now set Steam Input to Mouse and Keyboard to make it easier for now with the updater and launcher</li>
<li>Load it up, and when you get a black screen, simply press the A button. Proton currently doesn't render it properly, but it's just an accept button to continue on the installer<br/>
<em>You may find it dumps you back to the Steam Library, just reload and it eventually works. Mine only took one extra attempt</em></li>
<li>Load the game</li>
<li>Create / load into your character using the right trackpad as the mouse. Once in-game head to the Options menu in Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Gamepad &gt; Enable Gamepad</li>
<li>Open Steam Input again, set to Gamepad but edit the right trackpad to be a mouse with a left mouse click. This enables you to properly interact with the main menu and get proper gamepad controls in-game</li>
<li>Enjoy.</li>
</ol>

      <title>You can now try Resident Evil Village directly in your browser using Stadia tech</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capcom has released a cloud gaming browser demo of the popular Resident Evil Village, so you can try it out in only a click and a few seconds waiting on pretty much any platform. As long as you're using a Chromium-based browser, that is.</p>
<p>It uses "Immersive Stream for Games" from Google, which is their rebrand of the technology used for Stadia that they give out to publishers and developers for direct use. So while the actual Stadia store continues limping on, the tech behind it at least should live on for years as more developers offer up quick cloud demos like this.</p>
<p>Google noted in their <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/discovery-and-trial-immersive-stream-for-games/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about it that they've continued to expand Stadia's own cloud game trials, with 15 games now available to try out at no cost without even having a Stadia account too and they plan to increase that number over the next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18572171041654852288gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18572171041654852288gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - a shot taken from testing it today.</em></p>
<p>For Resident Evil Village, it certainly helped that the developer already had a version for sale on Stadia, so they didn't need to do a port to Linux (since Stadia uses Linux) or wait for Google's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-talk-about-their-windows-emulator-for-stadia-and-they-use-dxvk-already/" target="_blank">upcoming Windows compatibility layer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.cid.capcom.com/top.html" target="_blank">Head over here</a> to try it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck update improves Home Screen performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another small update to the Steam Deck, this time focusing on some bugs and UI performance.</p>
<p>Really, this is just Valve continuing to clean up after the last major <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2 update</a> that came with better fan curves, refresh rate switching and a lot more.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance for the Home screen Recent Games carousel</li>
<li>Fixed boot glitching and crashes experienced by some customers</li>
<li>Fixed Quick Access volume sliders not working after suspend/resume</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the controller reorder screen where moving to a controller slot higher than the current number of connected controllers would show as '!' until the Quick Access Menu screen is re-opened</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dota 2 gets a nice performance improvement with the Vulkan renderer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Battle Report Update is out now for Dota 2, with the majority of it being for Dota Plus but there's also some of the usual balancing changes and a nice improvement for people using the Vulkan renderer.</p>
<p>Valve say it has a "significant performance improvement aimed at removing hitching when playing with the Vulkan renderer". They're making use of the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/reducing-draw-time-hitching-with-vk-ext-graphics-pipeline-library" target="_blank">VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library</a> extension, which is currently only supported by the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver</a> but it will be coming to the stable drivers for all vendors eventually. So if you're on NVIDIA, perhaps give it a try and see what you think.</p>
<p>For Dota Plus there's loads new! Including a new Battle Report screen to give you in-depth info on your performance plus Weekend Spotlight, a new queue for everyone to explore an assortment of Dota game modes and events all while stocking up on Dota Plus Shards. Valve also adjusted Immortal Item spell effects, so they can now be equipped regardless of the item you have equipped.</p>
<p>Have a great moment you want to share? There's also a new clip feature to capture those moments. Plenty more in the full <a href="https://www.dota2.com/battlereport" target="_blank">update page</a>.</p>

      <title>Arietta of Spirits gets fixed up for 30FPS mode on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arietta of Spirits, a story-driven action-adventure game with easy to approach game mechanics, has a new update out that makes it run better on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Arietta of Spirits is a charming adventure game with emotion-filled narrative, no-filler gameplay, and fast paced combat. The game tells the story of Arietta and her family, visiting their Grandmother's cabin for the first time after her passing away a year prior. However, the family trip takes an unexpected turn when Arietta meets a mysterious new friend and gains the ability to see strange spirits that inhabit the island."</p>
<p>It's currently Steam Deck Verified, but it appears that verification didn't test putting it down to 30FPS. At least now it's accurate properly. Some games just don't work well below 60FPS due to the way they are programmed, and it seems this is one of them. Thankfully, the developer noticed some reports on it and released a patch to improve it. Now it will work properly at 30FPS which saves battery life.</p>
<p>The developer also fixed up pixel perfect scaling at aspect ratios other than 16:9, added speedrunning features and fixed some other issues.</p>

      <title>Back 4 Blood gets a small update for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/back-4-blood-adds-experimental-support-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Back in April</a> the Zombie shooter Back 4 Blood added experimental support for the Steam Deck, and they're continuing the support along with a new patch.</p>
<p>Along with lots of tweaks to weapon balancing and some new features, they've now added some dedicated default graphical options for the Steam Deck and there's multiple to pick from. This is great, and something I hope more developers add in so Steam Deck players can get the best possible experience. It already worked <em>very</em> nicely out of the box, but hey more tweaks that the developer has directly tested is always welcome.</p>
<p>You can see my previous look at the performance in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x7CHdPuOXxw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94da3ce1d3778cd2821c727dac295b96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x7CHdPuOXxw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the new features in this update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Deck Draw
	<ul>
<li>Play all 15 cards from your deck at the start of a Campaign for all difficulties.</li>
<li><em>Developer Note: We felt like the 15 card draw in No Hope went over well with the community, and wanted to roll out this option to all difficulties. In the future we are considering adding multiple deck styles like ordered draw and full random decks. Some difficulties have been rebalanced to work better with this feature.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Player Kicking
	<ul>
<li>The new Player Kicking system identifies and allows kicking from a Mission when a Cleaner is idle for too long or deals too much friendly fire damage.</li>
<li><em>Developer Note: We discussed this feature at length to try and do what's best for the community, so we want to try this conditional kick feature that will only trigger if someone is playing outside the bounds of the game. We also feel that the traditional Vote to Kick can be exploitable and toxic. This feature is not final and we will be monitoring it closely.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New banners, sprays, and emblems</li>
<li>12 New Burn Cards</li>
<li>New Warped Chest Corruption Cards</li>
<li>New Cleaner skins</li>
<li>Legendary Accessories</li>
<li>A more detailed breakdown of Supply Points, Copper, and Skull Totems is now present on the post-round screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/back-4-blood?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>One of the highest rated games on Steam, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition from Larian Studios recently became Steam Deck Verified. Plus, we have a longer talk from Swen Vincke, the Founder and Creative Director of Larian Studios.</p>
<p>It gained official Steam Deck Verified status last week, which I somehow completely missed. Looking over the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">top 250</a> on Steam, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is number 68 of the most highly rated games so it clearly has a lot of fans and is arguably one of the best RPGs available on Steam too.</p>
<p>Back when the Steam Deck released, we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6UXZH_FONg" target="_blank">had a few clips</a> of developers talking about the Steam Deck and their games, as it turns out Larian had kept back more of their footage that they just released that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kzfEkSGa45k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b13c3fdf69d8c682b443c651ece3454.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kzfEkSGa45k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In short: they're going to ensure all their games and future games work well on it. Really nice to hear!</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/divinity_original_sin_2" target="_blank">on GOG</a> if you wish to try with Wine.</p>

      <title>Linux hardware vendor System76 is coming to Europe</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you wanting to get some hardware from Linux vendor System76 but they don't currently ship to you, or it's expensive to do so? Well, you're in luck! They're coming to Europe. System76 make a lot of hardware including desktops, laptops, servers and a keyboard now too (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">which I reviewed</a>).</p>
<p>In an interview over on Tweakers (<a href="https://netherlands.postsen.com/technology/18352/System76-gets-distribution-center-in-Europe-and-is-working-on-a-new-keyboard-%E2%80%93-Computer-%E2%80%93-News.html" target="_blank">translated</a>), they spoke to System76 principal engineer Jeremy Soller, who confirmed "Laptops and desktops have a lot of restrictions and the costs are higher, so we will start with our Launch keyboard and sell it from a European distribution center, so that the shipping costs and taxes for that market are lower".</p>
<p>This is quite exciting, as their products are generally quite highly rated too, and I know plenty of people in the Linux space personally who use them too. Being able to get my own hands on one of their laptops would be excellent, and I've been lusting over their Thelio desktop case since it was first announced — so looks like I have some saving to do.</p>
<p>When can we expect this to happen? Sometime "in the coming months" Soller said. System76 are working on adjusting their Launch keyboard for ISO versions, and they're looking for storage space to set up their distribution location. They're also working on a smaller version of the keyboard with a Lite version with a 65% layout and no integrated USB 3.2 hub.</p>
<p>Thankfully their laptops are already conforming to the CE marking needed for Europe and they're working on the keyboard layout there. For desktops, they're working towards certification but of course it's far more complicated than a keyboard.</p>

<p>Minecraft 1.19 - The Wild Update is out now. Not only that, all owners now get both Java &amp; Bedrock together as they've been merged into a single purchase.</p>

<p>Anyway, The Wild Update! It's here! Trailer below:</p>

<p>Some of what's new includes the Mangrove Swamp biome, Mangrove Trees, Mangrove Blocks, Mud and Mud Brick Blocks, Clay renewability, Frogs and Tadpoles, the Deep Dark biome, Ancient Cities, Darkness mob effect, Sculk, Sculk Veins, Sculk Shrieker, and Sculk Catalyst Blocks, Warden mob, Allay mob, Boat with Chest, new music, 3D Directional Audio simulation and much more has been added in.</p>
<p>There's plenty of tweaks to existing features too. See the full <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-wild-update-out-today-java" target="_blank">update notes</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Some new interesting Steam Deck Verified titles, there&#39;s now over 3,200 confirmed Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interested in picking up some more games that will work nicely on Steam Deck or a Linux desktop? Here's a quick run over some recent notable titles that are fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The amount is always increasing, as a bunch go through Deck Verified every day. There's a lot that are Playable and Unsupported but if you just want a click and play experience, this is a nice little reminder for you on what's around. Going by the numbers it's now on 3,245 in total as Verified or Playable. As a reminder though: there are games listed as Unsupported that actually do work, and those that aren't tested doesn't mean they don't work — a lot more do.</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper is going to be my next craving, demo is great on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dome Keeper, previously known as Dome Romantik, has a brand new demo available and after testing it, I fear it's yet another simple but addictive game I'm going to wake up craving to play more. Built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it has perfect Linux support so far as I can tell and it feels like perfection on the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>It's a rogue-lite game about defending and upgrading a Dome on a hostile planet, while you dig down below for riches. Quite simple overall but it has that repeatable hook that suckers you into it as the hours fade away. I love the differences between the two sections of the game. The drilling and mining is quite peaceful and fun exploration, while the combat parts feel absolutely nuts at times and really can make you sweat.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WnssSzto5b0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f5a94f1677a06819101bb03aea338a5d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WnssSzto5b0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Love the artwork too!</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dig - Drill tunnels beneath your dome in search of precious materials. Watch the time, you need to get back to the dome and be ready when the next wave of attack comes. How deep will you get this time? How much can you carry back?</li>
<li>Defend - Take control of the defenses and fend off the alien attacks. Air and ground, slow and fast, the attackers must be prioritized and dealt with before they tear your dome apart.</li>
<li>Develop - Use your mineral harvest to gain powerful upgrades; improve the strength of your weapon, make your drill more powerful, increase the speed of your jetpack and research other improvements. Find artifacts to give an extra boost to your survival odds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/" target="_blank">new demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs now supports the new Valhall architecture</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for fan of Arm devices, as developer Alyssa Rosenzweig has <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/conformant-open-source-support-for-mali-g57.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Panfrost driver for Mali GPUs now supports the new Valhall architecture.</p>
<p>This open source graphics driver now has <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengles#submission_980" target="_blank">fully-conformant</a> OpenGL ES 3.1 on Mali-G57, a Valhall GPU, with the final Mesa patches landing and the kernel patches are <a href="https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm-misc/commit/?id=5ba99fca1de0272ce05b65f19bcc184b5cb43285" target="_blank">queued for merge upstream</a>.</p>
<p>When it comes to hardware, it means the MediaTek Chromebooks with the MT8192 and MT8195 system-on-chips like the ASUS Chromebook Flip CM3 will work out of the box with accelerated graphics providing you have Mesa 22.2 and an appropriate kernel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5171063671654603455gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5171063671654603455gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - ASUS Chromebook Flip CM3</em></p>
<p>Seems it's a nice improvement over the previous generation chip too, with better Vulkan performance and hardware changes to improve other problems they had with the previous generation.</p>

      <title>RimWorld has another upgrade out for Steam Deck players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld on Steam Deck gets even better with the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/294100/announcements/detail/3325358588164752807" target="_blank">update</a>, as the developer continues tweaking to give the best experience possible. While it is thoroughly playable thanks to the last major update, a few lingering issues remained that hopefully this patch will solve.</p>
<p>Specifically for Steam Deck here's what changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed multiple cases where on Steam Deck some keyboard shortcuts were mentioned</li>
<li>Commands now show "button A" glyph instead of "A" label on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>When architect search bar is focused on a Steam Deck and the on-screen keyboard is visible, move gizmos up so that they're still visible.</li>
<li>Added "Keyboard mode" option on Steam Deck in case someone connects a keyboard to the SteamDeck.</li>
<li>Fix: Dismissing on-screen keyboard on SteamDeck doesn't unfocus the text field.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see a previous quick-look I did below:</p>

      <title>iFixit have the Steam Deck Battery prices up but already sold out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">official iFixit launch</a> for Steam Deck replacement parts but one major bit was missing — the Battery. Now though, it seems the store pages for it are properly live and they're already out of stock.</p>
<p>As I was writing this the EU and UK <em>had</em> some stock, I refreshed and they were <em>gone</em> so obviously a few people were waiting ready. Originally, when the initial launch happened there were only placeholder pages for the Battery replacements and no prices. iFixit told various outlets that they didn't currently have a solution to it but it seems that's being solved.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18030585181654597571gol1.jpg"/>Pictured - the full Battery Kit</em></p>
<p>So while you again can't buy it yet, we at least now have the full price required now:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/products/steam-deck-battery?pk_vid=cca664783d4d44f61654597360dbcbf1" target="_blank">UK</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only:  £84.99</li>
<li>Kit:  £89.99</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Miscellanous/Steam-Deck-Battery/IF260-001?o=2" target="_blank">US</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only:  $89.99</li>
<li>Kit:  $94.99</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-battery?pk_vid=cca664783d4d44f61654597323dbcbf1&amp;variant=39920887169105" target="_blank">EU</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Part only: €89,95</li>
<li>Kit: €94,95</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently they're still missing the replacements for various main buttons. While they have the triggers, they do not have the D-pad, Action buttons, Steam button, Quick Access button and others missing too.</p>

      <title>Gamers Nexus have a fascinating look at the Steam Deck fan situation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For all the hype around the Steam Deck there is one major controversy with the fan. There's two fans being used, with one having a noticeably louder pitch than the other and now Gamers Nexus are attempting to find out why and how bad it is.</p>
<p>Since I've been through both fan types, I can safely say they are very different in the type of noise they give out and it's good to see people with the right equipment attempt to dive into the <em>why</em>. The original fan that was used in the review units is still used, Valve just switch to whatever they have available at production time it seems. The original "Huaying" model sounds more like a nice blower, but the "Delta" fan gives this annoying high-pitch <em>whine</em>. Although, recent fan curve updates from Valve has dramatically helped with that.</p>
<p>In the Gamers Nexus video they do a tear-down of each fan, and you can see there are some pretty big differences. Notable bits being the blade design with the Delta fan blades being much more curved, how close the Delta fan is to the inside casing and the Delta fan outer casing also has bigger cut-outs for airflow too.</p>
<p>Anyway, check out the Gamers Nexus video below because it's a good one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="G2EEtzhsr2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b615b1138b32bd7b7319c5048413f22f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/G2EEtzhsr2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The good news is that if it bothers you, it's clearly real easy to swap the fan for a different one as it's really accessible. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">iFixit are also stocking</a> the original less-noisy fan, although they're out of stock as expected.</p>

      <title>Diablo Immortal works on Steam Deck, plus a fix for Battle.net being slow</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Diablo Immortal is the hot new thing, I decided to attempt to give it a go on Steam Deck. Turns out the Battle.net launcher really hates some connections, here's a fix and a Diablo Immortal video.</p>
<p>Currently, Diablo Immortal does work on Steam Deck (and so Linux desktops too) but it seems gamepad support is not working yet. So you will need to use Steam Input to adjust your configuration of any gamepad or Steam Deck to act like a keyboard and mouse. For the most part, that works reasonably well, not that I would recommend it considering the ridiculous micro-transactions involved in the game.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's the video of it running:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E4J2-nlTzHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99f08895d96545ef532ad0cb18f23e4a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E4J2-nlTzHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You might find the Battle.net launcher which you can install easily with Lutris (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/lutris-now-has-a-flatpak-beta-available-and-updated-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck Lutris Guide</a>) can take <em>forever</em> to actually load or do anything. Now, this might be specific to whatever WiFi hardware you have, in my case it's the Google Mesh WiFi system and Blizzard don't seem to like it. An easy fix though is to manually set your DNS to <a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/" target="_blank">1.1.1.1</a> (or any other free DNS service). On Steam Deck, simply right click on the WiFi icon in Desktop Mode and hit Configure Network Connections:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15697545591654511382gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15697545591654511382gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From there in the IPv4 (and IPv6 tab if you use it), switch it to "Automatic (Only addresses)" in the Method dropdown box and then set DNS Servers to 1.1.1.1. After that, disconnect and reconnect via the WiFi icon on your Plasma taskbar at the bottom and then reload Battle.net and it will work properly. It's incredibly weird but it works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8474013301654511169gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8474013301654511169gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you can properly use the Battle.net launcher on Steam Deck, if you also had this weird problem.</p>
<p>You can also add Lutris to Steam as a Non-Steam game, which allows you to launch Lutris and Diablo Immortal in Gaming Mode (so you're not stuck in Desktop Mode). I can confirm that also works just fine.</p>

      <title>GOG Summer Sale now live with new releases from SEGA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For readers who prefer to shop over on GOG, their <a href="https://www.gog.com/summer-sale-2022" target="_blank">Summer Sale</a> has just started along with some new releases.</p>
<p>To go along with it, more SEGA titles are joining GOG with the first being <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/alien_isolation_collection" target="_blank">Alien: Isolation Collection</a>. Plus <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/two_point_hospital" target="_blank">Two Point Hospital</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/warhammer_40000_space_marine" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine</a> are coming soon. All for Windows though but you can try with Wine if you wish.</p>
<p>GOG has a few fun collections up to browser through including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2022_summer_sale_80s" target="_blank">80's Games</a></li>

An absolute classic I remember fondly blasting through on the original PlayStation and would love to sit in bed with that on the Steam Deck.

      <title>Free to play shooter Rogue Company verified &#39;Playable&#39; on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Company, a free to play shooter from First Watch Games and Hi-Rez Studios recently had an update of Easy Anti-Cheat and now it's confirmed as "Playable" (not fully Verified) on Steam Deck. The situation is a little odd for the Linux desktop though.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, it works out of the box. It's noted as <em>Playable</em>, as it has some text sizing issues and you may need to bring up the on-screen keyboard manually. In my own testing though, it was great. Not only does it perform well but it looks really good and feels like a great fit for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's a look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a39F7N-Upzs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba69e2cb65fbf1589d0a46d313d9a1b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a39F7N-Upzs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On Linux desktop though, there's currently some issues preventing it working properly. If you install Steam as a Flatpak, it seems to work. With a normal Steam install though, a lot of distributions don't have it working. Thankfully, developers RichardYao and "GloriousEggroll" (GE-Proton dev), discovered <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/v4xezh/figured_out_reverts_needed_to_run_rogue_company/" target="_blank">the issue</a> is with glibc 2.35/34. Now the issue is known, hopefully it can be solved so more Linux gamers can play it too.</p>
<p>Free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/872200/Rogue_Company/" target="_blank">play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Endlanders is a glitchy RPG with real-time deck-building grid-based combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Endlanders and the prologue demo Endlanders : First Encounter have a graphics style that reminds me of Hyper Light Drifter and Resolutiion while offering rather different gameplay. A game that offers up a single-player RPG experience, along with a blending of deck-building and real-time grid-based combat wrapped up in a glitchy world.</p>
<p>"Delve into foreign worlds, translate languages, combat enemies and understand the universe."</p>
<p>One fun feature that sets it apart from other grid fighters, is that the grids aren't special stages. You can create a combat grid nearly anywhere, as long as there's enough space, so you're fighting on the map you're exploring.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UN7PcWnqeSk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3899c386c11a781dc27892c8b239f0ac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UN7PcWnqeSk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/endlanders/endlanders" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, this game is developed with the free and open source Godot Engine and plans for a release in 2024 but you can play the Endlanders : First Encounter now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2010450/Endlanders__First_Encounter/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Action Quake 2 (AQtion), considered the &#39;precursor&#39; to Counter-Strike now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Action Quake 2 (AQtion), a free and open source first-person shooter that the developers say "spawned one of the most popular and influential games of all time, Counter-Strike" is now available on Steam. Originally developed in 1998 to recreate the look and feel of an action movie, having a fast pace and a semi-realistic damage system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iLc8OnzFpmQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66ed620b1be33d564201e92fc1f8729b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iLc8OnzFpmQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers say the new release has been upgraded, with plenty of polish to make it worth playing.</p>
<p>Various modes available:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Deathmatch - Spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and by default players battle out with only pistol, and a combat knife in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the time or frag limit is reached. Additional "unique" equipment can be picked up throughout, meaning that only one exists on that map at any time.</li>
<li>Capture the Flag - You will have to team up with other players and manage your offense and defense in pursuit of bringing the enemy's flag to your base in order to score. The team that captures the enemy flag the most wins!</li>
<li>Teamplay - Players are split into two teams and play is round based. Players select one primary weapon and one item to use, in addition to the default pistol and knife. The teams spawn on opposite sides of the map and are then let loose to kill each other. If one team eliminates the other, they win the round.</li>
<li>Team Deathmatch - Like Deathmatch but with teams, spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and by default players battle out with only pistol, and a combat knife in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the time or frag limit is reached.</li>
<li>Play Offline - Engage in battle against bots that will challenge your skills both with and without using your network connection. You can adjust their capability as well as select from several game modes.</li>
<li>Espionage - Similar to teamplay mode, with the exception that the team points are awarded based on successful completion of a scenario. Players also respawn periodically, a fixed amount of time, if a certain amount of members of the team are dead, or instantly. Scenario types CNH, CTB and OFC are continuous play, as in there's no 'end' to a round until the roundlimit or timelimit is reached. The others types rounds end when an objective is met.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Gravitar: Recharged released from Atari revamping another classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another remake of a classic has landed, with Atari's Gravitar from the 80s now being available on Steam with Gravitar: Recharged. This was was in collaboration with developers Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox, along with artist and composer Megan McDuffee.</p>
<p>Blending the action of Asteroids and Space Duel, along with the physics fun of Lunar Lander, Gravitar was pretty popular back in the day and remembered quite fondly for the challenge but it was not a commercial hit at release. Perhaps now it might do a little better?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zAeimDfxYWY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3fdc9aa1edb2cf7b3b1158048c3191df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zAeimDfxYWY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gravitar: Recharged Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Far from Home: Travel across the galaxy in arcade mode, visiting planets to progress through ever-more-challenging solar systems in a quest to get home     </li>
<li>Explore, Triumph, Repeat: Take on 24 distinct missions, aiming to climb global leaderboards and assert yourself as the ultimate space adventurer     </li>
<li>Powerful Power-Ups: Utilizing the tech at your disposal, make use of your tractor beam to grab power-ups including homing missiles and electrifying EMP disruptors     </li>
<li>Not so Lonely Anymore: No longer doomed to wander the universe alone, play with a partner in each game mode. Connect to your player two via a tether and work together to accomplish each goal and make your way home.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905430/Gravitar_Recharged" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Since Atari seem to be going back through their classics to bring out updated version, is there a particular game you want them to do next?</p>

      <title>Craftomation 101 merges survival, crafting and automation programming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the developer of while True: learn() and Learning Factory comes yet another game with programming. Craftomation 101 brings together elements of a survival game, crafting and automation.</p>
<p>The idea is to help teach visual programming in a fun way, letting you tell robots what to do while helping them to survive on a frozen planet. Your mission is to make the planet habitable so you need to build up resources, make tools, melt ice, plant trees and produce oxygen. You could do it yourself, but with an army of programmable robots, why not get them to do it?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rdaPcULSnCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ab76881a2aed9cd0562427c08805f9f4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rdaPcULSnCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in an email, the developer explained how the idea came about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically, it all started when one of us (not me) tried to create a piece of javascript to try all the craft combinations in one really nice web game. But it’s too silly to be the reason for creating a whole game (okay it was me and I was kinda close to succeeding with this javascript).</p>
<p>The other piece of this puzzle was in a huge spreadsheet with feedback from players of our previous game <strong>while True: learn()</strong>. A lot of players asked us to add more “real programming” in our next games.</p>
<p>Another thing we were inspired by was an amazing article <em>Artificial Living Plants</em> by Edward F. Moore (1956). It was dedicated to using self-replicating machines for resource mining and production (not just on Earth, but on other planets as well). Additionally I was shocked by the idea of Freeman Dyson who proposed using self-replicating machines to deliver ice from Enceladus to Mars to help with terraforming.</p>
<p>It all lead us to brainstorming: what kind of game could encompass all those amazing concepts, while showcasing programming as a really useful tool for automating various systems, small or huge?</p>
<p>To be honest, “self-replicating programmable robots used for terraforming” sounds really charming, inspiring, and awesome to us. We simply had to try and make this concept into something playable!</p>
<p>The work began in early 2021, as our artist Alex started making sketches, while Dima and Ivan were getting familiar with the Defold game engine (read below) and how it works with Spine animations.</p>
<p>But the real push for us was Ludum Dare 48, which happened in April '21. This online event suggests participants to develop their games in 48 or 72 hours sprints, and we at Luden.io have a long lasting tradition of participating in it.</p>
<p>After a short brainstorm, we decided to make a game about mining resources and investing them into something - something cool, like building a rocket! So we’ve piled up some premade art assets, ideas that could be implemented in a short period of time, and a lot of coffee - and made it into a prototype.</p>
<p>That was a glitchy, but fun little game. After reading 30+ cheerful comments with tons of kind words and meaningful feedback, we thought that the concept was worth working on.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s another big Queer Games Bundle live on itch.io for 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to support queer creators? Now is a good chance for you, while also grabbing a whole chunk of games too in the Queer Games Bundle 2022.</p>
<p>This is another example of how great the game store itch.io is, with it previously hosting multiple mega charity bundles. This one is a bit different though, since you will be <em>directly</em> supporting various developers. Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/itchio-hosting-a-huge-queer-games-bundle-2021-with-hundreds-included/" target="_blank">last year</a>, it comes in two editions with a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1404/queer-games-bundle-2022" target="_blank">main bundle</a> and a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1405/queer-games-bundle-2022-pay-what-you-can-edition" target="_blank">pay what you can</a> edition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month. </p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life changing way and in exchange you get over 500 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buying it helps support over 400 different creators and gain access to over 500 incredible varied experiences, no doubt a bit of something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>The main bundle has already raised over $20,000 at time of writing and it runs for another month so there's plenty of time to look through it.</p>

<p>Proton 7.0-3 just had a first public <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5881" target="_blank">Release Candidate build</a>, while they ask for some help testing to see if there's any major problems before rolling it out to everyone.

      <title>Hands of Necromancy is an upcoming GZDoom powered dark fantasy shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love retro shooters? How about those with a little magical flair to them and dark fantasy? The GZDoom engine powered Hands of Necromancy is coming to Steam with a teaser demo up now.</p>
<p>The developer explains that it's a metroidvania styled game, in the spirit of the classics like Heretic. Looks pretty great too, and also awesome to see more developer use the thoroughly versatile cross-platform GZDoom instead of reinventing the wheel again for a game engine that's well suited for the classic FPS style and mechanics. Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ga11coGneIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c96e7b75364f5aac2b3eb59d3abc031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ga11coGneIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore many beautiful environments - a country side, a forest, a cemetery, a castle, an ice cave, a volcano, and more - all teeming with danger to prove yourself against, as their denizens try to destroy you.</li>
<li>Get weapons, use magic spells, and learn transformations to fight your enemies, using their own abilities against them and bending nature to your own will.</li>
<li>Use the Tornado Spell to toss your enemies away with wind, or the Ring of Ice to freeze them solid, or even an Unholy Hand Grenade to blow them to smithereens!</li>
<li>Gain transformations as you grow in power - become the Swamp Serpent who can slither into tight spaces while breathing underwater, or the Stone Breaker Golem that smashes walls into tiny bits, the Hell Burner Demon that safely walks on lava, or even a flying Wyvern!</li>
<li>All of them are your key to defeating the many creatures in this metroidvania, as you explore the 21 maps in 3 giant and exciting hubs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Old Skies is an upcoming time travel adventure from Wadjet Eye Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great looking point and click adventure is on the way from Wadjet Eye Games! They just recently teased their latest called Old Skies. They also confirmed on <a href="https://twitter.com/WadjetEyeGames/status/1532053665137274880" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it will support Linux too and there will be a demo available during Steam Next Fest which happens next week.</p>
<p>"Time Travel is real and history is up for grabs! In this point-and-click, you play Fia Quinn, a time agent for the ChronoZen agency. Your job is to keep close watch on seven travelers who have the desire (and the bank accounts) to sightsee in the past. Some are simply curious. Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they’ve all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it’s vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."</p>

<p>This is looking really great! Some wonderful work on the visuals for this one.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Seven eras of history to visit! From the speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age to the morning of September 11th.</li>
<li>High resolution 1920 x 1080 graphics! That's 3x higher than Unavowed.</li>
<li>Lots of puzzles that require temporal thinking to solve.</li>
<li>Death! You CAN die in this adventure game, but time travel means you can try again. And again. And again.</li>
<li>Musical score by Thomas Regin (composer for Unavowed and the Blackwell series)</li>
<li>Full voice acting! Our largest cast yet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out their new animated short too:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck now lets you override display resolution for games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have some games on Steam Deck that won't get the right resolution? Now you can force them into what you want. This will be useful for quite a lot of retro games especially, and some that just won't behave.</p>
<p>Announced as part of a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287861418016" target="_blank">update</a>, you can now go into the Properties menu of any app on Steam Deck and select to force the resolution:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10808615751654247666gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10808615751654247666gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/564345141654247666gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/564345141654247666gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's the full update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Game Resolution setting to App Properties, allowing players to override the max display resolution for games, on a a per-game basis</li>
<li>Added mouse cursor (using right trackpad) for built-in web browser interactions when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Improved default aspect ratio behavior for external monitors - games will now default to 1280x800 for 16:10 external displays and 1280x720 for all other external displays</li>
<li>Improved UI performance in game carousels</li>
<li>Improved UI performance when connected to an external display</li>
<li>Improved controller order when using external gamepads to assign the controller slots by the order of input. This should help with compatibility in games which locked onto the Steam Deck controller.</li>
<li>Fixed 'Enable updated fan control' toggle not remembering its state across reboots</li>
<li>Fixed Bluetooth controllers not working on the lockscreen</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting issues on the Steam Deck Chord Summary page</li>
<li>Fixed issue preventing deletion of some controller layouts</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled adaptive brightness toggle, as it was causing performance and stability issues. Big thanks to the community for catching this weird bug - we're working on a fix for it now.</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<p>For regular readers this won't be news since I go over the changes often but it's still a good catch-up for those who have fallen a bit behind on the news.

<li>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth </li>
<li>Aperture Desk Job</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve was keen to point out that it's not just because of Steam Deck upgrades or Proton, but effort directly from developers too and four of those titles were previously listed as Unsupported or Playable until they got updated to be Verified. They're making a clear and obvious point: if developers get their games supported, players are more likely to buy them and spend time in them — not exactly a big surprise. Plenty of us just want to play games and not have to tinker so hopefully more will get cracking on updating their games.</p>

      <title>Splitgate the free online FPS with portals has Season 2 live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mixing together some fast-paced shooter with a bit of a Halo feel and portals like out of Valve's Portal series, Splitgate has a big new update out now.</p>
<p>While there's plenty of new content additions, one of the biggest changes is to the matchmaking system. Matchmaker 2.0 brings with it faster and smarter matchmaking with human players (less bot matches), players can now be added into an in-progress unranked match if it began less than a minute prior, players are more likely to hop directly into a match than having to be in a waiting area and much more.</p>
<p>There's also three new game modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Juggernaut </strong>(Free For All): Every player against one (hard to kill) Juggernaut selected at random. Score points by surviving as the Juggernaut.</li>
<li><strong>Hotzone </strong>(Team): Capture and control the neutral zone for 30 seconds to score a point. </li>
<li><strong>Lockdown </strong>(Team): Score a point by controlling all three hills at the same time. After each point, the hills move.</li>
</ul>
<p>A new progression system is also in, they revamped the interface, big additions to the map editor and the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/splitgate-beta-season-2-patch-notes" target="_blank">list goes on</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bLbqB6DmEfA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fce69ca6884054105f59dcbf336ea928.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bLbqB6DmEfA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game definitely feels a lot better than when I tried it previously. While it was fun before, it did have a few minor tech troubles (especially in the Linux build there were some quirks) but it seems to be thoroughly smooth now, seems like they improved it a lot overall. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Splitgate is free to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/677620/Splitgate/" target="_blank">play on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>System76 and HP bring the HP Dev One with Pop!_OS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/hp-teamed-up-with-system76-for-the-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os-linux/" target="_blank">we reported previously</a>, The HP Dev One is a new laptop collaboration from System76 and HP that brings Pop!_OS Linux to even more people. It's now available to order.</p>
<p>Quite an exciting one, as it's always good to see more vendors dip their toes into selling and supporting Linux machines directly. Not only that, it's interesting because it's one hardware vendor teaming up with another. Hopefully this is the shape of things to come with more collaboration. Right now it's only available in the USA and priced at $1,099.</p>
<p>Some key specifications:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processor</strong> - AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong> - 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR4 3200 MT/s (2 SODIMM)</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong> - 1 TB PCIe 3x4 NVMe M.2 2280 SSD</li>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong> - AMD Radeon Graphics</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong> - 14” diagonal FHD LED UWWA for HD Webcam (1920x1080) (1000 Nits)</li>
<li><strong>Audio</strong> - Dual stereo speakers, 2 multi-array microphone</li>
<li><strong>Wireless</strong> - Realtek RTL8822CE 802.11a/b/g/n/ac (2x2) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 combo</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong> - HP Smart 65 W External AC power adapter</li>
<li><strong>Ports</strong> - 2 SuperSpeed USB Type-C 10Gbps signaling rate (USB Power Delivery, DisplayPortTM 1.4); 2 SuperSpeed USB Type- A 5Gbps signaling rate (1 charging); 1 headphone/ microphone combo; 1 HDMI 2.0; 1 AC power</li>
<li><strong>Battery</strong> - HP Long Life 3-cell, 53 Wh Li-ion</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong> - 12.73 x 8.44 x 0.75 in; 32.34 x 21.46 x 1.91 cm</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“System76 is thrilled to work with HP to advance open source and bring the Linux desktop to a much wider audience,” said Carl Richell, CEO, System76. “By bringing together our engineering, marketing, and customer support, System76 with HP are introducing HP Dev One to combine powerful hardware with optimized Pop!_OS for the app dev community.”</p>
<p>“Pop!_OS development and innovation has always been a top priority for System76,” said Jeremy Soller, principal engineer, System76. “We are working to develop new features and optimize current ones into Pop!_OS at a much faster pace than previously possible.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8600261501654195858gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8600261501654195858gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>“Software developers are looking for a device that is customized and optimized for the way they code,” said Tylitha Stewart, Vice President and Global Head of Consumer Services and Subscriptions, HP Inc. “By working with System76, we are meeting this need and providing a premium experience with Linux Pop!_OS preinstalled to deliver the new HP Dev One. The device has features important to developers including an optional Linux keyboard tuned with a super key and designed to be more efficient at the core.”</p>
<p>I'm hoping to see a review unit, so keep an eye out for what I think in the coming weeks. I might also be having a chat with System76 CEO Carl Richell about it soon too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck already hits over 5% of Linux users on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out for May 2022, and while it sees a tiny drop in the overall Linux user share, we can see the Steam Deck rising up. As usual, our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> has been updated for the latest figures, with a screenshot of the current status below for all to see:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12386350071654155336gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12386350071654155336gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Currently the overall Linux share is <u>1.12%</u>. Still a pretty clear upwards trend, and drops in a couple months are to be expected as that's just how things go. No doubt it will bounce up again within a couple months. The interesting thing to see now though, is how the Steam Deck will affect it since Valve actually hooked up the survey in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-gets-per-app-performance-profiles-hardware-survey-and-loads-more/" target="_blank">recent Steam Deck update</a>.</p>
<p>When filtering to <em>just</em> Linux, here's the current top:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 12.85% +0.53%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 11.75% -2.53%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 11.09% -0.46%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 8.04% +8.04%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 5.97% -0.39%</li>
<li>"SteamOS Holo" 64 bit 5.23% +5.23%</li>
<li>Other 45.07% +6.46%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So it might look like Arch Linux is on top at a quick glance, but not quite, since you need to take into account the various versions of Ubuntu as people tend to stick to LTS releases for years. The real interesting thing to see though is <strong>SteamOS Holo</strong>, which is the Arch-based Steam Deck operating system already hitting well over 5% of Linux users on Steam. Not only that, the Steam Deck GPU "AMD AMD Custom GPU 0405" is shown as the second most popular already for just Linux systems on Steam.</p>
<p>Using May's 1.12% share, that puts Linux users at around ~1,478,400 estimated "monthly active users" based on the last time Valve gave out their user data. You could say that to be around ~77,320 Steam Deck users, although keep in mind it’s an additional device for a lot of people, it depends where the survey is taken. The actual number is likely higher.</p>

      <title>Valve delay the Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a move that's not exactly unexpected, Valve has now delayed the launch of the official Steam Deck Docking Station.</p>
<p>Written in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3328736287857025157" target="_blank">official update</a>, the Valve team said it was due to both a shortage of parts and closures at their manufacturing facility due to COVID. No further date has been given and they said they will share more info when they have it. The good news though is that the schedule for shipping the actual Steam Deck is not affected as it's different parts and a different factory responsible for it.</p>
<p>Valve ended the post by mentioning how they continue to improve the "docked experience for Steam Deck with all USB-C hubs and external displays".</p>
<p>Right now, the docked experience isn't the best. For all the pros the Steam Deck has, the docked experience is something of a sore spot. It's a mixture of things between issues in the KDE Plasma desktop when connecting up external monitors, to resolution issues in Gaming Mode when docked. The problems are all solvable and for the most part it works but there's a lot of quirks left to solve. Valve may not have said so, but it's likely also a big factor in the decision not to release it yet.</p>
<p>If you are after a USB Hub that works well, I've used <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B099F6R6TC/" target="_blank">this</a> for months now and it has been working nicely for me.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect - Gangs DLC and free Kite update announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox and Double Eleven have announced the Prison Architect: Gangs expansion, along with the free Kite update. Here's what to expect from it.</p>
<p>I don't think this exactly needs much of an explanation does it? I think we all know what a gang is huh? Inmates will now form up, with different groups having their own personality and reputation inside your prison. As gangs grow and flex their power, things might get a little bit heated. Thankfully, you get a few new tricks to deal with them too.</p>
<p>Gangs DLC Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meet the gang: </strong>Gangs form and grow by gang members arriving by in-take or by recruitment. Each gang has its own personality and traits, and will naturally be drawn to recruiting prisoners with the same specific attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> Now you can measure your inmates and your prison’s “temperature”. As gangs grow and begin to flex their strength, the 'danger temperature' of your prison will rise. Thanks to the 'Boiling point' UI, you get a detailed overview of what's affecting the life of your inmates, allowing you to act swiftly, keeping them happy, and preventing irrepressible riots.</li>
<li><strong>Reform and release:</strong> Gang members are now allowed to leave their crew, help them come clean by removing their tattoos and enrolling them in the Gang Rehabilitation Program.</li>
<li><strong>New rooms: </strong>Use the Tattoo Removal Room to remove gangs' tattoos, or have gang members train in the Fight Club Room, turning their destructive energy into fighting in a controlled environment.</li>
<li><strong>Crooked guards: </strong>Gangs may coerce guards into smuggling contraband or accepting bribes. You can vet guards during the hiring process (Bureaucracy) as well as recruit C.I.s to identify guards that have turned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their brief and not very useful announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="54LgqxKijmo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b490b6fae8bed6e323f5a59996e748c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/54LgqxKijmo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Gangs introduces a whole slew of creative challenges for Wardens to overcome. While it sounds intimidating, the Gangs expansion keeps things fun and light-hearted for our players," says Gaz Wright, Game Director on Prison Architect at Double Eleven. “We designed the reformation features to feel authentic while giving wardens clever options to handle gangs and increase their population's happiness. Gangs expands Prison Architect's management gameplay and adds enjoyable new mechanics, offering players a fuller and more fun gaming experience."</p>
<p>Due to release "soon" but no actual date given yet.</p>
<p>The free Kite expansion releasing at the same time will add in more wardens, guard dogs, room sizes, prison capacity options, improvements to the game menus and tweaks to other mechanics.</p>

      <title>Golfie mixes together minigolf with a deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've seen a few attempts to spice-up Golf like Golf with Your Friends which is great but how about blending it together with a deck-building card game? Golfie is the answer to that. Note: key provided for me. It works out of the box on Linux desktop and the Steam Deck, thanks to Steam Play Proton.</p>
<p>"Deckbuilding meets minigolf in Golfie – the only game in which you can power-up and modify realtime golf shots by collecting and crafting a deck of cards."</p>
<p>It's the game you know (and love?) but with the main quirk being your shots can be changed and warped with cards. You will need to use them too, as the courses are quite varied and need you to hop over obstacles or shoot around corners. It mostly works too and there's a lot of replay value here.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i8cjYU9nbPo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6298f6a1d4ea8f52e56f7782406ccfb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i8cjYU9nbPo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a pretty great idea actually, and with it being in Early Access it has plenty of room to grow and tweak the cards and the maps available to expand on the initial set. The developer expects to keep it in Early Access for around 9 months with plans to add in new cards, power-ups, course options and modes.</p>
<p>Like any good deck-builder, you get an initial set of cards and it does take a good few runs to really get into it but thanks to the unlocks system you can really do some ridiculous stuff with the cards. Hovering your ball in the air with a jetpack, to smash it across the course is always hilarious.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Four distinct biomes such as Cherry Garden and the Dungeon to pitch and putt your way through</li>
<li>Procedurally generated nature of each hole, meaning no two courses are the same</li>

      <title>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom gets a Steam Deck update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom from Game Atelier and DG Entertainment recently gained a small but sweet update to improve gameplay on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While it's currently tagged as "Unsupported" by Valve, this should hopefully bump it up to fully Verified. It previously had an issue where all the button mapping icons where broken. This latest update adds full support for the Steam Deck controls, and additionally adds in native 16:10 aspect ratio support too. Thanks to that update, Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom should now be a great experience on Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Six awesome forms</strong> with unique combat and platforming abilities to make your adventure exciting from start to finish.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock new paths and secrets with special equipment:</strong> look for magic weapons and items that gradually open up the world.</li>
<li><strong>Over 15 hours of epic adventure:</strong> explore the new Monster World in a vast interconnected environment.</li>
<li><strong>Hand Drawn animations:</strong> characters and enemies come to life with detailed animations and fun facial expressions.</li>
<li><strong>Soundtrack from iconic Japanese composers:</strong> Yuzo Koshiro, Motoi Sakuraba, Michiru Yamane, Keiki Kobayashi and Takeshi Yanagawa.</li>

      <title>Steam Client Update released with Remote Play improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a small <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/139004" target="_blank">update</a> to the stable version of the Steam Client, with it mostly being about fixing up Remote Play. It's not a big surprise to see the focus on Remote Play right now with the Steam Deck, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2 update</a> bringing full Remote Play Together compatibility for the Deck too.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved desktop capture quality on Windows, now supporting variable framerates</li>
<li>Fixed crash on Windows when the stream resolution is changed</li>
<li>Fixed streaming connections failing after Steam has been restarted</li>
<li>Fixed Remote Play Together dialogs occasionally not resizing correctly</li>
<li>Fixed color quality when streaming from Linux to Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS/Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed game install/update failing for Steam libraries installed on a filesystem that does not support preallocation (e.g. ExFAT, FAT32)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see the Linux fixes there too, another reason to love the Steam Deck as it means other parts of Steam / Linux keep getting fixed up.</p>

      <title>Try out the demo for Ragtag Crew, a turn-based tactical rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo arriving as part of the DreamHack Beyond event, Ragtag Crew seems like a promising upcoming turn-based tactical rogue-lite to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>Plenty of options to build up a full squad of scavengers, that you will send across a wasteland in pursuit of profit, food and lots of battles too of course. The developer mentions that each class not only has the usual differing abilities but also a little personality thrown into the mix that will provide an "unrepeatable adventure", as the combat is broken up by little events and each choice you make changes the history of your squad with a big pool of events to pull from.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NyB_RIHGG18"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3b960ef5ed7bf64f22df3329d28393e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NyB_RIHGG18" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Each run, choose 3 characters out of 8 classes (some unlockable). Experiment with synergies and party compositions to slay everyone in your way!</li>
<li>Every character can choose a personality from the 7 available (some unlockable). These influence their dialogue, battle capabilities, relationships, morale, stats, and overall style — but most importantly, they can drastically change the course of events.</li>
<li>The heart of the game lies in the tough tactical fights. The enemies are strong, but often have flaws to exploit. Adapt, improve, overcome!</li>
<li>Slay bosses… or sneak past. These large and unique enemies come with their own mechanics and storylines. The rewards may be game-changing — but are you in a good enough condition to take them on? Sometimes it’s smarter to walk past a fight.</li>
<li>As you progress through the game, more options become available.</li>
<li>Every node on the map offers a text event. A smart choice can grant you loot, help two characters form a bond, or hint at the deeper truth behind the events. An unsuccessful one might end in a disaster.</li>
<li>Over the course of an adventure the party members will grow to become friends… or bitter enemies. Nudge their stories to receive unique events and outcomes!</li>
<li>From cute baby lizards to passionate fighter-pilgrims, all kinds of characters may aid you on your journey.</li>
<li>A mixture of post-apoc, Westerns, and sci-fi creates a relatable yet original world. "Firefly meets Douglas Adams."</li>
<li>Try again. Most bands of misfits fail — this is a roguelite, after all. But even failed runs bring progress in the form of unlockable classes, personalities, and items. You’ll be better equipped next time — and the game’s high variance offers high replayability.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Demo available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/882590/Ragtag_Crew/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's due for release later this year with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Fate of Iberia is out along with a free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best strategy games around has grown with the Crusader Kings III: Fate of Iberia DLC now available, along with the usual Paradox free update for all players. Paradox call it a "flavor pack", so it's not quite a full expansion but has enough new content that looks like it may be worth picking up.</p>
<p>"A centuries long Struggle will force you to rethink how to achieve your goals, as a variety of interested and competing parties fight to impose their will on the Iberian Peninsula."</p>
<p>Features in the DLC include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Struggle system: Entirely new system for historic conflict, available to modders and other content creators.</li>
<li>Decide the Fate of Iberia: Choose the path of conciliation or the path of conquest as you unite Spain or, alternately, agree to a peaceful division of spoils.</li>
<li>New content: Two new Legacy tracks (Metropolitan and Coterie), new cultural traits emphasizing special historical characteristics of the Iberian peninsula, new friendship interactions and duels over the chessboard.</li>
<li>New Events: Dynamic historical events related to the struggle for Iberia.</li>
<li>New Art: New character art reflecting Iberian cultures of the medieval era, new unit designs, new 3D models of holdings and artifacts  and a host of new art for backgrounds, events and loading.</li>
<li>New Music: Additions to the Crusader Kings III soundtrack.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 515.48.07 out now, Gamescope improvements and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA released a brand new stable driver release for Linux, building on the previous Beta that released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">along with their new open source kernel modules</a>. Version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/189809/en-us" target="_blank">515.48.07</a> contains all on the updates from the 515.43.04 Beta, along with some additional improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog:</p>
<div class="tabcontent" id="tab1_content" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Published the source code to a variant of the NVIDIA Linux kernel modules dual-licensed as MIT/GPLv2. The source is available here:<br/>
	https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules<br/>
	and will be updated each driver release. Please see the "Open Linux Kernel Modules" chapter in the README for details.</li>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf and VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier Vulkan extensions. To use this functionality, the nvidia-drm kernel module must be loaded with DRM KMS mode setting enabled. See the DRM KMS section of the README for guidance on enabling mode setting.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-suspend.service, nvidia-resume.service, and nvidia-hibernate.service to use WantedBy= rather than RequiredBy= dependencies for systemd-suspend.service and systemd-hibernate.service. This avoids a problem where suspend or hibernate fails if the NVIDIA driver is uninstalled without disabling these services first.<br/>
	See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/21991<br/>
	If these services were manually enabled, it may be necessary to update their dependencies by running<br/>
	sudo systemctl reenable nvidia-suspend.service nvidia-resume.service nvidia-hibernate.service</li>
<li>Interlaced modes are now disabled when active stereo is enabled.</li>
<li>NVIDIA X Server Settings will now display the quit confirmation dialog automatically if only there are pending changes that need to be manually saved. The corresponding configuration option to control the appearance of the quit dialog was thus also removed.</li>
<li>Removed the warning message about mismatches between the compiler used to build the Linux kernel and the compiler used to build the NVIDIA kernel modules from nvidia-installer. Modern compilers are less likely to cause problems when this type of mismatch occurs, and it has become common in many distributions to build the Linux kernel with a different compiler than the default system compiler.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to skip test-loading the kernel modules on systems where no supported NVIDIA GPUs are detected.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to avoid a race condition which could cause the kernel module test load to fail due to udev automatically loading kernel modules left over from an existing NVIDIA driver installation. This failure resulted in an installation error message "Kernel module load error: File exists".</li>
<li>Updated the RTD3 Video Memory Utilization Threshold (NVreg_DynamicPowerManagementVideoMemoryThreshold) maximum value from 200 MB to 1024 MB.</li>
<li>Improved performance of GLX and Vulkan applications running in gamescope.</li>
<li>Added a "kernelopen" feature tag to the supported-gpus.json file, to indicate which GPUs are compatible with open-gpu-kernel-modules.</li>
<li>Improved Vulkan swapchain creation failure reporting. Applications can use the VK_EXT_debug_utils extension to receive additional information when an error was encountered in vkCreateSwapchainKHR().</li>
<li>Added a new configuration option for NVIDIA NGX to allow disabling the DSO signature check. See the "NGX" chapter of the README for more information.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where HDMI audio output was not working in some cases, especially with high display refresh rates (120Hz, 100Hz, etc.) using Fixed Rate Link (FRL) transmission mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be fantastic once <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> works fully with NVIDIA, as it's one of the absolutely most useful projects around. Used by the Steam Deck, it fully controls the window for games so they don't mess with your system at all. Great for multi-monitor uses too, as lots of games like to misbehave. It also provides some added extras to allow you to control scaling, add in FSR and more. This driver is another step towards it.</p>

      <title>In the relaxing sim Sprout Valley you&#39;re a cute cat farming a tiny island</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sprout Valley looks quite sweet. A game where you play as Nico, a cute cat that has stepped away from their busy life to clean up a tiny island and create a nice farm. One I missed that had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zefrost/sprout-valley-chill-and-relaxing-experience" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> that finished earlier this month.</p>
<p>It's like a mini accessible animal-based Stardew Valley. You plant and water your crops, collect resources and sell them to keep progressing. There's a dynamic weather system, which the developer said will add-in some additional mechanics to the game too. What really makes it interesting is that each island is procedurally generated with a seed system, so you can play through the game an endless amount of times and share world seeds with others.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ecUjzb5D4T0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d6a0253213e77f05ea30e1560e74f06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ecUjzb5D4T0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said it will also feature an events system, a full storyline, foraging, fishing, multiple islands, a quest system, an upgrades system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Looks like one we're going to need to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>You can try out the experimental builds from <a href="https://zefrost.itch.io/sprout-valley" target="_blank">itch.io</a> right now and wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1964820/Sprout_Valley/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Made with Godot Engine, it offers Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Crystal Project is a wonderful new RPG you need to pick up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love classic JRPGs? Final Fantasy? Or anything like it? Well, Crystal Project released recently from developer Andrew Willman and it's quite wonderful.</p>
<p>It arrived on Steam back at the end of March, which somehow I missed actually covering even though I have been playing it and enjoying it thoroughly. Bringing back fond memories of playing through some classics on Game Boy Advance it really does scratch the itch for some adventuring and exploration. Seems most players on Steam agree too, with it seeing a Very Positive rating and the developer has a Native Linux build too that seems to work to perfection.</p>
<p>There's two things that really pull you in with Crystal Project. The first being the graphics with it mixing in flat-looking pixel characters in a 3D world that resembles Minecraft / Minecraft Dungeons in the presentation. Then there's the non-linear nature to it, as you're free to explore at your own pace and do what you want.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rr3T1Kdhtiw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d9d754ea4ab9e3b28de7638183aa7ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rr3T1Kdhtiw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No random encounters!</li>
<li>Manage Threat to control which party member a monster will attack.</li>
<li>No hidden information. Preview turn order, damage, and probabilities like in TRPGs.</li>
<li>Discover and unlock new classes.</li>
<li>Assign sub-classes, pick passive abilities, and equip all kinds of special items.</li>
<li>Invent unique team compositions, or stick to the MMORPG Holy Trinity.</li>
<li>No permanent missables!</li>
<li>Seamless transitions between zones with no loading screens anywhere.</li>
<li>Uncover the mysteries of the world all on your own.</li>
<li>Metroidvania-style progression.</li>
<li>No invisible walls! Try to jump and climb anywhere you want.</li>
<li>Overcome platforming challenges to discover neat loot... and other stuff.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also Steam Deck Verified with the Native Linux version of the game. Absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>You can buy Crystal Project on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637730/Crystal_Project/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>ROTA is a cute and colourful gravity-bending puzzle-platformer worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It might look colourful and inviting but don't let that fool you, ROTA is going to test your brain with its gravity-defying puzzle mechanics.</p>
<p>As you walk over the edge of each section, you begin to rotate gravity and then use pushing, pulling and rotating mechanics with blocks to get through each stage and solve the puzzles. Gravity affects the blocks you use too, and you need to position them in the right place to get over various obstacles.</p>
<p>It's simple and effective but the developer was pretty creative with the setting to the point that it will keep you interested, while also make you scratch your head a few times with the added challenging of collecting all the gems. If you love puzzle-platformers, it's definitely one you need to take a look at.</p>

      <title>SCS put the Heart of Russia DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 on hold for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Software have put out a statement about the Heart of Russia upcoming DLC for Euro Truck Simulator 2 and they've decided not to release it. With the ongoing barbaric invasion of Ukraine from Russia, it's not exactly surprising that releasing a DLC expansion for a game that's focused on Russia might cause problems.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/05/heart-of-russia-dlc-statement.html" target="_blank">statement</a>, SCS mentioned how they "try to be as apolitical as possible" but in this case, they simply could not stay silent on it "with so many people suffering, we decided to refrain from releasing the DLC so that it is not perceived in any way as being in support of or tolerance of the aggression".</p>
<p>Sounds like it's not completely cancelled though, as they will hold onto it until Ukraine can "rebuild and heal" so they will then "endeavour to find a way for our Heart of Russia DLC to play whatever part it can in that healing process, for everyone".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20980082261653929649gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A tough situation for SCS to navigate through, considering all the effort they put into their work and their DLC are usually quite well received too due to the work they put in to capture the essence of the areas they add in.</p>
<p>You can buy ETS2 from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/euro-truck-simulator-2?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Indie classic Super Hexagon gets a big free Neo update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Hexagon, a true indie gem classic from Terry Cavanagh has a big update out now and it has also become Steam Deck Verified with it. Previously available in Beta, it's now in the Stable branch for all players.</p>
<p>While the gameplay is the same, a lot of the tech behind the game was rewritten to perform better, along with much improved gamepad / controller support. This is only the start too, with a Part 2 coming at some point that has also been teased. Developer Ethan Lee wrote some comments about the work involved on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1531298835368005632" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and you can see the <a href="https://superhexagon.com/neo/" target="_blank">Neo update page</a> for the full details.</p>

      <title>The QuickLaunch plugin for the Steam Deck is a great time-saver</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Deck you can install various third-party games and applications in desktop mode. However, it's a bit annoying adding them all to Steam and so the QuickLaunch plugin can save you some time.</p>
<p>Making great use of the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a>, this <a href="https://github.com/Fisch03/SDH-QuickLaunch" target="_blank">QuickLaunch</a> plugin gives you a list in the Quick Launch menu of all your installed Flatpak applications on the Steam Deck (those you install via the Discover software store). Simple brilliance. No need to add each individually to Steam, no need for another app to keep adding them when you install something new, just an always up to date list via a plugin.</p>
<p>Here's a quick demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B3pqt6ANcDA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9955c271a58d4ed71e36bdb3e702a76c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B3pqt6ANcDA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's various other plugins <a href="https://plugins.deckbrew.xyz/" target="_blank">available</a> including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerTools - for even more performance tweaks.</li>
<li>SDH-Bluetooth - quickly connect to an already paired bluetooth device.</li>
<li>Mopidy-Controller - controller for the Mopidy music server, with tile view, tracklist view and playlist picker.</li>
<li>spdck - spotify controls</li>
<li>+ plenty more appearing</li>

      <title>Survival game Rust might be playable properly on Linux and Steam Deck soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rust, the massively popular and quite brutal survival game from Facepunch Studios is working towards Easy Anti-Cheat support for Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>This has been a long-time coming, as they previously removed support for their Native Linux build but confirmed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/garry-newman-of-facepunch-mentions-working-with-eac-for-rust-on-linux-with-proton/" target="_blank">back in July of 2021</a> that they were working on getting it running properly for the Steam Deck. In a fresh update reply to a user on Twitter asking about Easy Anti-Cheat, Facepunch head Garry Newman <a href="https://twitter.com/garrynewman/status/1531235676653510657" target="_blank">mentioned</a> how "They're working on it, maybe next month if it turns out to be stable enough".</p>
<p>Good news for fans of Rust and Linux / Steam Deck, considering it is still one of the most popular games on Steam and has remained so for years.</p>

Seeking a partner to play with, you join a team of players who hang out at Good Clean Fun, a combination pizzeria / laundromat / arcade. It's up to you to rally the team, learning more about who they are and how best to support their dreams along the way. Defeat rivals, conquer tournaments, build relationships, and uncover a strange arcade conspiracy as your team walks the road to victory!"</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher gets more Steam Deck and Flatpak improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> for Epic Games and GOG on Linux and Steam Deck has a new update out, mostly focused on cleaning up some problems but also sprinkles in some new features like a command-line interface.</p>
<p>This free and open source app has quickly become the go-to for running any games on Linux from Epic and GOG. especially as neither of them offer an official Linux client.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6369059551653908359gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6369059551653908359gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Version 2.3.4 Main Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a CLI parameter <code class="inline-code">--no-gui</code> that opens Heroic with no user interface. Might get in handy to create some scripts or add a Heroic game on other launchers. Basically, you just need to call <code class="inline-code">heroic --no-gui heroic://launch/{appName}</code>.</li>
<li>Added more feedback on errors and fixed some error messages that were not exactly clear.</li>
<li>Now it's possible to pass any wrappers on the Environmental Variable sections. Might be good to some advanced users.</li>
<li>[Linux] Heroic now will search for Proton versions and Runtimes outside the main library, so in any other drive or partition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Main Fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Linux/SteamDeck] Several fixes related to the Steam runtime and Proton.</li>
<li>[General] Fixes Force Download and Force Upload of Cloud saves not working properly.</li>
<li>[Linux/SteamDeck] Fix Winetricks on Flatpak/SteamDeck for good now.</li>
<li>[General] Fix GOG games not running the setup correctly;</li>
<li>[Linux/Mac] Fix the Windows version of a native GOG game not working properly</li>
<li>[macOS] Heroic will check if the crossover bottle exists before launching now.</li>
<li>[macOS] Fix Installing games on the folder with spaces.</li>
<li>[General] Library Refresh now will refresh only that specific library, making it more responsive.</li>
<li>[General] Fixes some styling issues across the settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Shortly after version 2.3.5 landed with these adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable most verbosity since several dialogs with false positives were being shown.</li>
<li>Fix corrupted config message on Windows.</li>
<li>Fix Library is not showing after log in with epic games.</li>
<li>Disabled auto-update on macOS</li>
</ul>

      <title>Crazy rogue-lite &#39;Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS&#39; adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for trying out a new rogue-lite that looks completely bizarre? Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS looks pretty hilarious and now it has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Not only does it look completely insane, the developer's description of the game is equally ridiculous that doesn't really tell you too much about the game. The developer says "What sets Wally the game apart is it's attitude. Wally is the weird kid in middle school who Naruto runs in between classes. It's weird, wholesome and confident in itself. It's that confidence that is omni-present in pretty much every part of the game. It's also not afraid of going to extremes in order to make a point or to make a good joke!" — okay then.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s1C92vDVUwI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7432359d329a1337cf3293feac3ec570.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s1C92vDVUwI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Game Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daily Twists</strong>, These Daily/Weekly runs we introduce crazy twists every day! Start one daily run with maximum movement speed or start a run over encumbered with bombs. Compete with 600+ members of our discord community!</li>
<li>Local <strong>COOP </strong>which means you only need one copy of Wally to enjoy with a friend!</li>
<li>10 <strong>Dungeons</strong></li>
<li><strong>150+</strong> different Upgrades/Curses/Weapons/Quests/Daily Twists. With so many stack able passives interacting with each other it'll take years to see every combination.</li>
<li>5 Single Player Run types</li>
<li>5 Boss fights that will make you say, WHAT THE HECK IS THAT</li>
<li>Branching paths, get as greedy as much as you want, do you want to trade all your max health and become a glass cannon? Why the heck not!</li>
<li>True Ending, (It's a mystery to everyone what it is)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Have to admit though, it does look and sound <u>really</u> good. Seems it also went quite unnoticed with the original release in 2019, with only 129 Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1077450/view/3308469454281066650" target="_blank">announcement</a> about the Linux version the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wally and the FANTASTIC PREDATORS now has native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Oh, also Steam Auto Cloud saves (set up to be cross-platform) and even Steam Input.</p>
<p>These changes should allow for a smooth Steam Deck experience right out of the box, such as savedata syncing between your main machine and your Deck and also easy control rebinding.</p>
<p>As for now, we don't have a "Steam Deck Verified" rating, but the Linux build has been tested to work on Ubuntu 64-Bit LTS releases.</p>
<p>If anything, tell your Deck to run the default Linux build.</p>
<p>To prevent any odd-looking behavior, the Linux version will always start in fullscreen if it's in Big Picture or Deck mode by default, even if you've synced savedata with your main machine.</p>

      <title>Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ comes to PC, works on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SEGA decide to drop out of nowhere Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+ on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761390/Hatsune_Miku_Project_DIVA_Mega_Mix/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The good news is that thanks to Proton, it works out of the box on Linux and Steam Deck. A very popular rhythm game series, so to see it arrive on PC is awesome. Not that I'm any good at it mind you, or that I've ever personally played one in the series before but I tried it for science.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><u><strong>Over 170 Songs</strong></u> - Project DIVA debuts on PC with over 170 playable songs, each accompanied by a unique music video. Get into classics like “Melt” and “Cendrillon” plus new favorites like “Catch The Wave”!</li>
<li><u><strong>Endless Customization</strong></u> - Dress Miku and friends from head to toe in over 500 dazzling hairstyles, costumes, and accessories. Costumes can be tailored to every music video, making for endless possibilities.</li>
<li><strong><u>Swap Visual Styles in One Click</u></strong> - Switch between two visual styles for different experiences. Enjoy the pop of the “Mega Mix” style or the gloss of the high-fidelity “Future Tone” style, and change it up anytime.</li>
<li><u><strong>Custom T-Shirt Editor</strong></u> - Let Miku kickstart your fashion designer career on the big stage! Draw your own T-shirt from front to back, then debut it in a performance.</li>
<li><u><strong>Custom Playlists</strong></u> - You’re the director of this concert! Curate a playlist to perfection, hit play, and let the customized music videos roll in this cinematic experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a little look at it running directly on a Steam Deck:</p>

<p><em>I might be terrible at it but hey it works well and looks great.</em></p>
<p>Also tested it running just fine on my Fedora 36 desktop, both tested with Proton 7 and no issues encountered. Overall it seems like the Windows port running through Proton is looking really good, so clearly the developer did well and hopefully more will come to PC in future.</p>

      <title>Modern twin-stick cave-flyer &#39;Gravity Ace&#39; is out now and it&#39;s great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days when games were a lot simpler, and you had various attempts at cave-flying? Well, I do and the new release Gravity Ace brings back some fun memories while making a modern spin.</p>
<p>A love letter to the likes of  Thrust and Gravitar, Gravity Ace has you pilot a ship through tight corridoors and avoid various obstacles and enemies. It's slick and it looks pretty great too with it's sort-of messy pixel-art style with lots of vibrant colours and effects going on. This isn't just a standard gravity-fighting 2D game though, as it's also a twin-stick shooter and a pretty good one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="89GQepJgNUA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d16d24610a52c30d85dccf8ac94c97d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/89GQepJgNUA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite challenging actually, since it makes heavy use of physics simulation. Everything that can move uses the physics engine, so you really have to watch out. Boost too fast at the wrong moment and you're done for. There's also a built-in level editor so you can make your own levels and full campaigns, along with being able to share them with others.</p>
<p>While the type of gameplay it offers is very much a small niche now since games have moved onto so many different genres and styles, Gravity Ace should be top of your list if this is the type of game you want to play. Not just for nostalgia but because it's a good arcade-like experience.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003860/Gravity_Ace/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://jotson.itch.io/gravity" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Corsair driver and UI for Linux ckb-next version 0.5.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have some fancy Corsair hardware that you want to tweak on Linux? You need the <a href="https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next" target="_blank">ckb-next</a> project, which has a new release out with version 0.5.0. With an aim to reproduce the features from the proprietary Corsair CUE software for Linux, it's filling a gap where the official vendor doesn't offer proper support.</p>
<p>With v0.5.0 these are newly supported on Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Katar Pro</li>
<li>Katar Pro XT</li>
<li>Glaive Pro</li>
<li>M55</li>
<li>K60 Pro RGB</li>
<li>K60 Pro RGB Low Profile</li>
<li>K60 Pro RGB SE</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also now a German translation and device previews can be resized. More importantly though perhaps, is that there's quite a lot of big bug fixes in this release including these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Scroll wheels are now treated as axes (Responsiveness should be improved for specific mice)</li>
<li>The lights on the K95 RGB Platinum top bar are now updated correctly</li>
<li>An infinite loop is prevented if certain USB information can not be read</li>
<li>GUI no longer crashes on exit under certain conditions</li>
<li>Mouse scrolling works again when combined with specific libinput versions</li>
<li>The daemon no longer hangs when quitting due to LED keyboard indicators</li>
<li>The lighting programming key can now be rebound on K95 Legacy</li>
<li>Animations won't break due to daylight savings / system time changes</li>
<li>GUI doesn't crash when switching to a hardware mode on a fresh installation</li>
<li>Daemon no longer causes a kernel Oops on resume under certain conditions (Devices now resume correctly from sleep)</li>
<li>Window detection is more reliable and works correctly on system boot</li>
<li>Settings tab now stretches correctly</li>
<li>Profile switch button can now be bound correctly on mice</li>
<li>ISO Enter key is now aligned correctly</li>
<li>Bindings are now consistent between demo and new modes</li>
<li>Firmware update dialog is no longer cut off and can be resized</li>
<li>RGB data won't be sent to the daemon when brightness is set to 0%</li>
</ul>

      <title>Get some classics working better on Steam Deck with Luxtorpeda upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a Steam Play tool (like Proton) but for running various Native Linux games engines. A fresh update is out, further improving Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>If you want to play some classics like Morrowind with OpenMW, X-COM: UFO Defense with openXcom, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 with OpenRCT2 (and <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">many more</a>) — Luxtorpeda is your friend. You would set Luxtorpeda as the Steam Play compatibility tool for those example games, and it then does the magic for you of downloading the Native Linux game engines for them, useful if those game engines are more up to date for modern systems and enhancements (which they usually are).</p>
<p>For the latest update here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade dependencies and code cleanup</li>
<li>Add logging to file if <code class="inline-code">LUX_WRITE_LOGGING=1</code> is set. The log will be written to <code class="inline-code">~/.local/state/luxtorpeda/luxtorpeda.log</code></li>
<li>Remove Steam Controller direct connection logic, relying on steam input instead. Steam Controller will still work in keyboard/mouse simulation mode. This makes it easier to maintain along with the steam deck support</li>
<li>Added support for Steam Deck gamepad controls. Gamepad support relies on the steam input settings. If steam input for the game is set as a gamepad, then will show controller icons and work as a controller. Otherwise, can use the touchscreen as a mouse</li>
<li>Detect if running on steam deck and set <code class="inline-code">LUX_STEAM_DECK=1</code> environment variable</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So now, if you have a game in Steam Input set to gamepad, it will actually detect that properly and allow you to use the gamepad prompts for the Luxtorpeda downloading and configuration UI in Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck thanks to this.</p>
<p>On top of that, the developer has been going through what games and game engines are supported, to give them some default configurations (like screen resolution) for the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Valve say they will look into fixing up the bot problems in Team Fortress 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally, after multiple years of problems, Valve seem to be getting back on the horse for Team Fortress 2 development to deal with the big bot problem.</p>
<p>All across Twitter recently there's been a big storm from TF2 fans about the issue, as Valve has seemingly ignored it for quite some time now. It was getting hard to come across posts about anything to do with Steam and Valve that didn't have players complaining about it. Rightly so, it's a huge problem, bots have been ruining the game.</p>
<p>Valve took to Twitter to the official TF2 account to say <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__e7agx3km9ot" lang="en">TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the first Twitter post from the TF2 team in years, and the official TF2 website hasn't said anything about the issues.</p>
<p>Considering TF2 is one of the games that helped to push Steam's popularity, and continues to this day being one of the most popular games on Steam, hopefully Valve really will actually solve it this time. They tried a few times across 2020 and 2021 to deal with it, but all they did is slow the bots down for a while and they all came back in force.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.2 out for Steam Deck — better fan curves, refresh rate switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a huge Stable update for SteamOS with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3297210455204145216" target="_blank">version 3.2</a> now available for updating on your Steam Deck. Here's what's new. A lot of this isn't exactly new-news, since it's pushing out most of the changes from the Beta you could opt into at any point. </p>
<p>SteamOS 3.2 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an OS-controlled fan curve to improve the experience in low usage scenarios, and adjusting how the fan responds to different scenarios and temperatures.
	<ul>
<li>The old version of the fan curve is still available, and can be turned on in Settings &gt; System</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for changing the in-game screen refresh rate. The refresh rate will automatically be adjusted to the desired option when going in and out of game.
	<ul>
<li>There is a new slider in the Quick Access Menu &gt; Performance tab that allows you to choose a screen refresh rate between 40-60Hz</li>
<li>The framerate limit slider values will update accordingly, and will include 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, or uncapped framerate options.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with typing the € key using the Steam keyboard</li>
<li>Performance HUD now shows a more accurate reading of VRAM used (previously would cap out at 1G used)</li>
<li>Added more internal screen resolution options for games to choose from</li>
<li>Fixed gain staging, resulting in higher max speaker volume, and removes white noise coming through 3.5mm jack with some headphones.</li>
<li>Fixed PipeWire and Steam failing to elevate their thread priorities</li>
<li>Fixed the language dropdown in the Warframe launcher</li>
<li>microSD card formatting process now performs a quick format</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally though, there's also the Steam Deck Client update that came along with it. This includes now full and proper support for Remote Play Together. So you will be able to host and join games using that feature. As a reminder, it allows one person who owns a game to let others join, who get it streamed from the host.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a notification if the Steam Deck SSD hits below 2GB space, you can name controller layout commands, you can connect to hidden wireless networks, there's icons for gamepad and mouse commands shown on in-game virtual menus and even the ability to close a window if the game / app you're running has more than one visible (an update to the window-switcher).</p>
<p>The fan changes really are the biggest thing here though. One of the fans the Steam Deck ships with is far louder than the other, with a high-pitch that comes with it. This new fan curve is massively quieter and just makes the experience so much nicer overall.</p>
<p>Second being the refresh rate switching, not to be confused with dynamic refresh rate, as this allows you to switch to a specific-set refresh rate like 40Hz. As Valve explained on that part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So 30hz = 33.33 ms/frame, and 60hz = 16.66ms/frame. Meanwhile, 40hz is 25 ms/frame. So while it might seem a bit counter intuitive, 40fps is exactly half-way between 30 fps and 60 fps in terms of update speed, and as such looks and feels far more responsive than 30fps. Generally speaking you always want a very stable frame pacing. So having a rock solid 40hz is better than oscillating between 42 and 48 hz, especially if your screen refresh is 60hz. This is because you're only actually getting a new frame each 1/60th of a second, so every time you miss, you get a double frame, leading to judder.</p>
<p>So a rock solid 40fps in game, with a 40hz updating screen, means every frame is a new frame and as a result it can feel smoother than an inconsistent framerate with a higher screen refresh. In addition, locking framerate lower puts less demand on the system and thus saves battery. While 40hz will use more battery than 30hz, it will use less than a game capped at a higher refresh, while still giving a subjectively far higher quality of an experience comparitively.</p>

      <title>Beautiful musical puzzle-adventure Sonority is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Musical puzzle-adventure game Sonority is out now from Hanging Gardens Interactive and Application Systems Heidelberg. I took a look so you know what to expect. Note: key provided by the publisher.</p>
<p>Set in a world where music is magic, you set off on a journey to help heal a friend and use the power of music to overcome many obstacles in your way. Here's the thing — I'm completely terrible at having any kind of rhythm, and musically I don't have the tiniest bit of talent, so I had no idea what to expect from such a musical adventure. The developers said that "no previous musical knowledge necessary", so I really put it to the test and thankfully it wasn't overly confusing, relatively simple but still beautiful in the presentation.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efu8HLs9-fo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9299f29b9f8246c83ace8423afe15890.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efu8HLs9-fo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As you go through the game you explore different areas, each having a few different sets of puzzles. A lot of it is about moving blocks around to access other areas, or to bring down barriers. You do this by collecting and then playing various notes on a pan flute while you're next to various stones that capture the note — then you run the puzzle sequence and see what happens. You can do each puzzle as many times as you like, until you get it right.</p>
<p>The notes are simple to play too, as it's just one-note per-key and you can pick between using letters or numbers on keyboard and they're spread across various buttons on a gamepad. Although the notes at the bottom of the screen don't show gamepad prompts, which was a little troublesome.</p>
<p>While a puzzle sequence is playing, you need to keep an eye on what moves with each note. It's all logical and well thought-out.  Just a little concentration and listening is all that's needed, so there's no real frustration involved, it's all thoroughly peaceful and enjoyable although there's a few tricky puzzles that stumped me for a while on getting the notes in the right order when multiple things were moving.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13744843101653597783gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13744843101653597783gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A bit quirky with the story, that sees you follow a Racoon that's friends with a weird stone head that can't quite believe you can understand them. Touching though, all about helping out a friend.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interesting new puzzle mechanic based on melodies. (Simple note sequences develop into small melodies and then into complex pieces of music.)</li>
<li>A touching story about Esther and an old, oddball raccoon and his singing stone friends.</li>
<li>A lovingly designed, cohesive 3D game world with varied locations.</li>
<li>Atmospheric, extensive soundtrack with English and German versions of original songs.</li>
<li>Play with keyboard or controller.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You also get full voice-over in both English and German, with text available for: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Japanese and Chinese.</p>
<p>It's also Steam Deck <em>Playable</em>, mainly due to some text being a little too small. Hopefully the developer can tweak that to make it properly Verified. Overall, a great puzzle game with a lovely atmosphere that works great on Linux.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sonority?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1432390/Sonority/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Nora: The Wannabe Alchemist is a fresh time-management visual-novel hybrid</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A mixture of point &amp; click, time-management and a visual-novel all blended together is what you get with Nora: The Wannabe Alchemist. It just entered Early Access from developer Error 300, a nice casual game for those of you who want something a bit slower to relax with.</p>
<p>"Witchcraft school dropout Nora has two great ambitions. One: Dust her cottage without breaking any potion bottles. Two: Become a great alchemist!</p>
<p>This vibrantly illustrated point-and-click game pits klutziness against good intentions – a ticking clock against wilting houseplants. Move into Nora’s cozy-but-cluttered witch’s cottage, brew more than 50 powerful potions and achieve domestic bliss in this truly magical visual novel / time management hybrid."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S4FYDglk1Ow"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c61a20c4a1751ab8135d22c61e690e90.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S4FYDglk1Ow" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Brew a number of unique potions.</li>
<li>Build your inventory and sell to clients.</li>
<li>Harvest alchemical plants – before they wilt, that is!</li>
<li>Redecorate your cottage.</li>
<li>Upgrade your abilities and unlock new recipes.</li>
<li>Grow, buy, and collect 20+ unique ingredients!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>About the release, the developer said: "I have something to confess. I actually like time management games. A lot. As long as they have a sensible story, decent UI and nice graphics, I’m all in. So that’s what we’ve done with the release of <em>Nora: The Wannabe Alchemist</em> on Steam Early Access: getting all the basics right for that perfect, casual, cozy buzz accompanied by your favorite warm beverage."</p>

      <title>CRSED: F.O.A.D. is like PUBG with powers, now on Linux and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We may not have PUBG supported on Linux / Steam Deck yet but we do now have CRSED: F.O.A.D. (previously called Cuisine Royale), a Battle Royale game that looks quite a bit like PUBG but sprinkles in some powers.</p>
<p>At some point, the developer put up a Native Linux version and it has also now been Steam Deck Verified with the <a href="https://crsed.net/en/news/show/449-crsed-is-now-officially-supported-by-steam-deck/#!/" target="_blank">announcement</a> being official earlier this month. So if you've been after another BR game, perhaps this might be it? Although it doesn't have a big playerbase, it's active enough that finding a game so far hasn't been a problem. Seems mildly amusing too.</p>
<p>Here's how it runs on my Fedora Linux desktop followed by Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kPSoYc-23nI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/228a8aa5ff6cf4236c5e0ee801c46685.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kPSoYc-23nI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's close to perfection. Once they fix up some of the lighting issues, it would be quite great.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Massive and dense PvP battles: dozens of players begin their trip in one of the four picturesque and detailed locations, fighting their way to the centre of the battlefield. All the while, the battlefield itself shrinks constantly, surrounded by the deadly Dark Zone.</li>
<li>Different champions to select - each one with a unique superpower.</li>
<li>A constantly growing collection of realistically modelled weapons and armor, including anti-materiel guns, sniper rifles, assault rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers and mortars. There are few compromises in the game regarding physics or ballistics rules. Different vehicles, military amphibians and speed boats will help to cover distances.</li>
<li>Use mystical powers! Draw seals with your blood or conduct ancient rituals, throw hex bags at enemies and use your own special power. You can flood the whole map or cause the sun to eclipse, set up traps, summon zombies or teleport yourself or others the hell out of here. But first, one needs to collect sinner souls for killing enemies - to be able to pay for most of that luxury.</li>
<li>Stand out from the crowd with different costumes, masks, talismans, hats, gestures, graffiti and even underwear! Unlock new spirit-guardians to get additional tactical abilities in the battles.</li>
<li>Regular special events with new rules and setups of battles and a system of daily tasks and secret missions rewarding players with unique items and powers.</li>
<li>Fair play TPV: you can play in first or third person view. In order to mitigate any advantage of the latter, every player has a familiar with a camera that can uncover the position of a player who is peeking around a corner. So if you see a butterfly or a drone - you should know that you are being watched.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On my desktop with two monitors, one annoying quirk it had when first loading was the resolution stretching across both. A quick change in the settings and now it's looking pretty good, and it performs well too. The game is even using the Vulkan API on Linux.</p>
<p>Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/884660/CRSED_FOAD/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Morrowind gets shiny in OpenMW with post-processing shaders coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenMW, the free and open source game engine reimplementation of Morrowind is about to get a lot better looking, with post-processing shaders coming in the next release.</p>
<p>This is a huge advancement for OpenMW, and will continue making it the absolute best way to play Morrowind on modern systems. Unlike modern games, Morrowind doesn't have lots of fancy graphical effects with shaders and OpenMW is fixing that for the upcoming 0.48.0 release.</p>
<p>Not in their recent <a href="https://openmw.org/2022/shiny-new-things-are-coming/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they mentioned "Cody Glassman aka wazabear finally added <a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/merge_requests/1124" target="_blank">post-processing shaders</a> to OpenMW. This is probably the biggest graphical enhancement for OpenMW since the implementation of real-time shadows. Modded OpenMW setups will now be able to take a huge step forward in time when it comes to graphic effects." and that sounds <em>very</em> exciting.</p>
<p>Some shots were also <a href="https://imgur.com/a/8DRyvi2" target="_blank">shared</a>, here's a few (click them to enlarge):</p>

      <title>Serious Sam 4 gets Steam Deck support with a small but &#39;notable&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Serious Sam 4 gained a Steam Deck Verified rating recently, which is in part thanks to the developer pushing out a small but significant patch for the game. It was listed in the recent post on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-hits-over-3000-games-either-verified-or-playable/" target="_blank">Steam Deck hitting 3,000 titles</a> either Playable or Verified.</p>
<p>While it's not a Native Linux version like their previous titles, seeing another developer actively support their game in Proton to give a good experience on Linux and Steam Deck is great.</p>
<p>In the recent patch notes the developer stated: "Hey everyone! As you have noticed we released a small, but notable update for Serious Sam 4. The update is focused on performance and game stability, new GPU support and most importantly the game now has a Steam Deck support".</p>
<p>How does it run on Steam Deck though? Let's take a quick look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KkuTlVzvzQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a59d866609fb331da45277c8bb1a030c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KkuTlVzvzQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In short: not great. Playable but frequent hard-drops down, even below 30FPS at times and the frame timing is messy. Seems they still have plenty of work to do on optimizing Serious Sam 4.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/serious-sam-4?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257420/Serious_Sam_4/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Battle of Polytopia gets a huge diplomacy update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Battle of Polytopia, a very highly rated turn-based strategy game that hopped over from mobile to PC back in 2020 is still expanding with a whole new diplomacy mechanic. Now you don't have to just expand and wage war, you can actually do a little more in the game and strategize with others.</p>
<p>Expanding the tech tree along with the diplomacy options, here's what was added:</p>

<li>Peace Treaties - Become friends with former enemies…until one of you calls it quits. Teammates cannot attack one another and can share roads.</li>
<li>Tribe Relations - With Tribe Relations systems, players can evaluate which tribe they can become friends with. Colored bubbles offer detailed explanations of what the tribes think of them.</li>
<li>Capital Vision - View the location of the Capital City of any tribe you’ve encountered. Capital Vision will also take effect when players meet someone new, thus aiding them in making tactical decisions.</li>
<li>Embassies - Diplomatic buildings which can only be built in other tribes' capitals when players are not at war with them. Embassies reveal the surrounding eight tiles and provide monetary rewards every turn, with greater rewards between allies.</li>
<li>Cloaks - These infiltration specialists are trained in the arts of subterfuge and clandestine operations and arrive armed with two new abilities: Stealth and Infiltrate. Cloaks are invisible to enemy units until they perform an action, and using them to infiltrate a city will create a horde of Daggers!</li>
<li>Daggers - Rebels incited to action by the Cloak to attack an enemy city. Daggers are the ultimate surprise attack, guerrilla warfare units, meaning enemies won’t retaliate when they pounce.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a really great 4x strategy game with cross-platform multiplayer and single-player against the AI too. The Native Linux version last I checked worked great too. Trailer is below if you've not seen it, it's kind of like a cuter and smaller version of Civilization, great if you don't have endless hours to put in one more turn but still want a taste of the genre. A perfect entry-game into it.</p>

      <title>Super Animal Royale gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a Battle Royale for everything now of course and Super Animal Royale puts 64 furry things in an arena and makes them fight until the end. Oh, it also now has Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Released originally back in August 2021, the latest update to this free to play game just landed and the developer noted that "full Steam Deck compatibility has been implemented". Seems they needed to tweak text input for the virtual keyboard, plus a few quirks with controller support were solved. This should move it from a Playable to a Verified rating!</p>
<p>Playing it for a little bit myself, it's actually great fun. Although, some of the text on the Steam Deck screen is still just a little bit too small to be clear enough but you're not really doing much reading here, it's all about the action. Pretty standard Battle Royale mechanics though, just wrapped up in a furry coating.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2nUJC4kHp6g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6c2ce2fdded42da44b9be50d3344f00.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2nUJC4kHp6g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>That said, I can easily see myself playing plenty more of this. Gives off that "just one more round" feeling when getting oh-so close to being number 1. A quality action game for breaks, in bed or just chilling on the sofa. Works great on a Linux desktop too thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Survival of the Fittest: Scavenge a variety of powerful weapons, armor and items to become the apex predator in intense 64-player online matches.</li>
<li>The Superest World: Explore a massive, beautifully illustrated 2D island and discover its hidden lore, by chatting with its inhabitants and scouring its rich environments for clues.</li>
<li>Different Stripes for Different Fights: Collect hundreds of animal breeds and customize them with thousands of cosmetic items, weapons, outfits, and even umbrellas!</li>
<li>Evolving Events &amp; Updates: Enjoy an endless stampede of new content, including seasonal outfits, animals, and weapons to collect.</li>
<li>The Fast and the Furriest: Flatten your foes while rolling dirty in a Hamster Ball, or mount a Giant Emu and peck your way to the promised land.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/843380/Super_Animal_Royale/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>. <em>While free it does have DLC for cosmetics and in-game purchases for cosmetics.</em></p>

      <title>Pixel-art people-sim Tiny Life adds gamepad support, works on Steam Deck too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's like The Sims but pixel-art and comes from an indie developer, what's not to love about this? Tiny Life has you take care of a family, build up their home and try not to kill them. First mentioned here <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/tiny-life-is-an-upcoming-pixel-art-take-on-experiences-like-the-sims/" target="_blank">back in January</a>, the developer has been steadily working away on it.</p>
<p>Celebrating two years in development, it has moved from Alpha to Beta and brings with it a bunch of big new features including full controller support, which I tested working quite nicely on the Steam Deck with the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>On top of that there's plenty of new content included in the latest build of the demo including cafes, a bunch of new furniture items, decorations and the list goes on. Plenty to keep your little pixel-family happy. There's also a new "foodie" personality type, newspapers to get jobs from, more speech sounds, control hints, children will now run around "for fun" plus an assortment of improvements and bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo gets a fresh demo and relaunched Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo is a thoroughly wonderful looking 3D adventure about a dead snake that wakes up in Limbo. Their first Kickstarter back in 2021 didn't do well but they've <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gallagames/kulebra-and-the-souls-of-limbo-relaunch" target="_blank">relaunched</a> with a new demo.</p>
<p>"Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo is a 3D adventure game where you’ll meet the many good and not-so-good folks of Limbo, a place where souls with deep regrets are cursed into repeating the same day on a loop. Use your wits and keen eye to gather clues from the residents and find items that will help you to breach the obstacles in your path one by one.</p>
<p>You play as Kulebra, a dead snake with a heart of gold that wakes up in Limbo. With his only lead being the words of a strange Old Lady, he embarks on a quest to find his purpose while sharing his light with the residents in hopes of helping them as well."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XqkKDfbWJmU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92820832a6fa5169eeb61fc4fa200f6d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XqkKDfbWJmU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This time around their goal is much lower, and they've managed to successfully hit it. Bringing the goal down from $60,000 to $10,000 is a huge drop though, hopefully it will still result in a fun game overall. They certainly have a good looking game and it sounds like a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore and interact with the world to gather clues and items that will help you open doors in your quest (figuratively and literally).</li>
<li>A game that will reward you for interacting with the world, paying attention to details, and connecting the dots.</li>
<li>Full of characters with their own quirks, side stories, and schedules that bring life to this world despite most of them being very dead.</li>
<li>An in-game <strong>day</strong>, <strong>dusk</strong>, and <strong>night</strong> cycle that will change the world and characters, ending with the curse that resets the souls of Limbo back to the start.</li>
<li>A notebook will keep track of important details for you, so you can't blame me if you weren't paying attention.</li>
<li>Confront the dark souls attempting to put out your light; Overcome their challenges that will test everything you’ve learned in this journey.</li>
<li>Bilingual! This game supports the <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Spanish</strong> languages.</li>
<li>A 1.5 to 2 hour-long fulfilling adventure (demo) with a beginning and end! (To be continued in the full release)</li>
<li>And many secrets are hidden away for you to find! (If you’re thorough, that is)</li>
</ul>

      <title>After a long wait, Psychonauts 2 has an official Linux version now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Psychonauts 2 was originally crowdfunded via Fig back in 2016, and now near a year after the Windows release the Native Linux version is now available. This comes along with an update that added more languages and fixed an issue with the Strike City checkpoint at the end of the level.</p>
<p>In the notes, they mentioned this about the Linux port:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game may crash at launch or when attempting to alter Display settings such as Window Mode. Please try the following troubleshooting solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use alternate display drivers, found in Software &amp; Updates &gt; Additional Drivers</li>
<li>Go to Settings &gt; Appearance and reposition the Activities bar to the bottom of the screen</li>
<li>Use an alternate desktop environment (DE) such as Gnome on X.Org or Ubuntu on Wayland</li>
<li>Try changing the resolution with the "Resolution Scaling" slider found in the Settings &gt; Graphics menu</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Some pretty strange advice but that's what they said… </em></p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience an imaginative, cinematic story that mixes humor and intrigue, brought to you by legendary game designer Tim Schafer (Grim Fandango, Brütal Legend, Broken Age).</li>
<li>Explore unique environments using Raz’s ability to dive into people’s brains to battle their inner demons, unlock hidden memories, and resolve their emotional baggage.</li>
<li>Leap acrobatically through the air, traversing tightropes and trapezes in a varied, challenging, and joyful platforming experience.</li>

      <title>Demo now up for high-speed future-combat racer FLASHOUT 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for high-speed explosive racing? FLASHOUT 3 was announced last month and dev Jujubee S.A.    has now put up a demo. The demo currently has one circuit (Star City), one ship and 3 types of weapons to try out and online leaderboards are hooked up too so you can take on the world.</p>
<p>Featuring incredibly vibrant neon-soaked graphics, FLASHOUT 3 brings with it ultra-fast ships, loops, jumps and sudden razor-sharp turns that can be a little tricky to manage while you're looking out for weapons firing from other racers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NiSL2s8E9Ig"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fab21e027716ef5889bbc3cf1433cf70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NiSL2s8E9Ig" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Linux Native demo seems to work just fine, with gamepad support also working nicely with my Xbox Series X pad, no trouble there at all which is a good sign for the full release at some point later this year. A little bit <em>too</em> fast for me personally (it felt really chaotic) but I'm sure some speed-demon readers will love a go at this.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>High-speed, unforgettable racing experience.</li>
<li>A powerful arsenal of weapons, boosts and upgrades at your disposal.</li>
<li>A large collection of destroyable race ships to choose from.</li>
<li>A variety of different race tracks and layouts.</li>
<li>Various game modes, including Career, Versus and more!</li>
<li>Stunning 3D Graphics.</li>
<li>High-beat electronic music.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can follow it and try the new demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761870/FLASHOUT_3/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fly Dangerous, the &#39;love letter&#39; to Elite Dangerous racing is now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love racing spaceships? Check out Fly Dangerous, originally created as a love letter to the Elite Dangerous racing community, it's now available on Steam and it's free.</p>
<p>"Ever wanted to take a ridiculously fast, fully-controllable rocket ship and fly it like the lunatic that lives inside of all of us? Well now you can!</p>
<p>Fly Dangerous is a game where 60Gs of acceleration is just fine because who needs realism? Configure your flight stick (or mouse, keyboard, gamepad or ... steering wheel, no judgements here but good luck) and take to the skies at absurd speeds."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6107864651653403349gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6107864651653403349gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The developer mentioned that it will remain free as "The top and bottom of it is this is a game I want to play and it's become a fun community project which stopped us going mad during a global pandemic. With this being a competitive / community-focused game at heart, the niche-within-a-niche nature means that the less barriers to entry, the better it will be for everyone." and they might look at ways people can support the game development in future.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4TDY9Co1pzg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f513c6d39e6d1f47443b3dbf7f9f15b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4TDY9Co1pzg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what it currently has includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6dof flight model (and the ability to tweak it to your hearts content - yes, a 50km/s ship will break the game and that's on you).</li>
<li>An infinite game world engine to facilitate the rather absurd speeds (~1km/s is no joke when it comes to floating point accuracy!)</li>
<li>2 ships (yes, many more to come) with colour customisation.</li>
<li>All the infrastructure around game / graphics / audio options, re-bindable inputs, various flight assists and a frankly absurd amount of options to cater to all kinds of users from casual pad-play all the way to dual-flightstick pilots.</li>
<li>VR headset support (F11 to recenter!) - I'd love to do cockpit VR controller support in the future but it's not a priority right now.</li>
<li>Basic JSON map format with auto-leaderboard-generation (ripe for an integrated custom map tool in the future).</li>
<li>14 Time Trial maps - more are planned when there's more concrete level geometry and finalised terrain.</li>
<li>Infinite terrain gen as a technical preview (more diverse biome terrain and foliage planned).</li>
<li>Multiplayer as a technical preview (no competitive game modes as of yet).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Lacuna – A Sci-Fi Noir Adventure now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lacuna – A Sci-Fi Noir Adventure is celebrating one year since release, and it seems they only needed to do one tiny fix to be fully Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>What is it? A classic-styled adventure that does away with "point &amp; click" instead going for more platformer-like controls and it really does look great. The developer also claims it has plenty of non-repeating conversations, story-driven mysteries, no pixel-hunting and "real" choices with multiple endings. Users on Steam appear to like it too with it having a Very Positive rating.</p>
<p>It was previously rated as "Playable" on the Steam Deck because of one little issue: sometimes a mouse cursor would appear. So they patched that and now it's fully Steam Deck Verified. Pretty amazing how good Proton is to make Windows builds run so well on Linux and Steam Deck that developers might only need such a tiny patch.</p>

<p>The anniversary update also came with improvements to various gameplay elements, some UI cleaning, new artworks and bug fixes for the whole game.</p>

      <title>Kingdoms and Castles has a huge AI Kingdoms update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's finally here! The huge AI Kingdoms update for Kingdoms and Castles has now landed, greatly expanding this wonderful city-builder with more strategy elements. Well, if you want them that is. You can still keep it as a mostly peaceful builder, as AI Kingdoms are optional.</p>
<p>You can chat with them, trade, fight and more but there's plenty of other improvements that came along with this update. There's also a fog of war visibility system, so you need to do a little exploration. If you're allied with another kingdom, you get to see what they see too. Sea gates to protect your harbours, a siege workshop which can create catapults, transport carts, a building integrity system and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nXW9QInOBN4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/29eab58bd583dbd665a50cc8c86c45d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nXW9QInOBN4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A pretty amazing update really. Fun to watch this one evolve, as it was a tiny game when it first released.</p>
<p>You can find Kingdoms and Castles on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/569480/Kingdoms_and_Castles/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/kingdoms_castles?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://lionshield.itch.io/kingdoms-and-castles" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>V Rising now works on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton Experimental Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/" target="_blank">V Rising</a>, the latest huge Steam hit can now run on Linux desktops and Steam Deck, thanks to updates to the Beta version of Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>What is it? The latest survival game, all about rising as a vampire! Explore a vast world teeming with mythical horrors and danger. Travel through lush forests, open countryside, and dark caverns to discover valuable resources, meeting friends and foes alike along the way. Traverse the world with vampire comrades or hunt solo as you pillage villages, raid bandits, and delve into the domains of supernatural beasts.</p>
<p>It managed to climb the Steam leaderboards pretty rapidly, with it now being in the top-10 for concurrent users.</p>
<p>To get it working on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton Experimental you need the "bleeding-edge" Beta version. As a <em>warning</em> though, doing this will affect any game you have set to Proton Experimental and you should only use the bleeding-edge Beta until the fixes roll out into the main version of Proton Experimental to prevent any future issues.</p>
<p>Here's what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find Proton Experimental in your Steam Library</li>
<li>Go to it's Properties menu</li>
<li>Head to the Betas tab</li>
<li>Select "bleeding-edge" from the drop-down box</li>
<li>Now pick V Rising in your Steam Library</li>
<li>Go to its Properties menu</li>
<li>Select the Compatibility tab</li>
<li>Put a tick in the box and select Proton Experimental</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you will have V Rising working on Linux and Steam Deck. Some issues remain like videos not playing and you get a test-screen instead, which will eventually be solved. The actual gameplay works though.</p>
<p>Here's a little video of the steps for you:</p>

      <title>The official iFixit launch for Steam Deck parts and repair guides is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bit of an accidental early start <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/looks-like-ifixit-have-steam-deck-parts-available-now/" target="_blank">that was taken down</a>, iFixit have now actually properly launched their Steam Deck replacements parts and various guides for each part to fix or replace yourself.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck scored a 7/10 on their repairability score which they said is "very respectable" but there are certain issues, like the battery not being very accessible and the USB-C port being soldered right to the motherboard. See the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Steam_Deck" target="_blank">guides here</a> and the <a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/collections/game-console-parts?pf_t_manufacturer=Device+Manufacturer%3DValve&amp;pf_t_model=Model%3DSteam+Deck" target="_blank">components here</a>, plus see the iFixit <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/60131/how-valve-is-changing-game-console-design" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, it seems there are still some parts that are missing including: the battery, audio board, touchpads, heatsink, all action buttons are missing including the D-pad, SSDs and the motherboard we saw before is also not available. So it's not yet the full thing but it's vastly better than what other vendors do.</p>
<p>Here's a fresh breakdown on the parts and prices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right Trigger Button Assembly - £7.99 / $7.99</li>
<li>Left Trigger Button Assembly - £7.99 / $7.99</li>
<li>UK charger - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>EU charger - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>US charger $24.99</li>
<li>Screen Adhesive - £4.96 / $4.99</li>
<li>Battery Adhesive - £4.96 / $4.99</li>
<li>Front Plate - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>Back Plate - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>Right Bumper Button Assembly - £6.99 / $6.99</li>
<li>Left Bumper Button Assembly - £6.99 / $6.99</li>
<li>Speakers - £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>Steam Button Rubber Membrane - £4.99 / $4.99</li>
<li>D-pad Rubber Membrane - £4.99 / $4.99</li>
<li>Action Button Rubber Membrane - £4.99 / $4.99</li>
<li>Screen (64GB / 256GB) - From £59.99 / $64.99</li>
<li>512GB Anti-glare Screen - From £89.99 / $94.99</li>
<li>Fan - From £24.99 / $24.99</li>
<li>Right Thumbstick - £24.99 / $19.99</li>
<li>Left Thumbstick - £24.99 / $19.99</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of them actually correctly show up in their store list too, so it seems like they're still tweaking it. The thumbsticks for example don't actually show in the list for me right now, but their store pages are live and linked from inside the guides.</p>

      <title>Meg&#39;s Monster has you help a lost girl get home before she causes the apocalypse </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is quite a story. Meg's Monster is the next and biggest game so far from developer Odencat, where you need to help a lost little girl get home. The problem is, she has some awesome power and might just cause some kind of monster apocalypse.</p>
<p>"Meg’s Monster is a short, story-driven JRPG with a big twist. Players control Roy, who begins the game with 99,999 HP and is virtually untouchable—but the real concern is keeping Meg safe, because if she starts crying, it’s game over for everyone. Players will have to master the unique mechanics and mini-games baked into each battle, all while protecting Meg and using her favorite toys to keep her pacified."</p>
<p>Honestly this sounds hilarious and rather clever, can't wait to try it. The developer is promising a story that continues to expanding, into an emotional journey that "will remain in your heart for years to come".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Bonfire Peaks - Lost Memories announced, plus Photo Mode update out </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bonfire Peaks, one of the nicest puzzle games released in 2021 is getting an expansion in Lost Memories plus an update is out now with new features.</p>
<p>What is it? A block-pushing puzzle game created by Pipe Push Paradise and Hiding Spot developer Corey Martin, co-designed with Alan Hazelden, and with art by Mari Khaleghi and Zach Soares. It's absolutely gorgeous with the voxel-based world, and the developer said to expect no filler content — just great puzzles.</p>
<p>Firstly, the update that just landed has these features and fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Photo Mode!</li>
<li>Fixed several position rounding bugs at low framerates</li>
<li>Fixed several rotation-based bugs at low framerates</li>
<li>Minor edit to level "Moving Day"</li>
<li>Fixed a softlock in level "Bodyguard"</li>
<li>Minor mesh optimizations</li>
<li>Audio mix edits</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the expansion, it's a "trilogy of DLC" with Bonfire Peaks: Lost Memories and Chapter One will be available sometime in Q3 2022. Each chapter will have new puzzles and some new game mechanics too, so I'm thoroughly curious to see what they will sprinkle into it.</p>
<p>Have a look at the teaser below:</p>

      <title>An interview with Ken VanDine, Ubuntu desktop lead at Canonical</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh interview for you today, this time with Ken VanDine who is responsible for leading the way for Ubuntu on the desktop at Canonical. This will form part of a mini-series — the first already up with <a class="u-url" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/an-interview-with-aaron-honeycutt-from-system76/" target="_blank">Aaron Honeycutt from System76</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Can you first introduce yourself and tell us what you do?</p>
<p>"I’m Ken VanDine, leading the Ubuntu Desktop team at Canonical.  I’ve been here for over 13 years now, and working on the Linux desktop for well over 20 years."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: How did you get started with Linux and what attracted you to it?</p>
<p>"Curiosity… From the time I was a young child, I just had to know how things worked.  I would take my toys apart to figure out how they worked before ever playing with them.  As I got older, that translated into computer hardware, and soon after software.  I discovered Slackware Linux in 1993 and never looked back.  It was simply amazing to have access to the source code, seeing how it worked, and I quickly immersed myself into open source software as a means to quench my thirst for how software worked."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s it like to work for Canonical as the Ubuntu Engineering Manager? What’s your work setup like?</p>
<p>"Having the opportunity to work on the Ubuntu Desktop all these years has been quite the privilege, and really the highlight of my career.  During this time I’ve been able to work on many exciting projects and contribute in different ways.  Now I get to be more involved in setting direction and leading an amazing team of some of the best developers around, it really doesn’t get any better than this! "</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What projects are you directly involved with / working on right now for Ubuntu?</p>
<p>"I lead the overall development of the desktop, which includes the distro, enterprise desktop, WSL, developer experience, and gaming experience.  With the gaming experience team being the newest, I’m the primary driver for that until we staff that team."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10522949491653301034gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10522949491653301034gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS</em></p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Does Canonical regularly speak to other businesses and developers, to try and get them to support Linux and Ubuntu?</p>
<p>"Certainly, we have relationships with many interesting companies, which is awesome.  And now that we’re starting to get involved in the gaming scene on Linux, we’ve found ourselves creating some more interesting partnerships."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Canonical recently announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/canonical-going-all-in-on-gaming-for-ubuntu-new-steam-snap-package-in-testing/" target="_blank">another push into gaming</a>. It seemed like Canonical and Ubuntu let things slide on that front — so why now?</p>
<p>"I would contest that we haven’t really let it slide.  For example, we’ve had long standing relationships with partners like NVidia to ensure users are able to easily use the best driver for their hardware.  But yes, we are upping our game, and getting involved in much deeper ways.  So why now?  Momentum… The landscape for gaming on Linux is improving, at a steadily increasing pace.  This momentum has sparked increased enthusiasm.  It’s the right time to increase our investment and help be a catalyst to continue to fuel that momentum.  Our engineers have the unique background to make a significant contribution to that growth, which we’ll all benefit from."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Going by various stats (like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam</a>), Ubuntu has been regularly falling as the main choice for Linux Gaming. With the likes of Arch and Manjaro pulling in a lot. Why do you think that is? Any more interesting plans to pull people back?</p>
<p>"I think this is primarily due to web searches done by users looking to solve various problems getting their games to work.  There is a wealth of information that leads to distros like Arch.  Our top priority will be to ensure users can get their games working without the need to consult those sites.  The next goal will be to improve the resources available to help users on Ubuntu when needed."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: So right now, why should someone go for Ubuntu over Pop, Manjaro, Arch, Fedora and others?</p>
<p>"Those are all fine distro choices, and people should choose what they are most comfortable with.  I’d say people should choose Ubuntu if their priority is a Linux desktop that just works.  We work hard to provide the best user experience possible, not only with the everyday desktop experience but also ease of access to the best drivers, bug and security fixes and out of the box access to the best selection of high quality applications.  And let’s not forget our certification program that ensures that many desktops and laptops are supported."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What are you particularly excited about for the future of Ubuntu?</p>
<p>"Dare I say the year of the Linux desktop?  Nah… Linux has reached a point where that can no longer be the goal post, we must look well beyond that.  I’m really excited about all the ways Ubuntu is meeting the daily challenges of so many use cases, ranging from robotics, IoT, cloud, to desktop deployments in large enterprises and home users playing video games.  Ubuntu is everywhere, and I’m really excited to be part of this journey."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: For all the critics of Snap packages, anything you wish to say to them?</p>
<p>"Ubuntu users aren’t the critics of snaps, and I’d argue that users are less concerned with how they get their applications.  Of course we have strong opinions on how to deliver high quality applications, in a secure and reliable way and it’s our mission to do just that.   We do hear what people say and we take the mission of providing the best possible experience very seriously, so we are always looking for legitimate ways to improve the platform."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Considering we have Flatpak, AppImage, deb, rpm and so on. What do you think about how fractured packaging is on Linux? Does Snap not add to the problems for developers?</p>
<p>"There is fragmentation, which isn’t surprising. I will say out of the packaging formats you mentioned, Snap is the only one that has really seen any success from ISVs.  There’s a reason why you see official snap support from major ISVs, but not the others.  Snap was one of the first packaging formats to address issues like sandboxing.  Other packaging formats following suit shows snap was on the right track.  The benefits of snap and the single source of truth store are must haves for any major vendor."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: One of the potential problems with Snap is that the server side is solely controlled by Canonical and is basically proprietary. Will this be opened up? Do you see it as an issue that needs sorting?</p>
<p>"Anyone can create an alternate store that supports snaps.  The API is completely open as is snapd.  Having a centralized store is actually one of the strengths of the ecosystem.  ISVs want that single trusted source for apps.  I think the tremendous success we’ve had with ISVs adopting snap is in no small part due to this concept.  And I ask, is it really a problem?  Snap is completely open, anyone can see what’s being executed on your system.  The internals of the store that handles metadata just isn’t interesting."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Are you buying a Steam Deck? What are your thoughts on what it means for Linux Gaming overall?</p>
<p>"I haven’t yet, I wish I had reserved one earlier.  It’s a great device, and Linux was the obvious OS choice for such a device.  Valve has done a fantastic job of pushing compatibility technologies to make Linux a viable platform.  All their work has really done wonders to bring more games to Linux and I look forward to seeing where that takes us."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s your own personal computing setup like?</p>
<p>"My primary system is a Thinkpad T14, with a couple of 24” displays attached via a USB-C dock.  But of course I have quite a bit of additional hardware necessary for development and testing."</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What are your top 5 favourite games to play on Linux?</p>
<p>"Oh, that’s a tough one.  I’ve always been partial to racing games and really enjoy any of the Need for Speed games. I’ve also been really into Raft lately as well as playing LoL, Valheim and RDR2. I’m more of a creator than a gamer, however I do have a passion for enabling users to get the most out of their Linux desktop experience."</p>

      <title>NVIDIA reveal a list of issues with their driver and Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the situation has improved a little for NVIDIA and Wayland, they're not really there yet and so NVIDIA are now keeping a <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/wayland-information-for-r515-beta-release/214275" target="_blank">public list</a> of the issues split between drivers and either protocol or compositor limitations. This follows on from the huge splash they made recently with their new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">open source Linux GPU kernel modules</a>, which also improved Wayland support a little too with the 515.43.04 driver that went up at the same time.</p>
<p>NVIDIA said they expect the list to get shorter over time as "missing functionality is implemented both in the driver and in upstream components".</p>
<p>So for those interested, here's things as they stand right now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA DRIVER LIMITATIONS</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The VDPAU library, used for hardware accelerated video decoding and presentation, does not have native Wayland support and does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NvFBC desktop capture library does not have native Wayland support and does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable display refresh rate capabilities such as G-Sync are not reported by nvidia-drm module, therefore this functionality is not available on Wayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual reality displays, such as the SteamVR platform, require support for DRM display leasing which does not currently work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EGL_EXT_platform_x11 is not supported with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nvidia-drm module does not support the GAMMA_LUT, DEGAMMA_LUT, CTM, COLOR_ENCODING, or COLOR_RANGE connector properties, which may impact some compositor features related to color correction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nvidia-settings configuration tool has limited functionality on Wayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Front-buffer rendering in GLX does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WAYLAND PROTOCOL OR COMPOSITOR LIMITATIONS</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following workstation features are not supported by any Wayland compositors or the Wayland protocol. They will also likely require new EGL extensions or other means to expose the related hardware functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SLI and Multi-GPU Mosaic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frame Lock and Genlock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swap Groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced display pipeline features including warp and blend, pixel shift, and emulated YUV420.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stereo rendering</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no established public API through which Wayland compositors can power off video memory via RTD3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xwayland does not provide a suitable mechanism for our driver to synchronize application rendering with presentation, which can cause visual corruption in some circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display multiplexers (muxes) are typically used in laptops with both integrated and discrete GPUs to provide a direct connection between the discrete GPU and the built-in display (internal mux) or an external display (external mux). On X11, the display mux can be automatically switched when a full-screen application is running on the discrete GPU, enabling enhanced display features and improved performance, but no Wayland compositors currently support this functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indirect GLX does not work with Xwayland because the Glamor rendering engine is not compatible with our EGL implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware overlays cannot be used by GLX applications with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>AMD give more details on Ryzen 7000, Socket AM5 and &#39;Mendocino&#39; APU</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Computex 2022 is now in full swing and AMD have done their presentation giving off some details on the upcoming  Ryzen 7000, Socket AM5 and 'Mendocino' APU. What we got was just a teaser for now though, since AMD will be saving their full detail announcement for later this year.</p>
<p>Based on the 5nm "Zen 4" architecture, Ryzen 7000 sounds pretty fancy. AMD say they will have double the amount of L2 cache per-core, with higher clock speeds, and they will have a "greater than" 15% uplift when it comes to single-threaded performance compared to the previous generation. During the keynote, they also showed off a pre-production unit doing 5.5 GHz in some testing and performing "30% faster" than an Intel Core i9 12900K in a Blender multi-threaded rendering workload.</p>
<p>You're going to want to save your pennies though, since Zen 4 will need the new socket AM5 but they will be compatible with AM4 coolers. For the first time, they're also putting the RDNA 2-based graphics engine into their main enthusiast Ryzen CPUs too. You also get support for DDR5 and PCI Express 5.0. Ryzen 7000 will be available "this Fall".</p>
<p>The AM5 series will have three different varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li>X670 Extreme: Bringing the most connectivity and extreme overclocking capabilities with PCIe 5.0 support for two graphics slots and one storage slot</li>
<li>X670: Supporting enthusiast overclocking with PCIe 5.0 support on one storage slot with graphics support optional</li>
<li>B650: Designed for performance users with PCIe 5.0 storage support</li>
</ul>
<p>As for their new "Mendocino" APU based on Zen 2 (up to 4 cores / 8 threads) with RDNA 2 graphics that will be available in notebooks priced around $399-$699, launching sometime in the second half of this year. Interestingly, they directly mentioned Chromebooks for this too, so maybe some more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/google-announce-alpha-quality-steam-on-chrome-os-is-now-actually-here/" target="_blank">Steam on Chrome OS</a> fun with these.</p>
<p>You can see the full presentation below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BRtBB2VnF8M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ed0358bed4fcb0a418dbef9a4d17644.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BRtBB2VnF8M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"At Computex 2022 we highlighted growing adoption of AMD in ultrathin, gaming and commercial notebooks from the leading PC providers based on the leadership performance and battery life of our Ryzen 6000 series mobile processors," said Dr. Su. "With our upcoming AMD Ryzen 7000 Series desktop processors, we will bring even more leadership to the desktop market with our next-generation 5nm ‘Zen 4’ architecture and provide an unparalleled, high-performance computing experience for gamers and creators." </p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 3,000 games either Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There it is, the next big milestone for the Steam Deck has been hit with over 3,000 games now rated as either Verified or Playable. It's just a number of course, and there's far more you can actually play, this is just what Valve has formally put through Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Looking back that's over 500 since I last covered this when it hit around 2,500 back on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steam-deck-hits-2500-games-verified-or-playable/" target="_blank">May 4th</a>, the rate is quite impressive although it's still thoroughly random what goes through. A long way to go though of course considering how many games there are on Steam.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the latest numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1535 - Verified</li>
<li>1493 - Playable</li>
<li>1322 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the latest to be Verified or Playable include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Between the Stars (Playable)</li>
<li>Beyond a Steel Sky (Verified)</li>
<li>FAR: Lone Sails (Verified)</li>
<li>Serious Sam 4 (Verified)</li>
<li>Temtem (Verified)</li>
<li>Thumper (Verified)</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, the Steam Deck has now spent 5 weeks at the top of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2022W19/" target="_blank">Steam charts</a> when sorted by revenue (no way to view by units, Valve don't give that out). Nice to see it continue doing so well!</p>

      <title>APICO is a very relaxing beekeeping game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now with Native Linux support, APICO from TNgineers and Whitethorn Games might be one of my new favourite was just to chill-out. <u>Note</u>: key provided for me by their PR team.</p>
<p>With a sprinkle of facts and plenty of exploration, APICO filled me up with a sense of pride in what I was doing. Bees are awesome, the world revolves around them and in APICO it's your job to protect them all — and breed them. You've left the bright lights of the big city to go out in the sticks to help your poor old grandmother. Honestly this is one of the most wholesome games I've played so far this year. Cozy would be a really good way to describe it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4cQ8zFgCAWc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d1107c3807f0fa4fe3eb39fb7223b5dd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4cQ8zFgCAWc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Live out your wildest beekeeping fantasies – sting free!</li>
<li>Unique crafting &amp; beekeeping minigames that drive gameplay progression</li>
<li>Cross-breed different bees to discover over 30 new species</li>
<li>Make and sell honey, Apicola, and other beekeeping products</li>
<li>Repopulate lost species and release them back into the wild</li>
<li>Multiple biomes to explore, each with their own unique bee species</li>
<li>Uncover the forgotten secrets of the APICO islands</li>
<li>Play together with friends in 4 player online co-op!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Note</u>: if it fails to run for you on Linux, simply set it to the Steam Linux Runtime in the Steam Compatibility settings. Game Maker still has a few issues with dependencies on Linux but the developer has most of them bundled with it so it works fine on Steam Deck and Ubuntu out of the box.</p>
<p>It gives off the same kind of zen feeling I got from the likes of Stardew Valley and Littlewood, it has that wonderful blend of exploration and building that allows you to just take a deep breath and smile while the hours tick away. An easy recommendation, great for any age.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“There was no better time to release APICO than on World Bee Day,” said Dr. Matthew White, CEO of Whitethorn Games. “We hope that everyone who plays the game will take its message about bee conservation to heart, and help bring more awareness to this important issue.”</p>
<p>“Our thanks goes out to Whitethorn Games and all the players who tried the demo and wishlisted the game for supporting our efforts,” said Ell, co-founder of TNgineers. “APICO is finally out, and we hope that its message spreads far and wide.”</p>
<p>Bee happy and pick up a copy from <a href="https://tngineers.itch.io/apico" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390190/APICO/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. A portion of sales will also go towards national and international bee, beekeeping and wild bee conservation charities.</p>

      <title>HP teamed up with System76 for the HP Dev One laptop with Pop!_OS Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS</a> Linux from System76 is expanding with more vendors, as HP now have a teaser up for the <a href="https://hpdevone.com/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> laptop. Built for developers they say, although with the kind of specs on offer it seems like it might make quite a good gaming machine too.</p>
<p>Some of the specs include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>8-Core AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO processor</li>
<li>16GB memory DDR4 @ 3200MHz</li>
<li>1TB fast PCIe NVMe M.2 storage²</li>
<li>14" diagonal FHD anti-glare display</li>
<li>AMD Radeon™ Graphics</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The unit itself looks absolutely gorgeous too, it even has a "Super" key instead of the standard Windows logo you get on most laptops as a great little added touch. Of course, it also comes with Pop!_OS as standard too, a project that has been "Months in the making" said System76 CEO Carl Richell.</p>

      <title>Looks like iFixit have Steam Deck parts available now (Update: it&#39;s gone)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: it turns out they put it up too early and they've now taken it down. As they said on <a href="https://twitter.com/iFixit/status/1527801532925857792" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Earlier today we published some pages related to our upcoming parts launch with Valve. These went live earlier than we planned, so we ended up taking them down. If you did get a parts order in, we'll honor it.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the real launch soon!"</p>
<hr/>
<p>Have you already broken your shiny Steam Deck or want some spares to tinker with? You're in luck, as it seems parts have now appeared over on <a href="https://store.ifixit.co.uk/collections/game-console-parts?pf_t_manufacturer=Device+Manufacturer%3DValve&amp;pf_t_model=Model%3DSteam+Deck" target="_blank">iFixit</a>. Looks like in some places they're selling out fast and it's not available yet in all regions, but here in the UK it all seems to be in stock — but for how long?</p>
<p>From what I can see they currently have</p>
<ul>
<li>UK charger - £24.99</li>
<li>EU charger - £24.99</li>
<li>Screen Adhesive - £4.96</li>
<li>Battery Adhesive - £4.96</li>
<li>Motherboard (No SSD included) - £289.99</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3802797761653079645gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3802797761653079645gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Front Plate - £24.99</li>
<li>Back Plate - £24.99</li>
<li>Right Bumper - £6.99</li>
<li>Left Bumper - £6.99</li>
<li>Speakers - £24.99</li>
<li>Steam Button Rubber Membrane - £4.99</li>
<li>D-pad Rubber Membrane - £4.99</li>
<li>Action Button Rubber Membrane - £4.99</li>
<li>Screen (64GB / 256GB) - From £59.99</li>
<li>512GB Anti-glare Screen - From £89.99</li>
<li>Fan - From £19.99</li>
</ul>
<p>So it seems right now they're missing the Battery, Thumbsticks, Face Buttons and probably other bits I forgot. So not the entire thing but plenty of it there ready and for those that might be sold out, at least you have an idea of a price for now.</p>

      <title>Project Zomboid version 41.71 out with Steam Deck and controller upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Project Zomboid, a survival game from The Indie Stone that's currently in Early Access just had a big new stable release, and it should now work better on the Steam Deck and with controllers overall.</p>
<p>Currently a Steam Deck Verified title, it actually wasn't supposed to be Verified until now as the testing was done on a Beta build, which is now what's live. Seems Valve need to tweak the auto-publishing of results when done on a non-Public build.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck they tweaked a bunch of their settings so that it should work properly out of the box, including at a resolution that actually works. You can also now do precise positioning when placing items when using a controller, more panels can be scrolled using the right-stick, the start button now brings up the main-menu in single-player, controller navigation added to the Steam Workshop UI, controller navigation for the server browser and lots of fixes for little niggling Steam Deck and controller issues. Overall, it runs <em>far</em> better in my test this morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17925147351653047333gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This build also included some big new features too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new action music system.</li>
<li>New items and updated 3D models.</li>
<li>New forage items.</li>
<li>A compilation of new hair types.</li>
<li>Option to "add all" to partially full Thread, Duct Tape, Twine etc</li>
<li>Numerous multiplayer improvements.</li>
<li>Updated community translations.</li>
<li>Loads of balancing changes.</li>
<li>Plenty of bug fixes.</li>
<li>And much much more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Full changelog can be found <a href="https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/54121-4171-released/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Project Zomboid is available on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/project_zomboid?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/project-zomboid?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108600/Project_Zomboid/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a quieter fan again, and louder volume in the latest updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another two big Steam Deck updates just dropped, one for the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220648637502115304" target="_blank">Stable</a> channel and one for the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3269060419612777126/?ctp=4" target="_blank">Beta</a> channel. Here's what's new.</p>
<p><u><strong>Stable Update</strong></u></p>
<p>For everyone in the main Stable channel they adjusted the lock screen to include battery status, network status, and time. Plus you can also now toggle on the battery percentage in the header bar, found in Settings &gt; General.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6937232841653036970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6937232841653036970gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10366226571653036969gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10366226571653036969gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also button to reset the performance profile to system default, handy if you tweaked quite a few things:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15964825891653037152gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15964825891653037152gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Reduced login time for users with thousands of screenshots, the performance overlay is no longer stored with the per-app profile system and if you get Steam Support to remove the Steam Deck rewards put on a wrong account, you can also now reclaim them. Plus these bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed per-app performance profiles restoring the wrong FPS limit</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with keyboard theme not being applied the first time the keyboard was shown</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with keyboard theme not being applied when there is no connection to Steam</li>
<li>Fixed pinch-to-zoom gestures being active in certain places - preventing UI from being unexpectedly zoomed in</li>
<li>Fixed some focus issues in the Library when going back from a game's detail page. It should give focus back to the last focused item properly.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues with the Re-order Controller dialog</li>
<li>Fixed login issues with users that have a '/ 'character in their profile name</li>
<li>Fixed the Confirm button on controller layout export screen exporting more than one configuration</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong> - 20th May, 2022: an extra update landed for the Stable channel:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="item-content">
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrectly displaying an update is available when there isn't one.</li>
<li>Fixed Official Steam controller layouts not loading in certain scenarios, such as the default Desktop layout for Deck.</li>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay level always being set to 0 on startup</li>
<li>Fixed manual GPU clock settings being deactivated after a suspend/resume cycle</li>
<li>Fixed controller layout error after editing a game-bundled layout</li>
<li>Fixed keyboard theme regression that prevented selecting the Default Theme</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Beta Update</strong></u></p>
<p>On the Steam Deck opt-in Beta, things are just as exciting.</p>
<p>The fan controller has been upgraded once again so it should be "now smarter, more stable, and quieter overall". So less of it randomly spinning up, and when it does it should be smoother. It's nice to see plenty of focus on this, as the model that has that louder fan really was annoying.</p>
<p>When you toggle on the performance HUD, it should also now give a more accurate reading of VRAM, plus they added more internal resolution options for games to choose from. Previously some games couldn't get the right resolutions, so now more will. Plus these bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed gain staging, resulting in higher max volume, and removes white noise coming through 3.5mm jack with some headphones.</li>
<li>Fixed PipeWire and Steam failing to elevate their thread priorities</li>
<li>Fixed the language dropdown in the Warframe launcher</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong> - 21st May 21, 2022: another Beta update shipped with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>microSD card formatting process now performs a quick format</li>
<li>Reverted fan controller to previous version while the team works on more improvements and testing</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seems some Steam Deck units were getting a little toasty…</em></p>
<p>Quick note though: on one of my Steam Deck units, the Beta update caused a black screen with the fan blowing. If that happens to you try holding down the power button for 15 seconds, then tap it once and it should reboot properly and apply the update.</p>

      <title>Old World from the Civilization IV designer releases on Steam along with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World is a new Native Linux historical strategy game from Soren Johnson, Lead Designer of Civilization IV and Offworld Trading Company and Mohawk Games.</p>
<p>This was originally an exclusive for Epic Games, and back when it released there in 2021 it gained some rather high praise from the wider bigger PC gaming websites. Since then though, the game has expanded dramatically with hundreds of new narrative events, a brand new DLC that also just released, lots of bug fixes, balance changes and various other improvements.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qw1d_7MvCBo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/50833776a8d3a6ebf03c5ba7ed15c76a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qw1d_7MvCBo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: the publisher, Hooded Horse, was kind enough to pass along a review key for this.</em></p>
<p>Given the designer on this, it's safe to say this is like a spiritual successor to Civilization. It's much more than that though, and there's been a few attempts from others to do the same, but this is more like a slick evolution on it. Much more character-driven, so it's a little bit closer to Crusader Kings in that way too and honestly, I'm not sure I can see myself going back to any current Civilization title after playing Old World.</p>
<p>One of the major ways it mixes things up is the new Orders system. Instead of only moving units once per turn, you have an overall Orders currency to use each turn. Units still have limits and can get fatigued but this expands what's possible in such a strategy game making it just feel so much more open. It does mean you need to do a lot more planning too, and at times completely rethink what you're doing, as using up all your orders might leave you too open for an attack, as just one small example.</p>
<p><em>Did you screw up? Good news, you can undo moves repeatedly, and that alone makes me really love this.</em></p>
<p>An absolutely gorgeous looking game too. The artists did some truly fantastic work on all aspects of the design here. Even the fog of war clouds excited me when playing it for the first time, the way they gently caress the map, it's really something to look at.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14552979911652976709gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14552979911652976709gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The amount of info you're being given the first few times can feel a little daunting though. There's quite a bit of depth to various parts of the game, even just founding a city needs you to be careful because of the family system. When you go to found a city, you pick which family will be the founders and they each come with different bonuses so you're choosing your focus very early on. You also have to keep them all happy too, to ensure you keep various bonuses and don't lose out. Even though there's plenty going on, it's surprisingly accessible thanks to the clear UI.</p>
<p>Research is another area that's quite different here too with it being more random, and a bit more like Stellaris in fact. You are given a few cards to pick from, and those not picked go into a discard pile. Once your pile to draw from is empty, the discard pile comes back shuffled up for you to continue on. You still get access to a tech-tree but you don't get the direct planning to go through it like other games. (although you can target specific research to remind yourself when it comes up). This presents some difficult decisions when you're going through the game but does spice things up a bit.</p>
<p>One aspect of it that some will love and some will hate, is how much shorter it is compared to other similar games. It's a race to 200 turns, which for me is actually great. Games don't feel like they drag on forever! I continue to be quite amazed with Old World and it has firmly scratched the itch I wanted after burning out with Civilization.</p>
<p>With all the events though, of which the developer said there's at least 2,500 of them now, there's never a dull moment in any part of the game. So many choices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4148237761652976735gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4148237761652976735gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I quite liked how the tutorials were done too, as there's a fair bit to learn. You can go through <em>dedicated</em> tutorial missions that carefully guide you on the same map each time but you can also just play a normal game, with plenty of tutorial prompts and explanations as you go along. Best of both worlds and a nice touch.</p>
<p>When it comes to the fresh Native Linux port, I have to say that I'm very impressed. It works out of the box with no issues on Fedora 36, and performance is absolutely fantastic. It's even <em>playable</em> on Steam Deck. Turning down a few settings and upping the built-in scaling actually worked quite nicely but some text was still a bit too small. No obvious issues in my notes on it to tell you of, so it's a solid recommendation from me. A simply <em>must have</em> for strategy fans.</p>
<p>Later in June they plan to add in localizations for Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Japanese, Spanish, Russian, French and German. If you buy it before May 25th, you get the Heroes of the Aegean DLC free.</p>
<p>Available for Linux on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/597180/Old_World/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. For <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/old_world" target="_blank">GOG</a> it does not have the Linux build.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.25 Beta is out now for testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for even more improvements to come to the KDE Plasma desktop? I know I am and <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.24.90/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.25 Beta</a> is now available.</p>
<p>This is readying up for a full release for everyone on June 14th, and they will also be holding a special "beta review day" of May 26th where anyone can join in for a day of "bug-hunting, triaging and solving alongside the Plasma devs".</p>
<p>Some of the improvements coming sound pretty great, a lot of it just fine-tuning the whole Plasma desktop to react better to certain situations and just give it a bit more spit and polish. I especially like some of the updates coming to the Discover software installer like an overhaul to the app page and showing permissions for Flatpak applications.</p>
<p>It's also good news for Wayland fans, as there appears to be quite a lot of bug fixes and overall improvements there too, over 200 in fact and that includes fixes and improvements for Xwayland too.</p>
<p>Also plenty of adjustments to the look and feel of Plasma with a nice rejection animation on lock screens / login for a wrong password, you can apply the accent colours of UI to match a wallpaper, tint the whole colour scheme with an accent colour, an optional floating panel for Plasma themes and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10477153721652974808gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10477153721652974808gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you want to try it live, it looks like KDE neon might be a good one with their regular unstable iso <a href="https://neon.kde.org/download" target="_blank">downloads</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse from Revolution Software just had a big update to improve how it handles on modern systems and screen resolutions. It also works great on the Steam Deck.   </p>

      <title>The modular Framework Laptop gets a new model with 12th Gen Intel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework are doing some great things after the first model of the modular Framework Laptop, then the mainboard release and new an upgraded model with 12th Gen Intel.</p>
<p>The new unit as a whole has some other parts upgraded too including a redesigned lid assembly for "significantly improved rigidity" and they say how they've also "carefully optimized standby battery life, especially for Linux users". A new expansion card is also coming soon for 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet.</p>
<p>Sticking to their promise of being modular and reducing waste, this 12th Gen Intel unit will also be available as an upgrade module to swap if you have a current Framework Laptop. The top cover is also available by itself for people who want the newer version and there's also an upgrade kit for them both.</p>
<p>The new units go up for pre-order today in US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, and Ireland with more countries being announced through this year. To order you need to place a deposit which is fully refundable and it's being done again in a batch system.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3151033851652964347gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For their original model, the price has also been dropped to sell them all and fully move onto the new model. The 11th Gen Intel DIY model is down to £699 or £899 for the pre-built Windows model. While the new 12th Gen Intel DIY model is £819 and the pre-built £1,049.</p>
<p>Framework continue testing and working on their Linux support in the DIY edition too, noting that they've now tested Fedora 36 working "fantastically well out of the box, with full hardware functionality including WiFi and fingerprint reader support" and Ubuntu 22.04 "also works great after applying a couple of workarounds, and we’re working to eliminate that need".</p>
<p>More info on the Framework <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/introducing-the-new-and-upgraded-framework-laptop" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>I truly hope to see more of this come along, it's super wasteful to get rid of an entire laptop for upgrades.</p>

      <title>Developer of popular noise suppression tool NoiseTorch has dev machine compromised</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you a user of NoiseTorch? It's a popular way of getting some pretty great noise suppression on your microphone, to keep out all that background noise or a hammer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/microphone-noise-suppression-app-noisetorch-has-a-new-release-with-early-pipewire-support/" target="_blank">hitting your desk</a>. Sadly, the developer had a machine compromised.</p>
<p>The developer announced on the <a href="https://github.com/lawl/NoiseTorch" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> that a system that held some of their private keys was compromised, giving attackers the ability to mess with the code. For that reason, they're suggesting people to not trust the builds and they think the source code could be compromised too.</p>
<p>Such a shame for such a great app that I've used previously. However, it appears the community is <a href="https://github.com/lawl/NoiseTorch/issues/254" target="_blank">coming together</a> to review the code in an attempt to help save the project.</p>
<p>Alternatives exist for those of you still needing some right now like <a href="https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects" target="_blank">EasyEffects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/josh-richardson/cadmus" target="_blank">Cadmus</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully they will be able to salvage the project and ensure no harm was done.</p>

      <title>The Linux port of Psychonauts 2 will land next week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having you been holding out for the Native Linux port of Psychonauts 2? Well, the developer has announced after a long wait that it's just about to finally land. This was funded as part of their original Fig campaign, with Double Fine Productions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/double-fine-say-psychonauts-2-for-linux-and-macos-still-coming/" target="_blank">previously stating</a> they took the port "quality seriously" which was a part of the reason for the delay on it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fig.co/campaigns/psychonauts-2/updates/1546" target="_blank">fresh update</a> they mentioned this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left">I can finally (finally!) update everyone about the MacOS and Linux versions of <em>Psychonauts 2</em>. I’m dang glad to say that Mac and Linux versions will be available on all major storefronts next week.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you eager to play these versions, you do not need to ask for an extra game key. Everything will be provided on your Humble Games page.<strong> Please contact Humble for support - but please also remember these aren't live yet.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This has been a long journey and I know some players really wanted to play these versions sooner; time was taken to ensure they’re solid ports. The wait’s basically over! We’ll update next week as soon as they are available.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently it does work very well in Proton according to various reports but I'm sure plenty will be happy to see the official port landing.</p>
<p>It's available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/psychonauts_2" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/psychonauts-2?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Canonical seek Software Engineers for the &#39;Ubuntu Gaming Experience&#39; team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for helping to improve Ubuntu Linux and get it into shape for more gaming? Now is your chance, as Canonical are hiring exactly for that. They did say only recently that they were going "<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/canonical-going-all-in-on-gaming-for-ubuntu-new-steam-snap-package-in-testing/" target="_blank">all in</a>" with gaming on Ubuntu, when they announced their testing Snap package for Steam and of course there was more to come.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://canonical.com/careers/3920832/software-engineer-ubuntu-gaming-experience-remote" target="_blank">new role</a> mentions they are "seeking Software Engineers to join the Ubuntu Gaming Experience team and be part of our mission to ship the best open source operating system in the world". What the heck is this team anyway? Well, as they explain, they're hiring to create a team that is focused on "performance, compatibility and user experience for gamers".</p>
<p>People in this role will "work with open source projects like Proton and partners like Unity to improve the gaming experience for Ubuntu users around the world, as well as the wider Linux gaming ecosystem in general" — so it's a wide ranging job and it appears Canonical want to get people involved directly in improving the likes of Wine and Proton, Mesa drivers graphics drivers and more as you need to be "effective working with low-level libraries, drivers, and the Linux graphics, sound and input stacks".</p>
<p>The good news is that it's a remote position, so pretty much anyone with the experience needed can apply to improve gaming on Linux and Ubuntu for everyone.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 3.5 RC 1 is up with a new asynchronous shader compilation system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine 3.5 is getting close to release with a first Release Candidate available for developers to test the next version of this open source game engine.</p>
<p>This is one of the most important FOSS projects around, giving developers a full game engine and editor to create games with that works great for both the editor and exports across many platforms.</p>
<p>Version 3.5 is coming in with some big new features including an asynchronous shader compilation + caching system, that uses a "ubershader" that gets compiled at startup to fill in for shaders initially and then the more efficient and material-specific shaders get compiled asynchronously, and cached for future runs. In short: this should enable games with Godot Engine to perform better overall.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16828382511652891763gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16828382511652891763gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other improvements include a backport of their much improved navigation system from the upcoming Godot 4.0, 3D physics interpolation to make everything look smooth at different framerates, an easy way to add basic occlusion culling, a port of the editor to Android, a lot of new features for Version Control Systems (VCS) integration in Godot, joypad events are now in a separate thread for Linux to prevent missed input and <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/release-candidate-godot-3-5-rc-1" target="_blank">so much more</a>.</p>

      <title>Gamescope from Valve pulls in support for NVIDIA Image Scaling </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a>, an open source project from Valve that's part of what powers the Steam Deck, now has support for NVIDIA Image Scaling. So it now supports both FSR 1.0 and NVIDIA Image Scaling for various GPUs.</p>
<p>The merge request was opened on the same day NVIDIA made that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">massive announcement</a> about having open source Linux GPU kernel modules and their new Beta Driver 515.43.04. That new driver version is also needed for NVIDIA users who want to try out Gamescope.</p>
<p>What is the point of Gamescope? Well, it handles the display of games in a way that keeps performance nice. If you're running it directly on top of a regular Linux desktop, it also prevents games from interfering with your desktop, plus it enables you to adjust all sorts of things like resolution, refresh rate and of course the extras like FSR 1.0 and now NVIDIA Image Scaling too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK provides a single spatial scaling and sharpening algorithm for cross-platform support. The scaling algorithm uses a 6-tap scaling filter combined with 4 directional scaling and adaptive sharpening filters, which creates nice smooth images and sharp edges. In addition, the SDK provides a state-of-the-art adaptive directional sharpening algorithm for use in applications where no scaling is required.<br/>
The directional scaling and sharpening algorithm is named NVScaler while the adaptive-directional-sharpening-only algorithm is named NVSharpen. Both algorithms are provided as compute shaders and developers are free to integrate them in their applications.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile Sentinel rolls out, controller support works nicely on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the big Sentinel update to Path of Exile out now, I gave it a spin on my Steam Deck to get a feel for the controls and it really does work nicely.</p>
<p>As one of the biggest action-RPGs available on Steam, and it being free to play, it's wonderful to see it working so well out of the box thanks to Proton with no changes being needed to have it running. This update doesn't just affect the Steam Deck though of course, as controller support on desktop should work great too. You can view the full <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3264788" target="_blank">patch notes here</a>.</p>
<p>Have a look at my video below briefly showing off how it works on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9viKt5l05PY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1405ccb1483b39ff8525d3cdcf8041b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9viKt5l05PY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Considering how smooth it is and how genuinely good it feels with the Steam Deck controls, it's highly likely I'll be personally spending a lot more time with this one. Since it has a built-in Vulkan rendering system, performance on Steam Deck and Linux desktops continues to be really good overall.</p>
<p>Path of Exile is available on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" target="_blank">Steam Page</a>.</p>

      <title>This Steam Deck Durability Test had me watching in horror</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been various attempts to show how durable (or not so) the Steam Deck can be in various situations but JerryRigEverything definitely had me wincing. Obviously, a lot of durability tests are rather extreme but even so, it's interesting to see just how much the Steam Deck can take before you might need a replacement.</p>
<p>I went into this video expecting some of the standard stuff but I was honestly horrified at what was done, poor thing. It didn't even get a chance to make a gamer happy before it was tortured.</p>
<p>While this physical abuse to the Steam Deck might seem random, the tests are actually all pretty good to show up really what the Steam Deck is made of and why that carrying case is pretty essential for when you go anywhere. Seriously, I'm still putting mine in it to go downstairs.</p>
<p>Anyway, have a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="66xbBtnxb5k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/afc6c7cd64b784be4f0dbf2f37cd2f2b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/66xbBtnxb5k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They are also giving away a Steam Deck, see how to get it on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZacksJerryRig/status/1526314471961989120" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

      <title>Songs of Conquest looks good on Linux, works quite well on Steam Deck too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Conquest is a brand new release from Lavapotion and Coffee Stain Publishing, a turn-based tactical RPG with kingdom management that definitely feels like Heroes of Might and Magic. <u>Note</u>: key from Key Mailer.</p>
<p>I was never truly a big fan of Heroes of Might and Magic though, while I appreciate the lasting effect it had on a lot of people, I think many will appreciate another modern take on it. Featuring some great pixel-art touched up with modern effects and lighting, it really does look absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>Thanks to Proton it works on Linux desktops and the Steam Deck out of the box, it couldn't be simpler. Click install, hit play — nice. However, on the Steam Deck, some UI elements are just a bit too small, which I hope the developer can work on. It's only just entered Early Access so they have a lot to do. Additionally, you want Proton Experimental for best compatibility, although currently the cut-scenes are upside down.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TaMheQOX9yY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/197b3ba2e0f44dc1965ebaf67d906687.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TaMheQOX9yY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Steam Deck, the default Steam Input configuration it was given to act like a Keyboard and Mouse actually works really nicely for it. Since it's a slow game being turn-based, having that time to think helps. For now, playable and it does perform well to a solid 60FPS just keep in mind the smaller text and UI issue there. Even on the High settings (default), it performs at around 50-60FPS most of the time which is great, although tweaking it down to Medium makes it even better while still looking great on the Deck screen. With Medium settings and using the Steam Deck Beta to put it into 40Hz, looks like at least 3 hours battery life. Honestly with bigger text and UI it would be a fantastic experience on Deck, and then perfection with proper controller support.</p>
<p>On desktop Linux, no performance issues at all either, multiple-hundreds FPS. Everything looking great!</p>
<p>Seems like it has some nice writing through the campaign too. Although, honestly, I can't get over just how absolutely lush it looks. The maps have lots of little detail to them, as you explore and come across various camps and villages that allow you to buff up your forces or engage in battle and the battle animations look just as great too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18195061991652796424gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18195061991652796424gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I still have a lot more of it to play yet but it leaves a <em>lasting</em> first impression.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Adventure Awaits - Explore a wide variety of maps with diverse enemies and valuable loot. Venture into contrasting biomes with unique enemy factions, environments and battlefields.</li>
<li>Build an Empire - Manage resources, research new advancements and expand your kingdom. Plan your towns to match your playstyle - will you utilise brute force, magic or a mix of both? There are many paths to world domination.</li>
<li>Wage War - Dive into a deep combat system utilizing troop abilities and powerful magic. Combine troops to maximize available spells and damage potential. Use the battlefield to your advantage by claiming high ground and protecting bottlenecks.</li>
<li>Alone or Together - Immerse yourself in epic single player adventure or challenge your friends to an honourable duel, online or local!</li>
<li>In-game Level Editor - The in-game level editor allows you to create your own adventures using the same tools the developers use to create campaign and skirmish maps. Script in-game events, control the soundtrack, write dialogue and share your creations with others!</li>
<li>Four Factions - Four factions are locked in an epic conflict. Arleon, knights of old battling each other for dominance. Rana, ancient tribes fighting for survival in the swamp. Loth, necromancers raising the dead to create a glorious future. Barya, bold mercenaries and inventors dedicated to coin, gunpowder and independence.</li>
<li>A Choral Campaign - Listen to the bards as they celebrate your path to victory. Each of the two campaigns comes with a unique song that tells the tale of your rise and ruin. Unlock new verses as you complete missions, enjoying the full track at the end of the journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer is estimating around one year to remain in Early Access. For now what they have is an absolutely magical start to what could turn into one of the best fantasy strategy / RPG mixes around. It's already hit a Very Positive user rating on Steam too, which is unsurprising to me.</p>
<p><em>Nice to see another really interesting release working on Day 1 with Proton.</em></p>

      <title>Looks like the Budgie desktop is coming to Fedora Linux officially</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love the <a href="https://github.com/BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop" target="_blank">Budgie</a> desktop environment? Good news, another Linux distribution looks like it will have it soon with Fedora. This is official too, with developer Joshua Strobl formally getting it going.</p>
<p>This will include all the major parts required like the Budgie Control Center, Budgie Desktop, Budgie Desktop View and Budgie Screensaver. Going even further, Strobl noted in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/uq3gah/budgie_desktop_has_now_been_submitted_for/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post they are "strongly considering" getting a proper Fedora Budgie Spin going, which is Fedora's way of providing install media with various different desktop environments compared to the main Fedora Workstation with GNOME.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311430961652791083gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311430961652791083gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see things going well for Budgie after the split from Solus, as it's a pretty slick desktop environment that looks modern while staying out of your way to get work and gaming sorted on Linux.</p>

      <title>Fall Guys to become Epic Exclusive for new owners, so no Steam Deck support then</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again. Another game is moving from Steam to become an Epic Exclusive and this time it's <a href="https://www.fallguys.com/en-US/news/fall-guys-is-going-free-on-june-21-launching-on-playstation-nintendo-switch-xbox-and-the-epic-games-store" target="_blank">Fall Guys</a>.</p>
<p>It's the same situation as Rocket League. Epic acquired the studio, eventually made it free to play and pulled all new players from Steam to force them onto the Epic Store and that's what's happening with Fall Guys on June 21st. So anyone who owns it on Steam can continue playing and get updates but no new players on Steam will be able to get it.</p>
<p>For Proton and Steam Deck, this complicates things. Right now, Fall Guys has the Easy Anti-Cheat file needed to run on Linux and Steam Deck, although it's in the wrong place and needs moving to work (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/ge-proton-715-is-out-enables-fall-guys-on-linux-and-steam-deck-easily/" target="_blank">see here</a>). Now, there's really no reason for them to keep it there and certainly the Epic Store release won't think about Linux and Steam Deck at all since Epic don't support either.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cnAxsZXd7vE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c1596702612843b3c4f77f59e1b36e24.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cnAxsZXd7vE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What to do then? Well, there's always the cheap knock-off of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677740/Stumble_Guys/" target="_blank">Stumble Guys</a> which appears to work perfectly although it's clearly a much cheaper copy that really doesn't feel as good. You never know what might happen though, perhaps they might see a surge in players and just keep on making it better.</p>

      <title>Super Hexagon is getting a big overhaul available in Beta now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Hexagon Neo is the upcoming big upgrade for Super Hexagon from Terry Cavanagh, originally released in 2012 it's remained a rather popular title. Currently with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over sixteen thousand users, it's probably worth a look if you've still never played it.</p>
<p>With simple looks and devilish difficulty, Super Hexagon has a simple idea: you control a tiny little triangle, and various hexagons come at you quickly from the screen edges and you need to avoid getting trapped. That's pretty much it but it really is good.</p>
<p>Super Hexagon Neo will bring with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The framework got completely replaced with a new one built just for Super Hexagon</li>
<li>It should be more stable and in some cases quite a bit faster</li>
<li>The window is now resizable, and macOS/Wayland now have high-DPI support</li>
<li>Controller support is better and the UI now accounts for controller input</li>
<li>A "part 2" eventually</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the technical side of things it's now using SDL, FNA3D and FAudio. Together it means better window management (like a resizable window finally), better controller support and many other smaller tech improvements behind the scenes to just keep it running nicely across various platforms. More on all that <a href="https://superhexagon.com/neo/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Part 2 will be a major update but it sounds like it is still some time away.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2sz0mI_6tLQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/30de3c4abd133e1340de0cc451f45ae5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2sz0mI_6tLQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To test it right now you can opt into the Beta on <u>Steam</u> named "neo-update". Right click on the game in your Steam Library, go to Betas and just pick that from the dropdown. It will come to other stores when ready.</p>
<p>You can buy it in many places like <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/super-hexagon?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/Super_Hexagon/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/super-hexagon" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/super_hexagon" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to take better quality screenshots on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get some higher quality screenshots of all the awesome moments in gaming on the Steam Deck (or any Linux desktop?). Here's a quick-tip guide on what to do. This will also work on Windows too but of course the Steam Deck uses Linux, and so the path to certain folders is different.</p>
<p>Guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be in Desktop Mode (Power button -&gt; Switch to Desktop).</li>
<li>Open the Steam Settings (right click Steam icon -&gt; Settings).</li>
<li>Click in-game on the left panel.</li>
<li>Click save an uncompressed copy.</li>
<li>Click the "Screenshot Folder" button and pick where you want them to drop in.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't want that but do wish to know where to find all your screenshots regardless, you can find them in the hidden Steam folder:</p>
<ol>
<li>In your Dolphin file manager, head to the hamburger menu in the top right.</li>
<li>Click the Show hidden files option.</li>
<li>Then head through: <code class="inline-code">.steam/steam/userdata/yourid/760/remote/gameid/screenshots/</code> or if you don't have .steam for whatever reason it's also found in <code class="inline-code">.local/share/Steam/userdata/yourid/760/remote/gameid/screenshots/</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Short video guide on it if that helps too:</p>

      <title>Bad at Chess? Bring a shotgun in this roguelike spin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If, like me, you're terrible at Chess, how about the chance to jump across the board with a Shotgun? That's exactly what you do in Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Working out of the box with no issues found with Steam Play Proton, it's another small game that will end up sucking away vast amounts of your time and it's pretty cheap too at only £4.99. It doesn't have controller support but on Steam Deck, it has such simple controls it's practically perfect anyway with the trackpad.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10499837411652696014gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10499837411652696014gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The idea is that you were a rubbish King, treated your people badly and so they all left you (including your Queen) for the other one. Obviously you're mad about it and all you had left was your trusty Shotgun, so you decide to go on something of a Chess-rampage and battle your way through.</p>
<p>Runs don't last particularly long, so it makes for a fantastic coffee-break game but it's so delightful that you can easily lose a few hours to it too. So it's a bit like Vampire Survivors and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/uh-oh-gunlocked-is-like-vampire-survivors-in-space-and-just-as-absorbing/" target="_blank">Gunlocked</a> in that way. What makes it especially good is that it has some of the basic rules of Chess for movements but adds the uniqueness found in rougelikes and the action too. Each turn you get to decide where you go, or who you shoot as you attempt to avoid a checkmate while also hunting down the enemy King.</p>
<p>After each floor you will also get to pick between two random cards, each giving an upgrade for you and the enemy to spice things up which is why it's fun to replay through it many times.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="U_O1_a6CLog"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/967c3bbd8bf6e416489e11e5743c343b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/U_O1_a6CLog" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is going right near the top of the pile for my regular games on both my Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Doom &amp; Destiny Worlds gets Steam Deck Verified, dev gives info on what they changed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doom &amp; Destiny Worlds is an open world turn-based RPG with crafting, building, farming, and 4 players local co-op option. Recently it was Verified for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For those who do want the techy-info, I asked the developer what was changed to get it working nicely and Verified for the Steam Deck. They replied to say: "The main changes required was in full controller support without a keyboard and OpenGL code compatibility. In specifics where on PC we could go without explicitly clearing renderbuffers as they where usually automatically cleared before reuse, on Deck we had to explicitly clear RB on every reuse. There are also some Win32 libraries we use to better detect keyboards that were crashing on the Deck."</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.3.1 adds themes, platform selection, auto update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> 2.3.1 is officially out now, bringing with it some big new features to help you manage games from Epic Games and GOG. I previously wrote about the last Beta but it has improved even more since then.</p>
<p>The first big new feature is the ability to change the Theme with five built in. Some examples (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Default</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4165812321652693115gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4165812321652693115gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Dracula</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11041994051652693114gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11041994051652693114gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Zombie</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10662046131652693113gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10662046131652693113gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can install the Windows version of a game from GOG instead of the Native Linux version if you wish.</li>
<li>The Heroic app can now auto-update, for Linux it's with the AppImage.</li>
<li>You can add favourite games.</li>
<li>You can hide games.</li>
<li>Swap between favourites or recently played (or nothing) at the top of the app.</li>
<li>A new accessibility screen to allow you to tweak certain settings:</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13315749381652693323gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13315749381652693323gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now sort the game list alphabetically or by install status.</li>
<li>Heroic will now show you how much space is left on the device you're downloading / installing on.</li>
<li>Various other UI improvements.</li>
<li>Various other bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really fantastic to see just how quickly Heroic is evolving to become a real quality way to manage your games, especially for Epic who don't support Linux at all with games or their store.</p>
<p>This is probably my favourite launcher because it's so simple and just gets the job done on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Deck Builders Round Up</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p style="text-align:left">Deckbuilders! I love 'em. Slay the Spire got me into this genre digitally, after originally feeling the pull of Magic the Gathering in the late 90's. After over a hundred hours playing Slay the Spire, the classic that invigorated the whole genre, I had the bug, bad. So since late 2019 I’ve been hunting for more. MOAR! Here’s a round up of a few favourites.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a couple of Proton-only titles, then look at the native options.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Neoverse</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/994220/NEOVERSE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em>(Note: Proton)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:left">Yes, this <em>is</em> full of scantily-clad, over-sexualised ladies, thanks for noticing. Judge me all you like, but after landing this in a Humble Bundle, I was gobsmacked at how good it is and I stand by that assessment.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><img alt="" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7215398741652371832gol573.jpg"/></p>
<p style="text-align:left">This is the game in this round up most like Slay the Spire, and like its inspiration (it launched almost exactly one year later), each of the three characters have very different styles. The right amount of challenge combines with surprisingly deep gameplay and brilliant synergies if you land the right cards. Well worth playing.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Tainted Grail: Conquest</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1199030/Tainted_Grail_Conquest/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tainted_grail" target="_blank">GOG</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">(<em>Note: Proton. Also, I didn’t test the GOG version under Lutris/Wine, apologies</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Another single-player vs the world game, but this time, with a beautifully realised 3D world which acts as the map. The map has a clever lighting mechanic which revolves around a dwindling torch, driving the gameplay forward. Some unusual design choices in this one – for example just a single “block” will block ALL damage from one source, while other stats drive armour and dodge. There’s a lot going on and it’s pretty challening, but beautfully done. I've not played much yet, but it looks like there's about 7 characters to unlock.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Across the Obelis</strong><strong>k</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385380/Across_the_Obelisk/" target="_blank">Steam</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Still in early access, but showing a lot of promise, this is the first "team" game I'm covering - this features a cast of four characters from different classes. The mechanics are under heavy development, but there's a nice combination of in-game progress as you build your deck and between-run progress as you build up city resources. There’s also the glimmering of a cool story developing already, and the lore of a fantasy world recovering after decades of conflict. Already fully playable for multiple hours, this is also one to keep an eye on if you prefer the finished product, as I suspect it’s going to be pretty special.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Roguebook</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076200/Roguebook/" target="_blank">Steam</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">My personal favourite, this game revolves around a party of two taking on a series of challenges inspired by the developer's other game, Faeria. Amazing (truly AMAZING) synergies are at play here, allowing you to develop awesome teamwork with much less RNG than Slay the Spire.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><img alt="" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20019789751652371829gol573.jpg"/></p>
<p style="text-align:left">I honestly can’t recommend it enough. Full of character, an incredible overland map mechanic, inventive challenge system, beautiful graphics, clear, clean gameplay – it’s a must-buy in my opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Hadean Tactics</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260590/Hadean_Tactics/" target="_blank">Steam</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">I’ve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/hadean-tactics-a-realtime-auto-battler-with-deck-building-launches-today/" target="_blank">covered this one before</a> and it continues to develop apace, as you can see when Liam covered it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/the-great-auto-battler-deck-builder-hadean-tactics-gets-a-big-content-update/" target="_blank">6 months later</a> for its huge content update. It’s the combination of classic deck building with grid-based auto-battling which makes this so unique and compelling.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><img alt="" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4262499721652371892gol573.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:left">The auto-battling is frantic, but freezes every 7 seconds to allow you to spend your three energy by playing cards from your draw pile. Your tactics here can deal damage, boost allies or reposition units, which all follow their own rules about how they attack on the field of battle. Intense and unusual.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left"><em><strong>Honourable mentions</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Steamworld: Hand of Gilgamech</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/804010/SteamWorld_Quest_Hand_of_Gilgamech/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/steamworld_quest_hand_of_gilgamech" target="_blank">GOG</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">Much more story-based than the others I've mentioned, but still recommended. Some synergies, much more limited deck-building, but because it's driven by its narrative, there's much more of a slow-burn going on here.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Dicey Dungeons</strong> [<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/861540/Dicey_Dungeons/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/dicey_dungeons" target="_blank">GOG</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:left">This one hopefully needs no introduction. Is it really a deck builder? I don’t really care about pigeon-holing it – it’s great, and deserves to be played!</p>
<p style="text-align:left"><strong>Deep Sky Derelicts [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/698640/Deep_Sky_Derelicts/" target="_blank">Steam</a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deep_sky_derelicts" target="_blank">GOG</a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left">A brilliant sci-fi team-based deck-builder. I recommend sticking to it for a while, because it starts out very slowly. It pays off in the longer run though.</p>
<p style="text-align:left"> </p>
<p style="text-align:left">If you have any other deck-building suggestions, holler in the comments!</p>

      <title>Lovecraft&#39;s Untold Stories 2 gets delayed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Although the release date for Lovecraft's Untold Stories 2 was only announced (along with Native Linux support) recently, it seems they're going to give it a bit more time to cook.</p>
<p>It was going to release on May 17, 2022 but they've emailed in to say the game as a whole just needs more time after all the feedback they had during testing. No new date yet but they said they will announce it sometime soon. As a reminder: while it is a sequel, you <em>don't</em> need to have played the first game, as they've made sure new players will have everything they need and players "will understand the story".</p>
<p>Some fresh screenshots were also shared with the announcement like these:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11835673681652474982gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11835673681652474982gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6041800121652474983gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6041800121652474983gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 continues the narrative of the cult classic first game, but this time players will continue the fight against the unknown with new elements like crafting - using blueprints and resources to create consumables and even new equipment. Reunite with old acquaintances and meet new heroes with up to 6 playable characters to choose from, explore new procedurally generated locations, defend yourself against dozens of different enemies and face off against epic bosses. But beware… Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 is more challenging than ever before, and the tough nightmarish creatures opposing you will not give up easily!"</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight dozens of different enemies, monsters and terrifying bosses from the Cthulhu Mythos</strong> in this intense, challenging action RPG. Ferocious beasts in the Swamps, Asylum lunatics, City thugs and the demonic creatures from the void will test your resolve to uncover the truth!</li>
<li><strong>Meet the 6 playable characters</strong> <strong>-</strong> 3 familiar faces from the series and 3 complete newcomers - each with their own weapons, gear and skills. Switch between them freely and pick the one most suited for the task at hand!</li>
<li><strong>Collect hundreds of different weapons and clothing items, or craft your own -</strong> scour every last room in a level, open every single box and get rewarded with randomized drops of gear, money for trading or resources and blueprints for crafting.</li>
<li><strong>Side quests are crucial -</strong> you can earn extra resources and items and get that extra bit of advantage you may need to be able to progress in the main story. Don’t forget to trigger side quests every time you encounter them, you don’t have to finish them right away, but keep them for when you need extra loot!</li>
<li><strong>Exploit the roguelike elements -</strong> level maps are randomly generated, as are all loot drops. The game is not pure roguelike: if you die or choose to restart the level, you only lose progress in the current area. Use this to your advantage, and if you don’t get the loot you wanted; try again!</li>
<li><strong>Make use of Charms and Amulets!</strong> Sacred relics which grant strange new abilities. Find those that serve you the best and make your journey unique - but beware, power may come at a cost!</li>
<li><strong>Plunge into the world of darkness where every step could be your last</strong>. Balance on the brink of madness as you explore the Asylum and various other locales in the city of Arkham, Swamps, Enchanted Forest, even the Underworld and many more mind-bending locations, all in procedurally generated levels!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Open 3D Engine v22.05 out, O3DCon in October with proposals open</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally Amazon Lumberyard that was donated to open source, the Open 3D Foundation just announced a big new release and they have an annual conference coming up.</p>
<p>Lots new in O3DE v22.05 including upgrades for core stability, installer validation, motion matching updates, user-defined property (UDP) support for the asset pipeline, and automated testing advancements.</p>
<p>Work to improve the game engine for artists came along with this release thanks to the ability to integrate user-defined properties (UDP) metadata into its asset pipeline from source assets so that scene-building and asset-processing logic can be customized using this metadata. Animation saw improvements too so animators can "utilize motion matching, a data-driven animation technique that synthesizes motions based on existing animation data and current character and input contexts to deliver photorealistic experiences".</p>
<p>Some of the other improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simpler customization of the render pipeline is now possible using a new set of APIs. Examples of gems that currently exploit this capability include Terrain, LyShine and TressFx.</li>
<li>Developers can now re-use Material Types much more easily.</li>
<li>Developers can now control the spawning of player-controlled, networked entities using an improved interface, a capability that is essential for building multiplayer games.</li>
<li>Automated tests now verify that an installer build is valid, and ensures that all of the steps within the build are successfully executed. These tests are run nightly for O3DE, and have been designed so that anyone can plug them into their quality verification process.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Linux specifically the whitebox module is also <a href="https://github.com/o3de/o3de/pull/5075" target="_blank">now</a> supported. Full release notes <a href="https://www.o3de.org/docs/release-notes/archive/22-05-0/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>With biannual releases planned and the next due in October 2022, plenty more will be on the way. Do you have high hopes for this game engine? Let us know in the comments.</p>
<p>As for the conference it's happening on October 18-19, 2022, in Austin, Texas and they're looking for people to do various talks and so proposals are <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/o3dcon/program/cfp/" target="_blank">now open</a>. This will be a hybrid event, so anyone interested in their quickly advancing open source game engine can attend in-person or virtually.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"I'm proud of the O3DE community's focus on core stability while delivering new capabilities aimed to simplify and enhance 3D development for developers around the globe," said Royal O'Brien, Executive Director of O3DF and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. "I'm also incredibly excited about the opportunity O3DCon offers in bringing together diverse minds to collaborate on advancing the state of open 3D development across so many industries."</p>

      <title>Please Fix The Road will have an official version just for pirates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Please Fix The Road is an upcoming puzzle game I highlighted back in March because it looks simply beautiful and perhaps a bit of a challenge. The developer announced recently a rather unusual plan in the indie dev space, involving pirates.</p>
<p>A wonderfully styled puzzle game where you, as the name suggests, fix up roads by rotating and moving tiles. The end result doesn't need to look good, you just need to get people from A to B by manipulating multiple tiles at a time, insert new tiles, destroy them and more.</p>
<p>For this upcoming release and word of pirates being spotted, we're not talking about those who actually sail the seas and get up to no good, we're talking about software pirates here — obviously. Instead of going after them, or getting bothered by them, the developer has decided to make an "official" pirate version. While not a unique idea as a few other developers have done it in the past, it's not exactly something that's popular with developers with all sorts of arguments for and against doing it.</p>

<p>Developer Ariel Jurkowski said on <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielJurkowski/status/1522202001702068225" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Pirate version will have all of the launch levels, but no updates. No strings attached. There's an extra pirate themed song at the start, altered intro sequence, a pirate face instead of the cogwheel options icon and a request in the options menu to buy the game. Cheers!"</p>
<p>Following up in another <a href="https://twitter.com/ArielJurkowski/status/1522220431402586112" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post in reply to a user, Jurkowski also said: "It would be pirated anyway and I don't blame anyone for it, it is what it is. I hope at least some people will appreciate the gesture, maybe I'll get some PR points from this. Cheers!"</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets some quick fixes, main Steam Client update with Deck Verified Collections</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released a small update for the Steam Deck, along with an update to the main desktop Steam client.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck it's mainly a small clean-up release after the recent big update. Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3216144458731474306" target="_blank">what's new</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed per-app performance profiles for non-Steam shortcuts</li>
<li>Fixed TDP limit slider temporarily displaying an incorrect value</li>
<li>Fixed demos and free games failing to install from the Steam Store</li>
<li>Fixed keys with AltGr functionality not being capitalized properly</li>
<li>Added rumble / haptics toggles back to the Quick Access menu</li>
<li>Updated localization</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the main desktop Steam client <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/5525365201760610310" target="_blank">update</a>, there's a new set of Steam Deck compatibility options for Dynamic Collections. So now you can set up your own dedicated collections in the Steam client as a whole for Deck Verified and Playable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2624496741652433202gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2624496741652433202gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently you <em>cannot</em> set it to <em>just</em> Playable titles. It's either: Verified; Verified + Playable; Verified + Playable + Untested; Verified + Playable + Untested + Unsupported.</p>
<p>On top of that performance should be improved for opening app details of games that have lots of DLC, multiple bug fixes for Steam Cloud so there should be fewer problems with cloud syncing, on-screen keyboard should work better when streaming to a Steam Deck and other miscellaneous fixes including these specific for Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where updating graphics drivers would re-download media pre-caching files</li>
<li>Fixed the file picker extension filters not appearing when selecting Library custom art</li>
<li>Fixed adding non-Steam shortcuts with spaces in the path</li>
<li>Added home and mounted drive paths to the file picker quick bar</li>
<li>Added the ability for the file picker to remember the previous location when selecting Library custom art</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stellaris 3.4 &#39;Cepheus&#39; and Stellaris: Overlord out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive has released the major Stellaris: Overlord expansion, along with a free Stellaris 3.4 version update. Let's go over what's new.</p>
<p>This big new expansion adds in brand new vassalization mechanics, some more varied empire additions spreadout across the stars, five new origins, new technology, orbital rings, hyper relays and quantum catapults to travel quickly and of course some stellar new music as well to relax while you're subjugating other empires and bending them to your will.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ONAnoNoax5U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/da7657711c27f6fac0c332ab8582fb72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ONAnoNoax5U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the new origins added in, Overlord gives you a few ways to spice up your early game including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Imperial Fiefdom - You may be just a Specialist Empire now, but some day, the galaxy may need a new ruler… shouldn’t it be you?</li>
<li>Slingshot to the Stars - The ruined remains of a Quantum Catapult have been discovered near your homeworld - what secrets might it unlock if your people are clever enough to bring it back online?</li>
<li>Subterranean - Your species adapted to life underground, excelling in mining and archaeology. See what awaits you far, far above the surface!</li>
<li>Teachers of the Shroud - Developing in contact with the curious psions known as the Shroudwalkers, your empire has learned a thing or two about expanding their minds!</li>
<li>Progenitor Hive - Under your leadership, this hivemind empire can achieve more than ever before… but without your guidance, the hive will fall to ruin!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't had time to try them all, since games of Stellaris can take a very long time to go through. For my chosen play-through of the DLC though, I went for "Slingshot to the Stars" and I can safely say that's possibly the most exciting start to Stellaris I've ever had. You start off with one of the new Quantum Catapults very close to you, so it's an easy one to check out something big that's brand new in Overlord.</p>
<p>The first time I laid eyes on that Quantum Catapult, my space-nerd heart nearly exploded with excitement to begin unravelling its mysteries. Who made it? Why did they leave it? What does it actually do? Many questions and it takes some time to answer them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8588396341652379522gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8588396341652379522gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You find out more about it using the relic research system, assigning a ship and a scientist to it as you dive further into its secrets and it's things like this that make me fully appreciate some of the writing that goes into the little stories spread throughout Stellaris — something this was designed around. Honestly, I wish the Quantum Catapult research actually lasted longer, as I was enjoying the little logs that were coming in on it immensely. The ending of that chain was bittersweet but you do find out why it was created and now it is yours. Time to reach for the stars, once repaired that is, which isn't as costly as expected for such a big thing.</p>
<p>Once repaired or constructed (everyone can make them eventually), it's not a done deal. They carry a certain risk. While you may be able to use them to throw a fleet across the stars — they might not end up exactly where you intended and that risk increases the further out you try for. Thankfully, they do have upgrades to make them better but they're costly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4108498541652379628gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4108498541652379628gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The fact that I can just attempt to YOLO a fleet of ships across space, perhaps into enemy territory is awesome, it really does open up so many more ways to play. Not just for those using it but you also have to think about protection against it, and perhaps attempt to take it down or take it over as a priority.</p>
<p>For the free new features in Stellaris 3.4 Cepheus, one of the most interesting is the new situation system. This covers multiple things like Resource Deficits, Planetary Uprisings and Machine Uprisings and some other new story events that have been added in. They're far less basic, and have you run through stages, so it's a little more like the artifacts system.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13520563871652382902gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13520563871652382902gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm quite a big fan of this system, especially when it comes to the resource issues that I constantly come up against because I'm quite terrible at managing everything. Instead of being brutally punished, with one deficit leading to another, having it start off slower and gradually progress onto being worse is much more manageable. Really, it just seems like a more fair way of handling it, giving players less resource-savvy to have more of a chance to come back from the brink.</p>
<p>Being modding friendly, I can't wait to see what new and exciting ways modders can enhance the game even further with this situation system. Let me know in the comments if you can think of anything fun for it. Loads more included, see the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/dev-team-3-4-2-cepheus-patch-released-checksum-7836.1524452/" target="_blank">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>It's pretty safe to say that if you haven't touched Stellaris for a while, or even since the early months after the original release, coming back to it now is like a very different game. Even without a single DLC pack, Stellaris is so full of content it's quite fantastic and it continues being one of my absolute favourite strategy games. It's also still easily the most accessible strategy game to come from Paradox.</p>
<p>You really can't go wrong with Stellaris paired up with the Overlord expansion. However, the Overlord is perhaps far less essential than other big expansions but that doesn't mean it isn't good, it's still a very fun time and more of Stellaris is always a good thing in my book.</p>
<p><em>A fab time to jump in with a big sale on now too.</em></p>

      <title>Save the Bees on May 20 with the release of APICO</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of the most important creatures on Earth and now you'll be looking after them in APICO on May 20, 2022. Developed by the brotherly duo that is TNgineers, along with publishing from Whitethorn Games, this is the next big cozy indie game you need to keep on your radar.</p>
<p>A peaceful game where you explore, build and take care of nature's precious pollinators. Collect them, breed them and more in a game that combines together elements of resource gathering, biology, and beekeeping minigames, taking ideas from a mix of real-life and fantasy apiculture and floriculture. As you expand, you will be able to find lost species, cross-breed and repopulate various islands. Sounds like a perfect game to cozy up with on a Steam Deck to me.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UJJQwV51SGE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8057eec953bf15f3c2c226500093a501.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UJJQwV51SGE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique crafting &amp; beekeeping minigames that drive gameplay progression</li>
<li>Cross-breed different bees to discover over 30 new species</li>
<li>Make and sell honey, Apicola, and other beekeeping products</li>
<li>Repopulate lost species and release them back into the wild</li>
<li>Multiple biomes to explore, each with their own unique bee species</li>
<li>Uncover the forgotten secrets of the APICO islands</li>
<li>Play together with friends in 4 player online co-op!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only does it seem like a wonderful game that I very much enjoyed the demo with, it will also help support the Bees! The developers will be donating a portion of sales towards national and international bee, beekeeping, &amp; wild bee conservation charities. Gotta save the Bees!</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://tngineers.itch.io/apico" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1390190/APICO/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Uh oh, Gunlocked is like Vampire Survivors in space and just as absorbing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you burned out on Vampire Survivors and want something new? Or perhaps you just prefer spaceships? Gunlocked is here to give you more action.</p>
<p>On Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with the latest Proton 7. On Steam Deck, setting it to fullscreen instead of windowed gives you a better screen size as this game gives a special border in windowed mode.</p>
<p>In Gunlocked, just like Vampire Survivors, you have no direct weapon control. Instead, weapons fire off automatically on timers, so the strategy is a mix of rapid dodging and knowing where to be when your weapons are about to fire. To put it another way, Gunlocked is a vertical-scrolling twin-stick without the second stick. You get a small area to move around in like classic shooters, but it has the added upgrade and unlock system that Vampire Survivors is now known for too with you collecting little gems.</p>

<p>Once you collect enough of these gems, you level up and get to pick between a few new abilities or power-ups to build up your ship as you go. You can unlock some incredibly fun combination moves with this system. Weapons aren't the usual lasers firing in front of you either, there's a big mix of things requiring some thought in how you play. Frankly it's almost intoxicating, I don't want to put it down, I need more.</p>
<p>A run doesn't last particularly long either, so it's a great game to take a break with and doesn't require you to stick at it for hours.</p>
<p>Current Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Action-roguelite gameplay</li>
<li>Rich, 2d pixel art graphics</li>
<li>20 Powerful upgrades</li>
<li>3 Unique playable pilot characters</li>

<p>Since it's in Early Access, plenty more is to come including new enemies, bosses, pilots with unique attributes, powerups, weapons and upgrades, difficulty options, and more!</p>
<p>Here's a short look at some gameplay because I simply had to video this one directly, absolutely love it:</p>

      <title>Core Keeper gets dedicated servers, upcoming Sunken Sea Biome sounds huge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper is another big indie hit and for good reason, it's a total gem and it's expanding to become a lot bigger.</p>
<p>First, a new update is out that brings with it dedicated servers, boosting the online functionality of the game. So now you can share worlds with friends, and set up a dedicated server for a community without someone needing to be online at all times to host it and play. However, the normal in-game hosting is still available as before — best of both worlds, along with new admin functions to keep things nice and clean.</p>
<p>Some other new additions include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A reinforcement mechanic has been added that allows players to extend the durability of their items as well as giving the item a small stat boost. Reinforcing an item costs some of the item's crafting materials.</li>
<li>Added scrap parts that can drop from destructibles and some enemies.</li>
<li>Higher tier hoes now cover a larger area. This works for both tilling and gathering plants in larger areas.</li>
<li>Added a digging damage stat to shovels that impacts how many uses it takes to dig up ground. Health of ground has been rebalanced around the digging damage of shovels so that higher tier shovels are more effective against lower tier ground and lower tier shovels are less effective against higher tier ground.</li>
<li>Added a Scarlet Hoe that can be crafted in the Scarlet Workbench.</li>
<li>Added a Scarlet Shovel that can be crafted in the Scarlet Workbench.</li>
<li>Moved the Scarlet Sword to be crafted in the Scarlet Anvil instead of the Scarlet Workbench.</li>
<li>Large Watering Can now covers 2x2 tiles. More watering options coming later!</li>
<li>Fishing rods no longer have durability.</li>
<li>The chance to gain kelp from fishing has been reduced, and we’ve added resources such as ores, wood, fibre and scrap parts that can be gained from fishing.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BIYcsYVxzPg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ea0bcd27bddb6575af1ec256495fd2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BIYcsYVxzPg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A roadmap has also now been posted, with the first major update due in June. THis is a big one too adding in a new sub-biome, a new boss, 4 new enemies, a new types of ore, more gear and weapons, a legendary weapon, new fish, new plants, teleporters, boats, map markers and much more.</p>
<p>I honestly can hardly contain my excitement for that update, after stopping really early to give it more time to get updates before playing properly but I absolutely loved what I saw from it.</p>
<p>The developers also recently announced they hit over 500,000 downloads within the first two weeks after launch, which is an incredible milestone for an Early Access game.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Get an early look at The Garden Path with a few copies left on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Garden Path is an upcoming casual chilled-out life sim that looks gorgeous. Now you can get access to it with the early bird limited access system on itch.io.</p>
<p>A game designed to be played whenever you feel like it, and things continue advancing in the world while you're not playing, so it's not requiring you to be sat playing endless hours to progress anywhere. For those of us with busy lives that still want to check out more games, it sounds interesting.</p>
<p>"The Garden Path explores the quiet moments of a life well lived, where your garden will grow to reflect both the passing of time and your own design. Time here runs in concert with the real world, and the passing of seasons heralds new encounters and a new story to weave.</p>
<p>Above all, The Garden Path is a life sim that celebrates the tranquil and the pensive, a tucked-away place to shape and grow as you like."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A humble gardening life-sim with real-time progress even when you’re away. Play for a little while, and come back some time later to see how the Garden evolves.</li>
<li>Rich illustrated visuals and original soundtracks that draw you in.</li>
<li>A charming cast of characters, all with their own stories to tell.</li>
<li>A far away corner to call your own - somewhere to pause and stay awhile.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>The Jackbox Party Starter coming this &#39;Summer&#39; with more localization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Jackbox Party Starter has been announced to launch this "Summer", which will be the perfect entry to get the party started with more languages supported.</p>
<p>It's not quite a "new", as it's a bundling of three existing games with Quiplash 3, Trivia Murder Party 2 and Tee K.O. However, they are all getting a big update for it. All games will support English, French, Italian, German and Spanish. Not just full subtitles but all of the voice actor dialog will be fully translated they said.</p>
<p>On top of that some new settings found in their 8th full pack will be coming to the starter including family-friendly filters, moderation, text filtering plus updated pause and settings menus. They also teased "some top secret new features that are going to be included in The Jackbox Party Pack 9" will be in this starter pack too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets per-app performance profiles, hardware survey and loads more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another absolutely <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3216144458727332893" target="_blank">huge update</a> for the Steam Deck just landed, with Valve clearly taking on lots of feedback to make it the best handheld gaming device around.</p>
<p>The first big one is that you can now add a performance profile for each title. By default the main system settings are used, and when toggling on a profile for the currently running title is then created with all changes saved and automatically applied on launching. Pictures below (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1845169841652308926gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1845169841652308926gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1059037291652308925gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1059037291652308925gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is going to be fantastic for just getting the most out of each game, without having to constantly change settings in the performance menu. No doubt Valve will continue expanding that, perhaps even allow sharing like you can for Steam Input configurations.</p>
<p>Oh, and for those curious to know how well the Steam Deck is doing, we're going to perhaps get a better look at that next month, as Valve has now hooked up the Steam Hardware Survey properly for the Steam Deck. So maybe we'll see even better numbers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/linux-user-share-on-steam-hits-second-highest-percentage-in-years/" target="_blank">than seen recently</a>.</p>
<p>More work is being done on sorting out external displays, as we come closer to the release of the official dock. As now when you're connected to an external display, the Steam Deck interface is scaled to virtual 1280x800 resolution and Valve say "more work on this feature and functionality is underway".</p>
<p>Some of the other additions include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance when switching from offline to online modes</li>
<li>Improved availability of home screen sections when switching from offline to online modes</li>
<li>Added the Bulgarian Phonetic Traditional and Phonetic keyboard layouts</li>
<li>Corrected the interaction between CapsLock and Shift</li>
<li>The keyboard shows AltGr symbol hints when AltGr is not active</li>
<li>The keyboard only shows AltGr symbols when AltGr is active</li>
<li>Non-ASCII characters work in desktop mode</li>
<li>Removed rumble &amp; haptics toggles from the Quick Access menu. These can be accessed in the Settings &gt; Controller Settings page.</li>
<li>Moved Re-order Controllers button to the Other section in the Quick Access menu</li>
<li>Added a "Stop Streaming" option to the Power menu when hosting a Remote Play session</li>
<li>Updated Recently Played games list to include streamed games</li>
<li>Plus a bunch of bug fixes</li>
</ul>

      <title>NVIDIA releases open source Linux GPU kernel modules, Beta Driver 515.43.04 out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a nice big win for open source, NVIDIA has today <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-releases-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/" target="_blank">officially revealed</a> that they've released open source Linux GPU kernel modules. Additionally, driver version 515.43.04 is out. This is a huge step and hopefully the sign of more to come from NVIDIA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This release is a significant step toward improving the experience of using NVIDIA GPUs in Linux, for tighter integration with the OS and for developers to debug, integrate, and contribute back. For Linux distribution providers, the open-source modules increase ease of use. They also improve the out-of-the-box user experience to sign and distribute the NVIDIA GPU driver. Canonical and SUSE are able to immediately package the open kernel modules with Ubuntu and SUSE Linux Enterprise Distributions.</p>
<cite>NVIDIA</cite></blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA say that with each new driver release, they will be publishing the sources mentioned on GitHub, and they will be accepting contributions from the community and other developers.</p>
<p>For now, data center GPUs are "production ready" but normal GeForce and Workstation GPUs (what we all use) are at an "alpha quality" for Turing and Ampere but NVIDIA plans to continue improving on it and "fully featured GeForce and Workstation support will follow in subsequent releases and the NVIDIA Open Kernel Modules will eventually supplant the closed-source driver". NVIDIA has also been working with the likes of Canonical, Red Hat, and SUSE for better packaging and deployment of it all.</p>
<p>There's still quite a long road ahead, as NVIDIA say it currently doesn't conform to the upstream Linux kernel design and so can't go upstream yet but they have plans to work on "an upstream approach" with help again from Canonical, Red Hat, and SUSE. For now, NVIDIA say it can serve as a way to also "help improve the Nouveau driver" since it will be able to use the same firmware as the main proprietary NVIDIA driver.</p>
<p>As for the driver release version 515.43.04, here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf and VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier Vulkan extensions. To use this functionality, the nvidia-drm kernel module must be loaded with DRM KMS mode setting enabled. See the DRM KMS section of the README for guidance on enabling mode setting.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-suspend.service, nvidia-resume.service, and nvidia-hibernate.service to use WantedBy= rather than RequiredBy=dependencies for systemd-suspend.service and systemd-hibernate.service.This avoids a problem where suspend or hibernate fails if the NVIDIA driver is uninstalled without disabling these services first.<br/>
	See https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/21991<br/>
	If these services were manually enabled, it may be necessary to update their dependencies by running sudo systemctl reenable nvidia-suspend.service nvidia-resume.service nvidia-hibernate.service</li>
<li>Interlaced modes are now disabled when active stereo is enabled.</li>
<li>NVIDIA X Server Settings will now display the quit confirmation dialog automatically if only there are pending changes that need to be manually saved. The corresponding configuration option to control the appearance of the quit dialog was thus also removed.</li>
<li>Removed the warning message about mismatches between the compiler used to build the Linux kernel and the compiler used to build the NVIDIA kernel modules from nvidia-installer. Modern compilers are less likely to cause problems when this type of mismatch occurs, and it has become common in many distributions to build the Linux kernel with a different compiler than the default system compiler.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to skip test-loading the kernel modules on systems where no supported NVIDIA GPUs are detected.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to avoid a race condition which could cause the kernel module test load to fail due to udev automatically loading kernel modules left over from an existing NVIDIA driver installation. This failure resulted in an installation error message "Kernel module load error: File exists".</li>
<li>Updated the RTD3 Video Memory Utilization Threshold (NVreg_DynamicPowerManagementVideoMemoryThreshold) maximum value from 200 MB to 1024 MB.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With those changes, it means the start of support for <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> on NVIDIA drivers too!</p>
<p>Source code up on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, driver release <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/187834/en" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, you can read the take from Red Hat's Christian F.K. Schaller on it <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2022/05/11/why-is-the-open-source-driver-release-from-nvidia-so-important-for-linux/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: oh, and remember how NVIDIA wanted to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-play-proton-could-get-direct-support-for-nvidia-image-scaling/" target="_blank">NVIDIA Image Scaling into Proton</a>? Well, a Pull Request is now up for Gamescope <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/pull/488" target="_blank">support</a>, where it might be more likely to be accepted since it makes a bit more sense there perhaps.</p>

      <title>Humble put up a &#39;Handheld PC Power Bundle&#39; of games ready for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Got a Steam Deck or another handheld PC? Well, this latest one is just for you. Humble have put up a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/handheld-pc-power-bundle?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Handheld PC Power Bundle of games</a>.</p>
<p>All of the games included are either Steam Deck Verified or Playable, so clearly Humble Bundle have been paying attention to the wider industry. Not surprising, considering how popular the Steam Deck and anything surrounding it continues to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the games included in the bundle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exanima (Verified)</li>
<li>MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries (Playable)</li>
<li>Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden - Deluxe Edition (Playable)</li>
<li>Neon Abyss (Verified)</li>
<li>Orcs Must Die! 2 - Complete (Playable)</li>
<li>Orcs Must Die! 3 (Verified)</li>
<li>Paint the Town Red (Verified)</li>
<li>Parkasaurus (Playable)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/handheld-pc-power-bundle?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Check out the bundle</a> if interested.</p>
<p>Have to admit my finger is hovering over the trigger for this, Parkasaurus looks wonderful. Somewhat amusing though is how they say "Handheld Verified" or "Handheld Playable", likely as there's all sorts of rules around advertising and using the Steam Deck name directly.</p>

      <title>XIVLauncher now on Linux, gets FINAL FANTASY XIV Online running on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the newer official launcher for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/39210/FINAL_FANTASY_XIV_Online/" target="_blank">FINAL FANTASY XIV Online</a> is incredibly problematic with Steam Play Proton, a third-party launcher has recently come to Linux to help with that.</p>
<p>A game I know a great many people enjoyed, and now that <a href="https://goatcorp.github.io/" target="_blank">XIVLauncher</a> is properly available for Linux and installable from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/dev.goats.xivlauncher" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, it should allow more people to continue playing on Linux and the Steam Deck. The team behind it even set up a <a href="https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/steamdeck" target="_blank">full guide</a> to getting it running on Steam Deck. It even includes a special build of Wine that has been tuned just for getting FINAL FANTASY XIV Online running nicely.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3112935651652285125gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3112935651652285125gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully at some point it won't be needed, if Square Enix can look at the issues with their official launcher, but once again the community delivers to get a game more easily playable on Linux and Steam Deck. Currently, it has an Unsupported rating for the Steam Deck, largely due to the launcher. So if you wanted to get FINAL FANTASY XIV Online working on Linux and Steam Deck — this is for you!</p>
<p>As always with third-party launchers, use at your own risk.</p>

      <title>Little Inferno gets a newer Linux port, and improved Steam Deck compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Little Inferno, a 2012 classic from Tomorrow Corporation recently put up a fresh upgrade to keep it looking good. One of the early Linux ports, it seems it's had a bit of extra love lately. A popular game back when it originally released and it has an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam.</p>
<p>A thoroughly strange and unique game about setting things on fire, earning coins for doing so to buy more things to burn and perhaps a little more. I must confess I hadn't really put much time into it before this update but it's a delightful little game with no filler.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="En8cIVlj2Jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad55c32dc1e89ad6fdcca1fa1dccdb18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/En8cIVlj2Jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On May 10th the update notes state it has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new linux port using SDL2.</li>
<li>Provide improved compatibility with Steam deck</li>
<li>Native 64bit linux support</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's currently Steam Deck Verified, although that was done using the Windows version with Proton.</p>
<p>Curiously, I got a strange buzzing sound instead of some of the audio with the new 64bit version of the game. Deleting the "libopenal.so.1" file in the "lib64" folder seemed to solve that. No issues after that.</p>
<p>So far it looks like only the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/221260/Little_Inferno/" target="_blank">Steam</a> version has been updated with <a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.itch.io/little-inferno" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/little_inferno" target="_blank">GOG</a> not currently up to date.</p>

      <title>Retro Commander is a free-ish new RTS that brings on the nostalgia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Retro Commander from developer Noble Master is a free to play RTS that just landed on Steam in Early Access, and so far it seems to be pretty great and fills me up with nostalgia. Growing up with the likes of Dune 2, Total Annihilation, Red Alert I'm always on the lookout for new classic-styled base-building strategy games like this. So far, it seems like Retro Commander might hit the mark.</p>
<p>The developer explains that the focus is on two parts: a fun single-player that contains both a story campaign and skirmish battles, along with equally fun online multiplayer. The online experience also feature cross-platform play and a ranking system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0wzpzOAUzWw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/90b3142fb387c1a3153fa1ea4514ec47.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0wzpzOAUzWw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As it's a free to play game, it does offer micro-transactions and the free version is pretty limited with a $9.99 cost to unlock all the maps. For such a strategy game, the price seems <em>reasonable</em> and it's interesting to see more developers test out this hybrid model of letting people in to play with no time restriction to test and then pay if they like it.</p>
<p>When it comes to the gameplay, it feels like a strange mix between the classic Red Alert and Supreme Commander. You get the retro-style with a pretty pleasing look and then the sweet tactical zoom to get an easy glance at what's going on. Feels quite a lot like a more polished and coherently styled version of Rusted Warfare, another great 2D RTS.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><u>Post-Apocalyptic</u>: Real-time strategy (RTS) played in a post-apocalyptic timeline on Mother Earth. The environment includes day-night cycles, rain, snow, wind and solar flare activity.</li>
<li><u>Story Campaign</u>: Deep campaign and story line of humanity after a cataclysmic event. Factions come with their own specialized <strong>technologies</strong> such as stealth, robots, drones or shields.</li>
<li><u>Single &amp; Multiplayer</u>: A challenging AI for both single and multiplayer matches with co-op play. Cross-platform multiplayer including <strong>LAN</strong>/internet. ONLINE play comes with an award and rating system.</li>
<li><u>Play Modes</u>: In addition to regular skirmish matches, the game supports missions such as elimination, survival, <strong>capture the flag</strong>, defense and <strong>battle royale</strong>. Available in both single and multiplayer also are escort and rescue missions.</li>
<li><u>Structures &amp; Troops</u>: Common troops for land, sea and air warfare is available to all factions. Specialized elements such as stealth, shields, <strong>EMP</strong> weapons, nukes, <strong>portals</strong>, orbital weapons, assimilator and other troops and structures provide for additional variety.</li>
<li><u>Modding</u>: A map editor is included allowing for player-modded maps including player-modded campaigns. All elements including troops, structures, as well as graphics and sound effects, can be modded if desired.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During the course of Early Access the developer plans to finish the campaign, improve the AI and add more maps. They estimate it will remain in Early Access for 4-12 months.</p>
<p>You can grab it from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/338820/Retro_Commander/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://noblemaster.itch.io/retro-commander" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>CurseForge modding client comes to Linux in Alpha, only supports WoW for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CurseForge, the popular game modding client, has now officially released an early Alpha version for Linux. Since it's early, and they're starting slow, for now it only supports mods / addons for World of Warcraft (Wine) although they do have plans to continue expanding it. A bit of an odd one to start with though don't you think?</p>
<p>It's been through a few different hands like Amazon / Twitch, with the current owners being Overwolf. One of the reasons its so popular is not just because of the amount of games and mods it has, but mod authors can also earn monies from it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7808623351652272046gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7808623351652272046gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - CurseForge on Linux</em></p>
<p>Some of the current known issues include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="collapse in highlighted-anchor" id="linux" style="height: auto;">
<ol>
<li><strong>Switching between flavors and installing addons will cause an error</strong>
<p>Navigate to a different page (e.g "My Addons") and then install the desired addon.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Navigating to "My Addons" while installing an addon will create 3 instances of the same file</strong>
<p>Shouldn't impact anything besides the UI. Change to another page and back to fix it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relaunch will close the App</strong><br/>
	Close the app and then open it manually.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deleting addons and reopening CF will cause the addons to be "modified"</strong><br/>
	This is a known issue, shouldn't affect anything besides the UI itself. We are working on a fix for the next upcoming versions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll be following it along now, so we can report on any major updates when they happen. As always, do <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/email-us/" target="_blank">email in</a> if you see something we don't.</p>
<p>Download it <a href="https://download.curseforge.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. The Linux version is an AppImage, so it should hopefully work well across different Linux distros.</p>

      <title>Wolfire versus Valve antitrust lawsuit to continue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After it seeming like Valve might have won in the lawsuit from Wolfire Game, the story appears to be far from over.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/wolfire-versus-valve-antitrust-lawsuit-dismissed/" target="_blank">Last we heard</a> it was in part being dismissed, seemingly like Valve had the upper hand as Wolfire didn't have sufficient evidence of their claims. Now though, as reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/class-action/valve-loses-bid-to-end-antitrust-case-over-steam-gaming-platform" target="_blank">Bloomberg Law</a>, part of the case has been allowed to continue as the judge now seems to believe that it's "plausible" Valve uses their position to mess with the market in their favour.</p>
<p>The issue here, as before, is that Wolfire claim that Valve and Steam use a "most favoured nation" clause with a mixture of "written and unwritten rules" to "prevent price competition from rival storefronts". Wolfire are again sticking to their claim that Valve would remove games from Steam that are found cheaper elsewhere, noting that a "Steam account manager" told Wolfire that Valve would "delist any games available for sale at a lower price elsewhere, whether or not using Steam keys" and it's this that has the judge saying "These allegations are sufficient to plausibly allege unlawful conduct" and so it's going to continue on that point.</p>
<p>Other claims like the 30% cut Valve take being "supracompetitive", and another antitrust issue of Valve tying together the Steam Store and Steam Platform seem to be dismissed.</p>
<p>Whenever we hear what happens next, we'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 36 is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora Linux 36 is officially out now, after a number of delays as the Fedora team don't like to rush things out when they're not ready. Here's what's new.</p>
<p>With their main desktop edition being Fedora Workstation which is now running <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gnome-42-released-with-the-new-global-dark-style-preference/" target="_blank">GNOME 42</a>, they tend to stick to plain vanilla GNOME and not make too many tweaks there. So there's no big extra special bells and whistles when it comes to Fedora releases that you wouldn't have seen in new versions of GNOME. Fedora's Matthew Miller mentions "Fedora Workstation focuses on the desktop, and in particular, it’s geared toward users who want a “just works” Linux operating system experience.".</p>
<p>Fedora continues it's "<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/#_first" target="_blank">First</a>" foundation to include all the latest software so expect tons of upgrades to everything. For NVIDIA users, be aware that Fedora 36 now defaults to Wayland. Hopefully you won't see too many issues but they seem to think it's stable enough. A curious one though, since NVIDIA <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gdm3/+bug/1969566" target="_blank">requested</a> the folks at Canonical to go back to X11 for Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21341442511652195086gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21341442511652195086gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You'll find with Fedora 36 the likes of Linux Kernel 5.17, Mesa 22.0 drivers and OpenSSL 3.0 and so it should work nicely with the latest hardware.</p>
<p>You can download it from the <a href="https://getfedora.org/" target="_blank">official Fedora website</a>. Their various <a href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">Spins</a> were also updated for those of you who prefer KDE Plasma, Xfce, Cinnamon and more.</p>
<p>If you do plan an upgrade from 35 to 36, ensure you've run all your normal updates first, as some "very important upgrade-related bugs" have been solved.</p>
<p>Sometime over the next week I'll be doing the upgrade, hopefully it will go smoothly. As this will be likely my first full distro version upgrade ever when using Fedora.</p>

      <title>Intel gives an unclear update on when to expect Intel Arc GPU availability</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel are set to fully enter the dedicated GPU game soon with Intel Arc, although we're still in for a bit of a wait. Writing in a fresh <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Products-and-Solutions/Gaming/Engineering-Arc-5-9-2022/post/1383055" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they did their own little Q&amp;A session with Lisa Pearce, Vice President and General Manager for the Visual Compute Group at Intel.</p>
<p>The problem is, they're still not being very clear about the worldwide availability, and this blog post didn't exactly help.</p>
<p>To sum it up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Arc for mobile / laptop so far only has Samsung who started in Korea, and they're "expanding globally". Intel Arc 3 for mobile will be due "ASAP", with Intel Arc 5 and Arc 7 graphics for mobile "in early summer".</li>
<li>For desktops they will start in China for the entry level Intel Arc A-series (A3), this is just for system builders and OEMs in "Q2". Following along "shortly" China will also see retail sales, as Intel say strong demand and how close China is to the supply makes the most sense and then their "next step" is to go global with no date mentioned for the entry level.</li>
<li>Intel Arc A5 and A7 desktop cards will be "later this summer" for OEMs and system integrators worldwide, with "component sales" worldwide some unnamed time after.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intel being about as clear as mud here. Overall though, we should eventually see all the main dedicated Intel Arc series models by the end of Summer / start of Autumn 2022 worldwide by the sounds of it.</p>
<p>Part of the problem are their drivers, which just aren't in a ready state, and this was hinted at with Pearce mentioning "some software readiness delays".</p>
<p>So there you have it, that's the latest on Intel Arc release dates.</p>

KDE Connect has just <a href="https://twitter.com/kdecommunity/status/1523948423552061444" target="_blank">released</a> onto the Apple App Store, opening up more options for those that want it.</p>

      <title>VITURE One XR glasses look fun paired up with a Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Perhaps an answer to "Deck Neck" where your neck starts to hurt staring down at the Steam Deck? I'm certainly curious to give the VITURE One XR glasses a go.</p>
<p>The VITURE One glasses enable you to connect them up to various devices, to act like a 120" virtual screen so you can be completely absorbed into what you're doing. For the Steam Deck specifically, what we're obviously interested in primarily here, the developers said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With the increasing popularity of the Steam Deck, VITURE One will be huge for Steam Deck owners. The best part of Steam Deck is its portability. You can play it anywhere, anytime. But bending over a small screen for lengths of time is uncomfortable. Instead, connect your Steam Deck to VITURE One XR glasses to unlock a 120-inch virtual screen instead!</p>
<p>Together with Steam Deck, VITURE One will be a game changer in the gaming industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you get according to their included specifications is a virtual 120" display at 1080p and 60FPS, with a "PPD (pixels per degree) of 55 - roughly the equivalent of 300-400 PPI on a physical screen(Retina Display)". They include speakers too, providing spatial sound and the glasses will brighten and dim as needed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TJ_5nGFObjY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1687cfc289c662785448899e65700859.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TJ_5nGFObjY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a few extra features and add-on devices, some of which don't work with the Steam Deck. There's a lot more to it though, and a lot of devices supported — even cloud gaming. The nerd in me wants a pair.</p>
<p>You can check out the project on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/viture/viture-game-and-stream-anywhere-anytime" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, and it's already funded with 15 days left.</p>

      <title>Sorted by revenue, the Steam Deck has been the number 1 top seller for 4 weeks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not exactly a big surprise given the price but the Steam Deck has managed to stay at number 1 of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/2022W18/" target="_blank">Steam Weekly Global Top Sellers</a> list.</p>
<p>This is sorted by revenue, not by the amount of units sold. Sadly, we don't know how exactly many units that is since Valve don't actually give out direct numbers like that, so for now this is the best indicator we have of its performance. It has managed to do so for 4 consecutive weeks now too! Not only that, it's been in the top 5 for 9 weeks.</p>
<p>It's such a stark contrast the Steam Machines, which you can read some history on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">in my previous editorial</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously when the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-was-the-steam-top-seller-for-the-week-ending-april-17/" target="_blank">initially jumped to 1st place</a>, it's going up against some multi-million sellers like Elden Ring so all things considered — it's a thoroughly good showing for Valve's newest entry into the hardware market and it continues to be the most important thing in years for Linux Gaming.</p>
<p>Also, today, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the Steam Deck has hit 2,666 games set as Verified or Playable. Some recent Verified titles include: Serial Cleaner, Peaky Blinders: Mastermind, Owlboy, Wave Break and Escape Simulator.</p>

      <title>Vagrus - The Riven Realms, a deep and difficult RPG adds a new companion, keybinds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vagrus - The Riven Realms, an impressive deep and challenging turn-based fantasy RPG has a big post-release update out now, which brings a new companion.</p>
<p>A multi-award winning game, with a strong focus on the narrative (you need to love to read for this one), open-world exploration and lots of strategy elements make up a thoroughly unique experience for fans of RPGs and turn-based combat — along with plenty of trading and decision making. You lead a caravan through a completely ruined world hit by multiple cataclysmic events that's created a dark and strange world.</p>
<p>With the new update out, it adds in a new Companion to the game: the garrulous Undead cook called Vorax, who brings new perks to the table such as his Deputy role Supercargo, as well as his cooking during camping and combat Skills that make him a great support fighter. He comes with his own, expansive Loyalty quest chain, which involves a cooking challenge as well as a less gleeful delve in his dark past.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q6mJQAPYOTg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70011ecf3314b51ed7cc46031a5d3660.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q6mJQAPYOTg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer told me over email this "is the first in a series of downloadable content forthcoming for Vagrus".</p>
<p>Some combat changes came along with this too like "Initiative Track Changes", which they say provide "more immediate agency to the player during combat and to brush things up for increased visual clarity, we’ve adjusted combat design so that changes to Initiative will take effect from the active moment when they occur". Characters who are downed or stunned show up properly too, along with visual changes to show their state.</p>
<p>Many people will also rejoice at this: keybinds are in the game now too, so you can customize what key does what. Additionally there's a number of UI improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/vagrus_the_riven_realms" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/909660/Vagrus__The_Riven_Realms/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley hits 20 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stardew Valley, the peaceful farming life sim from ConcernedApe has hit over 20 million sales two years on from hitting 10 million. While the creator has moved onto the next project, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/haunted-chocolatier-announced-from-stardew-valley-creator/" target="_blank">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, it seems there's no stopping the massive amount of sales on Stardew.</p>
<p>You can see the new figure noted on the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/press/" target="_blank">official press page</a>, which notes the 20 million figure was crossed in March 2022. 13 million of those were sold on PC, with the rest split across the many platforms the game supports.</p>
<p>Looking over previous dates, it seems it's managed to gain 10 million sales in two years at a continuing rate of around 5 million a year. Pretty incredible for an indie game but goes to show that there's plenty of room for games that don't glorify violence in some form.</p>
<p>Fully deserved too of course, it's a wonderful game that's seen plenty of big free content updates over the years.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher for Epic &amp; GOG gets themes, platform selection, favourites</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher continues evolving to provide a way to manage your Epic Games and GOG libraries on Linux and other platforms with a fresh Beta release out now.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.0-beta.2" target="_blank">version 2.3.0 Beta 2</a>, another chance for people test before the next full release. One of the major additions is support for themes, so you can pick from a few built-in and no doubt they will expand it over time. Currently, it's just tweaking the colours. See the default (left) versus Dracula theme (right) — click to enlarge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13911315751652089019gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13911315751652089019gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14870691571652089018gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14870691571652089018gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When installing a game for Linux and macOS, there's now a platform selection option so you can install the Windows version instead if a Native version exists (the choice is yours). You might find a Windows version with Wine to work better than a really old and unmaintained Linux version.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6979892901652089451gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6979892901652089451gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can also favourite a game, you can hide or replace the Recently Played row with Favourites, GOG should work properly on Windows, you can sort installed games by title and installing status and a mixtures of UI fixes and performance improvements.</p>
<p>Steady progress on a brilliant open source app.</p>

      <title>Wave Break from Funktronic Labs gets a major update and Native Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wave Break, originally a timed-exclusive for Stadia that released on Steam in June 2021 just had a big upgrade, which also included a new Native Linux version. Not only that, it's also Steam Deck Verified now too with this Native Linux build.</p>
<p>Never seen it before? Imagine skateboarding — with boats. Inspired by skateboarding classics, you will grind, grab, kickflip and shoot your way through an explosive 80s crime-filled Miami Vice themed world.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MSzjrIDN30g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b77d7820a202e1fa6dec905194b79452.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MSzjrIDN30g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the gameplay changes that came with the update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added new cosmetic items!</li>
<li>Changed the menu text for "Online Lobbies" to "Custom Games" to make it more clear.</li>
<li>Fix for semi transparent Park Creator previews for non stroke items on Vulkan.</li>
<li>Made the first COMBO mission in the game a bit easier to complete on the initial lower stats.</li>
<li>Updated internal Steamworks.NET</li>
<li>The Tutorial now requests that you do some of the steps 3 times, in an effort to help people remember the controls better.</li>
<li>The Tutorial now has an additional step of completing a single 1,000 point combo.</li>
<li>Lowered the Campaign "Next Level" requirement from 60% to 30%.</li>
<li>The initial stats on Big Pin have been upped by 2 or 3 per stat (mostly Grind and Automatic balance).</li>
<li>Rescheduled all events to end at midnight PST instead of UTC.</li>
<li>Events now show the final results the second the event is over, instead of the following day.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see it arrive like this, as last I spoke to the developer they were a bit dismissive of doing a Linux version at all outside of Stadia. Seems the Steam Deck has pushed more developers to do this so they can make it work as best as possible.</p>

      <title>ScummVM adds support for the 1995 shooter Wetlands from Hypnotix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another classic gets a new life thanks to ScummVM, which just recently added support for the 1995 shooter Wetlands.</p>
<p>Work on this and the HYPNO game engine has been ongoing for some time now, with the team mentioning that it's now properly <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20220506/" target="_blank">ready for some public testing</a>.</p>
<p>"This sci-fi rail shooter was created by Hypnotix and published by New World Computing in 1995. The game includes 20 action-packed levels, cinematic cutscenes, attractive hand-drawn characters, and stunning 3D backgrounds.</p>
<p>Set in 2495, humanity is now forced to live in underwater cities after a nuclear test gone wrong caused uninterrupted worldwide rain. A war is unleashed between The Federation (Earth’s remaining governments) and the Volarins, a group of terrorists led by the mad scientist and Wetlands’ main villain, Phillip Nahj. You’ll play as John Cole, a ruthless mercenary hired to catch Nahj alive."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16653173131652087233gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The release with ScummVM supports English, Spanish, French, German, and Korean languages with improvements made to the controls.</p>

      <title>fheroes2 for Heroes of Might and Magic II improves hotkeys, cursors and languages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>fheroes2, a game engine reimplementation for Heroes of Might and Magic II, has another release out further improving the game for various platforms.</p>
<p>Continuing to be the best choice to play this classic, the developers working on it have continued to expand what's possible. Featuring support for the Black and White cursors, they said "Now some players can enjoy the perfection of monochrome graphics". Hotkey support was expanded too with a separate window where you can view them all to make it easier.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3141693381652086626gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3141693381652086626gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14609934571652086628gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14609934571652086628gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The game configuration window was also expanded so you can tune sound effects and music directly, along with other new options. The campaign was upgraded again with pop-up windows for awards and bonuses, so now "every player would know what to expect and how to plan the strategy to win the next scenario". Even more AI improvements came too as the AI can now use the View All spell, the AI will explore more and roam around and AI heroes can now also "properly navigate within narrow paths and they better manage mana consumption".</p>
<p>Main quick highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rework hotkey logic and add an in-game window to read all hotkeys within the game</li>
<li>Improve AI behavior on map: it is able to use View All spell, it manages mana more efficiently and it explores the map more often</li>
<li>Add images and description for every campaign's bonus and award by right clicking on them</li>
<li>Add basic support of Ukrainian language and update French, Russian, Polish and Norwegian translations</li>
<li>Add Black/White cursor support</li>
<li>Expand Text Support Mode and made it as an in-game option</li>
<li>Fix multiple issues in battle logic and spell interaction on map</li>
<li>Over <em><strong>50</strong></em> bugs are fixed since 0.9.14 release</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine 7.8 is out now with X11 and OSS drivers converted to PE</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). A new biweekly development release is out now with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.8" target="_blank">Wine 7.8</a>. It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and enables a ton of games to work on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Here's what they listed as the highlights in Wine 7.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>X11 and OSS drivers converted to PE.</li>
<li>WoW64 support in the sound drivers.</li>
<li>Number formatting using the new locale database.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's sometimes asked: the continued conversion of various modules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> is another change that will gradually increase compatibility in many ways over time for certain expected behaviour needed by Windows applications. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use PE instead.</p>
<p>With this release 37 bugs were listed as solved like issues for: Assassin's Creed IV - Black Flag, Guilty Gear XX #Reload, The Evil Within, Command and Conquer Generals and various other miscellaneous fixes.</p>
<p>If you're looking for help managing Wine, I can happily suggest you go take a look at <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>. Great software that really helps deal with it all.</p>

      <title>Cannibal Crossing seeing plenty of tweaks for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cannibal Crossing, an action-survival game for 1-4 players from development teams at Rocketcat Games (Death Road to Canada) / Everplay Interactive / Blow and Try Again, continues evolving and gets some nice Steam Deck improvements.</p>
<p><em>It's currently in Early Access, with a planned full release on May 26.</em></p>
<p>"Cannibal Crossing is an over the top action-survival game where you must explore a randomly generated town while scavenging, building a base, fighting hordes of deadly foes, and searching for a way to escape! Along the way, you'll encounter bandits, cannibals and beasts (mostly cannibals) – as well as other survivors. Face increasingly large swarms of enemies as you add to and improve your arsenal of weapons."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SaPvvT7H5pk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2a88c60d20f041a8c6087ef4985d0886.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SaPvvT7H5pk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As it's approaching release, the developers have been tweaking lots of the gameplay to make it feel better. One part of these updates has been improvements to controller support to make it work better. For the Steam Deck specifically, they put in work to adjust for the screen size and fix up the UI along with adjustments to tutorials and early game tips to make them better on Steam Deck and other controllers.</p>
<p>Nice to see developers of all sizes working to improve gaming on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304090/Cannibal_Crossing/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Comedy adventure Catie in MeowmeowLand now on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In need of a fresh point and click comedy adventure? Catie in MeowmeowLand from developer ARTillery is now supported on Linux with a new Native build. Must admit I hadn't heard of this one before but the screenshots instantly make it look worth playing.</p>
<p>"Catie in MeowmeowLand is a beautiful traditional point-and-click adventure game set in a bizarre world of cats and ludicrous characters. As Catie follows a strange white cat in her garden she suddenly finds herself in a mysterious world of MeowmeowLand, where she has to undergo a journey to find her way back home. Your task is to help Catie get there!"</p>

<p>Originally released for Windows and macOS in late March, it hasn't seen a lot of players but so far it has managed to get a Positive overall and Very Positive recent user review score on Steam so it seems thoroughly promising.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>MeowmeowLand is a bizarre world where you find the most unexpected characters in even more unpredictable situations</li>
<li>As you help Catie solve all kinds of original puzzles, be ready to face absurdly comical situations</li>
<li>Play through over 24 beautiful 2D hand-drawn sceneries, see more than 100 funny characters and more than 2 hours of charmingly crafted 2D animations</li>
<li>Listen to original recorded comical voices of all characters and composed music</li>
<li>Instead of reading traditional dull text boxes all characters communicate through comic bubbles filled with amusing line art</li>
</ul>

      <title>Controller support for Path of Exile leaving Beta, should work great on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/Path_of_Exile/" target="_blank">Path of Exile</a>, the free to play ARPG from Grinding Gear Games, is getting close to releasing the Sentinel update and along with masses of gameplay additions — controller support will leave Beta.</p>
<p>With controller / gamepad support all hooked up fully, this should give a much better experience for players on the Steam Deck. Main controller changes include (<a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3264788" target="_blank">full patch notes</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Controller Support for Path of Exile is no longer in Beta.</li>
<li>Added support for DualShock 4 Controllers.</li>
<li>Added PvP Support for controllers.</li>
<li>It is now possible to manually select a controller to use under the Input Options if there are multiple controllers connected.</li>
<li>It is now possible to navigate to and select Private Leagues and Events in the Character Selection Menu with a controller.</li>
<li>It is now possible to navigate and interact with the chat window when using a controller.</li>
<li>Attempting to load an Item Filter when using a controller will now output success or failure messages to the chat window.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update is due to launch on May 13, 2022 and I'll be sure to take a look at how it runs on both the Steam Deck and desktop Linux around the time.</p>

      <title>An interview with Aaron Honeycutt from System76</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's time for a fresh interview. Today I have Aaron Honeycutt from <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a>, makers of Linux distribution Pop!_OS and various hardware, who talked a little about their work.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Could you please introduce yourself and what you do?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron:</strong> Heyo! I’m Aaron and I work at System76 as a Happiness Architect.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: How did you get started with Linux? What attracted you to it?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I started around Ubuntu 10.04 LTS or so and I wanted to try something different from Windows (or macOS since I couldn’t afford the hardware). In the early days I was dual booting like most folks and this helped when I broke something in Windows and I fixed it from Ubuntu which was amazing to me at the time!</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What does being a ‘Happiness Architect’ actually involve? How the heck do you land a cool job title like that?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>A Happiness Architect is pretty much Tier 2 for our support though currently I’m the only one with the title. I work in our support system, Slack, Discord and social media to help folks get up and running or fix issues.</p>
<p>I pretty much created the title as we don’t actually have a Tier system in support but since I’ve been here the longest other than Emma of course I wanted a title that fit my experience and the internal/external joke of the fact that I run Arch.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s it really like to work for System76? What’s your work setup like?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>It’s pretty fantastic! I work in the warehouse as the only support person there as we are all remote (in other parts of the country as well). We also have a few office doggos from time to time though my dog Onyxia is in the office every day.</p>
<p>I’m the main point of contact for when something is shipped in or needs to be shipped out. I can also test something for customers using QA systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13215513841651662971gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13215513841651662971gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: System76 is a hardware vendor as well as a software vendor with desktops, a mini-PC, laptops, servers — and now a keyboard too (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">my review here</a>). Why a keyboard?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>The keyboard felt like the next step as it gives you even more control of your hardware and shapes your experience with your OS. You can also configure the keyboard on either Windows, macOS or Linux depending on what you use to unleash your potential.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Since you’re a Linux vendor, do you ever see much interest from the Windows crowd?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>While in support I do see quite a few people need to use Windows on our hardware usually for some software/hardware that they need. A lot of them apologize that they are even loading Windows on our hardware which is not needed!</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: I’ve seen the CEO, Carl Richell, share some quick videos of your hardware production on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/carlrichell/status/1519427569854132238" target="_blank">example</a>) and it’s kind of mesmerizing. Do you ever find yourself sneaking off to watch it all?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>Since my partner works in Production I often find myself out in the factory either watching them finish the coat on a Thelio veneer before it is put on the side of the chassis, watching a 3D printer run a bit or someone making a bottle opener with our rocket logo on it.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Why should someone pick Pop!_OS over something like Ubuntu or Fedora or even Arch?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>Pop!_OS includes a lot of the packages/software that folks add/enable during or after the installation of the OS. For example having flatpak/flathub installed and configured out of the box saves you a reboot and allows you to install your favorite packages out of the gate.</p>
<p>I myself install Slack, Mattermost, Discord and a few others this way. One of my favorites is Pop Shell which enables titling of windows which I use every single day.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Any plans to bring the Pop experience to other desktop environments (and other distributions?), or will you be sticking with GNOME?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>We have been actively encouraging other distros add features like Pop Shell and provide documentation for building our software such as this support article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-shell" target="_blank">https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-shell</a></p>
<p>We are also working on making sure that the COSMIC DE (not based on GNOME) will be easy to port to other distro so that everyone can enjoy it and help improve it as it evolves.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Back in 2020, System76’s Principal Engineer Jeremy Soller put a poll on <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremy_soller/status/1417464682164547586" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to see interest in a rolling release of Pop!_OS. Are there any plans for it to happen, what are your thoughts on it?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>Pop!_OS is currently a semi-rolling/half-rolling release. We push out newer versions of core packages that improve gaming like Mesa, the kernel, Steam, Lutris and many others.</p>
<p>While we don't plan to change our approach yet, we are considering options to offer an always fresh archive to our users.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Linux packaging is a little, dare I say it, messy right now. You have deb, rpm, AppImage, Snap, Flatpak and more. What are your thoughts on this, what do you prefer?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I personally prefer flatpaks no matter what distro I am using and I even use it on my Arch install. One of the neat things is that if you install them with the –user option they are installed in ~/.local which means backup programs like Deja Dup will back them up and they will be installed when you restore from that backup.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: A little while ago, a certain big YouTuber (hi <a href="https://youtu.be/0506yDSgU7M?t=637" target="_blank">Linus</a>) destroyed their install of Pop!_OS. What was it like to see such breakage be done so publicly, what have you learned from this?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I think this has reinforced the direction that OSTree (Immutable file systems) are going and certainly proves that Steam is right going that direction for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Anything in Pop-land that you’re particularly excited about right now?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I’m very excited to see the COSMIC DE come out and how folks will use it! I think it will strike a balance between awesome and useful features and control of your desktop as you want it.</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s your personal opinion on what Linux really needs to get more user share on the desktop? What are the roadblocks here?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>Introducing them to the OS is certainly difficult and having more hardware with it pre-installed certainly helps which is why I’m always happy to see more and more companies offer it.</p>
<p>When I introduced my partner to Pop!_OS it was because Windows just would not update and I tried fixing it but failed. Their main concern was if they could play WoW as that is what they used the laptop for mainly.</p>
<p>I showed them that they could pretty easily then backed up their files. They have been happy ever since! We built a custom desktop for them and I loaded Windows on another drive just in case for some games but they haven’t even booted into Windows for months since they can do everything they need in Pop!_OS most often without even asking me!</p>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Can you tell us your top 5 favourite games right now?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>That’s pretty tough!</p>
<ol>
<li>DOOM Eternal</li>
<li>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</li>
<li>Halo MCC</li>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West (PS5)</li>
<li>Warframe</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>GOL</strong>: What’s your own personal computing setup like?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>I have a custom desktop at home that I use for pretty much everything. It’s most likely overkill for what I need but it’s always nice to have that power when it is needed. All of my coworkers say I need a new GPU but they are aware of the current prices!</p>
<p>I have more spec info here:</p>

<p><strong>GOL</strong>: Will you be buying a Steam Deck? What is your opinion of it at the moment?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron: </strong>My partner and I both ordered ours on the same day a few weeks ago (512GB models). I think it will affect so many parts of gaming outside of just Linux Gaming and I think we’ll see more studios work towards having their game work with Proton. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Big thank you to Aaron for joining me on this.</p>

      <title>Fortnite added to Xbox Cloud Gaming, easier than ever to play on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft has today announced that the massive free to play game Fortnite is now on Xbox Cloud Gaming, this makes it easier than ever to play it on Linux and Steam Deck. Of course, you first need to be registered with a Live / Xbox account but there's <u>no</u> subscription required to play this and overall it actually works far better than using GeForce NOW to stream it.</p>
<p>Tested working across both Chrome and Edge, at least until some day in the far future when Epic decide to get Fortnite running on Linux properly, this is likely the best way to do it.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck specifically:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure Chrome is installed (available via the Non-Steam menu in the Steam Library), or via Discover in Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>In Desktop Mode enter this into the Konsole terminal app: <code class="inline-code">flatpak --user override --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.google.Chrome</code><br/>
	This enables the Deck Gamepad controller to work.</li>
<li>If you wish to auto-launch Xbox Cloud Gaming with Chrome, add this to the very end of the launch options (right click -&gt; properties on Chrome in Steam): <code class="inline-code">--window-size=1024,640 --force-device-scale-factor=1.25 --device-scale-factor=1.25 --kiosk "https://xbox.com/play"</code></li>
<li>Go back to the main Gaming Mode on Steam Deck, tap Chrome in your Steam Library and set Steam Input (the Gamepad icon on the right) into Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad.</li>
<li>Launch Chrome, and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a quick video of it in action:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1Q09qFclV1Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4320fa64c372cc6668d86a97f1219012.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1Q09qFclV1Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I also tested it working on my main Fedora Linux desktop and it works just fine in Chrome and Edge, although the resolution wasn't great on my 1080p monitor. On the Steam Deck, it looks just fine with the resolution.</p>
<p>This was possible with GeForce NOW (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/chrome-on-steam-deck-now-supports-the-deck-controller-with-geforce-now-working/" target="_blank">as shown by me before</a>), but the experience is a lot more fluid and there's less hassle with launcher logins and Fortnite seems to perform a lot better this way too.</p>

      <title>Owners of Dying Light get upgraded to the Enhanced Edition, final patch out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you own the base game of Dying Light? Good news for you, as Techland are bumping everyone up to the full Enhanced Edition which includes The Following expansion. Plus a final patch is out now.</p>
<p>This means all owners of the game (on Steam at least) will get The Following expansion, Bozak Horde, Cuisine and Cargo, Ultimate Survivor bundle and the Crash Test skin bundle! You have to hand it to Techland here, not only have they supported the original Dying Light for many years but bumping everyone up when the sequel is out is pretty fantastic.</p>
<p>A rather big patch also just landed which includes a bunch of changes and additions for the Hellraid DLC including a new weapon, a reworked armory, new consumables, new bounties and other minor additions. Overall, they claim it's much more satisfying to play though.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zjJTzW2TOCM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5294b0e95aac47d601e3b7b15b084171.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zjJTzW2TOCM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that the latest patch adds new tutorials for various parts of the game, new blueprints to craft, an overhaul to the Be The Zombie PvP mode, a bunch of bug fixes and the list goes on across two patch notes (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/239140/view/3182366126814239387" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/239140/view/3182366778716117091" target="_blank">#2</a>).</p>
<p>There's also a new event with the crazy engineer twins, Tolga and Fatin, having two new bounties available that are local for you and global for everyone with a new blueprint and 3 King Mods as rewards.</p>

<p>Dying Light is now 60% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/239140/Dying_Light/" target="_blank">Steam</a> until the 12th of May.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Space Bandit, a shoot &#39;em up roguelite with &#39;annoyingly clever AI&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love a twin-stick shooter? How about one that features apparently clever AI? Check out Space Bandit, which has a demo available right now.</p>
<p>On the surface, it looks like any other indie roguelite shooter with simple controls, pixel graphics and some procedural generation to keep things interesting for multiple runs. Where it gets interesting though is the AI. The developer said that the AI will "always work together to flank you, they'll call out your position to each other, they'll revive each other and generally make you suffer". After playing a few minutes of it, I can confirm it's a little challenging and actually thoroughly entertaining.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SAGoT4uHnsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f89f348ca06b8fcf2153b60ebcbe19e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SAGoT4uHnsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the action is intense and the weapons are fun to use, the environment is also your weapon. You're in space, and so if you run out of bullets you might get a chance to smash a window and vent all your enemies out into space. I'm quite a fan of the teleport system too, that allows you when it's ready to teleport through enemies to another spot and watch them explode as you do it — glorious.</p>
<p>This is one to watch, do give the demo a try.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435470/Space_Bandit/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out an hour of cancelled Half-Life game Ravenholm</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ravenholm, one of the names that Arkane gave to their Half-Life game, was previously shown off <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/half-life-was-going-to-get-a-ravenholm-spin-off/" target="_blank">back in 2020</a> and now we have a lot more footage of it. Sadly it never and will never see gamers get their hands on it properly but at least now we can see what might have been.</p>
<p>This kind of thing coming out with Valve's approval is pretty rare, as Valve has historically not been overly communicative with the community, especially on the future of their games so this is quite special. To note, this is not a possible Half-Life 2: Episode 3, but an entirely different game with a new character.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can watch it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xMygnmB9Zw8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78df0cf2f574ebc4f369241176cda01f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xMygnmB9Zw8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I continue longing for more Half-Life in my life. After playing through Half-Life: Alyx, which was incredible, it's a shame that Valve don't make a lot of games now. Even Erik Wolpaw <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/erik-wolpaw-to-valve-on-portal-3-we-should-just-do-it/" target="_blank">recently said</a> Valve should just make Portal 3 already. Previously, Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/valve-have-multiple-games-in-development-they-will-announce-says-gabe-newell/" target="_blank">Gabe Newell did mention</a> they had more games on the way and this was <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/03/01/valve-steam-deck-interview" target="_blank">repeated by designer Greg Coomer</a> recently too. So who knows, maybe late this year we might see another? One can hope.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits 2,500 games Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big milestone has been hit for the Steam Deck from Valve. There's now at least 2,500 games that have been through Deck Verified to be classed as either fully Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>That's another 500 or so <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/2000-titles-officially-hit-for-steam-deck-as-verified-or-playable/" target="_blank">since early April</a>, when they hit 2,000 showing good progress on getting more games through the system. Still, a long way to go before the full Steam Library is checked with tens of thousands and more releasing every day.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the latest numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1321 - Verified</li>
<li>1179 - Playable</li>
<li>1179 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>One important bit to remember is that a game that hasn't been through Deck Verified yet, doesn't mean it won't work. You can try to play <em>anything</em>, and realistically the number that <em>does</em> work will be a lot <em>higher</em> than the official number. There's also a few noted as Unsupported, which actually do work. There's also a few problems with certain Verified and Playable games which may not work right, which Valve continue to work on improving their verification for.</p>
<p>Some of the latest to be Verified or Playable include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Persona 4 Golden - Verified (although it was already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6doaQNnHR60" target="_blank">playable with GE-Proton</a>)</li>
<li>Aliens versus Predator Classic 2000 - Playable</li>
<li>Beat Invaders - Verified</li>
<li>Children of Morta - Verified</li>
<li>Gone Home - Verified</li>
<li>Loot River - Verified</li>
<li>RUINER - Verified</li>
</ul>

      <title>The deb-get tool helps Ubuntu (and derivative distro) fans grab extra apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there's plenty of software available out of the box for Ubuntu (and all the derivatives), some developers only provide .deb downloads from their websites - that's where <a href="https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get" target="_blank">deb-get</a> comes in.</p>
<p>The idea is that it sources various extra applications for you, giving apt-get like functionality for 3rd party repositories or via direct download. Sounds pretty neat! A nice time-saving tool developed by Martin Wimpress, lead on Ubuntu MATE. It could help when you're getting setup initially, or just looking for something that isn't available from Ubuntu directly or Ubuntu perhaps has an older version than what you want to install.</p>
<p>Wimpress said the idea is directly inspired by Software Boutique, a tool used on Ubuntu MATE that does very much the same thing with a curated selection.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of software already supported so go give it a whirl and see what you think.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Free and popular precision-platformer &#39;Janosik&#39; gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love some retro action-platformer to fill your time? Janosik quite a popular one, likely because it's free, and it just got a big upgrade.</p>
<p>"Janosik's companions were captured by the evil Count Von Zur and it’s up to you to find and rescue them from the prison. Explore hand-drawn pixel art world, find secrets, jump over deadly obstacles, roll and attack enemies, collect gold coins and find upgrades. Janosik gives you about 2 hours of single-player retro platforming fun."</p>
<p>The developer is currently working on a full sequel, and they decided to come back and improve the original. It moves to the latest Construct game engine along with adding in a map, travel corridors to connect up parts of the game, a new NPC that sells sword upgrades, lots of levels were re-designed, various new enemies, lava, new levels, new boss mechanics and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13201555191651678174gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13201555191651678174gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Sounds like a rather great upgrade for a free game.</p>

      <title>Linux gaming overlay MangoHud has a new release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> is something that Valve use on the Steam Deck, specifically for the performance HUD that shows various details like FPS, frame timing, temperatures and more. It just had a new release with plenty of changes.</p>
<p>It's not only for the Steam Deck of course, as it works just fine on Linux desktops and was available long before the Deck was a thing. MangoHud version 0.6.7 has these main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Show highest cpu freq instead of the cumulative average</li>
<li>Using sysfs scaling_cur_freq instead of /proc/cpuinfo for cpu core frequencies</li>
<li>Added EADesktop.exe and EALauncher.exe to blacklist</li>
<li>Logger writes a summary by default</li>
<li>Using gpu_metrics sysfs binary for amdgpu metrics</li>
<li>Showing min and max frametime for the period</li>
<li>Battery param shows a plug icon when plugged in</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to the items added to a blacklist, this is done for applications where it's not required and because it can stop certain games loading properly when used on their launchers and other loaders. Nice to see the plug icon made its way into a main release too, since that was already in the build used by the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A few fixes came along like fixing Splitgate crashing on AMD GPUs, fixed it not reporting AMD CPU power when using the zenpower module, fixed a regression in the hardware info updater and a bug was solved where setting CPU cores to offline would crash mangohud/mangoapp.</p>
<p>Some new Parameters have also been added which are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_only</code> - Allows you to only display FPS (requires legacy_layout=0)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gamepad_battery</code> - Shows battery and connection status for supported gamepads</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gamepad_battery_icon</code> - Replaces the percent amount with a battery icon</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">frame_count</code> - Shows the number of frames since start</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">throttling_status</code> - Shows if GPU is throttling based on Power, current, temp or "other" (Only shows if throttling is currently happening)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>HoloISO brings Valve&#39;s SteamOS 3 from the Steam Deck to everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has yet to actually release a proper iso for SteamOS 3 used on the Steam Deck, others have been taking it into their own hands to provide, like with the new <a href="https://github.com/bhaiest/holoiso" target="_blank">HoloISO</a>.</p>
<p>This is possible, since 99% of what SteamOS uses is open source (not the Steam client though) and so people can easily hack away at it to do whatever they want. It's not <em>exactly</em> the same as SteamOS 3 but it's probably the <em>closest</em> I've seen yet, with the main packages coming direct from Valve with "zero possible edits" the developer says.</p>
<p>HoloISO works with quite a lot already including the first-boot experience for the Steam Deck, the main Deck UI, the KDE Plasma Desktop Mode (including Valve's Vapor theme), Global FSR, frame limiting and more. Some issues exist though, like it not really working on NVIDIA GPUs and Intel needs some package downgrades. For AMD though, it's looking golden.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2656044751651657913gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2656044751651657913gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10415617941651657911gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10415617941651657911gol1.png"/></a><em>Pictures credit - the HoloISO team.</em></p>
<p>Still wouldn't exactly recommend it for full desktop use, best to really wait until Valve release it properly or at least leave it until HoloISO has had time to mature more.</p>

      <title>Media center and entertainment hub Kodi adds Steam Deck controls support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://kodi.tv/" target="_blank">Kodi</a> (originally XBMC), is a free and open source media center and entertainment hub, and the latest release up on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/tv.kodi.Kodi" target="_blank">Flathub</a> adds in support for the Steam Deck controller.</p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck is a portable you might want to bring your various media with you from Music to Movies — it supports a huge amount. Also manage Photos, Games, TV Shows and more. The plugin system is great too, there's lots you can add into it. The idea is to give you a good looking way to manage and view it all.</p>
<p>Giving it a short test today, it seems to work just fine in Desktop Mode as it does in Gaming Mode when you add it to Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16050968721651656570gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16050968721651656570gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To install it on a Steam Deck, simply load up Discover and search for it. Nice and simple. You can see various guides on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube</a>.</p>

      <title>Star Labs add an AMD Ryzen option to the StarBook Mk V</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a fancy new laptop with great Linux support? Check out the <a href="https://starlabs.systems/pages/starbook" target="_blank">StarBook Mk V</a>, which just added an AMD Ryzen option.</p>
<p>Originally revealed in 2021, it's quite a tidy little unit the starts at £778, although as neither the Intel or AMD models are available until later this month (Intel) and late June (AMD) you get a 5% discount if you order now. The AMD model is also only available with either English (US) or English (UK) keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>So now you get a choice between Intel Core i3-1115G4, Intel® Core® i7-1165G7 or an AMD Ryzen™ 7 5800U 1.90GHz with all models configurable from 8GB RAM up to 64GB 3200MHz. Storage options are different though, while all can have an SSD from 240GB to 1920GB, the Intel models have the extra ability to be configured with "Gen4" SSDs that the AMD model does not. Additionally, the Intel model has a Thunderbolt 4 port while the AMD model has USB-C 3.2 Gen2 port instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4431802431651655532gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4431802431651655532gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the display you get a 14 inch LED-backlit matte covering with IPS at 1920 x 1080. For power, they claim "up to" 11 hours battery life. You get a 65-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery, with a 65w USB-C Power Adapter.</p>
<p>You can select between various operating systems too including Ubuntu, elementary OS, Kubuntu, Linux Mint, Manjaro and more. Windows is an option too but adds to the cost.</p>

      <title>PowerTools is a Steam Deck Plugin for power users</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to tweak more on your Steam Deck? You need some PowerTools. A new plugin for the Steam Deck Plugin Loader.</p>
<p>I was hoping to see something like this come along, but fair warning on this — anything you use like PowerTools is at your own risk, so if you screw up your device Valve likely won't help you out. I say this, because there's quite a few advanced tricks it can do and for most normal users, it won't really be needed.</p>
<p>Anyway, some of what PowerTools includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable and Disable CPU threads</li>
<li>Enable &amp; Disable CPU boost</li>
<li>Set CPU frequency</li>
<li>Set GPU Power</li>
<li>Set Fan speed</li>
<li>Probably more I missed</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410040281651592662gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410040281651592662gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>How can someone create this? Pretty simple if you know a bit of programming and where to look, since the Steam Deck uses Linux (SteamOS) and so the majority of it is open source (apart from the Steam client).</p>
<p>One of the way I know some of this will be useful is for emulation especially. Some old games and systems can act a little funny with the immense (relatively speaking) power and core count compared with what old games are expecting. Just one small example.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/NGnius/PowerTools" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Beautiful looking puzzle-adventure Sonority releases May 25</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hanging Gardens Interactive and Application Systems Heidelberg have announced their lush looking puzzle adventure Sonority will release on May 25. That includes Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>They claim it's quite "innovative", and it was one of the winners in the "Best Prototype" at the German Computer Game Awards 2020. With a hand-designed world and areas filled with some pretty beautiful landscapes, it definitely pulls in your attention. From their email they mentioned how "players will discover an unusual puzzle mechanic in which obstacles must be moved by arranging sequences of sounds" and that the "mechanics slowly become more complex and surprise the player again and again with new variations on the theme".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="efu8HLs9-fo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9299f29b9f8246c83ace8423afe15890.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/efu8HLs9-fo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interesting new puzzle mechanic based on melodies. (Simple note sequences develop into small melodies and then into complex pieces of music.)</li>
<li>A touching story about Esther and an old, oddball raccoon and his singing stone friends.</li>
<li>A lovingly designed, cohesive 3D game world with varied locations.</li>
<li>Atmospheric, extensive soundtrack with English and German versions of original songs.</li>
<li>Play with keyboard or controller.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The publisher sent along a review key, so hopefully I'll be taking a look.</em></p>

      <title>Peglin turns Peggle into a Slay the Spire styled roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It may be a little rough around the edges since it's brand new and in Early Access but Peglin might be another game I end up sinking 100s of hours into.</p>
<p>Peglin is basically what you get if you combine Peggle, where you shoot something to bounce it into little orbs, with the dungeon crawling and events style popularised by Slay the Spire. Released into Early Access in late April, it's working great on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>The idea is that you battle varies enemies, by loading up a little cannon below and firing it into all the tiles and pegs. Each representing another damage point, and how much you do depends on not just how many you hit, but what you're shooting and if you manage to land a hit on a bomb peg, or a critical hit peg and things like that. What you get is another game that's gloriously simple, easy to pick up and play but it will sucker you right in. Gives off that constant feeling of needing just one more run.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hoSRP-w-5K0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c1742d6164e367849c0fd40faefc4e62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hoSRP-w-5K0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: the developer has no plans right now for Native Linux support, citing some major <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1296610/discussions/0/3042732979949928058/#c3276941086757382921" target="_blank">problems</a> while Proton works pretty much perfectly. Seems they had it mostly working on Ubuntu, but Steam Deck gave them big headaches.</em></p>
<p>Apart from a few gamepad issues, which seem to be present on Windows too, it's a great experience.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collect and upgrade powerful orbs and relics</strong> to defeat the monsters and bosses that stand in your way.</li>
<li><strong>Fight enemies with Pachinko-like gameplay</strong> - hit more pegs to do more damage. Use crit potions, refresh potions, and bombs wisely.</li>
<li><strong>Explore a new forest every time</strong>, with different orbs, enemies, and surprises along the way.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During Early Access they plan to add in more content including meta-progression, customised runs, a difficulty ladder to progress through and much more. As it is right now, it's good but once you've played a few hours you see the current limitations but it has an absolutely brilliant foundation to keep building on. I can only imagine the crazy combinations they're going to add it.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296610/Peglin/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Lovecraft&#39;s Untold Stories 2 releases with Linux support on May 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 is an action RPG with rogue-like elements, a sequel to the hit from 2019 and it releases on May 17, 2022. While the first one is not supported on Linux, it should work nicely with Proton or Wine and it doesn't actually require you to know the first game the developer said. The publisher mentioned very clearly in their email today that Linux, macOS and Windows are supported for this one.</p>
<p>"Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 continues the narrative of the cult classic first game, but this time players will continue the fight against the unknown with new elements like crafting - using blueprints and resources to create consumables and even new equipment. Reunite with old acquaintances and meet new characters, explore new procedurally generated locations, defend yourself against dozens of different enemies and face off against epic bosses. But beware… Lovecraft’s Untold Stories 2 is more challenging than ever before, and the tough nightmarish creatures opposing you will not give up easily!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Vm6gAohpRkA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e540ee4dbaa94066ce2dffbc18a2920c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Vm6gAohpRkA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fight dozens of different enemies, monsters and terrifying bosses from the Cthulhu Mythos</strong> in this intense, challenging action RPG. Ferocious beasts in the Swamps, Asylum lunatics, City thugs and the demonic creatures from the void will test your resolve to uncover the truth!</li>
<li><strong>Meet the 6 playable characters</strong> <strong>-</strong> 3 familiar faces from the series and 3 complete newcomers - each with their own weapons, gear and skills. Switch between them freely and pick the one most suited for the task at hand!</li>
<li><strong>Collect hundreds of different weapons and clothing items, or craft your own -</strong> scour every last room in a level, open every single box and get rewarded with randomized drops of gear, money for trading or resources and blueprints for crafting.</li>
<li><strong>Side quests are crucial -</strong> you can earn extra resources and items and get that extra bit of advantage you may need to be able to progress in the main story. Don’t forget to trigger side quests every time you encounter them, you don’t have to finish them right away, but keep them for when you need extra loot!</li>
<li><strong>Exploit the roguelike elements -</strong> level maps are randomly generated, as are all loot drops. The game is not pure roguelike: if you die or choose to restart the level, you only lose progress in the current area. Use this to your advantage, and if you don’t get the loot you wanted; try again!</li>
<li><strong>Make use of Charms and Amulets!</strong> Sacred relics which grant strange new abilities. Find those that serve you the best and make your journey unique - but beware, power may come at a cost!</li>
<li><strong>Plunge into the world of darkness where every step could be your last</strong>. Balance on the brink of madness as you explore the Asylum and various other locales in the city of Arkham, Swamps, Enchanted Forest, even the Underworld and many more mind-bending locations, all in procedurally generated levels!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wine manager Bottles gets a UI refresh, developers now GNOME Foundation Members</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of news and excitement happening for <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>, the free and open source application designed to help you manage various programs and games on Linux that need Wine.</p>
<p>First, quite a fun one, the developers of Bottles are now part of the <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/" target="_blank">GNOME Foundation</a>. What does that mean exactly? Well "Members can run for election to the Board of Directors, vote in the elections for the Board of Directors, and suggest referenda. The membership process is overseen by the Membership and Elections Committee" (<a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p>
<p>Bottles is also going through the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Circle/-/issues/61" target="_blank">approvals</a> process to become a <a href="https://circle.gnome.org/" target="_blank">GNOME Circles</a> app, which is pretty much a way of saying it's not a direct GNOME app but has their blessing and gives Bottles a few extra benefits like developer support, advertising and so on.</p>
<p>During the Linux App Summit 2022, two of the developers also did a presentation on Bottles:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HxM15UOVmyA?rel=0&amp;start=9353"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7034da4bc88d5e59f6cd0f6ec0bdae13.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HxM15UOVmyA?rel=0&amp;start=9353" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Two updates (<a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release.2022.5.2/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release.2022.4.28/" target="_blank">#2</a>) were also just released, with a lot of the latest release largely cleaning up the UI to conform to what is needed to be accepted into GNOME Circle. Plenty of it is just being more consistent, adjusting a few parts to be more clear to users with an improved startup / new user experience and more explanations of what to do.</p>
<p>Other features that were added / improved include: custom paths for storing Bottles, updates to the template system, performance improvements, a new Journal system to read through logs and plenty of bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Space Invaders fused with awesome music, Beat Invaders gets a huge 2.0 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite possibly one of my absolute favourite games released in 2022, Beat Invaders is a marvellous fusion of the classic Space Invaders with slick beats and neon lighting. Version 2.0 is out now adding in a lot and overhauling even more.</p>
<p>"Beat Invaders is a space-themed action roguelite shoot-em-up with a musical twist! A convoy of space freighters needs to ship their cargo - the hottest music tracks in town - to the beat-hungry interstellar clubs scattered across the galaxy.  However, their path is blocked by swarms of music-hating hordes!  Protect those freighters and their precious cargo at all costs, and help the universe to dance the night away once more!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16628830311651574580gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16628830311651574580gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in version 2.0 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 new music tracks</li>
<li>Waves 1-40 are now split into sectors with unique themes</li>
<li>Daily and Weekly Challenges</li>
<li>A new boss battle</li>

      <title>Escape Simulator hits 1 million sales, adds voice chat and new map</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape Simulator has been a huge success now for Pine Studio, with 1 million sales in around 7 months and a fresh major update is out now.</p>
<p>To celebrate, they've added a new official puzzle room that pays tribute to their earlier game called Cats in Time. In this new room you will need to repair a time machine. They say to prepare for some "strange issues" that may happen and the clock is ticking, you only have thirty minutes to solve it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dze1DmQFDg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1d66d5868c9074e758e44dee3983fa23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dze1DmQFDg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They also added in Voice Chat, which thankfully does not use Vivox since they still don't support Linux. Instead, the developer went with Steam Voice so there should be no problems with cross-platform voice here.</p>
<p>More upgrades were done too with texture compression in custom rooms, with users able to adjust it and the main menu should use less RAM. On top of that, the Room Editor had plenty of updates and tweaks too like multi-selection for everything, more tooltips, better collisions, UI tweaks and more.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435790/Escape_Simulator/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a small update to add more keyboard layouts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to improve the typing experience with the Steam Deck on-screen keyboard, Valve has released a new Steam Deck Client <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3216143124019700248" target="_blank">update</a> with additions. This comes shortly after adding in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-gets-a-lock-screen-window-switcher-and-more/" target="_blank">support for other languages</a> too.</p>
<p>There's now the option to use English Dvorak and Colemak keyboard layouts, if you prefer them. To change them, go into the Settings menu (press the Steam button) and then down to Keyboard and tap where it says Edit next to Active Keyboards.</p>
<p>Here's how they look:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3026522031651571823gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3026522031651571823gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8593247961651571824gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8593247961651571824gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Additionally a miscellaneous crash was fixed that snuck its way into the previous update.</p>

      <title>Linux user share on Steam hits second highest percentage in years</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have put out their usual monthly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey?platform=combined" target="_blank">Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> and it's looking pretty great for Linux overall. April 2022 showed a big boost to Linux gamers. After a few months of dipping down, it seems to have rocketed back up to be at the second-highest point it's been in years with 1.14%.</p>
<p>You can see how it has changed over the last few years on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>, with the current posted below. The previous peak being November 2021 at 1.16%, the previous second highest being October 2021 at 1.13%.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12538162671651568072gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12538162671651568072gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Going by the main combined numbers from Steam, these are the current most popular Linux distributions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 0.16% +0.03%</li>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 0.14% +0.02%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 0.13% +0.01%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 0.07% 0.00%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 21.10 64 bit 0.06% -0.01%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Steam Deck now shipping that uses SteamOS 3 Linux, it's perhaps not a big surprise to see a lot more interest in Linux Gaming overall now. Currently though, the Steam Survey is not included on the Steam Deck in Gaming Mode and only in Desktop Mode with the main Steam Client loaded so these numbers probably don't represent many Steam Deck users at all.</p>
<p>Thanks though to Proton and the Steam Deck, perhaps this is the start of a small shift over to Linux — one can hope but too early to tell anything really.</p>

      <title>Going Rogue: A Festival of Persistence event is live on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/going_rogue" target="_blank">Going Rogue: A Festival of Persistence</a> is a new week-long event on Steam, celebrating how diverse and confusing the whole roguelike thing is.</p>
<p>This includes Roguelikes, Roguelites, and everything in between — so technically it covers a huge amount of games as many like to claim they're some form of roguelike. Valve even jokingly said in their press email how there's "no need to argue this on the internet with strangers" as they outline it all in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3175610095143798950" target="_blank">blog post</a>. It's interesting enough, and does highlight the problems with defining game genres properly, with different interpretations and how they should be used.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3POUi1Imy0k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/102ed2eb8e01bfd81f3e4a0ed71c8b6a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3POUi1Imy0k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm liking this more natural feeling I get from Valve, they seem way more playful over the last couple of years, as you can see in the video above.</p>
<p>Valve also teamed up with a few content creators for a rather long video on it all:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YbsM8JtRKHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/57d35155b7055011a6a4b6e6a488b183.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YbsM8JtRKHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The event runs until May 9.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group to acquire Eidos, Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix Montréal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another huge acquisition for the games industry today as Embracer Group <a href="https://embracer.com/release/embracer-group-enters-into-an-agreement-to-acquire-eidos-crystal-dynamics-and-square-enix-montreal-amongst-other-assets/" target="_blank">have agreed</a> to purchase Eidos, Crystal Dynamics, and Square Enix Montréal amongst others.</p>
<p>This is honestly massive it means they now control the likes of Tomb Raider, Thief, Deus Ex, Legacy of Kain and "more than 50 back-catalogue games" from Square Enix. With this deal they add another ~1,000 employees to their list around the world for 300 million USD.</p>
<p>Of course, this is all pending the usual approvals process from regulators. It's not quite a done deal but it will likely go through just fine like their previous acquisitions have.</p>
<p>Embracer Group are truly huge now controlling and owning various publishers and developers directly including the likes of Coffee Stain, Gearbox, Ghost Ship Games, Deep Silver, Flying Wild Hog, Warhorse Studios, Koch Media, Asmodee, Saber Interactive, Aspyr Media, THQ Nordic and the list just keeps on going.</p>

      <title>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed gets a huge character overhaul and lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed came to Linux recently as a Native title and it is Steam Deck Verified but it wasn't without issues, which Digital Cybercherries have now fixed up. The latest update isn't just bug fixing though, it also overhauls and adds in quite a lot of the game too.</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes a Character Packaging system, so like a real toy each character has their own package which you can also customize. There's new and unique action sounds for each character, unique voice acting for each character, an improved invite system for online play, platform specific player icons, cross-platform saves and lots of other improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eZSklqh9YXs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/664a6c69d4fca48db7467f2238e049cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eZSklqh9YXs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Linux players, the invite code system didn't actually work as you couldn't paste the code. I let them know, and it should be fixed in this release.</p>

      <title>Relaxing and gorgeous city-builder Dorfromantik is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dorfromantik is a masterful blending of genres to create something you don't often see. Bringing together elements of tile matching with a city-builder, it sure is a peaceful way to game. <u>Note</u>: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>Played on Linux with Proton (and it works well on the Steam Deck too), this might actually be my new favourite way to unwind. No issues discovered at all, a true out of the box experience on Linux. Developed by Toukana Interactive, it has similar basic mechanics to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/colourful-city-builder-islanders-has-officially-released-for-linux-and-its-really-lovely/" target="_blank">Islanders</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/home-wind-is-a-free-minimalist-relaxing-and-cozy-city-builder/" target="_blank">Home Wind</a> with you matching up new buildings or areas (tiles) to keep on expanding, and build up a score to unlock more types of tiles. This is probably my favourite so far though by miles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aHzaY6TLKik"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/794ac2f31a834587652613ea414d18cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aHzaY6TLKik" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In fairness, Dorfromantik while having some similar basics to the aforementioned games, does it quite differently overall. You're building the world as you go, with each tile you place down near the border giving you more area to place down tiles and it just keeps on going. It offers three things I love: the endless replay value and (in the nicest possible meaning) mindless clicking that looks good. Then, you also have the strategy element to it (if you want it), to keep beating the high score with careful tile placement.</p>
<p>Some tiles give you little mini-quests like having more matching tiles linked up, doing so will give you even more to continue that never-ending expansion. Once you really get going you end up discovering new biomes, and there's also some special pre-place tile objects that can give you tasks to complete over a longer period allowing you to unlock even more of the game to continue, once again, that never-ending expansion.</p>
<p>When you place down tiles and they link up it's wonderful, seeing how they can all blend together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3501714451651489184gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3501714451651489184gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You won't find any traditional strategy elements here. There's no territory issues, no combat, no resource building or anyone that — just peaceful tile placing. Absolutely wonderful. This is practically as close to perfection as a game can get and not something I ever say lightly and extremely rare for me to come close to saying.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1455840/Dorfromantik/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Also on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dorfromantik" target="_blank">GOG</a> if you want to try with Wine.</p>

      <title>Society management city-builder Kapital: Sparks of Revolution is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kapital: Sparks of Revolution is a city-builder that brings in some social society management, so prepare for some fierce class riots and more. Quite an interesting turn for a city-builder, since most tend to focus on pure economy simulation.</p>
<p>This is a little more, dare I say it, human. The idea is that you're given limited resources and you need to balance the needs of the people and city development. So you'll deal with angry crowds, money, resources and try to create a society that actually works and most likely fail at some point.</p>
<p>"Being a mayor in Kapital: Sparks of Revolution is a delicate balancing act. Each decision has different consequences for the various classes inhabiting the city. Important investments need to be made into resource distribution, housing and security if tensions spill into the streets. When one class becomes disgruntled, things may get ugly if their concerns are not swiftly addressed."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6IMHxhaJnrM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1610df8e87faa60538c55f853834f80e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6IMHxhaJnrM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At release, it hasn't managed to get the best of reviews with it being Mixed overall from users on Steam as it seems there's a number of issues currently. The developer put up an announcement that they will "continue to improve the game based on your feedback" and they were "surprised with the amount of constructive feedback". Going further, they said to expect "new features never seen before in city builders to make the game a truly unique crisis management game".</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/kapital-sparks-of-revolution?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1399700/Kapital_Sparks_of_Revolution/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>The Long Dark has some huge changes on the way with paid survival DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hinterland has confirmed now that the future of the The Long Dark will have the Story and Survival modes completely separate, along with paid expansions for the Survival mode. This news shouldn't be a shock to regular players, or our readers, since we covered their initial thoughts on it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/the-long-dark-gets-another-big-upgrade-to-the-survival-mode/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a> where they announced the plans.</p>
<p>Now things are more set in stone, as detailed in a new <a href="https://hinterlandforums.com/forums/topic/41847-april-developer-diary/" target="_blank">developer diary</a>.</p>
<p>The game will be split in two, and all existing owners on all platforms will have full access to what they had already. So no one will actually be losing out on anything. Right now, they're already at a point where Survival mode will run standalone, so they can update it independently. Soon they will have the Story mode doing the same. Part of the point is that, they say, it streamlines the process and makes it easier to update both, while having Survival updates not impact the story with the opposite also being true.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7417152341651485005gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7417152341651485005gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So what we will see in future is a separate release, with Survival getting a series of paid DLC expansions. These will take the form of a sort-of season pass to get everything, and then going out as DLC once the season is finished for anyone who prefers to buy it that way. Free updates will also continue but be smaller.</p>
<p>It does sound reasonable, especially considering how many years they've continued to provide big free upgrades for everyone.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's going to be a Leadership change. Raphael van Lierop will be standing down, with studio veteran Katie Sorrell taking over. Lierop will still be the overall creative head at Hinterland though, and has written the final part of story too.</p>
<p>You can buy The Long Dark from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-long-dark?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/305620/The_Long_Dark/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe hit 100,000 sales in 24 hours</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like developer Crows Crows Crows has managed to make a hit into another hit, with The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe shifting 100,000 copies in the first 24 hours the developer announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/crowsx3/status/1519712683850977285" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>"When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers. You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win. The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you."</p>

<p>I went through some of the new content live on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Twitch channel</a>, until my PC had something of an unrelated mini-meltdown. Until that point though, it was <em>great</em>. The new content is thankfully easy to get to, and it doesn't exactly let you miss it with big signs pointing where to go (that alone is pretty funny). The narrator continues being brilliant, and some of it really had me properly belly-laughing.</p>
<p>Won't spoil anything here, as this kind of game really needs you to go in blind for the majority of it. Safe to say I can highly recommend picking it up.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1703340/The_Stanley_Parable_Ultra_Deluxe/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Microsoft joined the Open 3D Foundation for the Open 3D Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a missed one from Friday, Microsoft has joined the Open 3D Foundation, who oversee the Open 3D Engine that's a free and open source updated version of Amazon Lumberyard that was contributed by Amazon. Only caught this as they boosted their post on <a href="https://twitter.com/o3dengine/status/1520908609462448128" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. It seems no press email was sent out to us when it happened.</p>
<p>It's another big boon for the up and coming game engine designed to help build anything from AAA games to cinema-quality 3D worlds, as the more companies that back it the better. Microsoft has joined as a "Premier" member, although I can't seem to find a <em>proper</em> explanation as to what the difference between member states are. Usually, it's a big difference in the funding they provide. I've asked the Open 3D Foundation to clarify that.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-open-3d-foundation-welcomes-microsoft-as-a-premier-member-to-advance-the-future-of-open-source-3d-development-301536018.html" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>"Microsoft's roots in creativity run deep and we want to help creators wherever they are, whoever they are, and whatever platform they're creating for," said Oliver. "Having the Linux Foundation create the Open 3D Foundation is a fantastic step towards helping more creators everywhere and we are excited to be a part of it."</p>
<p>"We are elated to have Microsoft join the Open 3D Foundation as a Premier member," said Royal O'Brien, Executive Director of O3DF and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. "Having incredible industry veterans like Microsoft contributing and helping drive innovation with the community for 3D engines is a huge benefit to the open source community and the companies that use it alike."</p>

      <title>Crawl through dungeons, hack computers, or explore an undersea base: Dungeon Crawler Jam</title>
      <author>Dennis_Payne</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Before computers had the hardware for 3D games, some games still managed a 3D view on a limited scale in dungeon crawlers. The 3D views were created with prerendered walls and ground that were composed together. Due to this you were restricted to 90 degree turns and movement was restricted to squares on a grid. The game might draw a few in between frames when walking forward but those were already rendered and you couldn't stop halfway between these squares.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://dungeoncrawlers.org/" target="_blank">dungeoncrawlers.org</a> organized the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2021. They returned again this year and over forty games were submitted. Some are very much in the vein of classic dungeon crawlers, while others have modern elements. I have not played through them all but have picked some the entries that I've tried and recommend. Games <em>without</em> Linux versions were run on the latest Wine version available on Fedora. There may be some small spoilers in the descriptions but I've tried to keep that to a minimum.</p>
<p><a href="https://hephforgegaming.itch.io/cycle-of-spore" target="_blank">Cycle of Spore</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13804114221651325387gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13804114221651325387gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>An explosion knocked you unconscious while on a school trip to a garden maze. The explosion has spread seedlings everywhere. Most of your classmates are probably infected but you focus on trying to find your friends.</p>
<p>The purple and cyan colors of the environment and monsters contribute to the horror setting. Your health is represented with leaves on a vine which fits the setting. Sometimes the monster graphics didn't appear but otherwise I didn't have any problems playing the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://hiimwren.itch.io/xenoseekers" target="_blank">Xenoseekers</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614822611651325390gol10189.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614822611651325390gol10189.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An alien spacecraft broke apart in low orbit and rained debris and toxic substances down on the earth. Humanity used the alien technology to construct domed cities but cannot repair the machines. You are a relic seeker travelling the wasteland for alien technology to keep the domed cities functioning.</p>
<p>You start in the safety of your vehicle. You can purchase equipment and save before descending into a dungeon. The toxic air requires you to bring your own oxygen which limits the time you have to explore. Beware of the mutant creatures inhabiting the dungeons. After collecting as much as you feel is safe, you can drive to a new dungeon to explore.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamknight.itch.io/aegir-rising" target="_blank">Aegir Rising</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6309494521651325383gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6309494521651325383gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>You awake with no memory but a voice over a speaker helps you out. You appear to be on an underwater base after an experiment on the base has gone horribly wrong.</p>
<p>The game feels similar to the game Soma but has it's own story. The enemies appear as cardboard cut-outs which gives the game a unique look. It is a little dark on my display but is playable.</p>
<p><a href="https://zooperdan.itch.io/it-came-from-the-forest" target="_blank">It Came from the Forest</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2415024711651325388gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2415024711651325388gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>An unknown darkness has fallen on the area. All people know is that it came from the forest.</p>
<p>This game follows a more classic dungeon crawler design with a fantasy setting. The game includes a short tutorial area to explain some mechanics found in older games like illusionary walls and teleporters. Combats are real time with only a few options. There is no Linux version but the game uses Love2D and includes the source code. Instead of using Wine, I was able to run it with the native Love2D on Fedora.</p>
<p><a href="https://entikan.itch.io/hz-so-good" target="_blank">Hz So Good</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10863169311651325388gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10863169311651325388gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>After hacking into a computer system, you need to avoid or defeat the security systems to find data to sell.</p>
<p>The game has psychedelic visual style that works for the setting. In addition to integrity which serves as your health you have storage space. You need to upgrade your storage to get larger data files. You purchase warez to fool the systems to give you greater access and add offensive capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://inkusgames.itch.io/dumbest-dungeon" target="_blank">Dumbest Dungeon</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2635670031651325388gol10189.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2635670031651325388gol10189.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Dumbest Dungeon is a parody fantasy setting where you explore dungeons and battle using cards. The card battle system is fun with humorous card abilities. The visual style is great for the tone of the game. Remember to pet Mr Mittens before entering the dungeon.</p>
<p><a href="https://mkimball.itch.io/gift-of-fire" target="_blank">Gift of Fire</a></p>
<p>War has raged between the surface animals and the Underground Kingdom. After the Rat King stole the Gift of Fire, the surface has been growing colder. The Underground Kingdom has flourished but one soldier has seen enough death from the conflict and tries to return the Gift of Fire.</p>
<p>While many game jam entries are solo efforts, a team of eight put together Gift of Fire. The team has put in an amazing amount of work in graphics, gameplay and level design. The combat system displays a pattern of "abc" which you need to quickly memorize and enter before the time runs out. As the game progresses the patterns get longer. It didn't seem that interesting but it proved more fun than I expected. The level have a collection of keys and switches to discover.</p>
<p><a href="https://narkhos.itch.io/digging-dungeon" target="_blank">Digging Dungeon</a></p>
<p>No story is provided for this entry. You are simply tasked with collecting twenty five emeralds. The real time combat system is well done but the high random encounter rate mars the experience. The developer plans to fix the enemy spawn rate after the game jam's rating period is over. If you persevere, you encounter the digging mechanic and a second enemy type. It makes me curious what more could be done with this design.</p>
<p><a href="https://danga.itch.io/labyrinth" target="_blank">Labyrinth</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5796604051651325389gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5796604051651325389gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>"Labyrinth is a short mind bending dungeon puzzler, where you must crawl on every surface to find your way out."</p>
<p>The description from the game page gives the best explanation of this game. You walk up walls to pass barriers which makes it a very different dungeon crawler.</p>
<p><a href="https://fernandolv3.itch.io/arcadeus" target="_blank">The Tomb of the King Arcadeus</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17233543981651325390gol10189.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17233543981651325390gol10189.png"/></a></p>
<p>You have discovered the Tomb of the King Arcadeus but there are multiple challenges before you reach the king's final resting place.</p>
<p>This one doesn't really feel like a dungeon crawler to me but I'm not the gatekeeper to dungeon crawlers. In this game you play a series of minigames as you explore the dungeon. The minigames are well done and give a different experience from any of the other games mentioned here.</p>
<p>The Game Jam and all submissions be found on <a href="https://itch.io/jam/dcjam2022" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck updates out for Stable and Beta, better Refresh Rate Switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another set of Steam Deck upgrades and it includes updates for both the Stable and Beta branches.</p>
<p>For the Stable update, there's a few fixes and some new additions. Here's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3216143124007678705" target="_blank">what's new</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added pinned notifications to the Quick Access Menu for friend requests and comments</li>
<li>Added two new notifications: Steam gift received and Item received</li>
<li>Added "View Mutual Friends" to invites page</li>
<li>Minor updates to localized keyboard themes</li>
<li>Fixed issue where controller input goes to the remote computer while the on-screen keyboard is up during Remote Play</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the left trackpad pressure could be unresponsive in the Deck UI after launching a game</li>
<li>Fixed issue where games with no action sets crashing on launch</li>
<li>Fixed a case where a game library would appear as locked if the lender is in Offline mode</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that, the Beta update was improved to "cause less black screen time when changing refresh rate". Currently, when you swap the refresh rate the screen will momentarily turn black so they're working to reduce that happening. Their previous <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3269060419612777126/" target="_blank">Beta post</a> was updated to note it.</p>
<p>Additionally, open source consulting firm Collabora recently <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/pipewire-bluetooth-support-status-update.html" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Steam Deck has become a conformant Bluetooth A2DP audio product thanks to the work done in PipeWire and WirePlumber.</p>

      <title>Canonical going &#39;all in&#39; on gaming for Ubuntu, new Steam Snap package in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there's a huge focus on Flatpak and Flathub thanks to the Steam Deck shipping with it out of the box, Canonical on the other hand continue with their own Snap packaging and they have a Steam Snap in testing for Ubuntu (and other distros, since Snap also works elsewhere).</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/introducing-early-access-to-the-steam-snap/28082" target="_blank">introduction post</a> on the Ubuntu Linux Discourse forum (thanks <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/04/steam-snap-store" target="_blank">OMGUbuntu</a>), it outlines how they're now actually "going all in on the gaming experience on Ubuntu and we’ve started building out a team dedicated to working on just that". Part of that is reducing the need for PPAs and other solutions, and their focus now is on Steam.</p>
<p>The call for testing has now begun on their Steam Snap package which gives you everything you need for Native Linux gaming and for Proton too. It's early days for the Steam Snap so expect issues but they said they will "iterate quickly, and respond to this feedback" on it.</p>
<p>On top of that we can expect more gaming on Ubuntu Linux improvements to come "such as providing easy ways to get more bleeding edge components like Mesa drivers, and even newer kernels and proprietary drivers" — that all sounds great to me.</p>
<p>It's not actually live yet but once it will be, I'll update the post here with instructions they give, which they will also post in the link above. <strong>Update</strong>: Canonical has now done an additional <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/level-up-linux-gaming-new-steam-snap" target="_blank">blog post</a>, going over the instructions. Either install it from the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/steam" target="_blank">website / Snap Store</a> or via terminal: <code class="inline-code">snap install steam --beta</code></p>
<p>With the blog post, Canonical once again reiterated their plan to improve Ubuntu gaming mentioning that "the Ubuntu Desktop team is getting down to work planning for the future, and improving the gaming experience features heavily in our priorities (and hiring plan!)". They go on to mention how "serious gamers" continue using Windows primarily, which we all know as Steam puts Linux at about 1% currently (see our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>) but they hope by "improving the gaming experience, and the Steam experience in particular, we can ensure that Ubuntu can become a genuine daily driver for gamers".</p>

      <title>Good Old Games Week is live on GOG with a sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good Old Games, what GOG were originally known as, is a bit more than just a name it's a commitment to keeping classics alive and easy to purchase so GOG are celebrating with a sale.</p>
<p>Of course, plenty of the games in their classics collection don't have Native Linux versions because a lot of them are incredibly old. That's fine though really, considering how good the likes of DOSBox, ScummVM and Wine are — most will likely just work out of the box with one of those ready.</p>
<p>It's not just a sale though as GOG has put up some more titles like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/revolt" target="_blank">Re-Volt</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/deadly_dozen_reloaded" target="_blank">Deadly Dozen Reloaded</a> and various titles from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?publishers=throwback-entertainment" target="_blank">Throwback Entertainment</a>.</p>
<p>Along with this, GOG has made a special <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/good-old-games" target="_blank">dedicated page just for Good Old Games</a>.</p>
<p>During the event, GOG said to expect more, so we might see other classics appear.</p>
<p>The aptly named Good Old Games Week runs from April 29 - May 9.</p>

      <title>First-person zombie co-op shooter Projekt Z is up on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Projekt Z from German studio 314 Arts is now live on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/314artsohg/projekt-z-ww2-zombie-coop-fps" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with an ambitious plan to release a free to play shooter that's supported on Linux.</p>
<p>A game that I've followed for quite some time, as their early development blog videos were pretty impressive and they definitely left the impression of knowing what they're doing. It will be interesting to see how the crowdfunding goes, especially since they're asking for funds for what will be free to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21266572341651234791gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21266572341651234791gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Projekt Z is a free-to-play first-person coop shooter set in a WW2 Zombie scenario on a secret German island. The game focuses on the "Projekt Z", a project run by the Nazis to turn Zombies, which have been discovered on the island earlier, into weapons to turn the war around in Nazi Germany's favor. Choose a character that has an ability that favors your playstyle. Play through the coop story with your friends and take care of your hub. Find food, water, gas, and other resources to give the people in your hub a chance to survive. Find other survivors (NPCs) during the missions and shelter them. But be aware every decision you and your friends make will influence the morale inside the hub. Be a judge and decide what will happen to the people that do not follow the rules. Be a leader and prioritize the resources you find. Are you going to upgrade your weapons and characters, or do you help someone? It's all up to you and your friends. Projekt Z is not just a basic zombie coop game, it's a management game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their latest dev video below shows off some of the very early gameplay while they explain some of it:</p>

<p>You can also see their actual Kickstarter trailer below:</p>

<p>Liking what I'm seeing, and the developer confirmed to me today their original plan for Native Linux support is still in place so that's great too.</p>

      <title>Mistlands in Valheim will have strange structures — and Hares</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As work continues on the major Mistlands update for Valheim, Iron Gate have given us another teaser of what's to come for their co-op survival game.</p>
<p>Firstly, a video they did earlier this month that I missed, is that Valheim will have Hares hopping around in the Mistlands. You can watch them model it below with a brief clip of it in-game:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ddzQ_Bzn89s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9e1f6135e77fe07abb77dfb398be5506.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ddzQ_Bzn89s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another creature is being teased, although they're not quite ready to talk about it yet. Iron Gate said "we think they’ll be something many of you have been curious about!" so what do you think that will be?</p>
<p>Exploring the Mistlands sounds like it will be quite a sight to see. Like other places, the Mistlands "were once a place where civilisations of old built homes and strongholds alike" and so you will end up seeing the remnants of these old inhabitants through various structures left laying around. These still might change before release but for now we have these teasers (click them to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18398625501651231178gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18398625501651231178gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6686710511651231180gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6686710511651231180gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A patch to help stop players overwriting their saves with an older one from Steam Cloud is also in the works.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Easy GE-Proton installer ProtonUp-Qt now shows Steam Deck compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> is great. A very simple application that allows you to download extra compatibility layers for Linux desktops and the Steam Deck and now it's even better. This tool helps you install GE-Proton (formerly Proton-GE) and Luxtorpeda for Steam, plus it also helps with Wine-GE for the game managers Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>The latest release, ProtonUp-Qt v2.6.2, is out now adding in the display of official Proton in the game list, a new column to show expected Steam Deck compatibility in the game list and performance improvements.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how it looks:</p>

<p>You can find the source up on <a href="https://github.com/the3dfxdude/7kaa" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I looked around but couldn't find an easy way to play it on Linux that doesn't involve compiling it, perhaps someone helpful can get it up on <a href="https://flathub.org/home" target="_blank">Flathub</a> to help keep it nicely preserved.</p>

      <title>Owlboy gets a nice upgrade, should now work great on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Owlboy, a rather sweet story-driven platformer developed by D-Pad Studio has been updated and it's quite a major change for the tech behind it that will make it run nicely on the Steam Deck. Currently, the game has an "Unsupported" rating but this should hopefully move it over to Verified.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changed to <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a>, which should fix multiple crashes</li>
<li>The old XNA version of the game is still available on the "xnaversion" beta branch on Steam</li>
<li>Level loading is much faster</li>
<li>More readable Japanese, Chinese, Traditional Chinese, and Korean fonts</li>
<li>Better error logging, moved logs to C:\Users\<user>\Saved Games\Owlboy\Saves\logs</user></li>
<li>One shared build for Windows, Mac, and Linux</li>
<li>Support for PS4 controller natively</li>
<li>Help files now available in Data/Help in the install directory</li>
<li>Many out of bounds and speed-runner glitches fixed</li>

      <title>Kaiju Wars seems like Into the Breach but it&#39;s much more and it&#39;s out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taken at face value, you could easily think that Kaiju Wars was close to Into the Breach but after playing it, I can safely tell you it's a whole lot more than that. While they both have you command armies on small maps against incoming enemies, Kaiju Wars has a bunch of extras that really do set the two games nicely apart.</p>
<p>In Kaiju Wars you're defending cities against huge creatures, and to do so you need to construct buildings and an army (and repair them when destroyed). The gameplay is a bit more flexible and forgiving that way compared with Into the Breach. Here you don't kill anything, you only really slow them down for them to come back and stomp all over your cities in later missions.</p>
<p>Release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r4YvQxqTDCs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0b4f9e891dbebf42e81635e0abce695.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r4YvQxqTDCs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The style and interface looks all a bit retro here, and while the graphical style in missions is actually quite awesome, I found the overall interface to be a bit lacking, and the way the main menu is set up to be a little too messy. A mostly minor nitpick there though. The way the creatures are designed is brilliant, you get a good sense of their scale and power in the missions compared with your tiny units.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a silly game too, with some slightly cringe-worthy comedy dialogue but it all fits so nicely with the theme here. It's set in the future, but your military advisor and the style feels like something out of an 80s action film in some ways. The campaign is set up like a comic book too with each panel being either a mission, a news story or something else. Their version of King Kong is called Big Donk, and if you complete the mission where you first encounter them, you're told some special anti-Kaiju serum was delivered via a giant banana, which is the only reason why it ran away. After that mission, I'll admit that seeing the ridiculous real-life styled news reporting about it made me laugh. All of the creatures (there's five) have these funny nicknames in the game, like another the Hell Turkey.</p>
<p>You play through a series of turns with Kaiju movement, your economy bringing in money and research from buildings you have left, and then you get to repair / build units and move them around. What did take a little while is getting to properly understand how to correctly use each unit. The point here is <em>not</em> to kill (since you're seriously out-gunned) but to slow down the Kaiju, and certain units are better at doing that — especially while being trampled on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18575795501651169036gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18575795501651169036gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4751922941651169038gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4751922941651169038gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's all about getting the right positioning on where to leave your units and what side to attack from, and hoping the creatures go the way you've planned for. You get to see a few tiles of where they might move, and what percentage chance they will take that route so you're not totally blind. If you're wrong, you have to reposition, repair units at a base and keep moving around and attack to slow them down.</p>
<p>Kaiju Wars is pretty much a strategy game of playing cat and mouse with tanks, rockets and giant monsters wrapped up in a delightful bright retro visual style and comedy sprinkled throughout.</p>
<p>You play through a full story campaign but there's plenty more outside of that too. Kaiju Wars also has Twitch Integration, a local versus mode, a map editor and weekly challenges. It all certainly adds up and I can see myself repeatedly coming back to this for one more run. That said, it does make me value the beautiful simplicity of Into the Breach but for those after something with a little more flavour — Kaiju Wars has plenty of destruction to offer.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1508400/Kaiju_Wars/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Trigon: Space Story is a fresh FTL-like space strategy game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this looks pretty darn cool. Did you enjoy FTL: Faster Than Light? Well, Trigon: Space Story looks very much inspired by it but with much more modern graphics. Developed by Sernur.tech and published by Gameforge 4D GmbH, it doesn't just looked like FTL, they were directly inspired by it to create an FTL 2 that never came. Nice to see a title with full Linux support too, with a Native Linux build available.</p>
<p>Trigon: Space Story places you in the captain's seat of a fully customizable starship. Here you manage everything from the weapons systems and engines to the day-to-day tasks of the crew. Each time you play it's fresh, with a procedurally generated universe that has you travel through 9 different sectors with over 10 individual systems. With dangerous space anomalies, roving gangs of space pirates, and a complex web of intergalactic politics to navigate, you will need to strategize each approach with myriad factors to consider.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Oh Captain, My Captain: It’s your show out there and it’s up to you to lead and inspire your crew, make life or death decisions, and craft the most badass ship in the galaxy.   </li>
<li>Build the Best Ship in the Stars: Outfit your star cruiser with more than 70 types of weapons including lasers, turrets, plasma cannons, bombs, drones, and more.     </li>
<li>It’s a Culture Thing: On your travels, you will make first contact with multiple species, each with their own unique qualities, like the warmongering militant Rakhi, or the crafty and tenacious Earthlings.     </li>
<li>Decisions, Decisions: You find a damaged ship with a crew that needs rescuing. Do you take the noble route and save them? Or hit ‘em while they’re weak and take their stuff?     </li>
<li>A New Adventure Every Time: A procedurally generated universe ensures no run is the same, forcing players to learn, adapt, and craft fresh strategies to ensure victory.</li>

      <title>Bugsnax out on Steam, looking good on Steam Deck but tweak needed on Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bugsnax, originally a console exclusive for PlayStation and an Epic Exclusive on PC, was just released on Steam. Thankfully it works well on Steam Deck but on Linux desktops you need a small adjustment for the Windows version running through Proton.</p>
<p>By default, the game uses DirectX 11 which is a bit broken, for the Steam Deck the developer did a tweak to automatically change it over to DirectX 9 - so on Deck it works well out of the box. For Linux desktops though, you need to manually force it to DX9. There's two ways to do this either by editing the config file to change it over found here:</p>
<p><code>/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/674140/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Saved Games/Bugsnax/Settings/Config.xml</code></p>
<p>Inside here, you can edit this line to have a "4" instead of a "6": <code class="inline-code">int name="System_VideoDriver" value="6"</code></p>
<p><strong>Or</strong>, you can set this as a Steam launch option: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_NO_D3D11=1 PROTON_NO_D3D10=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Back earlier this month, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/674140/discussions/0/3278066352367210687/#c3278066352367292925" target="_blank">noted</a> on Steam they will look into sorting that for Proton overall but it's not yet fixed so that is needed for now. Again though, that's not needed on Steam Deck but once done Bugsnax looks great on a Linux desktop too.</p>

      <title>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe from Crows Crows Crows is out now with Native Linux support and it's looking good. In no time at all, it gained an Overwhelmingly Positive review score on Steam so it seems this new expanded edition has been worth it for both the developer and players.</p>
<p>"When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers.</p>
<p>You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win. The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you."</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.2 Beta brings a new Steam Deck Fan Curve, experimental Refresh Rate Switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has only just put <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-gets-a-lock-screen-window-switcher-and-more/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.1 into the Stable channel</a> with tons of improvements and there's already a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3269060419612777126/" target="_blank">Beta available for SteamOS 3.2</a> with some big goodies.</p>
<p>The first is that Valve are trying to deal with all the noise complaints about the fan. As it turns out, there's multiple fans being used in the Steam Deck, and one of them gives this annoying high-pitch whine. Since I've had a <a href="https://youtu.be/hNg2a7rFT3M" target="_blank">replacement</a> recently, I've now seen first-hand just how annoying it is. The new OS-controlled fan curve should improve that making it near-silent in low usage and there's adjustments for how it responds to different temperatures.</p>
<p>A definite improvement on my end but temperatures will be higher, since often the fan is running at a much lower speed than before. <em>I'll take a slight increase in temps to not have my Steam Deck simulate my Tinnitus.</em></p>
<p>We also now have experimental support for changing the in-game refresh rate, which will automatically adjust the FPS lock as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12280788131651133425gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12280788131651133425gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11621386971651133424gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11621386971651133424gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve has also tweaked Desktop Mode, so that the on-screen keyboard will come up automatically in more cases. This is great, hopefully they continue to improve that.</p>

      <title>Wii U emulator Cemu getting closer to Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work continues on the Wii U emulator <a href="http://cemu.info/" target="_blank">Cemu</a> to bring it over to Linux, and with that gain Steam Deck support. The developers still plan to open source it too, with their roadmap indicating it's still scheduled to happen this year.</p>
<p>For the Linux port, the developers put up an <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3Rk75PM" target="_blank">Imgur post</a> going over the current status. An important milestone has been hit recently, with the project being able to be compiled on Linux "without errors". After that, they said it "didn't take long until we were able to boot the first few games" with a screenshot shared of it running on a Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6272299981651070193gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6272299981651070193gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Plenty more work is still to be done though, so don't expect it too soon. Lots of issues remain from UI problems to porting over various other parts like networking and sound. From what they said we're looking at "1-3 months" before it will be ready to release in public.</p>
<p>They also showed off that it can do OpenGL and H264 video decoding in the port, along with a shot of some of the broken UI. So a ways to go yet but it's coming along nicely it seems.</p>

      <title>Block Quake is basically Quake made into LEGO</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love Quake? Do you love LEGO? Well, now they've been kind-of combined together to create Block Quake. Yes, someone really did this. It's a total conversion mod for the original Quake, giving you cute plastic blocky styled characters.</p>
<p>It works with multiple different game engines too. You can combine it with the official Quake, which was remastered by Nightdive Studios to the KEX engine but it also works with QuakeSpasm 0.93.2, QuakeSpasm-Spiked and DarkPlaces. So you get to pick and do whatever you want with it.</p>
<p>Block Quake has blocky characters, enemies and boss models, textures and animations. Along with blocky themed weapon pickups, weapon model textures and animations and the list goes on. As much as possible has been changed into this rather silly (but awesome) style.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z0L-51OUqfM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4084072a72d0ef72bcbe1c17399c6ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z0L-51OUqfM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer has plans to continue improving it with new sound effects, a new HUD, possible support for some other modes like QuakeWorld CTF and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1378869411651058273gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1378869411651058273gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18202025081651058297gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18202025081651058297gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>Classic Bethesda titles come to Steam, play them easily on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Bethesda Launcher <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2RXxG1y000NWupPalzLblG/sunsetting-the-bethesda-net-launcher-and-migrating-to-steam" target="_blank">shutting down</a>, they've begun the migration to Steam and now some of their classics have become available to download easily.</p>
<p>The titles that have newly arrived on Steam are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812290/The_Elder_Scrolls_Arena/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls Arena</a> (free)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812390/The_Elder_Scrolls_II_Daggerfall/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall</a> (free)</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812410/The_Elder_Scrolls_Adventures_Redguard/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812420/An_Elder_Scrolls_Legend_Battlespire/" target="_blank">An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1873030/Wolfenstein_Enemy_Territory/" target="_blank">Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory</a> (free)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can play them all pretty easily on Linux and the Steam Deck too. Probably the best way is with the likes of <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a>, a Steam Play tool that helpfully downloads Native Linux game engines. So you would grab Luxtorpeda (using something like ProtonUp-Qt, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">see my guide</a>) and set Luxtorpeda on them in Steam and it would do the magic for you.</p>
<p>Luxtorpeda will set Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory on Steam to use the far superior <a href="https://www.etlegacy.com/" target="_blank">ET: Legacy</a> (although there is a <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.etlegacy.ETLegacy" target="_blank">Flatpak</a> for this), The Elder Scrolls Arena will use the in-progress <a href="https://github.com/afritz1/OpenTESArena" target="_blank">OpenTESArena</a> project, and then both Redguard and Battlespire will use a Native Linux version of DOSBox.</p>
<p><em>As always, just a suggestion, set them up however you want.</em></p>

      <title>Claustrowordia, a fun free crossword-type game from Ludum Dare 50</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Game Jam <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50" target="_blank">Ludum Dare 50</a> is over and the overall winner appears to be Claustrowordia, and it turns out it actually is a great crossword-type game.</p>
<p>You're given a basic starting board with a few letters filled, and a few letters of your own to place onto it. The difference here is that you can place your letters anywhere. It's a clever little tweak to the usual word-game and it's pretty amazing that this came from a Game Jam, made solo in 28 hours. I've played quite a bit of it, and it supports a few different languages too. All languages play the same, it just changes the dictionary and word definitions used.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DAaVrbDmAlA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cd9740c5d2895d960db357f13a90fbd5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DAaVrbDmAlA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Honestly, it's always amazing to see what comes out of a Game Jam like Super Hot, Surgeon Simulator, Broforce and a great many more.</p>
<p>You can play free by downloading or playing in your browser on the <a href="https://anttihaavikko.itch.io/claustrowordia" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>. The source code is also available for people to learn from on <a href="https://github.com/anttihaavikko/claustrowordia" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (it uses Unity).</p>

      <title>Classic Sonic games being delisted to make way for Sonic Origins</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sad day for preservation and emulation, as SEGA has announced that they will be delisting the classic Sonic games.</p>
<p>Why? Well, they have Sonic Origins coming out on June 23. So they will be delisting Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles and Sonic CD on May 20. If that alarms you, then you might want to grab them from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34270/SEGA_Mega_Drive_and_Genesis_Classics/" target="_blank">SEGA Mega Drive and Genesis Classics collection</a> (you can buy them individually). That whole collection supports Linux too, and comes with roms, which it appears Sonic Origins will not (on both counts).</p>
<p>The full press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SEGA announced today that the company will delist the digital versions of the stand-alone titles that will be featured in the upcoming game, Sonic Origins<strong> </strong>on May 20, 2022.</p>
<p>This will include Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles and Sonic CD. There are a couple of exceptions - Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2 will remain available via SEGA AGES on the Nintendo Switch and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 will still be playable via Sega Genesis on Nintendo Switch Online +.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delisting means no new purchases but existing owners will continue to have access.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that Sonic Origins has a stupid confusing DLC policy mess, just look at this. What have they done to Sonic?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18890225571650991104gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18890225571650991104gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Publisher Devolver Digital were quick to make a <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1516877660370124801" target="_blank">good joke</a> about it.</p>
<p><em>Currently waiting on a little more info from SEGA PR, will update if / when they reply.</em></p>

      <title>Dune: Spice Wars is out in Early Access, works on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The battle for Spice has begun on the sandy planet, with Dune: Spice Wars from Shiro Games and Funcom officially out on Steam in Early Access. Good news for fans of 4x RTS games, as it appears to work great with Steam Play Proton out of the box with no additional tweaking needed. This has been tested on both my desktop with NVIDIA and my Steam Deck with AMD.</p>
<p>"Conquer Arrakis through political maneuvering, military dominance, sabotage, and wise resource allocation. The spice must flow, but as you struggle to wrest it from the grip of opposing factions, the planet itself threatens with coriolis storms and colossal sandworms. Lead the honorable Atreides, brutal Harkonnen, opportunistic Smugglers, or survivalist Fremen, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Specialize your faction by appointing various iconic characters as your councilors."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B2TJHua1EQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dde935b28fc9267697a6c3b268622103.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B2TJHua1EQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I personally grew up with Dune 2 as one of my first strategy games, so I simply could not pass up the opportunity to play this one (personal purchase). First impressions count of course and so far, so good. It definitely looks and feels a bit like a sci-fi Northgard, with a few of the mechanics being quite similar and the UI also feels close there too. Not a bad thing though, Northgard is great and Shiro clearly learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, it works well and performs quite nicely from my initial test. The interface even looks okay, although the problem is the text size (which a lot of games suffer with on Deck) being in many places too small. Playable on Deck for sure but not overly comfortable due to that. No issues with that on my Linux desktop of course.</p>
<p>Not a big surprise that it works out of the box, especially since it has options for OpenGL or DirectX. Both appear to work on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Screenshots from desktop (click pictures to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20402392631650983496gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20402392631650983496gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10498733641650983494gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10498733641650983494gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Performance on Steam Deck appears to be far better if you use the <u>OpenGL</u> option. I saw a good 10-15FPS improvement on Deck by using OpenGL. Steam Deck screenshot on High settings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5075711121650984664gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5075711121650984664gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sebastien Vidal, Shiro games CEO says, “We’re all very proud of the current state of the game as we enter Early Access. It's the beginning of a journey, and the game is only going to keep expanding from here, with the help of valuable player feedback."</p>
<p>Through Early Access they have plans to add in a full story campaign, multiplayer and more.</p>

      <title>Loop Hero gets controller support, looking good on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Loop Hero, the fantastic deck-builder from Four Quarters and Devolver Digital now has controller support, making it work even better on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A big update is on the way too, which they say stalled around the 80% mark but work on that will continue again as almost "all graphics and code are finished, mostly texts/sounds/balance remain". Until then though, this small update to work with controllers / gamepads is a nice addition to an already great game.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, Valve gave it a Playable rating previously but this should bump it right up to Verified status as the control system and icons were the issue which is now solved. Feels really good on Deck too, and the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1282730/discussions/0/3278066986694410834/#c3278066986694603454" target="_blank">solved</a> a problem I reported very quickly.</p>

<p>The situation is a bit different for the Native Linux version, which is the default on normal desktops. As they use Game Maker, which really doesn't have the best gamepad support on Linux. Four Quarters only officially support the Sony DualShock 4 there and sure enough, my Xbox pad was very broken in it. If that bothers you, switching to Proton can solve it.</p>

      <title>AMD driver work ongoing to help Halo Infinite on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Bas Nieuwenhuizen has a new blog post up about some of the work going into the radv AMD GPU driver on Linux, and they're taking steps towards doing "<a href="https://www.basnieuwenhuizen.nl/a-driver-on-the-gpu/" target="_blank">A driver on the GPU</a>" which should help Halo Infinite get working.</p>
<p>One of the problems with Halo Infinite on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton, is to do with the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer VKD3D-Proton and how a certain part of Direct3D 12 is being used in a "non-trivial" way. Getting that properly supported sounds like it has been difficult.</p>
<p>The full blog post goes into some highly <em>technical</em> details that most people won't understand, but what they're doing is sending a bunch of the work to the GPU by adding some support for the Vulkan extension <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_NV_device_generated_commands.html" target="_blank">VK_NV_device_generated_commands</a>. Sounds like some parts of the Vulkan specification may need some tweaks or adjustments based on what they're doing, and what's actually "allowed".</p>
<p>A key point though is not to expect this to come any time soon, as Nieuwenhuizen explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t expect this upstream very quickly. The main reason for exploring this in radv is <code class="inline-code">ExecuteIndirect</code> support for Halo Infinite, and after some recent updates we’re back into GPU hang limbo with radv/vkd3d-proton there. So while we’re solving that I’m holding off on upstreaming in case the hangs are caused by the implementation of this extension.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is only a partial implementation of the extension anyways, with a fair number of limitations that we’d ideally eliminate before fully exposing this extension.</p>

      <title>AI War 2: The Neinzul Abyss DLC out, Arcen finished with it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The massive-scale space RTS AI War 2 has a new expansion out with AI War 2: The Neinzul Abyss, and it seems Arcen are now finished with the game and moving onto their next project.</p>
<p>Arcen say this expansion is bigger than some standalone games, and the game has lost the "Beta" status for multiplayer as it seems to all work fine now. On the game as a whole, they're not working full-time on it now and consider it pretty much done. However, they will be around watching over it to put out bug fixes whenever they're needed.</p>
<p>Their next title is already in progress, but it is not set in their existing "Arcenverse" of sci-fi games.</p>
<p>For AI War 2: The Neinzul Abyss, the expansion allows you to be a "Necromancer", giving you control over a mobile fleet that feasts on the living from other universes. Capture enemy guard posts, make skeletons and wights out of enemy ships.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19744858831650967957gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19744858831650967957gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8958408401650967958gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8958408401650967958gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also a bunch of new factions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Neinzul Sappers can be the ultimate ally... for you or your enemies</li>
<li>Neinzul Elderlings are giant creatures you can unleash to roam around the galaxy, even without the necromancer</li>
<li>Neinzul Custodians are fractured groups of Neinzul that have found their way to our galaxy that will show undying loyalty to any that accept them</li>
<li>Neinzul Migrant Fleets constantly appear at random on the map, either opening up new holes in your enemies' defenses or aggravating them and leaving you to pick up the pieces</li>
<li>Neinzul Wild Hives appear to be relatively peaceful if left alone, but their hives actively inhibit the abilities of any ships within their territory</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus, free updates to 'The Spire Rises' Expansion</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Ark Empire player type</li>
<li>Spire-Insued Empire player type</li>
<li>Modular Ships</li>
<li>New Chromatic Horror faction</li>
<li>Several new Spire Dyson Sphere factions</li>
<li>Warheads and Interplanetary Weapons, related to the spire dyson sphere factions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy AI War 2 from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/ai_war_2" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/ai-war-2?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/573410/AI_War_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 reimplementation OpenRCT2 has a new save system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Work that has been ongoing for some time now, <a href="https://openrct2.org/" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> the free and open source reimplementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 version 0.4.0 is out now and it's big. If you want to play it easily on Linux from Steam, you can do so with <em>Luxtorpeda</em>. I have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">a guide on using that</a> on the Steam Deck in a previous article. Or, you can use the version from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>With the huge change being to the save file system, one of their time previously told me that it "significantly raises pretty much all the limits the original sv6 format had and is probably the biggest milestone we have hit since OpenRCT2 started over 7 years ago".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8424224531650966608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8424224531650966608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other improvements in this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow up to 255 trains per ride.</li>
<li>Path surfaces and railings can be mixed and matched, like in RCT1.</li>
<li>The Fruity Ices Stall can now be recoloured, like in RCT1.</li>
<li>The Corkscrew, Twister and Vertical Drop Roller Coasters can now draw inline twists.</li>
<li>Allow map sizes of 999 × 999 (up from 254 × 254).</li>
<li>Custom music objects that are distributed with the save.</li>
<li>Various plugin improvements.</li>
<li>Cheats are now saved with the park.</li>
<li>Increased image limit in the engine.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes</li>
</ul>

      <title>Space station building and management sim orbit.industries is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy a fresh take on building up a space station? orbit.industries from LAB132 and Klabater is out now. So far so good, with it having a number of positive user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>"Jump into 3 modes: Campaign with missions set in the orbit of far flung alien worlds, Endless mode where resources are limited but time is not, or Creative mode where you can let your imagination run wild in the orbital sandbox with no constraints. Orbit.industries blends inspiration from classic science fiction literature, movies, and popular space-opera TV series with actual knowledge and progress achieved in the field of space exploration, space engineering, and orbital stations development."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sCUzO6Gd5ys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2baeb4fdb58b74749411da3a822da53d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sCUzO6Gd5ys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full 360 degrees, 3D view of an orbital station within Unreal Engine 4</li>
<li>An abstract 2D stylized view of management cycles and resource planning</li>
<li>3 Gameplay Modes: Campaign, Creative and Endless</li>
<li>54 Modules varieties to build and design your station with</li>
<li>A technological tree to explore and expand</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see a building sim with a slightly more realistic look and style to the tech we have now, with all the modules looking a lot like what we can do now. Seems like a good one to take a look at it you love space games.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a lock screen, window switcher and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a huge upgrade for the Steam Deck that includes some much requested features, that should dramatically improve the overall experience. The update comes in multiple parts (Client and OS), and should be done via Gaming Mode (the main Deck UI), <em>not</em> Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>Here's the big features:</p>
<p><strong>Lock Screen</strong> - as many requested, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-improves-offline-mode-switching-looks-like-a-lock-screen-is-coming/" target="_blank">as we saw hints of</a>, it's here! You can now feel a bit more secure without someone just pressing the power and doing whatever they want to your Deck. Available to show up on wake, boot, login, and/or when switching to Desktop mode. Available via the new Security menu.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13325012821650963200gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13325012821650963200gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16691026871650963199gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16691026871650963199gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Updated Achievements Page</strong> - The Deck has a nicer looking way to view game Steam Achievements now.</p>
<p><strong>Localized Keyboards</strong> - Another frankly <em>essential</em> feature, instead of forcing everyone into one language there's now 21 available. Keyboards for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are also on the way.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Window Switching</strong> - FINALLY! Hopefully far less annoyance from game launchers now. You can tap the Steam button to get a list of open windows and swap between them. Before this, the Deck would flash violently between them and it was horrible. Good to see Valve act on this major nuisance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15947883591650965910gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15947883591650965910gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Warning for slow chargers</strong> - The Deck will actually tell you if you plug in a charger that's too slow.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Half-Rate Shading</strong> - Allowing you to force 2x2 Variable Rate Shading into existing games for power savings.</p>
<p>Plenty of other improvements came along with this including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New achievements drop down allows players to quickly compare stats against any friend who also plays</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8">Add Friend and Pending Requests have been combined into a single new page for better handling of friend requests</div>
</li>
<li>Added logic to detect and notify user when a microSD card doesn't match advertised storage size and specifications, instead of attempting to format (for a very long time)</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam and (...) button couldn't be used with Remote Play when streaming games from PC</li>
<li>More performance improvements for players with very large game libraries</li>
<li>The LED now dims a few seconds after plugging in / unplugging (so it's less annoying at nighttime)</li>
<li>Battery life is improved in idle or very low usage scenarios.</li>
<li>Compatibility has been improved for Type-C docks, chargers, and SD cards</li>
<li>SD card formatting now tests to see if a card has less storage than advertised</li>
<li>An uncapped framerate option is now available in the Performance tab of the Quick Access Menu</li>
<li>fTPM support has been added, allowing for Windows 11 installation</li>
<li>Overall stability has been improved</li>
</ul>

      <title>Twitter agrees to Elon Musk buyout, a reminder we&#39;re on Mastodon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today, one of the biggest things on the social internet happened, with Elon Musk buying Twitter. So here's a little reminder of Mastodon. Not our usual news, but it's too big to be ignored. Twitter is a massive and important platform and now it's going to be wholly owned by Elon Musk. Regardless of your thoughts on Musk, it's still a little alarming.</p>
<p>Good news for those who do dislike Musk, as there is a great alternative available with <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>. Not perfect, nothing is, but it is a good option to try. It's very much like Twitter except it's free, open source, has no adverts and anyone can host their own instance. Thanks to how it's designed, people can follow and talk to each other across these instances too.</p>
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux is on Mastodon</a>, so feel free to give us a follow. If you don't care about this whole thing, you can also <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow us on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html" target="_blank">Press Release</a>:</p>
<p>Bret Taylor, Twitter's Independent Board Chair, said, "The Twitter Board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess Elon's proposal with a deliberate focus on value, certainty, and financing. The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders."</p>
<p>Parag Agrawal, Twitter's CEO, said, "Twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world. Deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important."</p>
<p>"Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated," said Mr. Musk. "I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans. Twitter has tremendous potential – I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it."</p>
<p><em>It will be interesting to see if Musk does open up more of Twitter.</em></p>

      <title>Linux distro Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS from System76 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 has today released the latest version of their own Linux distribution, with <a href="https://pop.system76.com/" target="_blank">Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS</a>.</p>
<p>The basics are that they've rebased on top of Ubuntu 22.04 for their packaging, with it being an LTS it's supported for 5 years with updates. Also included is the more up to date Linux Kernel 5.16.19 at release (and they do regular updates), Mesa 22 drivers and GNOME 42 with their COSMIC interface. Plenty more tweaks are included with this release too, so here's a quick run-down.</p>
<p>Automatic updates are available in the new OS Upgrade &amp; Recovery panel in Settings, allowing you to set what time and day you want them to happen. Notifications for updates are also now shown weekly, they said it's to "reduce distractions" but you can change that frequency too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16652208261650900193gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16652208261650900193gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The settings menu also has a new Support panel, giving you various options to get help from articles to support chat. You can change what background you want between light and dark modes, better performance with their newer System76 Scheduler — they said this "optimizes performance by directing resources to the window in focus" which should help gaming. PipeWire is now the default for audio too, so you get the latest and greatest way to handle it all on Linux, something <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/pipewire-is-the-future-for-linux-audio-and-i-am-sold-on-it/" target="_blank">I am a big fan of</a>.</p>
<p>Pop!_Shop, their software store, saw plenty of upgrades too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Backend code improvements for more responsive operations</li>
<li>Improved reliability for package operations (update, install, etc.)</li>
<li>UI Improvements to aid in allowing small window sizes for tiling</li>
<li>Update and Install buttons now also function as a progress bar</li>
<li>New "Recently Updated" homepage section highlighting newly added/updated apps</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Various other improvements include better multi-monitor support with the workspaces view, a fixed layout on HiDPI displays and increased performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20109686241650900310gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20109686241650900310gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Outside of that, they sent over this list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Installed NVIDIA drivers are now visible in Pop!_Shop, and will no longer include an “Install” button. Older drivers are also available to install, though the most recent available NVIDIA driver is recommended for most NVIDIA GPUs.</li>
<li>Better performance with improvements to the CPU scaling governor, which keeps your CPU running at the optimal frequency for your system.</li>
<li>The Pop!_OS upgrade service will now only activate when checking for or performing release upgrades. (Previously it was active 24/7.).</li>
<li>If your upgrade gets interrupted, debian packages are now resumable—meaning you can pick up the upgrade from where you left off.</li>
<li>File type for icons has been changed to .svg.</li>
<li>Max disk capacity for journald logs is now limited to 1GB.</li>
<li>Added support for laptop privacy screens.</li>
<li>RDP by default for remote desktop use.</li>
<li>Better performance, scaling, and reliability in Pop!_Shop.</li>
<li>Added this funky <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/default-settings/commit/77e14a2847fada0e979b1bb519e4f291b7bb3246" target="_blank">new user icon</a>.</li>

      <title>Turn customers into food in Godlike Burger - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turn customers into food in Godlike Burger, to serve more customers. This is like the opposite of the Overcooked series. Okay, perhaps not the opposite, but Overcooked's evil twin maybe. Developed by Liquid Pug with publishing from Daedalic Entertainment, this new Native Linux release looks hilarious.</p>
<p>Here you play as a murderous chef who seems to love the taste of aliens. With the use of your flying diner, you need to find all the tastiest ingredients around, which means luring customers into traps and then turning them into delicious meals to fatten people up to create more exotic dishes. Then use your monies to keep upgrading, improve your restaurant reputation and hopefully avoid the space police.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aZsDOb7Wqyc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/407d8598c0e9984d3987773d05fdbff2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aZsDOb7Wqyc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Kill your customers with a range of hidden traps or the good old meat cleaver! Their delicious meat is your special ingredient after all.</li>
<li>Cook the best burgers and turn your pitiful burger joint into the universe’s most famous restaurant.</li>
<li>Improve your kitchen and find out what each alien race likes - uncover the secret of the perfect burger.</li>
<li>Explore the galaxy and its worlds. There are different alien species and their individual strengths and weaknesses to discover.</li>
<li>Don’t get caught! Leave no witnesses and keep the police’s suspicion low by playing and planning smartly.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valheim is absolutely smashing it with 10 million copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate has announced that their single-player and online co-op survival game Valheim has managed to hit a massive milestone of sales.</p>
<p>Writing on Twitter, their team <a href="https://twitter.com/Valheimgame/status/1518591911497412608" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Valheim" target="_blank">#Valheim</a> has sold over 10 million copies! Thank you to every single one of you who got us to this milestone – when we launched the game we could never in our wildest dreams have imagined this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not even remotely surprised by this, considering how absolutely enamoured by it I was when it first came out, spending every free moment running through the lands to explore. I think it certainly helped that they had quite an expansive free Alpha version available for quite a while before release, which pulled in quite a lot of eyes on it.</p>
<p>Valheim is quite a <em>magical</em> game really, which does things so differently to other survival game it's simply brilliant. The team at Iron Gate fully deserve all the sales they can possibly get, it's easily one of the best games I've played over the last few years.</p>

<p>Currently, the developers at Iron Gate are working away on the very exciting upcoming update for The Mistlands, which will bring another full biome to the game.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you want to play Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout on Linux or Steam Deck the easy way? Well, the community-built version of Proton named <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> (formerly Proton-GE) has a new version out to do just that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As for Fall Guys, it now works without issues. Really, the developer just needs to put things in the right place as they've put up the actual Easy Anti-Cheat file needed that works. Until then though, using GE-Proton is the easiest way to go. For those who love their video guides:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0a9UsXffb3s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6446fe396e2a2844bd1eedbcf14382c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0a9UsXffb3s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you find it doesn't work, check to ensure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed in your Steam Library.</p>
<p>You can buy Fall Guys on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097150/Fall_Guys_Ultimate_Knockout/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher for Epic and GOG on Linux and Steam Deck new Beta available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher is a very simple to use free and open source app to manage and download your Epic Games Store and GOG collections on Linux and Steam Deck. It's great, one of my regular apps on both my desktop and Deck and now it's in the process of getting a clean-up operation with <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.3.0-beta.1" target="_blank">version 2.3.0 Beta 1</a> now available.</p>
<p><em>If you want a stable experience, stick with the current version, as bugs are to be expected.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21473275631650883085gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21473275631650883085gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the changes includes the integration of Winetricks, an improved language selector for games, a fix for special characters on Wine prefix folders, lots of user interface flow improvements, GOG user credentials are no longer stored in plain text (the token generated, not username / password), GOG setup improvements, an option to hide games from your library, auto-update for AppImage and various other bug fixes and small improvements.</p>
<p>Really great to see the continued improvements on such an essential app.</p>

      <title>Discord Overlay for Linux v0.5.1 out with notifications, other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get an easy to use on-screen Discord Overlay for Linux and Steam Deck? <a href="https://trigg.github.io/Discover/" target="_blank">Discover Overlay</a> v0.5.1 is out now. It's incredibly useful when you're in a group gaming session, chatting away and you want an easy to see list of who is in the chat (both voice and text channels supported). Good for video recordings too, for viewers to know who is who.</p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added system notification support</li>
<li>Huge overhaul of connector which hopefully fixes rate limit / temporary API bans</li>
<li>Improved default settings</li>
<li>Gave each module a named logger rather than "Root"</li>
<li>Fixed Autostart on boot</li>
<li>Prevent multiple Flatpak instances</li>
<li>Fix HiDPI floating window placement</li>
<li>Other but fixes!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Using it on Linux is wonderfully simple, and it works quite well on the Steam Deck too. You can check out a quick test I did previously on the Steam Deck below:</p>

      <title>Turbo Overkill should see full Linux and Steam Deck support for the 1.0 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turbo Overkill, a brand new Blade Runner-meets-DOOM hellscape FPS from Trigger Happy Interactive and Apogee Entertainment is out in Early Access. It looks quite awesome, and the press email came to me directly so I decided to ask the all important questions.</p>
<p>In reply to my questioning on any plans to support it on Linux and the Steam Deck, the official reply that came back was: "We are targeting 1.0 release for both optimized Steam Deck support and native Linux support." — so there you have it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ht0fbsgtw_4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c9b6a11f80a5d64e034fc4e0d46f2db7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ht0fbsgtw_4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by genre giants like Quake II, Titanfall, and BioShock, Turbo Overkill marries hyperspeed, pixel-perfect gunplay with the freedom to try different playstyles. Outrun and outgun with frenzied stunts like wall-running, grapple-swinging, and car-surfing. Upgrade the arm rockets for devastating close-range volleys. Reap aggressive rewards with chainsaw leg mods that increase mobility or restore health with kills.</p>
<p>"To this day, the classic shooters I grew up on are still masterclasses in tight, focused design," said Sam Prebble, one-half of Trigger Happy Interactive. "Turbo Overkill kneels at the altar of the greats, but I admire how modern games give us more ways to express ourselves. I can’t wait to see how players and their badass creativity blow my levels wide open."</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1328350/Turbo_Overkill/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>dbrand made a slick &#39;Teardown&#39; skin for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the days where you could buy tech with clear casing? I loved my Game Boy Pocket that had it, and now you can sort-of get there thanks to dbrand with their <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/teardown?category=skin&amp;device=steam-deck#buy" target="_blank">Teardown skin</a> for the Steam Deck. This doesn't show up in their normal skin selector for the Steam Deck, as it's a special edition.</p>
<p>It might not be see-through casing but it's close enough, and dbrand jokingly said on <a href="https://twitter.com/dbrand/status/1516204410787053576" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that "Steam Decks died for this.". I must admit, it really does look cool and dbrand skins are high-quality too so you can't really go wrong with them.</p>

      <title>See what&#39;s eating up drive space on the Steam Deck with Filelight</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a <em>quick</em> tip for you on the Steam Deck: how to find out where all that drive space is going with a sweet program called Filelight. This will work great on Linux desktops too, since it's just a KDE application.</p>
<p>Available as a Flatpak package, you can easily install it from Flathub. On the Steam Deck (or a Linux desktop running Plasma), you can load up the Discover store and look for Filelight. You can also use Flatseal to allow access to other parts of your system, like an SD Card.</p>
<p>Filelight gives you quite a rather gorgeous and simple way to look through your storage, and find something perhaps you've left laying around that was forgotten. You can click inside each folder, and keep going deep until you see exactly where that space has gone.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Po0WxJ1BWXo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b86ef0ef5576c9caeb92fad99b6efca4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Po0WxJ1BWXo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><u>Note</u>: if you don't see it listed, you may need to add the Flathub Beta Remote using this command in terminal (Steam Deck has it by default):</p>
<p><code>flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo</code></p>
<p>For normal Linux desktops (not the Steam Deck), it's also usually available in your standard software repositories. Use whatever packing system you prefer.</p>

      <title>Terraformers, a relaxed game about turning the Red Planet green, out now</title>
      <author>Philadelphus</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released into early access on April 21 (on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244800/Terraformers/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/terraformers" target="_blank">GOG</a>), <a href="https://goblinzstudio.com/game/terraformers/" target="_blank">Terraformers</a> is a game about growing and developing a network of cities on Mars, with the eventual goal of (what else) terraforming it. </p>
<p>Gameplay takes place over a number of turns (each representing one Martian year), and involves both the surface of Mars and a zoomed-in look at the individual cities you place, which have spots to place up to fifteen buildings. Areas on the planet are represented by a web of connected nodes, which you explore throughout the game. This allows you to find resources, either one-time boosts, or sources that can be mined to provide a continuous production. Each turn, you get to pick from a number of projects which you can spend your acquired resources on. These projects can be buildings, which can be built either in cities or on the Martian surface depending on the building, or space projects which require trade routes to provide the necessary resources but can provide some powerful rewards in turn. Trade routes can also be used to trade with Earth, allowing you to export some resource you might have too much of at the moment for something you critically need.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M-8kcB-Qsa0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/076047ffe9173faf01884dcb8fc9d0e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M-8kcB-Qsa0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Every ten turns, you get to choose a new leader, which will provide some unique bonus actions you can use. Every leader can explore a region on the planet, but they can also do things like clear rocks blocking building sites in cities for free, give you free buildings, provide resources like power or food, and other things which can be quite helpful. Each leader also comes with a “specialization,” a bonus which continues in effect even after that leader has retired (so that you accrue more of them as the game goes on); this might be things like decreasing the cost of building mines, or giving you a bonus production of +1 titanium for every two titanium production you set up. Leaders come from a wide pool of cultures around the globe, which I thought was a nice touch and provides a bit of visual character. (Some leaders you can encounter later in the game are even said to be the descendants of earlier leaders you might have chosen, providing a reminder of the time scale over which the game takes place.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15821174431650776417gol4404.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15821174431650776417gol4404.jpg"/></a><small>Here you can see the planet's surface, with three cities and their networks of controlled regions.</small></p>
<p>Along the way, you need to keep the “support” of your Martian populace up, or face public sentiment turning against you and losing the game if it reaches zero. Certain buildings provide bonuses to support, and exploring new and exciting places often gives one-time boosts, but over time the population starts to have higher expectations, represented by increasingly larger drops in support happening periodically over time. A typical game for me starts off with support being positive and banking a large store of it, then a long mid-section where it’s negative and I need to keep it up by exploration and having enough stored, then finally an end-game where it becomes positive again as terraforming starts to take hold and conditions outside the cities become more tolerable. (I’ve never personally lost a game to losing support, but I've heard of it and could see it happening if you don’t prioritize it enough!)</p>
<p>As you develop your colony, you'll start getting projects to terraform the planet. There are four parameters: atmosphere, heat, oxygen, and oceans, and different buildings provide various bonuses. You can breach aquifers to provide a one-time boost to ocean progress (instead of using them to supply water over time), and there are space projects that can provide large boosts to various parameters as well. Eventually, you'll be able to start introducing life; Mars's surface is broken into a number of “climate zones,“ with each zone able to hold one type of bacteria, plant, and animal. These have different requirements (penguins can obviously handle colder temperatures than elephants!), and provide different bonuses: Methanogenium bacteria increase temperature, for instance, Tundra Forests provide oxygen and atmosphere, and animals can keep your people happy and supportive. I'm still learning how the system works, but it's nice to watch the surface of Mars slowly turn green as oceans spread across the dry and dusty plains.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6846839511650776419gol4404.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6846839511650776419gol4404.jpg"/></a><small>This is the city interface screen, where you can place buildings. Quite a few have adjacency bonuses, making efficient cities an interesting puzzle.</small></p>
<p>If all this sounds interesting, you can actually play a free, standalone prologue on Steam called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1557040/Terraformers_First_Steps_on_Mars/" target="_blank">Terraformers: First Steps on Mars</a> which was released last October (see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/colonize-the-red-planet-in-terraformers-first-steps-on-mars-a-free-prologue-out-now/" target="_blank">this previous article</a>). It’s not the same as the full game, as the developers have iterated on it since then and changed several features (for the better), but it gives a good indication of what the game is like. The prologue is limited to 30 turns, but in the full game you have no turn limit and the challenge is simply in being more efficient and completing the goals of the various scenarios in as few turns as possible. Speaking of which, there are a number of scenarios at the moment with goals like “get this many victory points” (calculated from a variety of things), “produce this much of these specific resources,” or “fully terraform the planet.” While there’s currently no free-play option, the developers released a <a href="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/clans/38311261/117f8edcaa7f2e74ef096f8de079c4b5d9aaebc2.png" target="_blank">roadmap</a> upon the game releasing into early-access and that’s one of the first few goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11980279381650776420gol4404.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11980279381650776420gol4404.jpg"/></a>Some of the projects you get to choose from each turn. (Normally you start with just three choices; in this screenshot I've built some buildings that increase the number available, and this is actually the largest I've ever seen.)</p>
<p>Terraformers plays fine on Linux, and has had a native version from the first day the prologue came out (and even before that when it was a Steam Next Fest demo). On release, Terraformers had a critical bug on Linux that prevented progress past the first turn, but after a few people reported it on the game’s Discord server the developers were very responsive and fixed it the next day. (In the meantime, it worked flawlessly on Proton.) Other than that I’ve never encountered a crash or major bug in my nine hours in the prologue or the eight hours I’ve played of the full game so far, so I have no reservations recommending it.</p>
<p>Overall I quite enjoy Terraformers; it’s a relaxing game with a great art style and no time pressure, which allows you to challenge yourself to beat your previous best. (It has a bit of a “board game” feel to it, if that makes sense.) If there's one thing I'm not entirely sold on it's that there's definitely a large element of randomness to the game. The map is randomly generated each time, so sometimes you might find yourself searching for a while to find more minable nodes of a particular resource or good locations for cities (which can only be built on certain nodes on the planet's surface). Generally, however, it averages out of the course of a game (typically ~50 turns or so in my experience with the scenarios so far), and trade routes do a good job of letting you mitigate resource shortages. This is the fourth game about terraforming Mars in my Steam library, and I expect it’ll be one I return to for a long time to come, especially as the developers continue to add more to it.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.7 is out with more PE conversion work and theme additions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). A new biweekly development release is out now with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.7" target="_blank">Wine 7.7</a>.</p>
<p>It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and enables a ton of games to work on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Here's what they listed as the highlights in Wine 7.7:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More progress on the PE conversion of the X11 and OSS drivers.</li>
<li>Support for UTF-8 as default Ansi codepage.</li>
<li>Theming support for control panel applets.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's sometimes asked: the continued conversion of various modules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> is another change that will gradually increase compatibility in many ways over time for certain expected behaviour needed by Windows applications. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use PE instead.</p>
<p>They only noted 11 bugs were found to be solved as of this release including issues with Anno 1602 / 1602 A.D., Steam and other miscellaneous issues.</p>

      <title>Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a sprawling FOSS apocalypse roguelike</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA" target="_blank">Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead</a>, CDDA for short, is a free and open source apocalypse-themed roguelike that is incredibly deep and a ton of fun to play. If you haven't heard of it, think of a turn-based Project Zomboid, but in addition to zombies, CDDA features alien fungi, eldritch horrors, giant skeletons, and dozens of other monsters eager to add you to the billions of victims of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>The core gameplay loop will be familiar to fans of Zomboid: you start with little equipment or knowledge, but as you gain experience and find or craft equipment and build a base an you can eke out a life on the fringes of the apocalypse. While the base game is ASCII, releases also includes several tilesets - I am using one of the included tilesets, Ultica.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10352092901650652460gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10352092901650652460gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here I am a few moments after one of my first forays into the world of CDDA. I have spawned inside a FEMA evacuation shelter, and while checking the lockers for supplies I hear some terrible noises outside a window, indicated by the yellow icons. Stupidly, I draw back the curtains to take a look, and an undead horde smashes the windows and spills into the shelter, quickly chasing me down and ending my pitifully short life. Welcome to the apocalypse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6540314401650652459gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6540314401650652459gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>While the game <em>is</em> unforgiving, after a few tries (and some better luck with your spawn) you can become an absolute zombie terminator. On my current save I have fared considerably better. I march through the streets clad in heavy SWAT Kevlar and a Guy Fawkes mask, swinging my fire axe to cleave through hordes of zombies while occasionally popping batteries into  my mp3 player (the music helps me stay calm). Exploring an eerily quiet town a week after the apocalypse I came across a swimming pool filled with webbed zombies that had evolved to live in the water along with a terrifying half-crocodile half-zombie. After spotting me through the glass walls of the pool, the horde smashed the glass and rushed across the street to show me their bathing suits. It took me two days to drag all the corpses into a pit and burn them, and I now have a delightful collection of swimwear.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10874849231650652459gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10874849231650652459gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>The best example of the complexity of CDDA is its crafting system. There are hundreds of recipes, and navigating them all and understanding how to craft them is made simple through a powerful crafting interface. You can search through the recipes you know with a search engine that accepts wild cards and allows searching based on ingredients, proficiency required to craft, the characteristics of the crafted item, and more. I have never seen such a powerful or enjoyable crafting system, and it may be the single greatest feat of the game. I know this looks complicated (and it is) but if you spend a bit of time with it you'll recognize how well designed it is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14278263801650654330gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14278263801650654330gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>In addition to the more immediate physical threats of the apocalypse, your survivor is faced with battling starvation, dehydration, extreme temperatures, exhaustion, illness, addiction, and even depression. You can break your leg falling off a roof, go deaf from firing a rifle indoors, and be blinded by goo.</p>
<p>As time passes, the environment around you changes. Monsters evolve into more terrifying monsters. Like Project Zomboid, this is not a game with a happy ending for your character. Two weeks into the apocalypse, having chopped up most of the undead population of a small town, I was faced with a new problem: giant bugs, presumably attracted by the rotting corpses I had left in the street. Investigating a basement in one house with a flashlight I am met with a horrifying sight (and stench): a giant nest of cockroaches, mutated giant bugs, and their droppings covering the floor. You can see me on the staircase to the right.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8694143831650652458gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8694143831650652458gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>I dash back up the stairs but am pursued by the larger bugs, one of which slashes open my leg. A pitched battle ensues, and I limp home with the resolution to leave the basement bugs in peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14155096701650652457gol1142.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14155096701650652457gol1142.png"/></a></p>
<p>CDDA also features a bizarre cast of NPCs that try to survive the apocalypse along with you. One man I met was convinced that government corruption had something to do with the apocalypse, and implored me to find files in a nearby Federal building that would prove him right. I politely told him I would look into it. Another man asked me to find an American flag for him; his concern, presumably, was that the apocalypse had led to flagging (sorry) patriotism. One woman I met was convinced that the Cataclysm was connected with the songs she could hear emanating from animal bones. Some of these NPCs can be convinced to join you, after which they can guard you, be set to work at your base, teach you skills or perform first aid on you, and countless other options. Not all NPCs are so helpful, though, and the potential for violence is never far from your interactions with strangers.</p>
<p>There are also vehicles that you can build, find, hotwire, modify, and operate. And by 'vehicles' I mean everything from a canoe to a helicopter. There are giant swords and medieval armours. There are wild beagles. There are nuclear weapons. Despite having 40 or so hours in the game, I feel that I know next to nothing about it or what is possible. And that's a great feeling.</p>

      <title>Lumencraft hits 20,000 copies in the first week, roadmap detailed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lumencraft, a recent Early Access release from 2Dynamic Games that offers up Native Linux support powered by Godot Engine seems to have been a hit.</p>
<p>Blending together a top-down shooter with tower defense strategy elements, and mining through every wall you possibly can to get resources, it's quite something. I got fully sucked into blasting through it on release day and can't wait to see all the extras they plan to add in.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1713810/view/3175610095142586911" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, they announced the 20,000 milestone for the first 7 days. Given how many games are releasing all the time, it's still a nice achievement considering this is an in-development title.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ldgf-iLMxxY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/493d922b67e640f1d193323e211786bc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ldgf-iLMxxY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what's to come for the game, they've now also put up a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1713810/view/3175610095142969333" target="_blank">roadmap</a> and it sounds pretty exciting including: new maps, new terrain textures, a better user interface, hero classes, robot helper pets, more enemies and weapons, dynamic water and eventually at the full release there will also be a story campaign to play through.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/lumencraft?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713810/Lumencraft/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Underwater chaos expands with the Barotrauma &#39;Urban Expanses&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to find out what it's like to travel in a submarine on another planet? Barotrauma gives you that option and it can be total chaos. It's a 2D co-op survival horror inspired by the likes of FTL, RimWorld, Space Station 13 and others like that. With silly ragdoll physics, and plenty of strange creatures waiting for you.</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access, it just received a nice big update named Urban Expanses. This adds in a new creatur called The Latcher, which you can encounter earlier than their two previous abyss monsters, so there can be a little frantic fun earlier in the game now. Modding should now be easier to both use and create, a new money system that's a bit more flexible giving players personal wallets and a crew bank and a huge overhaul to the big colony outposts to "make them look and feel like real cities".</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Despot&#39;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder adds gamepad support, works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despot's Game: Dystopian Army Builder is a rogue-like tactics army battler that I was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/uh-oh-looks-like-despots-game-dystopian-army-builder-is-going-to-suck-all-my-time-away/" target="_blank">absolutely in love with</a> when it first entered Early Access and now on the Steam Deck I love it all over again.</p>
<p>You build up a little army of fleshy people and equip them with all sorts of weird combinations like: a bow and arrow, a sword stuck in stone, a rabbit in a hat, a stale pretzel, an American football and the list of weird weapons goes on and on. When ready, you run through dungeons room by room and face off against various robotic creations (and other horrors) while your people auto-battle. It's thoroughly odd but really engrossing to play through.</p>
<p>It's closing in on the 1.0 release, and a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1227280/view/3220645457117599668" target="_blank">update</a> rolled out recently which amongst other things, added in controller / gamepad support. Naturally, I took it for a spin on the Steam Deck and apart from some tutorial quirks, it feels really <em>great</em> to play on it. Can easily see this getting a Deck Verified rating once it's more polished.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to become the overlord of others in Stellaris? You're going to get your chance when Stellaris: Overlord releases officially on May 12, 2022.</p>
<p>This is a full expansion too, not just some little pack. Not only that but the latest free update version 3.4 "Cepheus" is launching at the same time. This free update will bring plenty of new content and improvements for all players worked on by their "Custodian Team".</p>
<p>Here's what the new expansion will give you:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rulers Make the Rules</strong>: New vassalization mechanics let you define the role of your new subjects - create new Specialist Empires to grow into economic superpowers, military specialists, and technological creators. Negotiate or demand contracts and agreements between your vassals to define the future of dozens of worlds, and reap the benefits!</li>
<li><strong>The Brightest Star Must Guide Them</strong>: Seek out and unite scattered empires across the stars! As you explore the vast galaxy you’ll encounter more unique enclaves of people, from mysterious shroudwalkers to militaristic mercenaries and crafty salvagers. Will you forge a mutually beneficial relationship and earn their unique services, or will they submit to your rule by force?</li>
<li><strong>Five New Origins to Lord Over</strong>:<br/>
	 - Imperial Fiefdom - You may be just a Specialist Empire now, but some day, the galaxy may need a new ruler… don’t leave any doubt that it will be you.<br/>
	 - Slingshot to the Stars - The ruined remains of a Quantum Catapult have been discovered near your homeworld - what secrets might it unlock if your people are clever enough to bring it back online?<br/>
	 - Subterranean - Your species adapted to life underground, excelling in mining and archaeology. Now it’s time to see what awaits you far, far above the surface.<br/>
	 - Teachers of the Shroud - Developing in contact with the curious psions known as the Shroudwalkers, your empire has learned a thing or two about expanding their minds!<br/>
	 - Progenitor Hive - Under your leadership, this hivemind empire can achieve more than ever before… but without your guidance, the hive will fall to ruin!</li>
<li><strong>Engineer the Future and Showcase Your Power</strong>: New feats of technology will give your empire the edge it needs to become the dominant force across the galaxy.<br/>
	 - Orbital Rings will elevate your influence (and defense) in grand displays of power  from your planets further into space.<br/>
	 - Hyper Relays will give your fleets the ability to enforce your will across the stars faster than ever before.<br/>
	 - Quantum Catapults enable new ways to react quicker in the galaxy while projecting your might - but it’s a daring one-way trip for your fleet!</li>
<li><strong>Four</strong> new music tracks to inspire your rise to greatness.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Lutris now has a Flatpak Beta available and updated for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's not quite ready just yet to be a one-click install, the game manager Lutris is at least now available with various improvements as a Flatpak Beta.</p>
<p>The what: the point of Lutris is to bring together many different launchers (Steam, Epic Games, Origin, GOG, Ubisoft), along with support for running games through Wine and Emulation too.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, the Flatpak means you no longer have to mess around with disabling the read-only filesystem. However, it still needs an extra couple steps to make sure it's installed and able to run correctly. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load up Discover and search for "Lutris", then install it.</li>
<li>Run this command in terminal (Konsole):<br/>
<code class="inline-code">flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Platform.Compat.i386 org.freedesktop.Platform.GL32.default org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default</code><br/>
<em>Which is needed otherwise Lutris throws up an error at you. Use CTRL+SHIFT+V to paste into Konsole with a keyboard.</em></li>
<li>That command will ask a few options, for each one just select the last in the list (the latest). Example:<br/>
<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3371872161650628847gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3371872161650628847gol1.jpg"/></a></li>
</ol>
<p>After that, you will have a working Lutris install on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Once it's out properly (which should hopefully be soon), this should end up being just a one-click install like other Flatpak packages in the Discover app.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12776619591650629355gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12776619591650629355gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>Rocket Bot Royale is like a Worms styled Battle Royale with jumping tanks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rocket Bot Royale is a brand new release from developer Winterpixel Games that seems to be what you get if you took Worms, turned it into a Battle Royale and turned everyone into a tank.</p>
<p>It's ridiculously frantic. With both solo and group play, everyone starts off in the helicopter that flies into that map and then just like other BR games, you get to pick where you pop out. Quite hilarious actually and really fast-paced, so games don't last particularly long so it's a great coffee-break game too. Your tanks can climb up walls, rocket-jump and more. It's last tank standing, with a map that gradually gets smaller due to rising water levels.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="E69G82ovrqY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8cfaf503addfc473b5749341face8171.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/E69G82ovrqY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even better — it's free to play. There are some micro-transactions but so far it hasn't put them in my face or bothered me at all. I'm not a fan of how you can use coins (which you earn as you play) to power up before a match, which feels a little unfair but I've still managed to take down plenty of others without touching any extras. People who spend real money can get an advantage that way, but since you earn in-game anyway (and reasonably quickly too), it's not the worst I've seen.</p>
<p>The key point is that the game is a lot of fun and worth a look.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748390/Rocket_Bot_Royale/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and works <em>great</em> on a Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Overgrowth from Wolfire Games goes open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just like they did with some earlier games, Wolfire Games have now open sourced the game code for Overgrowth. What is it? Overgrowth is a 3D martial arts action-adventure featuring giant rabbits — jump, kick, throw, and slash your way to victory.</p>
<p>You will still need to own a copy of the game, as the open source release does not include the data files, which is a great way for developers to support the open source community (and enable their game to live on forever pretty much) while also continue to earn from it easily.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uOdjo_Do6hM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67f2fc58d7899a9895201f06ad7d618a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uOdjo_Do6hM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/WolfireGames/overgrowth" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The upcoming Steam Deck Dock got an upgrade, now called a &#39;Docking Station&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At some point, Valve quietly tweaked the specifications for the upcoming official Steam Deck Dock and it's actually better than what they said originally. We still don't even know exactly when it will be out, and they likely want to improve the overall docked experience first as there's quite a few quirks (especially in desktop mode).</p>
<p>Originally, the Steam Deck Dock listed it had 1 x USB-A 3.1 Port and 2 x USB-A 2.0 Ports along with Ethernet. Now though, it states it has 3 x USB-A 3.1 Ports and Gigabit Ethernet.</p>
<p>Seems this was updated in February, when checking the Wayback Machine it shows the text specifications with the original on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220212200007/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech" target="_blank">February 12</a> but then the <em>text</em> was updated sometime around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220222053526/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech" target="_blank">February 22</a> to note the newer ports. Later around <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220225193441/https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech" target="_blank">February 25</a> the actual <em>image</em> of the Dock was updated to also note it has Gigabit Ethernet too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9448537661650611919gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9448537661650611919gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Seems Valve are also now calling it a "Docking Station", which was noted around February 22 too.</p>
<p>At least for now, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B099F6R6TC/" target="_blank">this USB-C Hub</a> has been working well enough for me, as noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">in my original review</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-2 out now with many more games playable on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now officially released the latest version of Proton, the Steam Play compatibility tool that allows Windows games to run on the Steam Deck and Linux desktops. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog#70-2" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-2</a> is the new main stable version, not to be confused with Proton Experimental that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/proton-experimental-updated-fixes-resident-evil-revelations-2-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">also updated recently</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the games that are newly playable with Proton:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Atelier Ayesha</li>
<li>Devil May Cry HD Collection</li>
<li>Dragon Quest Builders 2</li>
<li>A Way Out</li>
<li>Fall in Labyrinth</li>
<li>King of Fighters XIII</li>
<li>Montaro</li>
<li>ATRI -My Dear Moments-</li>
<li>Guilty Gear Isuka</li>
<li>INVERSUS Deluxe</li>
<li>Metal Slug 2 and 3 and X</li>
<li>One Shot and One Shot: Fading Memory</li>
<li>Call of Duty Black Ops 3</li>
<li>Saint Seiya: Soldiers' Soul</li>
<li>Medieval Dynasty</li>
<li>Bright Memory: Infinite</li>
<li>Double Dragon Trilogy</li>
<li>Baseball Stars 2</li>
<li>Elden Ring</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely loads of bug fixes too like Unity games crashing on launch with certain peripherals connected (e.g. Logitech's Unifying Receiver), which is something <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/unity-games-crashing-with-proton-on-linux-or-steam-deck-check-your-usb-devices/" target="_blank">I helped to discover</a>.</p>
<p>Video playback is a big ongoing issue as lots of games use patent encumbered video codecs but work continues to get more supported with these now having working videos: Atelier Meruru, Cook-out, DJMAX RESPECT V, Gloomhaven, Haven, Rust, Rustler, The Complex, TOHU, Monster Train, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, Car Mechanic Simulator 2021, Nine Sols Demo.</p>
<p>Many other games had bug fixes like: The Last Campfire not starting on the Steam Deck, DiRT Rally 2 and DiRT 4 not being able to connect to the game server, STAR WARS Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy not displaying anything on the Steam Deck, Assassin's Creed Odyssey displaying an unsupported driver warning in the overlay and more.</p>
<p>On top of all that the Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer DXVK was updated to version <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v1.10.1" target="_blank">1.10.1</a> and VKD3D-Proton to version <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.6" target="_blank">2.6</a>. DXVK-nvapi (an NVAPI implementation on top of DXVK) was updated to version <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.5.3" target="_blank">0.5.3</a>.</p>
<p>Great to see such big updates to Proton but the work never stops, as keeping up with Windows compatibility is something that will need to continue to be updated for a long time. For games that Valve has run through Deck Verified, they pick either the Native Linux version or the version of Proton needed for it to work. For games not yet tested by Valve, it will default to Proton 7 (until a later Proton release becomes the main stable version) but you can set whatever you want and you can see how in <a href="https://youtu.be/f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">our guide video</a>.</p>
<p><em>It will come down as a normal update in Steam like anything else.</em></p>

<p><u><em>Original article below:</em></u></p>
<p>Valve recently put up a new version of Proton Experimental, the compatibility layer that runs Windows games on Linux and the Steam Deck handheld. Proton has a few stable versions like Proton 7 and Proton 6.3 but Experimental brings in changes quicker than need a little more time testing.</p>
<p><em>This new build actually went up on April 18, which I completely missed.</em></p>
<p>Newly playable on Linux (and possibly Steam Deck too) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>One Shot</li>
<li>One Shot: Fading Memory</li>
<li>Age of Chivalry</li>
<li>Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamer Edition</li>
<li>Saviors of Sapphire Wings / Stranger of Sword City Revisited.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes include a fix for Resident Evil Revelations 2 not starting on the Steam Deck, Wine Mono (a replacement for the .NET Framework) was upgraded to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-7.2.0" target="_blank">version 7.2.0</a> and dxvk-nvapi (NVAPI implementation on top of DXVK) to <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.5.4" target="_blank">version 0.5.4</a> for a small bug fix. The changelog can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The gorgeous looking Lila&#39;s Sky Ark is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monolith of Minds and Graffiti Games have today launched Lila's Sky Ark, a feast for the eyes if you love pixel-art. The second game from Monolith of Minds, acting as a prequel to the first game Resolutiion.</p>
<p>"Lila’s psychedelic world is in grave danger. Help her and her eccentric friends stop the Conductor’s minions from destroying all things musical and magical in this meditative action-adventure game. Explore this dark yet groovy world as you unravel the poetic mystery that is Lila’s story. Discover secrets, solve puzzles, and battle bizarre beasts and punishing bosses as you attempt to unite the Spirits and save the mysterious Sky Island from ruin."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0T5QEnMAk_Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ab1ecc86341412f2b0a55e9cd78a87a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0T5QEnMAk_Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore Lila's pyschedlic world and get to know her quirky cast of friends, such as the fantastically bespectacled Doctor-Father-Sir and the raven shopkeepers.</li>
<li>Search this groovy dreamscape for hidden secrets, recipes, and even new glasses for a certain Sir.</li>
<li>Unravel Lila's puzzle-like story, which explores themes such as loss, loneliness, grief, and depression, in this moving prequel to Resolutiion.</li>
<li>Battle music-inspired enemies and punishing bosses using an array of strange weapons unlocked through alchemy recipes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It looks just as peculiar as Resolutiion, and that's a good thing. I really adore this colourful graphical style too, it's very much like Resolutiion but a lot more bright and welcoming looking overall but it sounds like the story goes down some interesting holes.</p>

      <title>Euro Truck Simulator 2 gets a new modern trailer and a fresh Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Software are showing off all the advancements made to Euro Truck Simulator 2 over the years, with a brand new video to showcase it. Plus, there's a new Beta available.</p>
<p>Their last proper trailer was back in 2012, and with how many huge upgrades they've given the game it was of course very much overdue for a proper trailer to show it off. It's not just that though, the game is approaching 10 years old (yes, really!) and so it's a good way to mark the occasion:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5uvwfskYwl0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1d6b6e05eb07732940aff857c4fc81ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5uvwfskYwl0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>They're also teasing something very special for the upcoming 10th anniversary of the trucking sim.</em></p>
<p>On top of that, Euro Truck Simulator 2 version 1.44 is now in <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/04/euro-truck-simulator-2-144-open-beta.html" target="_blank">Open Beta</a> for owners of the game to try out the latest upcoming changes. This new build includes an Austria Rework, Companies Logos Revision, a Mod Refund Feature for those who play the Convoy mode, an Accurate Mileage System for road signs, Unmarked Roads Exploration with advisor notifications, an upgrade to Force Feedback and more. SCS truly showing how much they love their own game to keep pumping out free upgrades like this.</p>
<p>You can buy ETS2 from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/euro-truck-simulator-2?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Framework Laptop Mainboard is out as a standalone platform</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite interesting. Framework Computer, the company that builds the fab modular Framework Laptop has announced the release of the <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/mainboard-availability-and-open-source-release" target="_blank">Framework Laptop Mainboard</a>.</p>
<p>This is available for USA and Canada with a release upcoming for the UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Austria, and Ireland sometime "soon". What's really fun though, is that they say it was designed in a way that you can simply use the mainboard as a standalone single-board computing platform. As they say "All you need to do is insert memory, plug in a USB-C power adapter, and hit the tiny power button on-board, and you’ve got a powered-up computer".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3382870071650555319gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Mainboard" target="_blank">also released</a> the CAD files and electrical documentation under Creative Commons licensing, to encourage people to do whatever they want with it and they also released two 3D printable reference designs to go with it. Going even further, they're opening up a developer program to give away 100 i5-1135G7 Mainboards.</p>
<p>Additionally, they're trying to improve the Linux situation for their hardware too. While it already works quite well, they're going above and beyond what most other traditional vendors do. They've launched a <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/linux" target="_blank">dedicated Linux page</a>, to show off how it works across different distributions and to give more info.</p>
<p>Really liking what they're doing.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For Canonical fans, the latest release of <a href="https://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> is now available with Ubuntu "Jammy Jellyfish" 22.04 LTS (Long-term support). Not only is it a carefully tailored GNOME experience for normal desktops, but this also marks the first LTS for Ubuntu to come with support for the Raspberry Pi 4.</p>
<p>"With Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, the entire recent Raspberry Pi device portfolio is supported for the very first time, from the new Raspberry Pi Zero 2W to the Raspberry Pi 4", said Eben Upton, CEO of Raspberry Pi Trading. "It’s great to see a certified Ubuntu Desktop release that includes support for the 2GB Raspberry Pi 4, giving developers all over the world access to the most affordable development desktop environment."</p>
<p>That's not their only focus of course, the main desktop saw plenty of upgrades with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gnome-42-released-with-the-new-global-dark-style-preference/" target="_blank">GNOME 42</a> (that alone has lots new), ten different accent colours for a little customization, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/linux-kernel-515-released-futex2-work-to-help-linux-gaming-going-into-kernel-516/" target="_blank">Linux Kernel 5.15</a>, OpenSSL 3.0 and a whole lot more. A controversial change, to some, is that Firefox is now only provided in Ubuntu as a snap, that's directly maintained by Mozilla.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17797659471650554212gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17797659471650554212gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Ubuntu 22.04</em></p>
<p>On top of that, they've swapped the desktop icons around to be in the bottom right by default but there's a new Appearance setting to adjust that. You can also change some more settings for the sidebar Dock, plus they said the Dock devices and file manager integration has also been improved.</p>
<p>"Our mission is to be a secure, reliable and consistent open-source platform - everywhere", said Mark Shuttleworth, CEO of Canonical. "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS unlocks innovation for industries with demanding infrastructure security requirements, such as telecommunications and industrial automation, underpinning their digital transformation."</p>

      <title>GOG do a few more upgrades, this time adding 170 game tags</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finding games on <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> seems like it's steadily getting easier, with another update to their store out now.</p>
<p>After suffering losses, GOG continue to try and bring customers back to their store with a few tweaks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gog-update-their-stance-on-drm-free-galaxy-as-optional-for-single-player/" target="_blank">what they will allow</a> on the store and a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gog-attempt-to-bring-customers-back-with-a-revival-of-good-old-games/" target="_blank">revival of Good Old Games</a> — they've been improving how people search for and actually find games. This latest update is a continuation of that.</p>
<p>What they've <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/store_update_170_new_tags_to_help_you_with_more_accurate_catalog_browsing_and_filtering" target="_blank">done now</a> is expand store filtering with 170 new tags for games. The way they've done it seems slightly different to Steam, which bundles tags and genres into the same thing. GOG on the other hand seem to have separated them like <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games/adventure" target="_blank">Adventure</a> having it's own section but <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?tags=point-and-click" target="_blank">Point&amp;Click</a> just being a searchable tag. Game pages will have them, and you will be able to search using these tags now too.</p>
<p>It's not a feature that's going to blow your mind but it's definitely helpful as GOG continues building up a larger selection of games to pick from. As we all know from Steam, discovering what you want to buy is a big issue.</p>
<p>Also, you can get Postal 2 free on <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> for 48 hours. Scroll down the homepage to find the banner.</p>

      <title>2013 classic Proteus gets an update for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proteus, a relaxing casual exploration game from Ed Key and David Kanaga (with porting by Ethan Lee) was recently upgraded for Linux and the Steam Deck due to some graphical problems.</p>
<p>The Windows and macOS versions were untouched, as the Linux version had a "severe performance regression". The cause was an issue with "OpenGL call lists" that affected AMD GPU drivers (NVIDIA was fine). Apart from that a few of the techy bits behind the scenes were updated like MonoKickstart and SDL2, with 32-bit also being dropped from the main game (although available as a "linux32" Beta.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rpkpuoq6y9s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f502dc1a857a658141074043eadc31b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rpkpuoq6y9s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With this update it should now work well on the Steam Deck and Linux desktops / laptops with AMD GPUs. One issues remains though that users with XWayland and a high-DPI mode will see a black screen but you can use "SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland" to get around it for now.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/proteus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/219680/Proteus/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Funny run and gun game Mighty Goose gets a free upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Run and gun like the classics in Mighty Goose, which just got a little bit bigger with a free update out now. See my previous thoughts about the game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/mighty-goose-is-a-furious-over-the-top-honking-good-time-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank">in this article</a>. Seems it's done quite well, with it now having a Very Positive rating on Steam although that's from less than 500 users.</p>
<p>"Waddle back in action as Mighty Goose travels to the aquatic planet Ceto to deal with the Evil Baron. Fight enemies on a surfboard, commandeer a new aquatic assault vehicle, and reunite with companions like Regular Duck and Commander Vark. Square off with the malevolent tyrant in a devilish boss fight and save Planet Ceto."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TWcGcWtGlHM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd72ff55f772ee5510e5f5e1d583ce60.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TWcGcWtGlHM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the initial release issues with the game were thankfully solved, like the most annoying being enemy projectile colour being the same as yours. Since then though, the developer has made them render above yours and they colour-cycle, so it's much clearer. It was a huge amount of fun to play but now it's much better.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299360/Mighty_Goose/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Mighty Goose on Steam</a>. Honk.</p>

Otherwise, they’ll have to wait for the next train - and be frustrated, nobody likes to miss the train.     </li>
<li>New tracks - Click and drag to create tracks that connect your stations. Tracks will be elevated allowing your rovers and drones to pass underneath together with power cables, while pipes can cross over them.     </li>
<li>Same train, different cargo - Traveling on the red planet has never been safer (and efficient!). Trains will have 2 wagons to transport colonists and resources at the same time. Don't worry: they'll travel on the same track with no risk of collision. Build your trains in the stations, assign them to the connected tracks and watch them go.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Wobbly Life looks like pure silly joy and it added Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wobbly Life, an open world physics based sandbox that looks like a lot of fun recently had a huge update and with it comes Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>There's not exactly much of a point to this one, it's very much a game where you decide what you're going to do with friends. A good one to have a laugh with and it seems quite popular too, with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over five thousand users. It already worked quite well on Linux with Proton but now it should be a nicer experience directly on a Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Introversion classic Darwinia gets remastered with better Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Darwinia was originally released back in 2005, and now Introversion Software has done a massive remaster.</p>
<p>What is it? Darwinia combines together fast-paced action with strategic battle planning. It features a novel and intuitive control mechanism, a graphical style ripped from 80's retro classics like Tron and Defender, and a story concerning a tribe of nomadic sprites trapped in a modern 3D world.</p>
<p>"Fully re-mastered in 2022 to celebrate the Darwinian's 10000 anniversary this updated version brings an undisputed indie classic bang up to date. Running seamlessly on all modern systems, the game hasn't aged a day and is a fresh and relevant now as it was when it first dropped. Winning 3 out of 5 prizes at the IGF including the Seamous McNally Grand prize for Best Independent Video Game and multiple editors' choice awards, now is the time to play one of the most critically acclaimed indie games of all time."</p>
<p>The developers have rewritten the graphics engine and it now supports OpenGL 3.3 core, Direct3D 11, Metal, or Vulkan thanks to <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle/+/main/README.md" target="_blank">ANGLE</a>. Other big changes includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All the in-game UI now scales more appropriately with the size and DPI of the monitor it's running on</li>
<li>Support for anti-aliasing modes including MSAA, SSAA, SMAA, and FXAA</li>
<li>Support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 1.0 (FSR)</li>
<li>Support for anisotropic texture filtering</li>
<li>Higher fidelity colors and tonemapping</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Some other pretty big additions like Cloud Saves and Dynamic Cloud Sync, on-screen keyboard support and good defaults for the Steam Deck are all in. Various performance improvements plus lots of bug fixes to input handling, graphics, AI and so on too.</p>
<p>You can also see the team have a long chat about it below:</p>

      <title>Erik Wolpaw to Valve on Portal 3 — &#39;we should just do it&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Erik Wolpaw, a writer on the likes of Half-Life 2, Portal, Portal 2, Half-Life: Alyx and more thinks Valve really should just go ahead and make Portal 3 already.</p>
<p>Wolpaw recently spoke on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzkVD94yAmA" target="_blank">KIWI TALKZ podcast</a> on various topics, and had some pretty firm words to give to Valve on getting moving making games again. Some of what Wolpaw said during it included: "I would love to work on Portal 3 in a second, but I can't do it unfortunately by myself. <small>[…]</small> The problem is with 300 employees and I don't know exactly the breakdown, like how many of them are on the production side versus Steam business side versus legal versus whatever, there's a lot of opportunity cost taking 75 people and trying to get a game made.". The conversation goes on to point out employees are always doing something, so they would be pulled from something else of course.</p>
<p>In the end, Wolpaw mentions "We gotta start Portal 3, that's my message to whoever, anything you can do let's just do it, let's just make it happen. I am not getting any younger, we are reaching the point where it's crazy to think literally gonna be too old to work on Portal 3. So we should just do it and Desk Job is fun, if you liked Desk Job send mail to Gabe and tell him you want some Portal 3.".</p>

      <title>Game manager Lutris continues Flatpak improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's not quite ready yet, proper support for Flatpak is coming for <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> which will make it work easily on the Steam Deck and a <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.10.1" target="_blank">new update</a> is out now.</p>
<p>For those who haven't used it: Lutris is an app that allows you to have one place to launch all your games from on Linux. This includes Steam, GOG, Origin, Ubisoft, Emulators and more. Regardless of them being Native Linux titles, Windows games run through Wine and more.</p>
<p>Version 0.5.10.1 is a smaller update than usual, as this is mainly fixing up issues from the previous release while also improving Flatpak support. Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Check for Steam executable in home folder for Flatpak</li>
<li>Adjust the Steam, application and desktop shortcuts to launch with<br/>
	Flatpak when necessary</li>
<li>Disable local (XDG) service in Flatpak</li>
<li>Simplify MangoHUD option (now an On/Off toggle)</li>
<li>Remove ability for Lutris to quit Steam</li>
<li>Don't default to fsync on older kernels</li>
<li>Default to a base resolution when Lutris is unable to read the current<br/>
	configuration</li>
<li>Fix issue with .NET 4.8 installation which affects the FF XIV launcher</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Steam Deck Client Update out, plus Valve dev clarifies a tweak for Gaming Mode (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of official Steam Deck news to cover this morning, as there's a new small Steam Deck Client Update out plus we now know what special performance tweak is done in Gaming Mode compared with Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>For the Client <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3220645457134651321" target="_blank">update</a>, here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Great on Deck carousels to the Recommended tab of Deck Home</li>
<li>Added deadzone visualizer to the Controller Configurator</li>
<li>Fixed focus issues when entering the Library, and when going into and out of Collections</li>
<li>Further performance improvements for users with very large Steam accounts</li>
<li>Fixed focus display issue with selecting friends in the Invite Friends to Game dialog after entering in some text to filter the list</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, for a while we've known there's some difference in expected performance between Gaming Mode and Desktop Mode. I tried to get clarification on what exactly the difference was two weeks ago but Valve didn't reply. Now though, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais decided to explain it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1516286672073228291" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" dir="auto" id="id__bcxn1fxxa7n" lang="en">There's no difference in actual available CPU resources between game mode and desktop mode, but game mode has a tweak to expose the CPU as 8c/8t instead of 4c/8t. This lets several games pick 6 or 8 threads instead of 4, yielding big gains from SMT scaling.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like an interesting way to get a little more juice.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: an additional Steam Deck fix was <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220645457137629092" target="_blank">released</a> later noting it "Fixed Home screen loading issue when in offline mode".</p>

      <title>Looks like the Steam Deck will get Refresh Rate Switching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continue to cook up plans for more exciting upgrades to the Steam Deck, with Refresh Rate Switching looking like it's on the way. Not ready quite yet with work to do but the idea is great.</p>
<p>In response to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZImJANp_-k" target="_blank">video</a> from YouTuber The Phawx who made it work on Windows, Valve developer said <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1516140319443619842" target="_blank">this</a> on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've been really excited to bring refresh rate switching to Deck to deliver smooth frame pacing in arbitrary FPS limit scenarios, but the current screen blanking time when switching is a bit much. We've been doing work behind the scenes to improve it, coming soon!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having the ability to force the Steam Deck screen to a specific refresh rate is going to come with plenty of benefits for so many games that can't hit 60FPS on the Steam Deck. Really, for battery life anyway, you will <em>want</em> to run lower than that a lot of the time for tons of games.</p>
<p>The point isn't <em>just</em> battery life of course, which is a big concern, but how smooth games look and feel overall and being able to lock the panel a bit lower could make all the difference. Looking forward to seeing what Valve come up with, and it will likely be as easy as flicking a switch like the current FPS limiter on Deck.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck just keeps on getting better!</p>

      <title>Steam Deck was the Steam top seller for the week ending April 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more supporting evidence towards the Steam Deck being a nice success for Valve, with <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1515708930344824836" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> reporting that the Steam Deck was the #1 top seller last week.</p>
<p>Their list goes by revenue, so it's not a huge surprise considering the price of the Steam Deck, however it's going up against the likes of Elden Ring which has sold over ten million copies (and lots of those were on PC), as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23027375/steam-deck-sales-numbers-figures-best-selling" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reported. Not only that though, it's <em>also</em> fighting the Valve Index, which is in the top 10 for last week as well and costs quite a bit more — so it really is a show of early strength for Valve's newest hardware.</p>
<p>Maybe 2022 really is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/2022-is-officially-the-year-of-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">officially the Year of Linux Gaming</a>. The key point of that though (that some across the net missed from my take), is that it doesn't mean it's going to suddenly take over, it just means it's at a stage where it really is good.</p>
<p>I also did a quick-take video on how it's doing across the weekend in case you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WM_aKwJNErw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99cd998e6d9943168ed7e5eacdf72ec7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WM_aKwJNErw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's another mildly amusing point I saw come up recently like "Am I the only one hoping that Valve releases a more TV-centric version of the Steam Deck?" on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/am-i-the-only-one-hoping-that-valve-releases-a-more-tv-centric-version-of-the-steam-deck.572332/" target="_blank">Resetera</a> that I saw pop up on Twitter. People sure do forget quickly huh? That <em>was</em> the Steam Machines. However, the Steam Deck clearly has a market waiting for it but I bring this up for another reason — Valve has solved so many of the problems that plagued the Steam Machines that caused their failure.</p>
<p>Especially with the newer Deck interface, Proton, how far Steam has come as a platform with many more features and the list of improvements just goes on. If in a few years they made another attempt, it might not go as badly as some think. What do you think though? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Wine manager app Bottles adds a new Library mode, vkBasalt support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bottles continues to mature as a way to manage installing applications and games with the compatibility layer Wine. A fresh release is out now showing off some UI improvements and new features.</p>
<p>Version 2022.4.14 adds in a new loading screen, as the startup can take a few seconds so it's just a nice bit of initial polishing for the user experience. Another experimental feature also made its way in with the new Library Mode view. The idea with this Library, is to pull together your various programs into one place for easy launching:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12631820391650294561gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12631820391650294561gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Giving you a one-click start and stop, along with letting you know which Bottle it was installed inside. Sounds like it's going to be quite useful. The option to kill all running processes was also moved, and given a warning to prevent users doing it accidentally.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18932681741650294805gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18932681741650294805gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Another fun addition is support for <a href="https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt" target="_blank">vkBasalt</a> (if you have it installed), a Vulkan post-processing layer that can run shaders from Reshade and it has a few options built-in like Contrast Adaptive Sharpening, Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing, Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing, Denoised Luma Sharpening and a 3D colour LookUp Table.</p>
<p>Bottles has quickly become my go-to way for installing things with Wine.</p>

      <title>box86 and box64 get Steam Play Proton working much better on Arm devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you planning to do some gaming on Arm devices? You need to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86" target="_blank">box86</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64" target="_blank">box64</a> projects, which are really quite impressive. Since the majority of software (especially games) are built for x86 processors (the usual Intel / AMD crop), Arm needs something stuck in between to get them running and that's exactly what these projects do.</p>
<p>Split across 32bit and 64bit, box86 and box64 both recently had major updates and a fun highlight on both is that the developer noted they have plenty of fixes and improvements to get both Steam and Steam Play Proton working — so Linux gaming on Arm is about to see a nice boost with these.</p>
<p>It's a good way to try out some more gaming on devices like the Raspberry Pi, or other popular tiny computing systems.</p>
<p>Many other improvements came along, see the release notes on both:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/releases/tag/v0.2.6" target="_blank">box86</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box64/releases/tag/v0.1.8" target="_blank">box64</a></li>
</ul>
<p>At some point soon, I'm definitely going to need to see how well it runs on my own RPi4. Sounds like it's getting quite exciting!</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive goes Multicellular in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Multicellular evolution has begun, for the open source game Thrive that is. Currently in Early Access, it continues to show off an impressive design.</p>
<p>With version 0.5.8 the first big addition is a prototype of the Multicellular Stage. For this, once you've gained the nucleus and binding agents, you will be able to jump onto the next stage of life. As it's in the early stages of development though, it's somewhat limited with only the Budding reproductive method available right now. Before this part of the game is fully sorted, they continue working on the microbe stage. The other big addition is signalling agents, enabling you to communicate with allied cells which opens up the game even more.</p>
<p>Have a look at their new trailer below:</p>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt v2.6.1 adds support for the Heroic Launcher Flatpak</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtonUp-Qt gives you an incredibly easy way to install compatibility layers on Linux like GE-Proton (formerly Proton GE), Lutris-Wine, Luxtorpeda and more.</p>
<p>The developer just recently put up version 2.6.1, which as a bit of a highlight should now work nicely with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heroic-games-launcher-now-on-flathub-even-easier-to-run-epic-games-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Flatpak version of the Heroic Games Launcher</a> (for the Epic Games Store). This is especially good for the Steam Deck, where I imagine most people will be using the Flatpak, since it's easy to install and update via the Discover software centre.</p>

      <title>2022 is officially the Year of Linux Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's it, I'm done, finished. It's "mission complete" now is it not? 2022 is officially the Year of Linux Gaming. Yup, that's something I am now proclaiming and I'm also putting a flag down into February 25 (the Steam Deck release date) as Linux Gaming Day every year.</p>
<p>While the long-running joke of "Year of the Linux Desktop" might take forever to actually be a thing, Linux Gaming is now a lot more mainstream. Thanks largely to Valve of course bringing over Steam to Linux, and eventually producing the Steam Deck — putting the power of Linux and open source literally into peoples' hands.</p>
<p>Of course that's not to say it's all Valve. There's a massively <em>long</em> list of open source contributors who have helped to make this happen. From drivers to desktop environment upgrades there's so many different people, companies and organisations to thank. We wouldn't see the Steam Deck without open source and without the Vulkan API. I've said for years that we needed "hardware, hardware, hardware" with more vendors to properly jump in. It's not enough to have good marketing, or a good desktop, people needed a reason to use it to actually sway them over and clearly the Steam Deck is doing wonders.</p>
<p>If you follow the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, you'll see a lot of people trying out (and actually enjoying) the KDE Plasma desktop mode on the Steam Deck too. Plenty of the fixes coming into KDE Plasma are as a result of people trying it out too, and finding issues, which then benefits all users. You only have to look at the regular <a href="https://pointieststick.com/category/this-week-in-kde/" target="_blank">This Week in KDE blog posts</a> from developer Nate Graham to see how much effort goes into it.</p>
<p>The community building up around it is quite fantastic too, we've already seen a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-plugin-loader-gets-another-release-should-work-better-now/" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a> come along which will be fun to see progress. We've seen multiple emulation tools appear like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/emudeck-makes-emulation-on-steam-deck-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/retrodeck-is-another-solution-for-emulation-gaming-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a>, masses of developers moving to improve their games to add in gamepad support and better text sizing and the list goes on.</p>
<p>There's been times recently it felt like I woke up in a different world, when sites like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/steam-deck-soulless-windows/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> told people to stick with SteamOS and not Windows and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNt_ReLwk40" target="_blank">LinusTT</a> thought SteamOS did better overall. Never did I ever expect things like that to happen. Heck, even Jeff Grubb from Venture Beat said this in a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1513402150952468480" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" dir="auto" id="id__9k0i6f0gyvq" lang="en">Steam Deck makes me want to puke from thinking about how stifled everything is by walled gardens. The community has already made Steam Deck so much better, and it all works together because it's open source. A better world isn't just possible; it exists.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck, Linux and open source are finally starting to get through the cracks — it's incredible. After writing about it for so long, this really does feel like the "what a time to be alive" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu32fBkiHFE" target="_blank">clip</a> that came from The Simpsons and is now a fun meme for this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Heck, you even have Microsoft of all companies jumping in to repeatedly talk about their games on this Linux handheld, and even doing a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/microsoft-announce-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-steam-deck-with-edge/" target="_blank">guide to get Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> to work. It might not be Game Pass on Steam (yet?), but who had any of that on their bingo card? I sure didn't.</p>
<p>More companies are even now looking to go with Linux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">like OneXPlayer</a> because it's showing its worth, something sadly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gpd-are-getting-quite-desperate-against-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">GPD don't see</a>.</p>
<p>Even Epic Games are doing a little like making sure Easy Anti-Cheat can work easily on Linux, and getting Unreal Engine into a better state for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/unreal-engine-5-has-officially-launched-lots-of-linux-and-vulkan-improvements/" target="_blank">Linux with Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is heavily focused on the Steam Deck, but you need to remember that apart from the Steam Client, practically all of SteamOS is open source software and all improvements go on to benefit Linux Gaming everywhere. I think we're finally starting to hit that turning point for Linux Gaming as a whole thanks to this. Absolutely tons of people are now learning more about it, enjoying it and sticking with it — exactly what we want to see.</p>
<p><em>Now if you'll excuse me I'm off to go sit on my sofa and load up a AAA game on a Linux handheld.</em></p>

<p>This is the first desktop unit from Star Labs, who usually do their own laptops. All of which come with good and tested Linux support and of course this is no different. You can pick between Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Manjaro and more with Windows also an option but that will cost extra (+£110 for Windows 10 Home for example).</p>
<p>Tinker to your liking too, as their warranty allows you to take it apart, replace parts, upgrade, use whatever operating system you like all without voiding it.</p>
<p>When will it be available? You can order now, but it won't ship out until approximately "Late June" but they give a 5% discount if you order now. See more on the <a href="https://starlabs.systems/pages/byte" target="_blank">Star Labs website</a>.</p>

      <title>Online co-op shooter GTFO adds &#39;partial&#39; Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GTFO, the scary online co-op shooter from 10 Chambers recently had another update, and with it the developers claim they added in "partial" support for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What is it? "GTFO is an extreme cooperative horror shooter that throws you from gripping suspense to explosive action in a heartbeat. Stealth, strategy, and teamwork are necessary to survive in your deadly, underground prison. Work together or die together" — according to the developer.</p>
<p>A title that already ran reasonably well on Linux desktops with Proton. For the Steam Deck though it's currently rated as "Playable", and when I quizzed them a little more one of their team said it works better now with the "virtual keyboard, among some other things" as they work to make it Verified. Small steps but certainly better than nothing.</p>
<p>In my own testing though, it's a little problematic. My first attempt hard-locked the entire Deck while dropping down into the level, forcing me to do a full reset of the unit. Then it crashed to the Deck Library when opening a terminal in the next game. A third attempt got it working properly, although performance on the defaults is pretty low but you can adjust plenty to get it into a reasonable state. Apart from that, needing to manually type commands on a few terminals is not great on the Steam Deck and it doesn't show any gamepad glyphs (which is correctly noted by Valve). You also need to manually assign the ESC key to a button on the Deck, to be able to properly exit terminals (it's not added by default).</p>
<p>Considering how unstable I found it to be, plus the other issues, a game I don't think right now deserves to be labelled as Playable.</p>

      <title>Valve updates Portal to improve Steam Deck performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve sure do give a lot of love to their games (okay, most, I hear the rumbling of TF2 fans in the background) and a new update has rolled out for the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/" target="_blank">Portal</a> to help the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Portal is one of the titles that Valve updated with <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>, which allows the classic to run using Vulkan instead of OpenGL, an update for this title I somehow missed from back in late February. They did the same for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/portal-2-from-valve-gets-a-big-update-with-vulkan-support-from-dxvk/" target="_blank">Portal 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/left-4-dead-2-updated-with-vulkan-support-thanks-to-dxvk/" target="_blank">Left 4 Dead 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/half-life-2-and-the-episodes-get-a-beta-with-vulkan-dxvk-and-more/" target="_blank">Half-Life 2</a> series. The problem with DXVK for both Native Linux titles and Windows games in Proton, is that it can stutter while it builds up a shader cache.</p>
<p>The new update for Portal lists that it "Added DXVK cache priming for the Steam Deck", which should reduce any stuttering to a minimum for Steam Deck. You can use DXVK to get Vulkan on a Linux desktop too if you run "-vulkan" as a launch option.</p>

      <title>Screeps: Arena is an online RTS for programming fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love programming? How about real-time strategy games? Check out the new Native Linux release of Screeps: Arena. This is the second game in the series, with the first being Screeps: World that was released back in 2016 and gained a positive rating (and still has players too).</p>
<p>While Screeps: World was a persistent MMO, Screeps: Arena brings things down to be more like a traditional RTS that might end up appealing to a much wider variety of players. It's online only and PvP, where your scripts fight off against others autonomously. Actually sounds quite fun, if you enjoying writing a few lines first.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LkXuGcrCZtU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/90c2798908adf29c08a9b0fb70e52278.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LkXuGcrCZtU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the features available include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All aspects of an RTS game: gathering resources, base building, creating and upgrading units.</li>
<li>You don't control your units directly, you play by writing full-fledged JavaScript that runs on game servers.</li>
<li>Other languages are supported via WebAssembly: C/C++, Rust, TypeScript, Go, C#, F#, Kotlin, Swift, D, Pascal, Zig, the list is growing.</li>
<li>Your code is executed autonomously while fighting other players' code during series of short fast-paced 1x1 matchups.</li>
<li>The system will match equal opponents based on your arena rating that changes with every rating game.</li>
<li>You can find an equal opponent instantly 24/7 even if no other players are online, since their saved code is used instead.</li>
<li>Different "arenas" (multiplayer game modes) each with its own rules set and goals covering many aspects of a strategy game.</li>
<li>Only basic programming skills are required. However, if you are a pro developer, now is the chance to put your skills to the limit!</li>
<li>We will introduce new arenas every season so that you always have to write new code for different challenges.</li>
<li>Earn daily fame, gain resources and craft items to unlock more content during the season.</li>
<li>Play with friends and design your own challenges and arenas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1137320/Screeps_Arena/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> in Early Access, there's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Play Worms 2 on Linux with the Worms 2 Plus patch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Worms, a game I grew up with playing on the Amiga, it's an absolute classic and some modern versions just don't have the same charm. Thankfully, Worms 2 can be played easily on Linux (and Windows) thanks to Worms 2 Plus.</p>
<p>Originally released back in 1997, it's obviously quite <em>dated</em> now. Getting it running on modern systems can be quite a hassle but that's where Worms 2 Plus comes in. The developer emailed in about it, as they've made sure that it nicely works with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> too and the installer "automatically configures the game for Wine" they tell me, and this is a perfect way for Wine to shine.</p>
<p>There's a lot that Worms 2 Plus does like applying the last official patch, adds a Borderless Windowed mode, fixes various sound issues, online play without extra configuration, LAN play restored, server list is fixed, plus various other enhancements from other patches. Heck, even <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011449998-Worms-2-modern-systems-fix?product=gog" target="_blank">GOG suggest</a> people to use it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5951793071649945116gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>So, if like me, you're a bit of an old-school Worms fan, try it out and see what you think.</p>
<p>You can grab Worms 2 Plus from <a href="https://github.com/Carlmundo/W2-Plus" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and Worms 2 from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/worms_2" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>Soldat 2 gets completely overhauled in a new update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you remember the classic multiplayer shooter Soldat? Well, it continues living on with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/classic-multiplayer-action-game-soldat-is-now-open-source/" target="_blank">original now being open source</a> and the sequel just got completely remade.</p>
<p>Soldat 2 entered Early Access in September 2020 but it seems it didn't quite hit the marks players wanted, and failed to find much of an audience. Transhuman Design never gave up on it, and as it turned out they were hard at work to overhaul everything. This huge revamp is out now!</p>
<p>The movement system was changed to include new abilities like front-flips, hardrolls and glide rolls, sliding and more. Maps were redone, there's a whole new lobby system with lots of modifiers available, the UI was completely remade, there's now an End Results screen with match statistics, matchmaking, a new level editor and the list just goes on. Clearly, a lot of work was put into this. See the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Yes, the Steam Deck will eventually get Ray Tracing, once the AMD GPU driver matures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a lot of talk lately about Ray Tracing and the Steam Deck, especially after the recent Digital Foundry video but there's a few things that need to be cleared up.</p>
<p>As a reminder: the Steam Deck runs Linux, specifically it's SteamOS "Holo" based on Arch Linux. Right now, Ray Tracing <em>is</em> supported on Linux both for Native Linux titles and Windows title through Proton. NVIDIA has supported Native Vulkan Ray Tracing a long time now, and DirectX Ray Tracing (DXR) is getting into shape too with VKD3D-Proton (that translates Direct3D 12 to Vulkan) version 2.5 that was released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/vkd3d-proton-v25-is-out-for-direct3d-12-on-top-of-vulkan-improving-directx-raytracing/" target="_blank">back in October 2021</a> mentioning "DXR 1.0 support is more or less feature complete" and "DXR 1.1 is now experimentally exposed".</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, the issue <em>isn't</em> specifically to do with Proton. The problem is largely the open source AMD GPU driver in Mesa named "RADV", that just isn't ready yet. Our friends at <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> have covered a lot of the bring-up work involved. It works, but it's <em>slow</em> and improvements on it are being done constantly. While there <em>may</em> be some adjustments needed in Proton (which is likely true for NVIDIA too), the key point is the GPU driver on the Steam Deck. You <em>can</em> even enable it per-game <em>right now</em>, by setting this as a launch option: <code class="inline-code">RADV_PERFTEST=rt %command%</code> but again it won't work well. DirectX games likely still need VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr / VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr11 launch options depending on what they use, as noted in the VKD3D-Proton release notes linked above.</p>
<p>Quake II RTX for example runs on the Steam Deck but as you can tell from the screenshot — not well. First is the default OpenGL renderer, second is RTX (click them to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6472646051649931466gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Quake II RTX - OpenGL - Steam Deck" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6472646051649931466gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3974260601649931467gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Quake II RTX - RTX - Steam Deck" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3974260601649931467gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For Control, swapping it to Proton Experimental from the default Proton 7 (<a href="https://youtu.be/f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">guide here</a>) and having the launch option set as: <code class="inline-code">VKD3D_CONFIG=dxr RADV_PERFTEST=rt %command%</code> enables the Ray Tracing options to be enabled on Steam Deck too. First picture is the default graphics, second is with Ray Tracing turned on Medium:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14510414731649934314gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14510414731649934314gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5051109621649934315gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5051109621649934315gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Eventually, once the RADV driver is in good shape for Ray Tracing performance, I do expect it to work okay on the Steam Deck when Valve pull in the needed driver updates into SteamOS since some of it is already clearly there, just hidden behind that launch option above.</p>
<p>Hopefully that clears it up somewhat as a few other much bigger websites have mentioned things like "RT features cannot be accessed from Linux" (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-steam-deck-vs-next-gen-gaming-is-valves-handheld-truly-future-proof" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>) and thinking it's Proton itself that cannot "recognize Steam Deck's RDNA 2 cores" (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/steam-decks-future-proofed-potential-borne-out-by-ray-tracing-tests/" target="_blank">Ars</a> — which was also wrong on Quake II RTX, it's a Native Linux build and doesn't use or need Proton) and whatever else other websites say. Even Digital Foundry were technically incorrect in the video. Really, the point is just to clear up some continuing misconceptions of Linux and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Anyway, the DF video is below if you wish to see:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uhy0v_STh6k?rel=0&amp;start=135"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92d140dddb6cc1b2b4edab0240600177.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uhy0v_STh6k?rel=0&amp;start=135" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Personally, I don't see Ray Tracing as the key to anything when it comes to the future and longevity of the Steam Deck. What we need is more developers taking a look, and optimizing for it directly so that games still look good and play well, considering it's a portable with limits.</p>

      <title>Lumencraft blends top-down shooting, Tower Defense and a destructible environment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lumencraft is a brand new release from developer 2Dynamic Games that is going to suck up far too much of my time, and might be a new favourite run blast through on my Steam Deck. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Blending together a Tower Defense game, with a top-down shooter and destructible environments, it has all the makings to be the next indie hit and I get a slight Deep Rock Galactic vibe from it too. Blasting through the tutorial and then some of the first sandbox map, well over an hour vanished in the blink of an eye — that's the kind of game I like to see.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ldgf-iLMxxY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/493d922b67e640f1d193323e211786bc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ldgf-iLMxxY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Working great on the Steam Deck right away, although the fonts are a little small in places and the resolution isn't quite what it should be but they're aware of such issues and said they will look to solve both. Despite the issues, it's an awesome top-down game to get into already with a lot to like about it. Drilling around, setting up a base and watching out for holes appearing in front of you for creepy-crawlies to appear from — it looks brilliant.</p>
<p>Made with the open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's nice to see more developers pick up FOSS tools and the Early Access release comes with Native Linux support: "With a lot of effort and a set of original algorithms, 2Dynamic Games have transformed the open-source Godot Engine into a completely new tool. This allows every bit of terrain (pixel, as we used to call them) to be destroyed, and maps can be painted as if in a drawing program".</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Defending the underground settlement by direct combat and the use of diversified turrets.</li>
<li>Highly efficient and satisfying digging mechanics.</li>
<li>Explosive weapons. Yes, we have dynamite.</li>
<li>Dynamic lights and pixel-perfect interaction with the fully destructible terrain.</li>
<li>Dread atmosphere created through the impactful sound design and a unique 2Dynamic lighting system.</li>
<li>Realistic simulations. Just look at the lava!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Google detail more on how Steam on Chrome OS works with Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get more info behind the scenes on how Steam for Chrome OS works? It uses Linux but it's a little bit complicated and Google has put out the <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/bringing-steam-to-chromeos" target="_blank">first in a series</a> of blog posts to talk more about it.</p>
<p>The good news of course for normal Linux desktop fans, is that developers will need to ensure their games work on Linux directly. Either through a Native build, which should work out of the box, or ensuring and testing their Windows builds with Proton. Although, Steam Play Proton is not turned on by default for Chrome OS as there's various issues right now.</p>
<p>How does it work then? Through the magic of virtual machines! Using work they've done in the past with <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/linux" target="_blank">Crostini</a>, an already existing way to run normal Linux apps on Chrome OS and "Chrome OS's own virtual machine monitor (VMM), <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/+/HEAD/README.md" target="_blank">crosvm⁠</a>". They say running Steam and games in a container like this "provides another layer of security above normal Linux systems" that's used for Crostini, Android, and Parallels.</p>
<p>Their system, much like SteamOS for the Steam Deck, is based on Arch Linux which they codenamed "Borealis", and it's automatically kept up to date for you with each Chrome OS release. Keeping it simple, while hiding all the technical parts for users, as they say "we have aimed to make the VM invisible to the user – from both an operational and from a performance perspective". They do this by using "Linux's <a href="https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page" target="_blank">KVM⁠</a> hypervisor" and "paravirtualized virtio-based devices instead of emulation" and that to play the latest games they built a Vulkan virtualization driver called "<a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/venus.html" target="_blank">Venus</a>".</p>
<p>Borealis and Crostini differ in a number of ways, while still sharing the core graphics and display pipeline, so applications support Vulkan and OpenGL using Mesa drivers. It uses XWayland, together with "sommelier", which they say is their "proxying Wayland compositor" and then it all moves over to "exo" which is their own Wayland display server. The big difference is user experience with Borealis targeting end users and Crostini for developers, with Borealis enabling one-click installs like Steam. The other big difference is that Borealis is based on Arch Linux, while Crostini is based on Debian.</p>
<p>The way they've configured it sounds a lot like the Steam Deck too, with the VM being read-only while having a separate read-write partition for data and they're shipping newer versions of Mesa than what is usually tagged as a release upstream.</p>
<p>Google said to expect "deep dives" on their Steam integration, their Vulkan virtualization, how to develop games for ChromeOS and much more. We can also expect "new devices, new features, better integration and improved performance".</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky got a huge &#39;Outlaws&#39; update and works well on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No Man's Sky, a Steam Deck Verified title that also works great on Linux desktops with Steam Play Proton recently got another massive free update. Hello Games have well and truly shown how to recover from a rough launch, it's now such a completely different game.</p>
<p>Quite a lot is new with this update adding in the likes of overhauled space combat, a new pirate underworld, a new solar ship class (the first new ship class in a long time), you can hire wingmen, smuggle around naughty goods, there's new and more impressive explosions, pirate raids, frigate fleets that will fly overhead, an overhaul to warp and engine effects of all frigates and freighters, in-atmosphere combat and much more.</p>
<p>Their new trailer can be seen below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="A2UHduOn5ZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19983b5282df0743fabbfb21f7526ab1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/A2UHduOn5ZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Want to see how it can run on a Steam Deck? Good news, I have just the video you need to see after messing around with it for a while. It's interesting, as No Man's Sky was a title a tried quite a few times during <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" target="_blank">my original Steam Deck Review</a>, where it really didn't run well, even after their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/no-mans-sky-sentinel-update-specially-optimised-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck update</a>. Going back to it just recently though? It's like a different world, as it does perform quite a lot better. Still has plenty of frame drops when loading in new bits but it's now actually enjoyable.</p>
<p>Here's quite a few minutes of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L5zNBCgbfEA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8857c7276cd5b441449335db039af291.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L5zNBCgbfEA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>I think I'm going to be playing a whole lot more of this.</em></p>
<p>You can buy No Man's Sky from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/no-mans-sky?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Splitgate is getting a new matchmaking system that won&#39;t suck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Splitgate is actually a pretty great online FPS but it has a major problem with its matchmaking system, so it's getting a rewrite to suck less.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/blogs/matchmaker-matchmaker-make-me-a-match" target="_blank">blog post</a> they've noted the problem with the current system is that not only is it slow, it's forgetful. It will reset constantly, and re-queue you as it tries to find a bunch of new people to play with. One of the results of how slow it works, is that you end up playing with more bots than intended as it forces you into a game eventually and the developer is solving this.</p>
<p>With an upcoming update the "entire backend" is being rewritten. 1047 Games say the new system will be much smarter, it will keep you playing with people previously found to be a good match instead of entirely resetting, it's fast and scalable and more configurable.</p>
<p>So when will it release? They expected it to be within a few weeks, although they expect the initial update to be a little of the rocky side (buggy). Sounds like a good plan though, and one that's very much needed to save the game, with a playerbase that has dwindled to only a couple thousand playing at a time from heights of tens of thousands.</p>

      <title>Arx Fatalis open source engine Arx Libertatis gets fixed up for Mesa drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arx Fatalis is an Arkane Studios classic from 2002 that was officially open sourced. This update for <a href="https://arx-libertatis.org/" target="_blank">Arx Libertatis</a> should hopefully make it work even better on the Steam Deck, and Linux desktops using Mesa drivers.</p>
<p>"This critically acclaimed first-person RPG from Arkane Studios takes the player on an amazing journey into the fantasy world of Arx. Arx is wrought with turmoil, brought to the brink of destruction by a violent war. The sun has disappeared from overhead to shroud the world in eternal darkness, forcing communities to begin inhabiting underground mines. But as food and drink becomes scarce, the wars become even more violent as each race – from trolls, goblins, and rat-men, to humans – struggle for survival."</p>
<p>Arx Libertatis 1.2.1 is quite a small patch that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>One notable fix is for the "Crisp" Alpha Cutout Anti-Aliasing setting introduce in 1.2 which has been causing performance issues when near fogs or smoke for some players while resulting in crashes for Windows users with Intel graphics. In this release the performance issues have been fixed and the setting has been disabled for OpenGL drivers experiencing crashes.</li>
<li>Linux Steam users with Mesa graphics drivers may have noticed textures being replaced with solid colors once the Steam overlay loads. We have added a workaround to no longer promise the graphics drivers that we are good API-respecting citizens if we detect the Steam overlay so that its naughtyness can go unseen again.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to play it easily on Linux or Steam Deck, one way you could set it up is with the Luxtorpeda tool, which I did a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">guide on that you can see here</a> — it's really easy to do and gives you the best version of the game.</p>
<p>You do need the data files of the original release to play with Arx Libertatis which you can buy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/arx_fatalis" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1700/Arx_Fatalis/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>War for the Overworld gets a surprise graphics upgrade, also sees a big discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>War for the Overworld, a Dungeon Keeper inspired game from 2015 had a huge free upgrade recently bringing some graphical improvements and performance optimizations. Nice to see a developer come back to an older title.</p>
<p>The game for the most part is in maintenance mode but this was something of an experiment for a member of their team, and still quite impressive to just come out with years later. One of the major additions is the inclusion of real-time shadows, which dramatically improves the moody look of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4609868771649847411gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>A few other shadow tweaks were added in, all of which seem to be optional as the more advanced features are quite a bit more taxing on computer resources of course.</p>
<p>On top of that it went through a visual tone overhaul, to give you more of a sense of being underground and they provided some comparison shots on that (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15524460131649847590gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15524460131649847590gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Going even further, some performance optimizations also made their way into the game. The developer said they saw a "significant 41.8% reduction in UI overhead on the main menu" and a "5000% gain in performance" for certain parts of the in-game UI like the unit panel "taking only 0.1ms to render down from 5ms when fully populated".</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/war_for_the_overworld" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/war-for-the-overworld?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/230190/War_for_the_Overworld/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's 85% off until April 26.</p>

      <title>Back 4 Blood adds experimental support for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back 4 Blood, the zombie shooter from Turtle Rock Studios has a <a href="https://back4blood.com/en-us/patch-notes/april-2022-update" target="_blank">fresh update</a> out, and the developer has gotten it working on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>An important note though, is that this is "experimental" right now so there may be other issues. However, I've personally tested it on Steam Deck and it works quite well. You get a chat disconnection message often, and cut-scenes seem to stutter with the official Proton but other than that, it's quite playable and enjoyable on the defaults.</p>
<p>Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developer Note: We have made an experimental change that we believe will make the game playable on Proton platforms such as the Steam Deck, SteamOS, and Linux. While this is not yet official support and has had limited testing, if you are a player interested in playing on these platforms, you should no longer be prevented from doing so and should join us on our Discord to discuss bugs specific to this platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>What they've done is hook up Easy Anti-Cheat to work properly on Linux with Proton.</em></p>
<p>For a quick look at it on Steam Deck with default settings, have a look at my video below:</p>

      <title>Strategy game &#39;Old World&#39; comes to Steam and GOG on May 19 with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World, a game that was talked up as an alternative to the Civilization series that was previously exclusive to the Epic Games Store, is heading to GOG and Steam on May 19 (although, the Linux build will only be on Steam). When it arrives on the new stores, it will also come with an expansion called Heroes of the Aegean, which will be free for anyone who purchases Old World in the first two weeks after release.</p>
<p>Set in classical antiquity, Old World is a historical 4X turn-based strategy game where players select a historical leader to guide their civilization. Leaders are mortal, and once they die, the dynasty's future depends on their heir.</p>
<p>In regards to a Linux version, I did email the developer back in March but they did not reply. However, it has now been <em>officially</em> confirmed in a press release that a full Linux version will also arrive on May 19. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> The May 19th release of Old World will also bring full Linux support to the game, as well as localization to Japanese, Chinese (simplified and traditional), Russian, German, French, and Spanish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the expansion: Heroes of the Aegean contains six historical scenarios which put players in control of Ancient Greece's most famous generals and leaders, from Leonidas to Alexander the Great. Players can put their own spins on famous historical scenarios such as the Battle of Marathon, the Wars of the Diadochi, and the Battle of Thermopylae.</p>

<p>At release it will be up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/old_world" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/597180/Old_World/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <strong>Note</strong>: only Steam will have the Linux version.</p>

      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection broke on Linux and Steam Deck, here&#39;s a quick fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a recent update to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/" target="_blank">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>, Xbox Game Studios included the needed Easy Anti-Cheat file for Linux / Steam Deck to work online but they broke it in the process for some.</p>
<p>It's a very good sign that official support may come, as I pointed out on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1513566840856924161" target="_blank">Twitter</a> but I found that it stopped the game working entirely on both my Fedora Linux desktop and the Steam Deck. Looking around, I'm not alone in this issue. Even when trying to use the mode they included with the game to play without anti-cheat (so you can at least play offline), that doesn't work now either.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is a temporary fix so you can continue playing offline until they sort it properly. Here's what you need to do (for Steam Deck, be in Desktop Mode):</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the game in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go to Properties.</li>
<li>Local files on the left tab.</li>
<li>Click Browse.</li>
<li>Find the "easyanticheat" folder, and inside remove "easyanticheat_x64.so" (or the whole folder, both ways work)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you will have it back as before, with the option to load without anti-cheat working once again.</p>
<p>Is this safe? Yes, as you'll be using the built-in option to play without it anyway. If you want to restore it, you can just Verify the files inside of Steam and it will grab them again.</p>

      <title>Linux distro EndeavourOS has the &#39;Apollo&#39; release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EndeavourOS, an Arch Linux-based distribution has a <a href="https://endeavouros.com/news/the-apollo-release-has-landed/" target="_blank">new release out</a> with plenty of upgrades to the install process. It may not be "pure Arch", but it's damn close.</p>
<p>Giving you an easy to use installer in a live environment, that allows you to pick various desktop environments, it's easily one of the nicest distributions out there (if you can handle the regular updates). Unlike Manjaro that holds back updates to do some testing, EndeavourOS uses the plain Arch Linux repositories so you get all the updates when you look for them and whatever configuration Arch has for them — for better or worse. This was my personal choice OS until recently, when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/sorry-arch-its-not-working-out-any-more-and-hello-fedora/" target="_blank">I hopped over to Fedora</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17330342881649687881gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17330342881649687881gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
EndeavourOS Xfce - testing it live</em></p>
<p>A whole bunch of what's new is on the installer including a change to their internet check to not rely on GitHub or GitLab, a fix for when Xfce4 and i3 are both selected for installation, community editions now install with their dedicated Display Manager, a re-ordered desktop and package selection process, Firefox should no longer be installed when not chosen, compression is now being applied to the installed files for btrfs installs (instead of after) and more.</p>
<p>For the actual install once done, there's been a few changes there too. FirewallD has been enabled by default, there's a new EOS-quickstart application to help you out, a new NVIDIA installer, adjustments to their helper software repositories and a few other smaller changes.</p>

      <title>Selaco is an FPS inspired by F.E.A.R and a demo is coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To say I am hyped about trying Selaco might be a serious understatement because it looks incredible. A GZDoom powered cross-platform FPS inspired by F.E.A.R and soon a demo will be available.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selaco is a brand new original shooter running on GZDoom, featuring thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart AI and a fleshed out story taking place within an immersive game world. It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing traditional retro-FPS elements from QUAKE and DOOM, along with some more modern features. Together with professional artists who work in the industry, several having worked on successful throwback FPS games in the past, Selaco is a fully fleshed out world full of character, action, and mystery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently, the developer put up a refreshed version of their original teaser to show off the current state with an announcement that a demo will be coming to Steam in June. Backers of their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PlaySelaco" target="_blank">Patreon</a> will be getting it a little earlier on April 22. Check out the new teaser below:</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II recreation &#39;fheroes2&#39; gets improved language support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>fheroes2 is easily now the best way to play Heroes of Might and Magic II on any platform, an absolute classic and the project continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Version 0.9.14 was released recently improving the supported languages, like the ability to properly display Norwegian and Italian languages, plus most other translations were also updated. The "Battle Only" button was also fixed across most languages.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16923649421649678143gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16923649421649678143gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The logic and code for artifacts was also completely reworked, which they said fixes "many places of incorrect effects from artifacts and even missing bonuses", and it now "works exactly as in the original code". With the changes they made, it will even help modding, as it's now "very easy to add new artifacts into the game or modify their abilities opening huge possibilities for modding".</p>
<p>On top of that the AI should be smarter with optimizations done on making decisions for spells, construction and the AI can now use the "Dimension Door". Support for MP3 and FLAC in-game music formats was added, video loading speed was improved dramatically, plus lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21298729251649678148gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21298729251649678148gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and remember to grab the data from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <title>A developer made a ShadowPlay-like high-performance recording tool for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Find you get too much of a performance hit using other recording tools like OBS Studio? Maybe this new tool will help. It doesn't have a fancy name, just called "<a href="https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/about/" target="_blank">gpu screen recorder</a>" along with <a href="https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder-gtk/about/" target="_blank">GTK front-end</a> you can use to help manage it.</p>
<p>They claim it's the "fastest screen recording tool for Linux". Why make it? Well, in their own words on how it's different to OBS when paired with NVENC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OBS only uses the gpu for video encoding, but the window image that is encoded is sent from the GPU to the CPU and then back to the GPU. These operations are very slow and causes all of the fps drops when using OBS. OBS only uses the GPU efficiently on Windows 10 and Nvidia. This gpu-screen-recorder keeps the window image on the GPU and sends it directly to the video encoding unit on the GPU by using CUDA. This means that CPU usage remains at around 0% when using this screen recorder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In their own testing, they said they saw FPS drops from 30 to 7 with OBS Studio at 4K but with their tool they saw a solid 30FPS. This of course highly depends on your CPU but the point here, is that it uses the full power of your GPU, and seeing a performance loss with OBS on Linux is pretty common.</p>
<p>They have a lot of plans for it including support for AMD and Intel GPUs, the ability to dynamically change bitrate / resolution to match desired fps, see the cursor in the recording and more.</p>
<p>Sounds like a great project, that could be helpful for those of you who want high-performance recordings or something more like Nvidia ShadowPlay perhaps.</p>

      <title>Might and Delight come up with a plan to save Book of Travels</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Book of Travels is a tiny multiplayer online RPG from developer Might and Delight (known for the likes of Shelter and Meadow), which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/book-of-travels-did-not-have-a-good-launch-might-and-delight-let-devs-go/" target="_blank">didn't do particularly well</a> at the Early Access release but now they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1152340/view/3227400227403370955" target="_blank">have a plan</a> to save it.</p>
<p>Now the dust has settled on their studio cutbacks, they've outlined a reasonable sounding plan to get Book of Travels into a state where it can be ready for them to continue to produce actual playable content. This includes bringing in "help from old friends with large amounts of experience dealing with situations like ours".</p>
<p>Here's their plan:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>For the next 3 months we’ll focus on more large scope tech issues. These won’t be specific bugs or glitches that are typically visible to the player, but more world encompassing system issues that need to be addressed in order for the game as a whole to be more fertile ground for us to start eradicating the comparatively smaller problems that actually are evident to the player.</li>
<li>During this time we may appear to be quiet or seem inactive. This is just because we will be very busy. Since the nature of these larger scale issues don’t always make them suitable for traditional patch notes, you won’t necessarily see a typical flow of those during this period. You will, however, notice the game getting updated in the Steam client, and if an update doesn't come with the traditional patch notes – now you know why.</li>
<li>After this period we’ll resume with the releasing of additional content. By this point we plan to have the game’s foundation solid enough to allow us to start growing it again. We have lots of cool things that we’re dying to get into your hands. The city of Kasa, for instance, is very close to being finished and we know you’re excited for the deeper character customisation tools that we’ve talked about in the past. But this doesn’t mean that we’ll be done with fixes, just that we can start doing both fixes and fun new content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's pretty rare for a developer to admit they've got a lot of problems with their code, especially to go into quiet mode for a while to get it all fixed up. This likely means Book of Travels will fall off the radar even more for players — but hopefully it will be worth it in the end.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D6UFUUvWzUA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13ed604fafe49a529f450cb22de7baf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D6UFUUvWzUA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Book of Travels has a great idea, and a wonderful visual style but clearly has a lot of issues. You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1152340/Book_of_Travels/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Book of Travels on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://openrazer.github.io/" target="_blank">OpenRazer</a> version 3.3 brings with it support for even more Razer hardware on Linux, along with some other improvements. This is now a rather big collection of drivers, which you can use with various front-ends like <a href="https://polychromatic.app/" target="_blank">Polychromatic</a> and <a href="https://github.com/z3ntu/RazerGenie" target="_blank">RazerGenie</a>.</p>
<p>With this release these are now supported:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Razer Orochi V2</li>

<li>Improve battery notifer presentation</li>
<li>Fix missing battery notifications for some devices</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And of course some bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix possible oob memcpy in matrix_custom_frame methods</li>
<li>Fix key translations on Ornata V2</li>
<li>Fix sysfs create/remove inconsistencies</li>
<li>Fix crash when persistence.conf is corrupt</li>
<li>Fix media keys and volume wheel on BlackWidow V3 Pro</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>OpenRazer is an another essential free and open source project, making up for the official vendor not providing full Linux support. Open source is awesome right? Still, a shame it has to be done by the community.</p>

      <title>Valheim gets a bug fix update as work on Mistlands continues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While most players are itching to play through the upcoming Mistlands update, Iron Gate have a small bug-fix and improvement update out for Valheim. From the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/more-teasers-for-a-big-valheim-update-have-arrived/" target="_blank">last update</a> Iron Gate gave on Mistlands, we're still sadly quite a while away from seeing it in-game as there's a lot of work ahead on it.</p>
<p>For now, at least some annoying issues were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3220644827970865344" target="_blank">solved</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where trolls would not get staggered correctly sometimes</li>
<li>Map key legend fixes and remove map icon gamepad mapping set to LB</li>
<li>Various small fixes to Frost Cave rooms</li>
<li>Fixed a bug related to pausing after being in debugmode and changing server</li>
<li>Upgrade function will now remember the selected object when upgrading</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the split stack number sometimes would not be visible on high resolutions</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes smelters would not always use the correct amount of coal</li>
<li>Fixed some items not being covered in snow</li>
<li>Hotbar selection marker now more visible on light backgrounds when using gamepad</li>
<li>The ‘resetsharedmap’ console command added and various devcommands improvements</li>
<li>Buying items from the trader on gamepad no longer buys twice, plus some interface tweaks</li>
<li>Keyboard &amp; gamepad hints for inventory screen</li>
<li>Picking up your tombstone will now try to stack items</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where tombstones sometimes would be unreachable in Swamp trees</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I'm just playing other games until the next major update is out but it's a thoroughly enjoyable game to get into even though it's not yet finished. An Early Access game done right for sure.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's Steam Deck Verified. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck Plugin Loader gets another release, should work better now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community-built Steam Deck <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a> continues to mature, with version 1.1.0 out now fixing some issues.</p>
<p>With this installed onto your Steam Deck, you will be able to load it up with whatever Plugins the community can come up with like a classic <a href="https://github.com/SpyrexDE/SDH-BigPictureMode" target="_blank">Big Picture Mode</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/SpyrexDE/SDH-Calculator" target="_blank">Calculator</a>. No doubt plenty more plugins will be appearing over the next few weeks and months once the project improves more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21444655331649673490gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21444655331649673490gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - an example from the Plugin Loader developer</em></p>
<p>Here's what's new in Plugin Loader version 1.1.0</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The loader now automatically reinjects itself into Steam when Steam gets restarted</strong>
<ul>
<li>This means the loader now properly starts up again when switching back from Desktop Mode and also is more reliable when rebooting the Deck</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plugin Tiles are now isolated in their own iframes</li>
<li><strong>Plugins now all live in their own folder</strong>
<ul>
<li>This allows separating python backend code from UI code, bundling extra dependencies and so on</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The menu title now gets changed from <code class="inline-code">Plugins</code> to the name of the current Plugin when one gets loaded</li>
<li>Fixed first plugin button being smaller than the rest of them</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely loving seeing all the community additions coming along to the Steam Deck, showing the power of what open source can do without a walled garden.</p>

      <title>Duck Game gets a patch for Proton, now works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Duck Game, an action platformer from Landon Podbielski and Adult Swim Games has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/312530/view/3228526127310726251" target="_blank">been updated</a> to enable it to work properly with the current version of Proton 7 and gets it working on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With their changes, it should now work out of the box! Released originally on Steam back in 2015, it went onto receive wide recognition with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from 20,944 (at time of writing) user reviews. Always nice to see such a title running well on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A video of it on Steam Deck with no adjustments done:</p>

<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>-Updated Steam SDK version<br/>
-Fixed issues with toggling fullscreen in Linux (Proton)<br/>
-Added onscreen keyboard support when playing in big picture mode<br/>
-Duck Game will now automatically detect if it is being run through Proton, the '-linux' command line is no longer necessary. It can still be used incase automatic detection fails, and the '-nolinux' command line option has been added just incase the auto detect returns a false positive in some situations.<br/>
-Usability menu now works through Proton<br/>
-Fixed a number of issues with Mod types loading incorrectly through Proton (Dord's Weapons and any other assembly with weird characters in it's name such as ' will benefit from this)<br/>
-Fixed some rendering issues on Proton</p>

      <title>Wine 7.6 out now with more PE conversion work, Mono updated</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> is the compatibility layer that allows you to run games and applications developed for Windows - on Linux (plus also macOS and BSD). A new development release is out with Wine 7.6. It's a major part of what makes up <a href="http://steamproton.com" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> and enables a ton of games to work on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>. Once a year or so, a new stable release is made.</p>
<p>Here's what they listed as the highlights in Wine 7.6:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 7.2.0.</li>
<li>More progress on the PE conversion of graphics drivers.</li>
<li>Locale support using the new CLDR-based database.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As we explained previously: the continued conversion of various modules to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> is another change that will gradually increase compatibility in many ways over time for certain expected behaviour needed by Windows applications. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use PE instead.</p>
<p>17 bugs were noted as solved including issues for: The Crew (Uplay), Oculus Runtime, SteelSeries GG installer, Silk Road: Tale of the Star Island, Adobe Photoshop 7.0 and others.</p>

      <title>Godfall Ultimate Edition seems to run well on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godfall Ultimate Edition released onto Steam on April 7, a former Epic Store exclusive, and now thanks to the Steam release it runs very nicely on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>"Aperion is on the precipice of ruin. You are the last of the Valorian knights, god-like warriors able to equip Valorplates, legendary armor sets that transform wielders into unstoppable masters of melee combat. Ascend in Godfall, the first-of-its-kind, looter-slasher, melee action-RPG."</p>
<p>Here's some quick footage of it running on a Steam Deck. The initial intro story cutscene giving a quick bit of history seems out of sync though, although okay at the start during the fight scenes it doesn't match up at all to what's happening and that can be reproduced across Proton 7, Proton Experimental and GE-Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g6tuHVb44G0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e4f966e9477059dec2798a088bb9ff3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g6tuHVb44G0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Linux Mint working on a new upgrade tool for major releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint, the distribution that tries to set itself apart for beginners (but not only) along with their own Cinnamon desktop environment, <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4293" target="_blank">have some plans</a> to help users upgrade.</p>
<p>Jumping between small releases is currently fine, since Linux Mint sticks to the same Ubuntu package base. However, upgrading to a new major version can be a hassle. Thankfully, they're working on solving this issue with a brand new upgrade tool in the works.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8462209831649430316gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8462209831649430316gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Compared with the existing upgrade tool these are the main features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It’s fully graphical, no command line.</li>
<li>It’s localized (the existing tool is only in English).</li>
<li>It performs more checks to make sure everything is fine (for instance it checks that you are connected to AC power, free space vs download size, list of removed packages etc..).</li>
<li>It’s configurable (even though you really shouldn’t skip anything, it does allow you to disable some requirements, such as the presence of a Timeshift snapshot).</li>
<li>It preserves your choice of mirrors (it checks to see if they’re compatible, responsive and up to date)</li>
<li>It doesn’t force you to remove your custom repositories and PPAs (it checks whether or not they support the target release though)</li>
<li>It warns but lets you keep orphaned packages (packages which aren’t present in repositories)</li>
<li>It provides and handles solutions (for most detected issues, along with the explanation you’ll just need to click a “Fix” button to solve the issue).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also said it's the "number one priority" this current development cycle, and they will be using it for people who jump between the LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition) versions 4 and 5 first and then later for Linux Mint 20.3 to Linux Mint 21. It makes sense to use it on the lesser used version to help iron out any kinks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Linux Mint 21 is codenamed "Vanessa" and it will be based on Ubuntu 22.04 and support 3 editions: Cinnamon, MATE and Xfce.</p>

      <title>War Thunder gets officially Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gaijin Entertainment has updated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236390/War_Thunder" target="_blank">War Thunder</a>, and as a result it went through Deck Verified once again to get a fully Verified status for the Steam Deck. This seems to have be done on their Native Linux build too, so they put in some real effort for this.</p>
<p>They didn't say what exactly they changed though, here's their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good news everyone! The War Thunder development team have fully optimized the game for the newest Steam Deck gaming devices that hit the shelves at the end of February. Steam Deck players were able to play War Thunder right from the platform’s release point, but there were still some minor compatibility issues. We did our best to complete optimization, and are proud to announce the full compatibility check mark recently received from the Steam Deck developers.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands players worldwide come to play War Thunder daily. Players from various platforms can take command of combat vehicles in one battle: Windows, Mac, PlayStation, Xbox, Linux. Now, a growing audience of Steam Deck owners joins us, who are able to play with their Steam account and easily share the achieved progress between platforms. Welcome aboard!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's good news, as one of the more popular games on Steam where the anti-cheat is also supported. War Thunder sees regularly close to 70,000 players online at any one time meaning it's constantly in the top 20 Steam games.</p>
<p>Do you think you'll be playing War Thunder on Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi OS gets some big updates, possible to run experimental Wayland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Raspberry Pi OS has been through a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-bullseye-update-april-2022/" target="_blank">big update</a> recently, which fans of the little devices need to be aware of for future setups and upgrades.</p>
<p>First, in the name of security, the default "pi" user is no more. Why? Well, attacks are on the rise, and since the RPi is incredibly popular, it is obviously a target. Removing the default name is just another small barrier that anyone doing something naughty has to overcome, as they might now need your username directly too. That, and new legislation from some countries that forbid having default login info. Seems like a sane change regardless, so their install wizard (that's now required to use) was upgraded to create a proper user account.</p>
<p>On top of that, hassles of Bluetooth during setup should be a thing of the past. Now, it will tell you to set your devices into pairing mode and sync them up.</p>
<p>As for the future: say hello to Wayland. Everywhere it is beginning to replace X and the Raspberry Pi OS has been making preparations on that front too. They switched to mutter to help with this, and now you can also test out a very experimental version of RPi OS on Wayland (but they don't recommend it yet), with many features not yet hooked up fully or at all. Plenty of it is also running under XWayland, so it's not a "pure" Wayland implementation of the desktop.</p>

      <title>Zink, the OpenGL on top of Vulkan driver gets &#39;Kopper&#39; merged — huge for the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zink is an open source driver layer that gives OpenGL on top of Vulkan, it's been in progress for some time now, steadily making progress. Just recently, a big advancement was pulled in.</p>
<p>It's called "Kopper" (previously "Copper"), which is what allows Zink to talk to your Linux system properly. Thanks to this being merged in, it will provide proper GLX window handling to Vulkan WSI handling. What does this actually mean? Well, developer Mike Blumenkrantz who worked a lot on it mentioned in a <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/big-marge/" target="_blank">blog post</a> these simple points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Zink now uses Vulkan WSI and has actual swapchains</li>
<li>Combinations of clunky Mesa environment variables are no longer needed; <code class="inline-code">MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=zink</code> will work for all drivers</li>
<li>Some things that didn’t used to work now work</li>
<li>Some things that used to work now don’t</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, lots of cases of garbled/flickering rendering (I’m looking at you, Supertuxkart on ANV) will now be perfectly smooth and without issue.</p>
<p>Also there’s no swapinterval control yet, so X11 clients will have no choice but to churn out the maximum amount of FPS possible at all times.</p>
<p>You (probably?) aren’t going to be able to run a compositor on zink just yet, but it’s on the 22.1 TODO list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developer Christian F.K. Schaller <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2022/04/07/why-is-kopper-and-zink-important-aka-the-future-of-opengl/" target="_blank">explained</a> further on why this is all important for Zink. In short, it means "that you can get full OpenGL support even if your GPU only has a Vulkan driver available and it also means you can for instance run GNOME on top of this stack thanks to the addition of Kopper to Zink".</p>
<p>A massive step for the Zink driver. This is really ending up quite exciting for the future of Linux. Imagine it: driver vendors no longer shipping OpenGL but just Vulkan, with Zink handling the OpenGL side with all the performance and power that comes with Vulkan and any updates to Zink can benefit them all. As Schaller notes, it's all about backwards compatibility and "it will also at some point help reduce the amount of code we need to ship and maintain significantly as we can just rely on Zink and Kopper everywhere which of course reduces the workload for maintainers".</p>
<p>Sounds pretty great to me.</p>

      <title>Sorry Arch (EndeavourOS), it&#39;s not working out any more and hello Fedora</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There comes a time when everyone has to sit and think about what they use on their PC, especially if you're on Linux. For me, Arch Linux (via EndeavourOS) just wasn't working out any more and so I've moved to Fedora.</p>
<p>While I was reasonably happy with Arch Linux, it's just not stable enough for me <em>personally</em>. It's a very subjective thing of course, and highly dependent on what hardware you use — along with how often you update. For me, it just messed things up a bit too often, and last night was the final straw.</p>
<p>I updated either that day, or the day before, and just before a livestream was due to start, my SteelSeries headset no longer worked. No matter what I tried, following guide after guide about PipeWire, nothing helped. Just this weird and very quiet electrical static noise whenever I tried piping audio to it. Eventually it worked again by some downgrading, plus random hotplugging and testing it on a Windows machine for a sanity check and it started somewhat working again. My Microphone was another issue, at the same time it decided to be ridiculously quiet for no apparent reason I could see so there were wider problems. I had <em>enough</em>, I had work to do and after hours of hair-pulling — hello from Fedora.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5511528831649415297gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5511528831649415297gol1.png"/></a>Fedora's KDE Spin</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, with the likes of Flathub / Flatpak packages and how far along apps like Discover have come along for installing packages and setting things up, there's not a whole lot to learn. It's been a very long time since I used Fedora, and it was one of my first Linux distributions I tried sticking with back when it was "Fedora Core" and wow — it's always surprising to see how far we've come as a platform for doing anything.</p>
<p>Fedora does come with some of its own issues, like NVIDIA drivers being a nuisance to install, which they definitely should improve. If other distributions can do one-click or one-line installs, I'm sure they could do it too. However, it's just another point towards me swapping to AMD when prices settle, or perhaps Intel when Arc properly launches for desktop. I also need to figure out why Dropbox won't load on startup, some little things like that.</p>
<p>Anyway, are you really a Linux nerd if you don't distro-hop at least once a year? Jokes aside, I look forward to seeing why people keep recommending Fedora nowadays as a stable distribution, let's see how long it takes me to break it.</p>

      <title>Valve marks the first month of the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220644827954565734" target="_blank">news post</a> going over some of the changes and improvements of the Steam Deck over the first month since the initial release. There's a lot that's been going on, with updates releasing rather regularly. Most of it, we've already gone over in articles you can follow on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">Steam Deck tag</a> and videos on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube Channel</a>.</p>
<p>Some of what's mentioned includes jumping over 2,000 Verified and Playable titles, which is a nice healthy number for such a new system. There's quite a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/valve-gathering-a-list-of-deck-verified-games-that-have-problems/" target="_blank">lot of issues</a> there though, they know this, and so the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/looks-like-valve-are-adding-a-feedback-system-for-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">feedback system</a> was introduced to see how different the experience is compared with Deck Verified and what players actually see.</p>
<p>Anti-Cheat is another one, perhaps the <em>biggest</em> mountain the Deck has yet to climb even a little. This is the first time anyone official has actually mentioned Apex Legends, which got <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/apex-legends-gets-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">officially Deck Verified last month</a>, so that's nice to see. They also noted Elden Ring as another that has Easy Anti-Cheat hooked up. Valve say of course "One of our top priorities is to support as many titles on Steam as possible, and this includes titles that employ anti-cheat technology." but only having two new games to note is just showing how difficult it is to get developers to do it.</p>
<p>There's a few other points that Valve went over, but if you've read much on the Steam Deck from me or others, it will all be old news by now. Like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/microsoft-announce-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-steam-deck-with-edge/" target="_blank">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>, many <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-gets-a-small-update-to-fix-downloads-adds-triggers-for-keyboard/" target="_blank">Keyboard improvements</a>, Windows drivers and so on.</p>
<p>Valve did their own little overview too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OhfZ2exhBhs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25022b8ab9ef2cef5ba4474459b9e665.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OhfZ2exhBhs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall, it's been a fantastic month for the Steam Deck and Linux Gaming as a whole thanks to it and all of Valve's effort in making it a success. They're doing a huge amount right.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a small update to fix Downloads, adds Triggers for Keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again Steam Deck fans, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3220644827957420569" target="_blank">another</a> upgrading ready and waiting to be downloaded. This time though, it's a pretty small one with only a few changes. All welcome changes though of course.</p>
<p>Some users noticed recently that downloading on the Steam Deck might cause the Steam Client to freeze. Obviously a pretty major problem and one thankfully Valve has solved quite quickly since the last update.</p>
<p>On top of that, they continue to make using the on-screen Keyboard even better. Only recently they introduced dual trackpad typing, like that found in Big Picture Mode with the Steam Controller that many people missed. Now, they've tweaked it even further. You can use the Left and Right Triggers to select keys and in addition, there's options to adjust the sensitivity of the trackpads which sounds ideal for people to get it exactly where they want it.</p>
<p>My quick look at the Steam Deck Keyboard if you missed it:</p>

      <title>How to give Valve feedback when Steam Deck (Proton) games have issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While this may be something Linux users are used to, players new to the Steam Deck should be aware of how to catch issues for Valve to hopefully fix up Proton.</p>
<p>Here's the thing: for the majority of games on Steam Deck, they won't be Linux Native. Instead, they will rely on the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games on SteamOS which is based on Arch Linux. It's not perfect, there are issues and here's how you can catch them.</p>
<p>If you have a problematic game (yes, even Verified or Playable), here's what to do:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WMjnIKW9f58"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83c2f541a852f1e9043c22051fc48a40.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WMjnIKW9f58" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide, here's what to do:</p>
<p><em>You can tell a game on Steam Deck is using Proton in the Game Info tab, below the Compatibility note box.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the game in your Steam Library -&gt; tap the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Go down to Properties</li>
<li>In the General section (the first tab), enter this Launch Option: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_LOG=1 %command%</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now any time you run this game, it will create a log file of everything it's doing with Proton in your <em>home</em> folder. It will be named along the lines of "steam-1672970.log".</p>
<p>Next go to the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues" target="_blank">Proton GitHub Issues page</a>, search for your game and if a post already exists, add your log in a comment and explain what happened. Or, create a new issue, and it will give you a template to fill out.</p>

      <title>Xbox Games Studios talk up more of their games on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still a little weird to see but Xbox Games Studios have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/3090835/view/3106927664829135594" target="_blank">talked about</a> more of their games running on Steam Deck, a system powered by Linux. Not the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/even-xbox-game-studios-are-talking-about-steam-deck-compaitibility/" target="_blank">first time they've done</a> this and likely won't be the last, heck they even showed how to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/microsoft-announce-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-steam-deck-with-edge/" target="_blank">Xbox Cloud Gaming running</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Deck Verified</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fable Anniversary</li>
<li>Halo Wars: Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Ori and the Blind Forest: Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Killer Instinct</li>
<li>Kalimba</li>
<li>Halo: Spartan Strike</li>
<li>RUSH: A Disney - PIXAR Adventure</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deck Playable</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minecraft Dungeons</li>
<li>Gears Tactics</li>
<li>Deadlight</li>
<li>Halo: Spartan Assault</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a video of how Minecraft Dungeons runs on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9AYyTsgrXwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2aaf56a2e01ec3e9882daa6c0f882b18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9AYyTsgrXwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>An important note: while Valve has given Minecraft Dungeons a Playable rating, there's an issue where it can freeze when you complete a mission and get to open a chest. Luckily, reloading still gives you the chest. I've seen this on a Linux Desktop and on Steam Deck. Seems this bug was <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5246#issuecomment-1059720840" target="_blank">reported</a> previously.</p>
<p>While no doubt some other reporters will claim Microsoft has suddenly made them compatible or available, let's keep things grounded. Microsoft and Xbox Game Studios here actually did, well, not much really (apart from set some default settings perhaps). All of this is thanks to Valve's work and funding for the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux. Regardless, it's fun to see XGS talk about the Steam Deck in a positive way.</p>

      <title>The Hand of Merlin to get full Native Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Room-C Games working with Croteam have announced that The Hand of Merlin will see full Steam Deck support, as work continues on their Native Linux version.</p>
<p>The Linux version has been available in Beta for a while but they're not quite finished with it to tick the box and have it show on the Steam store. The good news is that they've also been testing on Steam Deck, where it works great, and they think it should get bumped from Playable to Verified when done.</p>
<p>As they stated in their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/600610/announcements/detail/3186867830748570723" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First things first, we've already been working on supporting Linux natively. Although we haven't ticked the box to make this official on the store page yet, the native Linux (and macOS) executables have been available for some time now, and a few of our dedicated fans have been helping out with compatibility testing. This means we do not require Proton (a Windows emulation layer) to run our game on SteamOS / Steam Deck. In other words, there's no risk of an emulation layer introducing bugs or instabilities, plus there's zero overhead, which improves both performance and battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the biggest gruntwork was updating our Steam API support from a fairly old version (that came by default in Serious Engine 4) to the newest one required by Steam Deck. This allowed us to correctly identify the input controls: both the touchscreen and the gamepad, and I have to say - planning ahead really helped us out here. With Steam Big Picture mode already supported via our dynamic UI scaling system, font legibility was no issue at all. Having already done full gamepad support, once we updated the Steam API, the controls also Just Worked(TM).</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zvPwlH92acc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d6a4a996cddb2aad4fa365a53101dd6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zvPwlH92acc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So at some point we should see a great experience with this on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>RimWorld now includes full Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ludeon Studios have updated RimWorld, tweaking lots of areas to improve their support of the Steam Deck. Available previously as a Beta that included some of the changes, it's now available to all players.</p>
<p>The original developer who was working on Steam Deck support was sadly caught up in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Ludeon Studios mentioning they are now safe.</p>
<p>There's quite a <em>lot</em> of changes involved to improve the controls for the Steam Deck and just generally make it work a little better. The gist of the update is that it makes "the Deck controls more intuitive, refines the touchscreen interface, improves the UI and keyboard, and adds an easy way to access the Deck's controller config options".</p>
<p>For those who want to see, here's all those that directly affected Steam Deck and Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Ideology Improvements</div>
- Show accept key command hotkey on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Set new, better SteamDeck menu icons.<br/>
- Larger float menu options on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Keyboard on a SteamDeck now shows automatically when a new text field is focused.<br/>
- Show a special window at the top of the screen which shows the typed in text, since SteamDeck keyboard can sometimes block the text field view.<br/>
- Increase text input font size.<br/>
- Don't show tooltips when the SteamDeck keyboard is open.<br/>
- Change quests SteamDeck icon.<br/>
 
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Controls</div>
- Touch screen scrolling improvements on SteamDeck.<br/>
- It's now possible to scroll through lists by dragging your finger on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Make zooming faster on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Holding a special "middle mouse button" button on SteamDeck, now translates left clicks into right clicks. This makes it possible to give goto orders to drafted pawns by using the touch screen.<br/>
- Don't pan the camera if the middle mouse button is held and a colonist is selected on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Allow more zoom on SteamDeck for better touch screen support and easier navigation.<br/>
- Better time controls on SteamDeck, it's now possible to increase/decrease time speed with back buttons.<br/>
- Accept key on a SteamDeck now activates the first command.<br/>
 
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Misc Improvements</div>
- Tutorial now mentions the correct button names on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Added triggered modal ConceptDefs which explain SteamDeck controls.<br/>
- Added controller configuration button to options on SteamDeck.<br/>
 
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Technical</div>
- Added SteamDeck configuration file.<br/>
- Added SteamInput.<br/>
- Suppress SteamDeck ConceptDef warnings.<br/>
- Updated Steamworks so that it's possible to show the correct on-screen keyboard on SteamDeck.<br/>
- Added "Simulate using Steam Deck" debug setting.<br/>
 
<div class="bbcodes_Header2_38_5M BB_Header2 eventbbcodeparser_Header2_QuKtT">Fixes</div>
<p>- Fix: Mouse position never updates on Linux builds.<br/>
- Fix: Missing EventUp event in MultiPawnGotoController on SteamDeck<br/>
- Fix camera movement on SteamDeck. "Middle mouse button" camera movement on SteamDeck now works as well. This also allows using touch screen to move the camera.<br/>
- Fix: Mouse position never updates on a SteamDeck<br/>
- Fix: Q and E hotkeys shown on a SteamDeck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/3133947359554382338" target="_blank">announced</a> previously in early March they would allow developers to add a note to their compatibility rating, and this is the first time I actually saw it in action for RimWorld. This linked to Ludeon Studios' previous blog post about upcoming improvements.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17653910471649320941gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Perhaps now it will see a bump up to Verified status. It will also be interesting to see if they reverify against the Native build, as previously it was rated with Proton.</p>
<p>You can see a previous quick-look I did below:</p>

<p>Half-Life Alyx: LEVITATION is an impressive looking upcoming mod for Valve's incredible VR experience. Probably one of the best games and gaming experiences, I've ever had. I'm itching to play a whole lot more in this world.</p>
<p>It will be difficult for any mod team to create a comparable experience, especially with the added extras that a VR game mod will need but this really does look promising.</p>
<p>Due to arrive sometime in Q3, a new trailer has been released:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KO2Hu3NynN8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/632ab8f36fcdcea9f790de6ae41081c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KO2Hu3NynN8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Will be great for those who can <em>actually</em> play it on Linux though, as I've been getting the "Timed out waiting for response from Mongoose" error for months now and I've been unable to play it either Native Linux or through Proton. It's <em>incredibly</em> frustrating Valve has left it in this state — with some seeing <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/332" target="_blank">the error</a> since 2020. Other VR games work fine, it only seems to happen to Alyx. Valve, please fix it.</p>

      <title>GOG attempt to bring customers back with a revival of Good Old Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> aren't having the best of times recently, with details about their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">financial troubles</a> painting a bleak picture, although it seems they have something of a plan. Later they announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/gog-update-their-stance-on-drm-free-galaxy-as-optional-for-single-player/" target="_blank">some changes</a>, including a tweak to what they mean by DRM free.</p>
<p>Now? They're attempting to go back to their roots, at least little, to woo customers back to their store with a small revival of "Good Old Games", what they were originally known as. The start of this is the addition of a <a href="https://track.adtraction.com/t/t?a=1578845458&amp;as=1636858786&amp;t=2&amp;tk=1&amp;url=https://www.gog.com/en/games?tags=good-old-game" target="_blank">Good Old Games tag</a>, which GOG say will "showcase over 500 games that our Team has deemed iconic classics".</p>
<p>This is one reason I liked GOG originally, their commitment to bringing back and supporting old games, but they lost their way somewhat when trying to become just another store. Hopefully they will be doing more as time goes on to revive old games. Plenty of older games nowadays can run on Linux just fine through all sorts of open source game engines, and having an easy and legal place to get them for the data files is great.</p>
<p>To go along with this announcement, today they released the classic FPS, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_wheel_of_time" target="_blank">The Wheel of Time</a>. GOG say this was done in cooperation with Nightdive Studios and that the "efforts and in-house expertise of GOG’s Tech Team the game received modern OS compatibility and hi-resolution support". Although, by modern OS, they only mean Windows specifically.</p>

      <title>Toasty: Ashes of Dusk confirm a Native Linux build is planned, shown off on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Toasty: Ashes of Dusk is an upcoming action RPG that honestly looks great, and now Pocket Llama has issued an update to confirm they will be doing Native Linux support. It's currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocketllama/toasty-ashes-of-dusk/description" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a>, with a little publishing hand from Top Hat Studios (who reached out to use about this) and it's managed to be successfully funded with 22 still to go on the campaign.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocketllama/toasty-ashes-of-dusk/posts/3473532" target="_blank">update</a> they said "Thanks to support from our engine provider for the operating system, we're happy to announce that Toasty can run natively on Linux systems, and thus on the Steam Deck as well!". They also showed it running directly on a Steam Deck and confirmed it "runs great" and that "While the install base may not be huge for Linux, we're dedicated to making sure the game can be played by as many players as possible, and all players will be able to receive the optimal Toasty experience".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Open source XR runtime Monado adds initial 6DoF &#39;inside-out&#39; tracking support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a little while since we heard progress on Monado, the free and open source XR (VR / AR) runtime for Linux but it has been progressing nicely with a big new feature added. Developer Mateo de Mayo had a six-month internship at Collabora, and decided to <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2022/04/05/visual-inertial-tracking-support-for-monado-openxr/" target="_blank">do a write up</a> on this exciting enhancement for Monado.</p>
<p>Pretty tech-heavy stuff here, and not something for regular consumers to read through and think "ah yes, I understood all that". The basic gist is that Monado, on Linux, can now support XR devices that have cameras and an IMU (Inertial measurement unit) to provide 6DoF (inside-out) tracking utilizing other open source projects like <a href="https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Kimera-VIO/" target="_blank">Kimera-VIO</a>, <a href="https://github.com/UZ-SLAMLab/ORB_SLAM3" target="_blank">ORB-SLAM3</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/VladyslavUsenko/basalt" target="_blank">Basalt.</a></p>
<p>Check out their example video in action, the video shows "an OpenXR application (bottom right), running on Monado, using a RealSense D455 as the data source (top left) and Basalt as the SLAM backend (top right)":</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9g-GWvHke9Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3dc730b410a7b5f99dc240d0a13f379f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9g-GWvHke9Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Collabora also continue <a href="https://www.collabora.com/careers.html" target="_blank">hiring</a>, so if you're after a job in open source and this kind of thing sounds like fun maybe it's time to send them your details.</p>

      <title>GPD are getting quite desperate against the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Think <a href="https://www.gpd.hk/" target="_blank">GPD</a> are a trustworthy company to buy devices from? Well, with the Steam Deck now here, they appear desperate.</p>
<p>Recently, they started taking various Steam Deck videos from YouTube creators, sticking them together with a look at their own devices and not crediting any of the people who put the work into those videos. On top of that, GPD has been attaching a "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)" license to the videos, again, without permission from the original creators.</p>
<p>It's not a good look, and some of those creators have started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/UgkxvpsD43QKbz6ZS_HSFiJasrYZ-eo6ozW4" target="_blank">fighting back</a>.</p>
<p>When pulling them up on it on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1509896729633697801" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, I expected some sort of reply (even a snarky one to my obvious bait) or just to do the honourable thing to correctly get permission for using videos from other people. At the very <em>least</em> slapping in a link to the channels they're pinching things from in the description / a pinned comment for people to see. Did any of that happen? No. Instead, here's the official response from GPD:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17314876361649241642gol1.png"/></p>
<p>I've never personally used one of their devices, and would have happily taken a look at any point with Linux installed onto one. Even some direct Steam Deck comparisons. Now though? This is not painting a good picture of GPD as a company.</p>
<p>Here's my video explainer:</p>

      <title>Space Haven adds gamepad support, gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news space sim colony-building fans, as Space Haven just got a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/979110/view/3200378629630609859" target="_blank">upgrade</a> and now it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Previously, it was given a Playable rating and it was tested with Proton. As of today, the developer released a new update adding in Steam Deck and Gamepad support directly. Seems they got a lightning fast turnaround on retesting, as it's now fully Verified with the Native Linux build, it's likely they sent Deck Verified their build before release to test to enable it to be Verified as it's released.</p>
<p>Other additions include a new wall style, meat and fruit plants have their own growth stage graphics and some bug fixes.</p>
<p>Space Haven is actually a <em>great</em> game, one worth checking out and thanks to this update — now even more so!</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/space-haven?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/space_haven?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/979110/Space_Haven/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Factorio improves low resolutions for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playing Factorio on Steam Deck and low screen resolutions gets better, with a fresh update out now for all players.</p>
<p>One of the problems a lot of developers face with the Steam Deck, is the screen size and resolution. A lot of games have quite a small interface, and text that cannot scale — an area that will be a constant improvement for games. Factorio being the latest that's tweaked it.</p>
<p>Along with various bug fixes, the latest update also makes adds some "GUI fixes and improvements for screen resolutions under 1920x1080" and also sets "the default GUI scale on the Steam Deck to 100%". Wube Software LTD. also improved performance when zoomed out, and the multiplayer games browser can now filter games that are hosted on dedicated servers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5538751491649239070gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5538751491649239070gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Will you be playing Factorio on Steam Deck? Hopefully this will push it more towards being Verified, as Valve have only given it a Playable rating for the Steam Deck currently. From my own test, it seems to run quite well but I'm not overly fond of the controls. It needs updating for gamepad icons for starters, as all the on-screen prompts are for keyboards. However, the official Steam Deck bindings for Steam Input make great use of Action Set Layers, to enable different functions when you hold down a certain button for example, and that works well but you need to learn them all to play it properly.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck improves Offline Mode switching, looks like a lock screen is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has updated the Steam Deck software again, this time giving a little improvement to the way they handle Offline Mode, plus a bunch of other improvements.</p>
<p>Before getting into what's available now though, how about something else that's exciting? It seems Valve are preparing to have a lock screen on the Steam Deck. This is something I've seen people mention as an issue on Reddit, as the Deck isn't just like a console, it's also a PC too with a full desktop mode where you can have more sensitive info. So, a little security makes sense. Thanks to a tip in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/commit/2ae90bd112cd2ebc3da54c72562dd580da526062#diff-ba7b9008074b7876f8483f3a292bffbe89a75c1e3de35697cee472038b9c175fR5717" target="_blank">SteamDB tracker</a> has shown that it's being worked on. Some of the relevant new text strings are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"LockScreen_IncorrectPIN": "Incorrect PIN, try again.",<br/>
"LockScreen_ForgotPIN": "Forgot your PIN?",<br/>
"LockScreen_ResetDescription": "If you have forgotten the system PIN for this Steam Deck, you can reset it by logging into Steam with the username and password of the user who created the PIN. You will need the password for %1$s.",<br/>
"LockScreen_ResetWarning": "By starting the reset process, the current user will be logged out of Steam and all games will be automatically closed.",<br/>
"LockScreen_Reset": "Reset PIN",<br/>
"LockScreenReset_Title": "Lock Screen PIN Reset",<br/>
"LockScreenReset_Body": "The lock screen PIN associated with your Steam Deck has been cleared. You will need to create a new PIN and enable the lock screen if you wish to continue using the feature.",<br/>
"LockScreenReset_Question": "Would you like to create a new lock screen PIN?",<br/>
"LockScreenReset_Settings": "Create new PIN",</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3215014689194345914" target="_blank">new</a> from the Deck update landing April 6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Offline Mode so that entering and exiting this mode no longer requires restarting Steam</li>
<li>Added support for showing the Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch controller equivalents of the Steam button in the footer</li>
<li>Added a new section to App Properties where users can provide Steam Deck Compatibility feedback or change their previous feedback</li>
<li>Added callout when a title has developer comments about Steam Deck compatibility to the Store on Steam Deck and on the desktop client</li>
<li>Added Steam Input API logo for layouts using the feature in the controller layout browser</li>
<li>Fixed collection detail view in the Library so that pressing B will now go back to the All Collections view</li>
<li>Fixed Store and Community views sometimes ignoring first button press</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Library preventing navigation from going back to all collections</li>
<li>Installing Chrome now installs the version from the flatpak stable repository</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Keyboard
<ul>
<li>Updated bounds for dual trackpad typing so that users can reach the extents of the keyboard more easily</li>
<li>Added dual trackpad typing support for Steam Items, Emoji keyboard, tintable emoji popup, and extended character row popup</li>
<li>Increased strength of haptics when moving trackpad pointer over a new key</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where a long press on tintable emojis didn't show the popup to select the actual tint colors</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the extended character popup was cut off if the long press was on a key in the top row</li>
<li>Fixed a focus bug after making a selection in the extended character row popup</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Big Picture keyboard and Steam Deck keyboard could both be visible in desktop mode</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad to see the adjustment on the trackpad typing, as I was finding it at times a little difficult to move around to the edges at times and testing this morning — it's a big improvement. The slight increase to the haptic feedback is a good touch too, feels better overall and just that bit more like real typing.</p>

      <title>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga runs on Steam Deck and Linux with GE-Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has rolled out today, and thankfully for fans of these LEGO games you can get it working on Steam Deck and Linux thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>In this case, specifically you need <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, the community-built version. Valve have given it an "Unsupported" rating on Steam Deck and it's not surprising for now. With the current Proton 7, even the intro movies are a mess of stuttering and out of sync audio. Proton Experimental is better but performance is still not great. GE-Proton 7.14 seems to work the best for now, although the game (even on Windows) has some performance problems overall it appears.</p>
<p>Here's an early look at it running on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wVwh2PIDBFE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c76e929ca717447bce1d6e56b284c5e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wVwh2PIDBFE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Getting it running initially was a mess though. For some reason, the download was quite corrupt and I had to verify the files on it <em>twice</em> to get it properly in shape. Seems I'm not the only one it happened to — strange. These things sadly happen from time to time.</p>
<p>Need to know how to install GE-Proton? It's quite simple. Here's the how on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6doaQNnHR60"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/37b4fc871ab3188f385a1c60a2e0949c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6doaQNnHR60" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can use the same method on a Linux desktop too. Text guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download ProtonUp-Qt from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a> (Using the Discover software centre on Steam Deck), or use the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">AppImage</a>.</li>
<li>Load ProtonUp-Qt, click Add Version and select the latest for GE-Proton, then hit Install.</li>
<li>Once done, restart Steam so it refreshes the compatibility tools list.</li>
<li>Go into the Properties menu for the game, select Compatibility on the left and tick the box to force a version and select the GE-Proton you downloaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore the Trilogies in Any Order – Players will relive the epic story of all nine films in the Skywalker Saga, and it all starts with picking the trilogy of their choice to begin the journey.</li>
<li>Play as Iconic Heroes and Villains –More than 300 playable characters from throughout the galaxy.</li>
<li>Discover Legendary Locales – Players can visit well known locales from their favorite Skywalker saga films .They can unlock and have the freedom to seamlessly travel to 23 planets as they play through the saga or explore and discover exciting quests.</li>
<li>Command Powerful Vehicles – More than 100 vehicles from across the galaxy to command. Join dogfights and defeat capital ships like the Super Star Destroyer that can be boarded and explored.</li>
<li>Immersive Player Experiences – String attacks together to form combo chains and fend off oncoming attacks. New blaster controls and mechanics allow players to aim with precision, or utilize the skills of a Jedi by wielding a lightsaber and using the power of The Force.</li>
<li>Upgradable Character Abilities – Exploration rewards players as they uncover Kyber Bricks which unlock new features and upgraded abilities across a range of character classes, including Jedi, Hero, Dark Side, Villain, Scavenger, Scoundrel, Bounty Hunter, Astromech Droid, and Protocol Droid.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Unreal Engine 5 has officially launched, lots of Linux and Vulkan improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being available in Early Access since May 2021 and Preview since February 2022, Epic Games has today released Unreal Engine 5 which will no doubt go on to power some of the biggest upcoming releases.</p>
<p>"With this release, we aim to empower both large and small teams to really push the boundaries of what’s possible, visually and interactively. UE5 will enable you to realize next-generation real-time 3D content and experiences with greater freedom, fidelity, and flexibility than ever before." — Epic Games.</p>
<p>Epic say that developers will be able to continue using "workflows supported in UE 4.27" but get access to the redesigned Unreal Editor, better performance, improved path tracing and the list goes on.</p>
<p>You can see the whole launch event livestream in the below YouTube video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7ZLibi6s_ew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8dc00fb82dabe75b99a99f629d22b789.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7ZLibi6s_ew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Two new starter samples have also been made for developers with:</p>
<p><strong>Lyra Starter Game</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lyra Starter Game is a sample gameplay project built alongside Unreal Engine 5 development to serve as an excellent starting point for creating new games, as well as a hands-on learning resource. We plan to continue to upgrade this living project with future releases to demonstrate our latest best practices.</p>

<p><strong>City Sample</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The City Sample is a free downloadable sample project that reveals how the city scene from The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience was built. The project—which consists of a complete city with buildings, vehicles, and crowds of MetaHuman characters—demonstrates how we used new and improved systems in Unreal Engine 5 to create the experience.</p>

<p>You will also find plenty of Linux and Vulkan improvements for Unreal Engine 5 including: Nanite and Lumen (with software ray tracing only) on Linux, the Unreal Build Tool was also upgraded to support Clang's sanitizers for Linux (and Android), Vulkan and Linux support was also added to their "GameplayMediaEncoder", compliant 64-bit image atomics in Vulkan that fixes all validation issues with 64-bit atomics and allows the use of RADV driver (AMD + Linux) for Nanite and Lumen, multiple crashes were solved for Linux and loads more like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Increased Unix Cycles64 resolution to 100ns</li>
<li>Fixed Unix crash messages printing a truncated memory address.</li>
<li>Added support for asynchronous logging on forked instances</li>
<li>SkeletalMeshComponents will now run multithreadable tasks on the taskgraph on forked multithreaded servers</li>
<li>Moved FForkProcessHelper code in Fork.cpp.</li>
<li>Added FForkProcessHelper::IsForkRequested function. This returns true when the process is set to fork child processes or simulate forking by itself.</li>
<li>Implemented FUnixPlatformMisc::GetCPUVendor and GetCPUBrand() for non x64 Linux platforms to read and parse the /proc/cpuinfo file. Added tables for 64-bit arm cpu implementers and part numbers. This table may have further updates in the future.</li>
<li>FUnixPlatformProcess::CreateProc no longer requires you to pass an absolute path to an executable. If passed an argument containing a program name but no path separators, it now searches directories specified in the $PATH environment variable in the same manner as the shell would. The underlying API has changed from posix_spawn to posix_spawnp, and failures are no longer treated as fatal.</li>
<li>Add Linux -crashhandlerstacksize command line option to set crash handler stack size.</li>
<li>Moved stack to mapped memory instead of allocating in the heap. This can set and reduce the size of the 200k stack significantly through the command line.</li>
<li>Add DumpGPU viewer script for Linux and Mac. To use this, run the DumpGPU command in the console. This will open a folder to the DumpGPU HTML files and data, plus OpenGPUDumpViewer.sh. If you open OpenGPUDumpViewer.sh, the GPU Viewer will open in your web browser.</li>
<li>Updated Linux SDL to 2.0.20.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Epic has confirmed that over 85 game studios are going to be using Unreal Engine 5 with more coming including The Coalition, CD PROJEKT RED, and Crystal Dynamics, who just revealed that they are building a new Tomb Raider game with UE5.</p>

      <title>A new tool &#39;unsnap&#39; helps you move from Snaps to Flatpaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to migrate over from Snaps to Flatpaks on your Linux machine? Well, unsnap is a new tool in the early stages that will help you do just that. Developed by Alan Pope, who previously worked for Canonical and was an advocate for Snap packages, it's certainly an eyebrow raising move.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: to allow you to quickly and easily migrate from Snap to Flatpak applications. Done over a two-stage process, it allows you to "view and/or edit the scripts prior to execution to validate or tweak them".</p>
<p>Right now, it's considered to be in the "Pre-alpha" stage, so not for production machines but eventually it could prove to be quite useful.</p>
<p>An example shot from Pope on the <a href="https://github.com/popey/unsnap" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17504075321649167454gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17504075321649167454gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Considering how popular Flatpak has become (especially with it used on the Steam Deck), it's not a big surprise to see something like this come along.</p>
<p>There's a lot more info on the <a href="https://github.com/popey/unsnap" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Steam Deck hit me over the head with feelings of nostalgia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something happened to me recently while playing the Steam Deck that I felt the need to share with you.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck may be a modern device but it's been giving me a <em>very</em> heavy dose of nostalgia recently. No, it's not because it's a <em>great</em> machine for emulation, which I've done very little of so far because so many amazing modern games work but for something totally different.</p>
<p>Here's something it reminds me of: I grew up with the likes of the Game Boy. In fact, I originally had the Game Boy Pocket, the one you could see through the case and get a look at the insides. I used to stay up far too late playing Pokémon Yellow, with one of those terrible bulky light and magnifier <a href="https://www.retronintendostore.com/gameboy-classic/gameboy-magnifying-glass-light" target="_blank">attachments</a> which had quite a bit of weight to it with the batteries inside. To me, the Steam Deck is bringing back memories of that. As weird as it might be to say from a modern device, the injection of nostalgia I've been getting has been quite wonderful.</p>
<p>Another favourite of mine was the Sega Mega Drive, also known as the Genesis. Another I stayed up late with playing through various versions of Sonic, Gunstar Heroes, Altered Beast and a great many more. Ah, the days of grabbing a box that contained more than one game on the cartridge — what an exciting time that was to be alive.</p>
<p>In my recent <a href="https://youtu.be/aPLI5f7yDCo" target="_blank">two month video</a> (and touched on <a href="https://youtu.be/PoG1yQr4D2M" target="_blank">with the long chat</a> between myself and YouTubers Jason, Gardiner and Nick), I mentioned how the Steam Deck freed me from my desk and how I enjoyed taking the Steam Deck to my sofa to chill-out with but it's a <em>lot</em> more than that.</p>
<p>The suspend feature, and how smooth it is, has become a true life saver. Slightly hyperbolic of course, this isn't life or death, but a fantastic bit of convenience. Being able to get a quick 20 or 30 minutes here and there between things, to just tap the power button and come back to the exact same spot later with hardly any battery drain is pure <strong>joy</strong>.</p>
<p>All these feelings of nostalgia just suddenly came rushing in recently, as I sat in bed tucked up with my Steam Deck one night playing games, I truly realised how far we've come with the tech and it's simply incredible. What Valve has done here is give us a device we can play our favourites from early console generations to some of the latest AAA games.</p>
<p>It's such a nerdy device but even so, I really hope it gains mass appeal for how versatile it is.</p>
<p>A brilliant comment I saw on one of my previous videos said to the effect of: it's my glass slipper that fits. That felt like a pretty fun comparison and I love it.</p>
<p>If you wish to hear me talk about this on video with the soothing visuals of the classic Gunstar Heroes played on a Steam Deck with RetroArch, check it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qHYVcIb9xbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/15a839370a260dc3ecb6f49b08279452.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qHYVcIb9xbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>ICYMI - Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/valve-might-send-steam-deck-purchase-emails-twice-a-week/" target="_blank">now ramping up production</a>, some emails will go out twice a week.</p>

      <title>Wine manager &#39;Bottles&#39; improves Steam Proton support, adds configurable environments</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bottles, a free and open source application for Linux (that works well on the Steam Deck), has another new release out bringing in major new features.</p>
<p>Since a previous version, it came with support for pre-configured environments (Gaming and Applications), which has been massively extended in version 2022.3.28. Now, you can setup your own configuration and share these environments with others, so in a way it's sliding closer to some capabilities of Lutris. These environments are configured with a YAML file making them easy to parse and read.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's improved support for Steam Play Proton directly. It's under heavy development and still experimental but Bottles can now read Steam Launch Options for games installed via Proton and deal with them in Bottles directly and configure certain settings in Bottles. This eventually might make it far easier than manually editing Steam launch options.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21099643731649161496gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21099643731649161496gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This release also brings a command-line environment for Bottles too, <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release.2022.3.28/" target="_blank">amongst other things</a>.</p>

      <title>Project Hospital gets big Steam Deck improvements in Patch 39</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>So to mix things up a little I'm taking this opportunity to announce I've decided to make another Monkey Island."</p>
<p>Then in a new post on April 4, the <a href="https://grumpygamer.com/return_to_monkey_island" target="_blank">real thing</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Plugin Loader gets upgraded, easier to install</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to mod the Steam Deck? SteamOS Plugin Manager (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steamos-plugin-manager-should-enable-lots-of-fun-on-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">covered here previously</a>) has been renamed to just <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader" target="_blank">Plugin Loader</a> and it's had a bit of a Python rewrite recently to make it better. As a result, it's now far easier to install too, along with having its first proper initial release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8213246971649154202gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8213246971649154202gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Just an example shot from the developer.</em></p>
<p>To install it, this is now all you need to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Go into the Steam Deck Settings</li>
<li>Under System -&gt; System Settings toggle <code class="inline-code">Enable Developer Mode</code></li>
<li>Scroll the sidebar all the way down and click on <code class="inline-code">Developer</code></li>
<li>Under Miscellaneous, enable <code class="inline-code">CEF Remote Debugging</code></li>
<li>Click on the <code class="inline-code">STEAM</code> button and select <code class="inline-code">Power</code> -&gt; <code class="inline-code">Switch to Desktop</code></li>
<li>Open a terminal and paste the following command into it: <code class="inline-code">curl -L https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/PluginLoader/raw/main/dist/install_release.sh | sh</code></li>
<li>Done! Reboot back into Gaming mode and enjoy your plugins!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It will create a "/home/deck/homebrew/plugins/" folder path where you can put Plugins you find inside.</p>
<p>Once some fun Plugins are available, I'll be taking a good look at it. Be sure to let us know if anything interesting releases that's properly compatible with it. Still early days for the project but it's incredibly promising and hopefully more will pick it up and help develop it further.</p>

      <title>dbrand now have Steam Deck Skins and Wraps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to customize your Steam Deck look to match your style? Well, at least with dbrand now you can and they have some nice looking choices to mix together.</p>
<p>On their system you can order (each being separate and costing extra): a front skin ($19.95), back skin ($14.95), trackpad skins ($4.95) and tempered glass screen protectors (two pack $24.95). There's 28 different skin colours or patterns in total, so you can really make something wild — or nice and tame, whatever you want.</p>
<p>You could come up with something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3582290131649152113gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3582290131649152113gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Or maybe this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14376013401649152114gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14376013401649152114gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Shipping will begin before the end of April. I've put an order in, so we can take a look once they ship.</p>
<p>Check them <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/steam-deck-skins" target="_blank">out on dbrand</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Developer Mode does not turn off the read-only filesystem</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was pointed out recently that there's been plenty of confusion on exactly what Developer Mode for the Steam Deck does. Even I've gotten it wrong in the past, so it's time to set the record straight. My friend and YouTube star Gardiner recently pointed it out on <a href="https://twitter.com/gardiner_bryant/status/1510801362535297025" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and it's worth repeating.</p>
<p>Developer Mode enables access to numerous extra options and tweaks on the Steam Deck, as the name suggests it's primarily meant for developers and there's a few bits and pieces in there that might help modders. It does <u>not</u>, however, turn off the read-only filesystem.</p>
<p>The confusion comes from Valve, as originally their <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/faq" target="_blank">developer documentation</a> (almost of us had to go on before their FAQs went live) mentioned this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Will SteamOS have a read-only immutable OS file system?</strong><br/>
<br/>
Yes. By default the OS updates will be distributed as a whole OS image. But any user can enter a developer mode, which will let them modify the file system and install packages like a normal distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now though, that's not the case. I sent a quick Twitter post to a Valve developer, who has now <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1511027026437632001" target="_blank">updated it</a> and corrected the record to be clearer. This is what it tells people now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Will SteamOS have a read-only immutable OS file system?</strong><br/>
<br/>
Yes. By default the OS updates will be distributed as a whole OS image, and we recommend installing additional applications via flatpak to avoid issues. If customers want to do more than what’s available by flatpak, they can turn off read-only mode. We don't recommend this though, as they may get their Steam Deck into a bad state or compromise their data. In addition, anything installed outside of flatpak (via pacman for instance) may be wiped with the next SteamOS update. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/671A-4453-E8D2-323C" target="_blank">More on that here.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning off the read-only filesystem requires a terminal command, which you can find in the previous link. Again, not recommended for the average user.</p>
<p>What does Developer Mode give you? Here's some of the options it currently opens up:</p>

      <title>Coromon is pretty much Pokemon for the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love monster catching and want a bit of a Pokemon-like game for the Steam Deck (or any Linux desktop too)? Check out the newly released Coromon. Developed by TRAGsoft, it released on March 31 and thanks to Steam Play Proton, it's working great out of the box.</p>
<p>"The sun begins to dawn on Velua, a new day for the world and a new day for you, a freshly minted Battle Researcher of the global research society known as Lux Solis. It’s your first day and everything goes smoothly until a mysterious force attacks your latest workplace. Build up a squad of Coromon, track down the invaders, and grapple with a rising threat that endangers everyone on Velua!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H2E3VXi_moQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/84a7792ec6e93fa2ac9c69dda1df1fba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H2E3VXi_moQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It <em>really</em> is a Pokemon-like, <em>massively</em> inspired by the classics but with plenty of modern touches. Honestly, it's so close to Pokemon you could say it's nearly a clone. All the basic mechanics are similar but it's unique enough to enjoy anyway thanks to the different setting and totally original creatures. The artwork is gorgeous too, I'm a little in love with the overall style of it. The developer seemingly hasn't really taken many risks here, using the tried and battle-tested mechanics from its inspiration.</p>
<p>The difficulty selection is a great addition too. Allowing players who want it, to have quite a challenge with battles becoming something you really need to be careful with on Hard mode, if a creature in your party faints in this mode, it will leave you. There's plenty of wiggle room to have the experience you want though.</p>
<p>Here's some of the early gameplay showing off the basic mechanics (captured on Steam Deck):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZRCRTavxLO0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6f3c6fa1eb3de1b53897da563eac27d5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZRCRTavxLO0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I can confirm it felt and looks great on Deck. Performance is a bit up and down in some places but you don't notice the spikes in actual gameplay. One problem <em>does</em> remain though, that I will <em>warn</em> you on: at random after a few encounters, it seems to drop down to 14FPS and lock itself there. No idea what the cause is so keep that in mind, other than that it's great and hasn't stopped me enjoying it but it is a real problem that needs to be solved.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build a team from more than 100 charming creatures, defined by their elements, traits, and skills. Catch, train then set them loose on your rivals!</li>
<li>Master a stamina-based battle system where every action costs energy, so choose skills and attacks carefully. Deal damage, sap enemy stamina with status effects, or nullify them through dozens of conditions to emerge victorious.</li>
<li>Challenge friends online and see whose Coromon squads are the best of the best.</li>
<li>Pursue the antagonists’ trail across six major zones and cities, with dozens of interconnecting routes to explore. Each one brimming with quests, secrets, and items to find.</li>
<li>Explore the furthest reaches of Velua, from frozen glacial caverns to the depths of blistering deserts.</li>
<li>Play a key role throughout a fully-fledged classic JRPG narrative, complete with plot twists, turns, and revelations that not all is as it seems...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1218210/Coromon/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve might send Steam Deck purchase emails twice a week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Keep an even closer eye on your inbox, as Valve has announced that we might see reservation emails for the Steam Deck go out twice a week sometimes now.</p>
<p>Each Monday is the usual day for new emails to go out, so people sitting waiting can finally put their Steam Deck order through. That might change some weeks, as Valve explained on <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1511019543803543556" target="_blank">Twitter</a> today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Q2! We've just sent out the first set of order emails to Q2 reservers (in order of reservation time). Starting today we're ramping up Steam Deck shipments, and will be sending more order availability emails every week. Sometimes even twice a week!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in a <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1511045220493787136" target="_blank">reply</a> to someone it was clarified as Monday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Since people were getting confused somehow on what a quarter is during a year, Valve also a little while ago updated the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">Steam Deck page</a> to show the months in brackets for when you can expect an email to come through. A refresher as apparently some people need it:</p>
<ul>
<li>January, February, and March (Q1)</li>
<li>April, May, and June (Q2)</li>
<li>July, August, and September (Q3)</li>
<li>October, November, and December (Q4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Really good to know Valve are able to ramp up production now, as they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/valve-expect-to-make-hundreds-of-thousands-of-steam-decks-next-month/" target="_blank">did say previously</a> they were expecting hundreds of thousands from this month onwards.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton gets upgraded with Feral GameMode added (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: And just like that, GameMode is gone. GE-Proton7-14 rolled out, which mentioned "Hotfix: Received more complaints than praise surrounding the gamemode change so I've reverted the changes. Gamemode is removed from the build and will not be used by default.". Really, you should stick with official Proton unless GE-Proton fixes a specific issue you need.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, the unofficial community-built version of the Proton compatibility layer has a new version out (and some hotfixes). Quick primer: Proton is a compatibility layer from Valve (who work with CodeWeavers), that runs Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck. Need more info on Steam Play and Proton? Check out <a href="http://www.steamproton.com" target="_blank">our page</a>.</p>
<p>This version of Proton, named GE-Proton (formerly Proton-GE), pulls in fixes faster but it comes without the quality assurance the official version has. It also has a fix a lot of people enjoy to enable videos in some games to work properly, where they don't with the official Proton.</p>
<p>GE-Proton7-11 and hotfixes up to GE-Proton7-13 are now available, here's what they add and fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Feral Interactive's '<a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" target="_blank">gamemode</a>' has been added to the build and will now be automatically used when games are launched (you no longer need to run 'gamemode %command%') (Thanks manueliglesiasgarcia!)</li>
<li>Proton Experimental bleeding edge wine build has been updated (fixes a prefix creation bug)</li>
<li>Several build-specific updates have been pulled from upstream proton</li>
<li>DXVK updated to git</li>
<li>VKD3D-Proton updated to git</li>
<li>DXVK-nvapi updated to git</li>
<li>A hotfix to enable New World since it's launcher hangs. The developer has added the Easy Anti-Cheat file needed for Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Adding GameMode by default though is a bit of a controversial change, since it can cause some games to crash (like Apex Legends). Hopefully the issue will be found and solved).</p>

      <title>Kitsune Zero DLC announced for Super Bernie World</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Bernie World, a free platformer that released back in 2020, is getting a paid DLC named Kitsune Zero. It's going to be a prequel to their upcoming platformer Kitsune Tails, which takes inspiration from platformers later in the 8-bit generation, that will release in 2023.</p>
<p>"Run, jump, and stomp on ghostlike creatures from Japanese folklore lurking in the countryside and castles. Collect powerups that make Yumi grow in size, grant fireball abilities, and make her invincible for a short time. Gather the necessary ingredients to break the pact's magic and take down the leader of the samurai clan to end the war.</p>
<p>Traverse four worlds, each containing two vibrant outdoor levels and one daunting medieval castle. Overcome the challenges of each of the 12 levels and unlock new bonus levels not seen in Super Bernie World! Explore environments based on Japanese culture and mythology in every realm and a story setting the stage for the next generation of kitsune in Kitsune Tails."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4YKptxDvnh8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c75ad2d637e7978bf632a9ce48081388.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4YKptxDvnh8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Kitsune Zero and Kitsune Tails don't just represent the past and present of the story we're telling in this universe, but also the start and end points of platformer conventions established on 8-bit consoles," said Emma ‘Eniko’ Maassen. "Each stands alone as its own special experience, but together they form a love letter from our team to the evolution of platformers during that era of gaming history."</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as a cute fox girl</li>
<li>Completely new graphics and story</li>
<li>Featuring new bonus worlds not available in Super Bernie World</li>
<li>Guaranteed 100% free from American electoral politics</li>
<li>Fully compatible with Super Bernie World any% speedruns</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1258040/Super_Bernie_World/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will also be on itch.io at release.</p>

      <title>Patrick&#39;s Parabox is an absolutely brilliant mind-bending puzzle game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Patrick's Parabox is a puzzle game about boxes within boxes, it's an absolute gem and I've had a fantastic time playing through this one. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>The reception to it seems to be great too, with a Very Positive user rating on Steam. It has less than 500 reviews right now though, which means plenty of people don't yet know about it. A shame, as puzzle game fans absolutely need to pick up and play this one and I truly mean that.</p>
<p>You've played Sokoban block-pushing puzzle games before I'm sure but nothing like this. It will at times melt down your brain and stuff it into a box. The idea is that you push boxes inside other boxes, that all need moving around into the correct positions. It constantly mixes it up and throws in little new mechanics and it's pure joy to play through.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rl_ohYPXNMo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cca7726f590ce6ecd60a30075b988289.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rl_ohYPXNMo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When you eventually get to levels of boxes within boxes within boxes of recursion, it can get challenging. However, Patrick's Parabox is careful not to truly overwhelm you. It's graceful on how it handles the difficulty that never feels ridiculous and I love it.</p>
<p>Could easily be the Puzzle Game of the Year.</p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://patricktraynor.itch.io/patricks-parabox" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260520/Patricks_Parabox/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Works really nicely on Steam Deck too, although you do need to quit via the Steam menu due to a black screen issue when you go to exit on Deck.</p>

      <title>RetroDECK is another solution for emulation gaming on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/emudeck-makes-emulation-on-steam-deck-nice-and-simple/" target="_blank">EmuDeck</a> not to your liking? Perhaps <a href="https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK" target="_blank">RetroDECK</a> might be what you're after for retro emulation on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Unlike EmuDeck that has you install multiple things in a list, and have them all separated, the idea of RetroDECK is more to bring a "one-click experience, and to separate retrogames from steam library" the developer says. It comes as a Flatpak to install, and from there it should have everything bundled together. Inspired by the likes of 351ELEC (what it's forked from), EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.</p>
<p>Powered by EmulationStation Desktop Edition, RetroArch and various standalone emulators it allows you to import your favourites into a tidy environment without flooding your Steam library. Available as a Flatpak you can easily download and install from GitHub, it's still early days yet but the idea is promising enough.</p>
<p>Right now, I couldn't personally get it to work properly and the developer said pretty clearly the current releases are intended for testing so it's one to keep an eye on perhaps. I love the idea of it having things properly integrated, far less hoops to jump through.</p>

      <title>Meifumado is an action game set in a post-apocalyptic world inspired by Japan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your pixel-art side-scrolling action RPGs? Keep an eye on Meifumado, as it looks pretty good and it will be coming to Linux the developer has confirmed. It recently had a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oldbit/meifumado" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> campaign, where Old Bit Studio raised $48,018 to bring out the full version.</p>
<p>It also popped up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1954130/Meifumado/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and it appeared to note Native Linux support in the system requirements. When asked about it the developer said to us: "Hello. Yes, it is correct. We didn't mention any OS. Kickstarter page says PC. That's including Linux." — so far Native fans it's another one to put on your wishlist.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep combat system offering multiple fighting styles, special attacks/abilities, sub-weapons and various weapon types.</li>
<li>Different non-combat skills: crafting, hunting, stealing.</li>
<li>Exploration of a vast, detailed open world ruined by a global war, consisting of many different kinds of locations divided into multiple metroidvania-structured levels; each with its unique environment and atmosphere.</li>
<li>Heavy focus on RPG elements: choices with consequences, multiple endings depending on player's actions, factions with their own ideologies, that player can join.</li>
<li>Story-driven side quests with multiple ways to complete.</li>
<li>Numerous side activities: guarding or raiding caravans, participation in fighting tournaments, gambling.</li>
<li>Highly detailed, beautiful pixel art with fluid animations.</li>

      <title>A Short Hike gets Steam Deck Support, and a 99 player multiplayer mod </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can now go on A Short Hike wherever you want with the Steam Deck and perhaps bring along a whole lot of friends too. More about it: Hike, climb, and soar through the peaceful mountainside landscapes of Hawk Peak Provincial Park. Follow the marked trails or explore the backcountry as you make your way to the summit. Along the way, meet other hikers, discover hidden treasures, and take in the world around you.</p>
<p>It's a game that's now Verified for the Linux-powered Steam Deck handheld from Valve! Here's what the developer improved for Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where keyboard glyphs would show up on the start screen even when a controller was plugged in.</li>
<li>Mouse movement alone no longer causes the game to switch from gamepad to keyboard controls.</li>
<li>An in-game license text window is now used when a controller is plugged in.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a sort-of April Fools joke but also a very real thing, there's also now "A Short Hike 99", a free multiplayer mod that allows 99 players to go hiking together. The developer will keep their server up for two weeks but they've also put out a way for anyone to host their own, so it can live on forever.</p>

      <title>Online platformer DDraceNetwork gets Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DDraceNetwork, a free and open source online co-op platformer now has Vulkan API integrated as of the latest update. Starting off life as a simple mod for Teeworlds, nowadays it's a popular standalone multiplayer platformer that can be quite the challenge.</p>
<p>Seems it's remaining somewhat popular too, especially with the Steam release, which sees over 2,000 players online at a time every day. Might not sound like a <em>lot</em> but it's more than the likes of some much more well-known indie and AAA titles, so it is pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Main improvements in the latest version:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[Client] New Vulkan graphics renderer for more FPS (enable in Graphics Settings)</li>
<li>[Client] Improved demo renderer performance</li>
<li>[Client] New players join Tutorial servers by default</li>
<li>[Client] Replace browser icons with font icons</li>
<li>[Editor] Quad knife tool</li>
</ul>

      <title>2,000 titles officially hit for Steam Deck as Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An impressive milestone has been hit just over a month after the release of the Steam Deck, with now over 2,000 titles being noted as Verified or Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>We know there's problems though, with some games being Verified or Playable where they shouldn't be, which is part of why Valve has a new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/looks-like-valve-are-adding-a-feedback-system-for-steam-deck-verified/" target="_blank">feedback system in place</a>. Overall though, it seems like a small minority of titles, the vast majority are being labelled correctly so it's still a good number to go by for players and potential buyers of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the latest numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1053 - Verified</li>
<li>986 - Playable</li>
<li>1036 - Unsupported</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the latest to be Verified or Playable include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Short Hike - Verified</li>
<li>DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR'S CUT - Verified</li>
<li>Fort Triumph - Verified</li>
<li>Killing Floor - Playable</li>
<li>Narita Boy - Verified</li>
<li>Rising Hell - Verified</li>
<li>The Outer Worlds - Playable</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't let the "Unsupported" tag for games be the decider on what you try either, plenty of them are false-negatives like Fallout 76 which works pretty nicely:</p>

      <title>Lutris version 0.5.10 brings improved Steam Deck support but no Flatpak yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lutris, the free and open source game manager for installing games on Linux from many stores, has a <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.10" target="_blank">new version</a> available as work continues to improve Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>While the headline feature from the developer is "Steam Deck support", it's not quite there yet. They've made plenty of steps towards it, but currently there's no Flatpak package that works properly, and so to install you still need to turn off the Deck's read-only filesystem (which we really don't recommend doing). Thankfully, work on the Flatpak is the priority for the next version! Additionally, there's a new "Create Steam shortcut" option to add games from Lutris to Steam so it can be used in Gaming Mode which sounds incredibly useful.</p>
<p><strong>New features include</strong></p>
<p>An expanded "Add Game" box with more options</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1308812661648888270gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1308812661648888270gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Support for Origin and Ubisoft Connect. They work the same as their Epic Games Store integration, with it needing to install the Windows clients. Sadly though, for now Humble Store is broken as Humble updated their API so work is needed to re-do that.</p>
<p>Here's some of the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add a coverart format</li>
<li>Download missing media on startup</li>
<li>Remove Winesteam runner (install Steam for Windows in Lutris instead)</li>
<li>PC (Linux and Windows) games have their own dedicated Nvidia shader cache</li>
<li>Add dgvoodoo2 option</li>
<li>Add option to enable BattleEye anti-cheat support (for those games that support it on Linux / Proton)</li>
<li>Default to Retroarch cores in ~/.config/retroarch/cores if available</li>
<li>Add support for downloading patches and DLC for GOG games</li>
<li>Add --export and --import command line flags to export a game a lutris game and re-import it (requires --dest for the destination path, feature still experimental)</li>
<li>Add command line flags to manage runners: --install-runner, --uninstall-runners, --list-runners, --list-wine-versions</li>
<li>Change behaviour of the "Stop" button, remove "Kill all Wine processes" action</li>
<li>Gamescope option is now disabled on Nvidia GPUs</li>
<li>Enable F-Sync by default</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Nightmare Reaper is a quality retro-themed FPS out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightmare Reaper, a retro-inspired FPS that blends together elements of a looter-shooter and a sprinkle of RPG mechanics, recently left Early Access and it works great on Linux and Steam Deck. With Steam Play Proton, it's a perfect experience. <u>Note</u>: key provided for me by Evolve PR.</p>
<p>A blending of many ideas from classic first-person shooters, a lot of the inspiration in the graphical style and level design is clear but it has plenty of modern tweaks too. While modern shooters continue to push the boundaries of graphics, they've lost a lot of what made them fun — which is why games like Nightmare Reaper are just so good. Absolutely pumping action with some great visual effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16054090691648815600gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16054090691648815600gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Your character is currently living in some sort of mental institution, and you've clearly not had an easy life. When you go to sleep, you sort-of lose grip on reality as each dream becomes a fight for your life in dark dungeons. The story might not be anything to write home about but that's okay, the gameplay and fast-paced shooting fully makes up for that side of it. Frankly, I could happily play through all the action without a hint of story because it just flows together so nicely.</p>
<p>Some of it is just complete chaos too, especially when you have the different enemy behaviours to account for while a few of them run right at you. Never a moment to panic though, with the speed of the game and the power of your weapons, ripping and tearing feels great here.</p>
<p>Here's a short look at it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FTHevtRj1Wk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02a657347d80adc7e95ea228b6676056.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FTHevtRj1Wk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Honestly it feels amazing on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Quite challenging at times too. While some of the enemies are easy, others are quite the bullet sponge and deal powerful blows you will need to try and quickly get around. Outside of the combat, there's a few places that need some careful platforming too.</p>
<p>You won't play the same game twice either, as it also merges random level generation with manually crafted levels too, so there's plenty to enjoy as your run through. Not only that, there's quite a few different types of weapons to get to allow you to mix and match your play-style. On top of that, weapons have different levels to them so there's plenty of customization on offer as well. It all adds up to an experience you can't forget.</p>
<p>Thoroughly entertaining, a little gory at times but the pixel style of it with the 2.5D theme really looks awesome. It hits the exact spots you want in such a shooter and you shouldn't miss out on this one.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1051690/Nightmare_Reaper/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Point and click adventure Pants Quest gets a Linux release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A point and click adventure game all about finding missing clothing? Well, there's been weirder things. Pants Quest gets a native Linux release.</p>
<p>"A classic style adventure game about life and finding your pants. The more our hero tries to find them, the more things seem to spin out of control. The tone is funny but also kind of introspective, following the kind of crappy morning that makes you rethink every decision you’ve ever made while wandering around in your underwear."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I8oApKjKUGA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a5b0ec79d8d771f4d5a38640978dead7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I8oApKjKUGA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite a short game this one at about 2 hours but seems like a good bit of comedy. A completely silly concept but if you love your classic adventures maybe one to run through with a coffee.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells &#39;Break the Bank&#39; free upgrade out, more big updates teased</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Motion Twin / Evil Empire have given us another great free update to the fantastic Dead Cells and teased plenty more is coming to the game. With this update you get The Bank, a brand-new optional biome that randomly appears in your run, replacing the immediately following biomes if you choose to enter it.</p>
<p>Here's the main points of the update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New optional biome – The Bank</li>
<li>3 new enemies</li>
<li>3 new gold-based weapons</li>
<li>3 new gold-based mutations</li>
<li>More updates and DLC are coming</li>
<li>Many QoL changes and bug fixes - my favourite is items dropped after boss fights now have +1 item level, so no more unsatisfying boss loot!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>As for what's coming next, they reiterated that the free updates are thanks to people buying the DLC, so support can continue for everyone. The good news is that more DLC and free updates are planned for a whole year, with some of it getting the developer "very, very excited".</p>

      <title>SteamOS Plugin Manager should enable lots of fun on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the same developer who created the support library for Tesla overlays, the <a href="https://github.com/WerWolv/SteamOS-Plugin-Manager" target="_blank">SteamOS Plugin Manager</a> is born and ready for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is going to be an absolute delight for people who want to hack away at the Steam Deck, and it can enable all kinds of things from music player integration to simple things like more quick-access buttons. I don't think it's possible to overstate just how awesome a project like this is. You don't even need to turn off the read-only filesystem to do it, and so changes made will be persistent too through OS upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10626873341648808674gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10626873341648808674gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Looks like the installation is reasonably easy too, but no doubt people will eventually find a way to make it super simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Installation</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the Steam Deck Settings</li>
<li>Under System -&gt; System Settings toggle <code class="inline-code">Enable Developer Mode</code></li>
<li>Scroll the sidebar all the way down and click on <code class="inline-code">Developer</code></li>
<li>Under Miscellaneous, enable <code class="inline-code">CEF Remote Debugging</code></li>
<li>Place the executable under <code class="inline-code">~/homebrew/services/plugin_manager</code>. Do not change the name of the file.</li>
<li>Place the plugin_manager.service file under <code class="inline-code">/etc/systemd/system</code></li>
<li>Open a Terminal and type <code class="inline-code">sudo systemctl --now enable plugin_manager</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Install Plugins</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply copy the plugin's .js file into <code class="inline-code">~/homebrew/services/plugin_manager/plugins</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will take a little while for Plugins to be created for it but now it's out in the wild, I cannot wait to see what people come up with, oh the possibilities!</p>
<p>There's seemingly no license on it right now, so I've asked the developer to add one so contributors will know what to expect from it. <strong>Update</strong>: the developer <a href="https://github.com/WerWolv/SteamOS-Plugin-Manager/issues/2#issuecomment-1085995398" target="_blank">replied</a>, and it's now under the GPL license, so it's properly open source.</p>

      <title>AI-powered map creator Dungeon Alchemist is now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a successful crowdfunding campaign a while ago, Dungeon Alchemist is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588530/Dungeon_Alchemist/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Not a game though, however, instead it's a special tool for creators to make really fancy looking maps to use elsewhere.</p>
<p>"Ever felt uninspired, technically challenged or just bored when creating your game maps? Dungeon Alchemist is AI-powered Fantasy Game Mapmaking Software that enables you to make high-quality content fast! Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="78j0pSZBFNE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6870a559b8f6375fd95e03cc66651501.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/78j0pSZBFNE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is a tool for RPG fans who like to create things, and have them printed out to play like some sort of a pen and paper tabletop RPG. Not only that though, it also supports some popular VTT programs too so you can create and import your projects into them and play them there.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An easy-to-use, intuitive interface that allows you to create high-quality maps, fast!</li>
<li>An ever-growing list of themes and rooms that can be instantly generated</li>
<li>A vast library of thousands of objects to be used in your maps</li>
<li>Tools that allow you to manipulate almost anything you create</li>
<li>Straightforward options to swap out floors, walls, windows, and doors on the fly</li>

<li>Export options that instantly create a map ready for print or to be imported seamlessly in your favourite VTT</li>
<li>Adjustable light settings</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's in Early Access and they estimate it shall remain there for about half a year.</p>

      <title>Minecraft Snapshot gets Ancient Cities and the Allay friendly mob</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang continue working towards the next major Minecraft update, with another Java Snapshot out now bringing in more big features to play with.</p>
<p>Snapshot <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-22w13a" target="_blank">22w13a</a> adds in the Allay a shiny blue friend for players that will collect items for you that matches what you're holding. To get an Allay to like you, they want to be handed an item and they also seem to love hearing noteblocks play tunes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4083571911648806686gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4083571911648806686gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The other major addition is the inclusion of Ancient Cities, which can be found in the Deep Dark biome. They were in an experimental version before, but now they've seen some big changes. There's a new Swift Sneaking enchantment you can find in chests guarded by Sculk Sensors and Shriekers, there's a new block called "Reinforced Deepslate" (not available in Survival) and no mobs spawn there — as they're supposed to be abandoned.</p>

      <title>GameMaker on Linux gets big improvements and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GameMaker Studio 2 is now just GameMaker, and there's a <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/en/blog/release-2022-3" target="_blank">new update</a> out with some dramatic improvements for Linux game exports and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>For far too long, GameMaker exports for Linux have required some very specific dependencies, which often caused issues for developers as they weren't included directly. Game developers had to go and manually grab these files to include with the Linux games. Now, that's not required - at least for Steam anyway.</p>
<p>If developers are putting their games on Steam, the export there will now properly target the Steam Linux Runtime, where Valve handle the dependencies and include a ton of them. It's what all Steam games for Linux should target. This means games should be click and play on Steam, with developers not needing extra steps. With this, they've also added direct support for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On top of that, their "Ubuntu (Linux)" target now gives an AppImage.</p>
<p>Their video player also got a nice upgrade, which now works on all platforms.</p>
<p>I have to say, I was a bit worried when YoYo Games were acquired by Opera but they seem to be doing some pretty good upgrades lately. It's just a shame they moved over to subscriptions for the software.</p>

      <title>Steam Client Beta gets Linux fixes like not re-download media pre-caching files</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not just the Steam Deck that is getting upgrades, as Valve are also tweaking the main Steam client with a fresh Beta release out now. This one actually does fix some pretty annoying issues, some of which should really make things easier.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3189118991320514548" target="_blank">new</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Cloud</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed sync error for games which have converted Cloud-saved files into directories</li>
<li>Fixed Cloud sync for some games with slightly malformed cross-platform Steam Cloud sync settings</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong>Linux</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where updating graphics drivers would re-download media pre-caching files</li>
<li>Added home and mounted drive paths to the file picker quick bar</li>
<li>Fixed the file picker extension filters not appearing when selecting Library custom art</li>
<li>Added the ability for the file picker to remember the previous location when selecting Library custom art</li>
<li>Fixed adding non-Steam shortcuts with spaces in the path</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see Valve finally pay some attention to the file picker, as that was left as extremely basic for so long. With the Steam Deck though, people are doing a lot with desktop mode with adding third-party software, so a lot of this was needed there too. Should just make doing that a smoother process. Good to see Valve really paying attention to every part of Steam lately.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a bunch more Keyboard tweaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve is really doing some great work on improving the Steam Deck, with another upgrade now available.</p>
<p>Just recently they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-gets-a-big-client-update-plus-deck-os-and-bios-beta-update/" target="_blank">overhauled the on-screen keyboard</a>, to give it the excellent dual-trackpad mode and now they've continued the tweaks. Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3215014689179840548" target="_blank">new</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Active keyboard theme is now loaded in desktop mode</li>
<li>Keyboard input is now sent on trackpad click down, instead of up, which should improve accuracy for fast trackpad typists</li>
<li>Made the default keyboard theme "pressed" key state more noticeable</li>
<li>Pressing R2/Enter no longer dismisses the keyboard in Desktop mode</li>
<li>Removed two second latency hiding trackpad cursors when the trackpads are no longer in use</li>
<li>Fixed issue with Steam Client on Desktop scaling when the standalone keyboard is shown</li>
<li>Fixed issue where transcoded video/audio was re-downloaded on a driver change</li>
<li>Fixed some missing localization in the controller configurator</li>
</ul>

      <title>The latest and greatest Vulkan extension has arrived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You thought they were done with the Vulkan API? Think again. To mark Vulkan 1.0 being 2236 days old (give or take), a brand new extension has been revealed. <em>This is an absolute game changer, there's no other way to frame this.</em></p>
<p>Presenting: <a href="http://printedsurface.ink/" target="_blank">VK_FOOL_printed_surface</a></p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton" target="_blank">Joshua Ashton</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liam-middlebrook" target="_blank">Liam Middlebrook</a>, who are both involved in many Linux related things, Liam handled the majority of the specification work, while Josh handled the CUPS layer implementation.</p>
<p>Okay, so what does it do? They say it's the "newest innovation in the cross section of the Printed Media and Vulkan ecosystems" and their hype around it is definitely warranted. This extension allows you to print frames, in Vulkan. That's right, printing for everyone and high ink rates too!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can print frames in Vulkan now! No longer are the days of yore when a frame would only last until the next vkQueuePresent() landed. Now you can cherish your favorite frames and have them last forever. Hang up your new family heirloom on the wall, or put them in a time-capsule for generations to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2167706041648745636gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2167706041648745636gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>"Bringing Vulkan to the workplace"</em></p>
<p>Of course the full Vulkan specification sheet has been upgraded for this new extension too, and it answers a lot of burning questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4) Printers are inherently complex devices which are not yet fully understood by humanity, does the current set of error codes available in Vulkan allow for implementations to adequately express the various states of disarray encountered when a print is not successful?</p>
<p>RESOLVED: To the best of our ability we have introduced new Vulkan error codes which should help implementations express the complex state of printers. This list is likely not exhaustive and may be expanded in a future extension.</p>
<p>7) Why would someone want to see a printed frame?</p>
<p>RESOLVED: This is a stupid question. For thousands of years humanity has pursued artistic passion and looked to immortalize their creations. This pursuit obviously extends to the printed frame.</p>
<p>21) Will the extension support tearing?</p>
<p>RESOLVED: No. The printed surface will only support perfect prints. Tearing is left to the end-user.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this a joke? What's going on? You decide. Only the smartest will be able to figure it out.</p>
<p>This can't possibly be real though right? See for yourself:</p>

      <title>Steam Play Proton could get direct support for NVIDIA Image Scaling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An engineer from NVIDIA has put up a Pull Request on the official Wine repository that Valve uses for Proton, suggesting a rather fun new feature be added.</p>
<p>Developer Eric Sullivan put up the Pull Request titled "<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine/pull/141" target="_blank">Support for NVIDIA Image Scaling</a>", if accepted it could mean a future release of Proton would enable users (of any GPU vendor - it's a simple shader) to upscale applications to the current display resolution with NVIDIA Image Scaling. The idea of that sounds pretty exciting, as the more options it supports the better.</p>
<p>While it's true developers can add options like this officially into games like what already happens with NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR and other tech, this is much more of a brute-force approach to give Proton the ability to do it to any game, (a bit like how you can do FSR on the Steam Deck).</p>
<p>From the pull request:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div class="edit-comment-hide">
<div class="comment-body markdown-body js-comment-body soft-wrap user-select-contain d-block">
<p>This pull request adds an option to fshack to upscale applications to the current display resolution with NVIDIA Image Scaling. It can be enabled by setting the WINE_FULLSCREEN_UPSCALER environment variable to "NIS". The NIS upscaler also supports using FP16 storage by setting WINE_NIS_UPSCALER_USE_FP16 to 1.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It should go without saying but I will anyway: this might not be accepted, so don't get overly excited just yet.</p>

      <title>OneXPlayer looking at shipping handhelds with SteamOS like the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://onexplayerstore.com/" target="_blank">OneXPlayer</a> are a series of handheld gaming devices, they're somewhat popular and it appears they've been keeping a close eye on SteamOS and how it's been working on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Currently they offer various models like the OneXPlayer Mini, OneXPlayer 1S, two AMD models and the One-GX 1 Laptop. However, all of them currently ship with Windows. Some of them are pretty powerful too, like the currently sold-out "ONEXPLAYER AMD® - 8.4 inch Ryzen® 5700U" model. Their prices are quite a bit higher than Steam Deck too, with that model in particular retailing at $1,419.</p>
<p>The good news is that they might actually be shipping SteamOS Linux in future, bringing them more in line with what the Steam Deck can do. As <a href="https://www.wepc.com/news/onexplayer-interview/" target="_blank">WePC</a> recently did an interview with the VP of OneXPlayer, Jason Zeng. Here's the excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zeng continued to share his opinions on Valve’s market-disrupting machine by giving his stance on how Valve managed to achieve success with the device. ‘Steam Deck is a very influential product that has managed to leverage its accumulated assets and bring [the] public’s attention to the field of portable gaming. We sincerely congratulate Steam Deck for its achievements, and will keep working on our competitive edges.’<br/>
<small>[…]</small><br/>
Of particular note is how the Proton developers actually improved performance in games such as Elden Ring, which highlights the OS against running something a little harder on the system like Windows 11. Zeng comments that the team has been ‘working on’ shipping the OneXPlayer line of devices with a build of Linux or SteamOS in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having more devices out there shipping Linux sound awesome. However, they seem to have no plans for cheaper devices right now, so you might want to keep waiting on and sticking with the Steam Deck if you don't have a ton of spare cash stuffed under your bed.</p>

      <title>Chrome on Steam Deck now supports the Deck Controller, with GeForce NOW working</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news Cloud Gaming fans, as it appears the version of Chrome available on the Steam Deck is now the correct version needed to detect the gamepad. With two small quick fixes, you can play GeForce NOW on Steam Deck easily.</p>
<p>I was waiting on the Chrome update to ship to properly show off Cloud Gaming, which was available in the Dev and Beta versions of Chrome for a little while. You can see on the official <a href="https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/commit/c9bc4476626e413fac9fac8b08e4b2110ee344f2" target="_blank">Chromium tracker</a> that it has now shipped, and checking the Chrome version on Deck today, it's the same.</p>
<p>Using the version of Chrome available on the Steam Deck, which you can install via the Non-Steam menu in the Steam Library of Gaming Mode, it's possible to tweak it to get it working fully.</p>
<ol>
<li>To get the Chrome package to work with the Deck controller, you need to do what Microsoft said in their guide for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/microsoft-announce-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-steam-deck-with-edge/" target="_blank">Edge and Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> with this quick terminal command in Konsole in Desktop Mode (with Edge changed to Chrome of course): <code class="inline-code">flatpak --user override --filesystem=/run/udev:ro com.google.Chrome</code></li>
<li>While in Gaming Mode, you will also want to set Steam Input on Chrome to be in "Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad" mode, along with one edit to set the Right Trackpad click behaviour to be a Left Mouse button. This just enables you to interact with Chrome and click things properly. Any other Steam Input mode, and the Deck Controller will <em>not</em> be picked up by Chrome.</li>
<li>If you want to get rid of the tab bar and have it feel more like an "app", you can also <em>append</em> these to the Launch Options for Chrome: <code class="inline-code">--window-size=1024,640 --force-device-scale-factor=1.25 --device-scale-factor=1.25 --kiosk "https://www.whateverserviceyouuse.com"</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a little demo of Fortnite on the Steam Deck, thanks to GeForce NOW:</p>

<p>#100, woo-hoo! That's obviously great right. Performance of Fortnite on GFN however isn't amazing (quite stuttery), although I was testing out the Free plan over WiFi.</p>
<p><em>I should note, I am on the Steam Deck Beta branch, but that shouldn't change anything since the Flatpak package of Chrome will be the same since it's an external package.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a big Client update, plus Deck OS and BIOS BETA update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two big updates arrived for the Steam Deck last night, so let's go over all that's changed as it's quite exciting. Firstly, the main Steam Deck Client update brings some really nice goodies.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="item-content">
<ul>
<li>Added dual trackpad typing support to onscreen keyboard</li>
<li>Added game mode onscreen keyboard to Desktop mode</li>
<li>Added Family Sharing status to game details page. Borrowers will see whose library they are borrowing from, and lenders will see a message if their library is currently in use by a borrower.</li>
<li>Added a Calibration and Advanced Settings screen with options for:
	<ul>
<li>Adjusting deadzones for the left and right Joysticks</li>
<li>Adjusting haptic strength for left and right Trackpads</li>
<li>Joysticks and other sensors on external gamepads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated network connection flow to connect without re-prompting for a known password</li>
<li>Improved performance downloading library images after logging in, leading to less stuttering</li>
<li>Removed display of 'B' back button in Overlay Quick Access Menu</li>
<li>Fixed onscreen keyboard input issues when connecting to public WiFi captive portals</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Chrome wouldn't install from the non-Steam section of the Library</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I know a lot of people preferred the dual-typing from the original Big Screen Mode, so it's quite pleasing to see Valve add that back in with the new Steam Deck on-screen keyboard. I have to say it looks pretty great in action too. Here's a quick video example with a bonus showing off some themes:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gwQjsIdCTko"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d96421803f1cde8028ad0500e35c953b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gwQjsIdCTko" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Having that same keyboard in Desktop Mode is also a great idea.</p>
<p>Here's where things get even more interesting though, as there's a Steam Deck OS and BIOS update also available in Beta. Some time ago, I discovered a charging issue with USB-C hubs and reached out to Valve about it. After a bit of back and forth, I ended up finding out that through some hotplugging — charging would work. It turned out that some hubs would pull power from the Deck, instead of a charging wire, and so you needed to plug the power into the hub first, then put the hub into the Deck. Valve were great on this, and they even picked up my exact model to reproduce it on their end. Doing some repeated testing today, it does seem to solve it.</p>
<p>Beta changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added messaging when a charger that doesn't meet the minimum bar is plugged in</li>
<li>Added uncapped framerate setting in Quick Access menu &gt; Performance</li>
<li>Added fTPM support, enabling Windows 11 installation</li>
<li>Added button combo: hold "..." + "Volume Down" to reset PD contract in the cases where Steam Deck gets stuck due to an incompatible Type-C device</li>
<li>Updated power LED to dim a few seconds after power supply connection events for better experience in dark environments</li>
<li>Improved compatibility for a number of Type-C docks and PSUs</li>
<li>Improved battery life in idle or very low usage scenarios</li>
<li>Improved stability</li>
<li>Fixed issues where the touchscreen does not work after some boots</li>
<li>Fixed compatibility with some SD cards specifically when used as boot devices.</li>
<li>Fixed ACPI error spew in the kernel</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the OS + BIOS Beta, you need to opt into the Beta channel on the Steam Deck in the System settings menu (down near the bottom).</p>

      <title>Unity games crashing with Proton on Linux or Steam Deck? Check your USB devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: </strong>a fix for this is now available in Proton Experimental, so switch to that for now.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Curiously, it seems Proton 7 and Proton Experimental are having problems with Unity games recently but there's a possible temporary workaround for you. This is the same across Linux desktop and Steam Deck, as it's a problem somewhere with Proton.</p>
<p>Recently, while trying to capture footage from the Steam Deck for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube channel</a> I came up against a problem. Certain Unity games wouldn't load, and instead would present me with a Unity error screen with a loading bar and then just quit. There was a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5658" target="_blank">bug report open</a> from others also seeing a similar issue. Proton 6.3-8 would work but for some games, that had other issues that Proton 7 solved.</p>
<p>After some fiddling, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5658#issuecomment-1082029764" target="_blank">I eventually found out</a> that unplugging my Logitech Wireless Receiver suddenly made the games work. I tested this repeatedly, and yup — simply having that plugged in caused the problem. Even if a game is fully loaded and working, simply plugging it in would cause an instant crash. Others on the bug report have now confirmed it too, and it seems even some wired USB devices (from other vendors) are also seeing the same problem.</p>
<p>For now, switching to Proton 6.3-8 or unplugging devices will get Unity games to work again on Linux and Steam Deck. If you need a quick guide to swap Proton versions on Steam Deck, here's how to do it:</p>

      <title>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe launches April 27</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a long time after originally planned, The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is now confirmed to launch on April 27.</p>
<p>The developer says it's an "expanded re-imagining" of the original from 2013, which was a surprisingly amusing first-person exploration game. All of the original content is here but there's a big expansion with new content to explore, new choices and new secrets. It's also gone through a visual overhaul, added accessibility features, localization of in-game text and content warnings. Plus, the fab voice work of Kevan Brighting returns.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Uv76dPXxfT8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/78d1177036c87e1e816591a62b353e2d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Uv76dPXxfT8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a simple-minded individual named Stanley discovers that the co-workers in his office have mysteriously vanished, he sets off to find answers.<br/>
<br/>
You will play as Stanley, and you will not play as Stanley. You will make a choice, and you will have your choices taken from you. The game will end, the game will never end. Contradiction follows contradiction, the rules of how games should work are broken, then broken again. You are not here to win. The Stanley Parable is a game that plays you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1703340/The_Stanley_Parable_Ultra_Deluxe/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel Arc Graphics launches for laptops, desktop GPUs later this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel Arc Graphics is finally here, as Intel officially enters the discrete GPU game and here's the details.</p>
<p>The first set is the Intel Arc A-series for laptops, with Arc 5 and Arc 7 coming in "early summer". Desktop / Workstation dedicated GPUs will be available sometime "later this year" with no clearer date yet being given. So unlike NVIDIA and AMD, they're not jumping in at the deep end first, doing a trickle roll-out starting at the lower end. This is an interesting step, which will enable them to really get their drivers in good shape before the possible masses flock towards their higher-end offerings later in the year.</p>

<p>Some of the features supported:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intel Xe Matrix Extensions</strong> <strong>(XMX) AI engines</strong> provide more compute capability for accelerating AI workloads. These AI engines have 16 times the compute to complete AI inferencing operations when compared to traditional GPU vector units, which can increase performance in productivity, gaming and creator applications.</li>
<li><strong>Xe Super Sampling</strong> <strong>(XeSS) </strong>is our solution that leverages the power of Intel Arc graphics’ XMX AI-engines to deliver high-performance, AI-accelerated upscaling. XeSS is a novel upscaling technology that uses deep learning to synthesize images that are very close to the quality of native high-res rendering. XeSS is coming in the summer and will be supported on all products with Arc A-Series graphics.</li>
<li>Intel Arc A-Series GPUs are the first in the industry to offer full <strong>AV1 hardware acceleration</strong>, including both encode and decode, delivering faster video encode and higher quality streaming while consuming the same internet bandwidth. We’ve worked with industry partners to ensure that AV1 support is available today in many of the most popular media applications, with broader adoption expected this year. The AV1 codec will be a game changer for the future of video encoding and streaming.</li>
<li>We’ve integrated <strong>Intel® Deep Link technologies</strong> to enable Intel Arc GPUs to work seamlessly with Intel CPUs and integrated graphics for a performance improvement across gaming, creating and streaming workloads. Intel Deep Link enables dynamic power sharing, intelligently distributing power across the platform to increase application performance up to 30% in creation and compute-intensive applications.1 With Hyper Encode and Hyper Compute, Deep Link allows multi-engine acceleration in transcoding and AI tasks. More details are available in our product fact sheet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of the announcement, they also teased their first discrete desktop GPU in a limited edition:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15281229231648653711gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15281229231648653711gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2469445271648653713gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2469445271648653713gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>"Today marks the first step in our journey. You’ll see Intel Arc graphics continue to improve and evolve, with new features and an ever-expanding ecosystem coming throughout the year. And for desktop enthusiasts, our Intel Arc graphics add-in-cards will be coming this summer. We are excited, and we hope you are too. It’s going to be a big year for Intel Arc graphics." — Roger Chandler is vice president and general manager of Graphics and Gaming Team at Intel Corporation.</p>
<p>Honestly, I'm excited. A third vendor properly jumping into it to mix things up, we've been stuck with just AMD or NVIDIA for far too long. Plus another vendor with open source drivers on Linux too, that's great. Some of the big main features will be supported on Linux too of course like Ray Tracing. As expected, all their testing and presentations are focused on Windows. When it comes to their new <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/arc-discrete-graphics/software/arc-control.html" target="_blank">Arc Control</a> software though, I doubt that will be supported on Linux, just like the other vendors don't give us their fancy control panels.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft Connect on Steam Deck guide with SD Card access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A guide that I've seen quite a few comments ask for across YouTube and our social media pages, so here's how to get the Ubisoft Connect launcher working on Steam Deck. You might want to do this if you own games on Ubisoft but not directly on Steam.</p>
<p>For this, I'm using my tried and tested method that I used for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-desktop-mode-plus-other-stores-like-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank">the Epic Games Store originally</a>, by adding the installer as a Non-Steam Game. You could also use Bottles, but I'll talk more about that later. First up, here's the video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9_p5jI2XWwc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/429cc938a2f43ac3a8ad9ed783a6cc7f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9_p5jI2XWwc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into Desktop Mode. Power button - &gt; Switch to Desktop.</li>
<li>Head to <a href="https://ubisoftconnect.com/en-GB/" target="_blank">Ubisoft Connect</a> and hit the big blue download button.</li>
<li>In your Steam Library, add a Non-Steam game and select the downloaded exe file from the Downloads folder.</li>
<li>Right click it in your Steam Library and go to Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the Force box and select Proton 7 or Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Then run it as normal and let it install.</li>
<li>Once installed, <em>don't</em> launch it. Right click on it in your Steam Library again and go -&gt; Properties -&gt; change the Target to the newly installed file. Do this by hitting Browse and go to "/home/deck/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/" and find the folder with a longer number than usual. You can also find the right one by expanding the box to see what folder was modified today. Then go into these folders to select the right exe file "/pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Ubisoft/Ubisoft Game Launcher/UbisoftConnect.exe".</li>
</ol>
<p>For SD Card access, you also need one minor adjustment. In the same Properties menu, there's a Launch Options box, you need to add this into the text area: <code class="inline-code">STEAM_COMPAT_MOUNTS=/run/media/mmcblk0p1/ %command%</code></p>
<p>This tells Proton it can use the SD Card and where it is. Ensure the path is the <em>same</em> as <em>your</em> SD Card, you can find it listed as "Primary" in the Dolphin file manager at the bottom of the left panel.</p>
<p>A special <strong>important</strong> note: ensure you've set Ubisoft Connect to minimize when closed in the settings. In Gaming Mode on the Steam Deck, you need to quickly close Ubisoft Connect once you hit Play on a game, otherwise Gamescope (the SteamOS compositor) gets confused on what to display and madly <em>flashes</em> between the launcher and the game. A problem shared by many launchers right now. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: thanks to a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/ubisoft-connect-on-steam-deck-guide-with-sd-card-access/comment_id=223491" target="_blank">comment</a>, you can get Ubisoft Connect to auto-launch a specific game by adding uplay://launch/*gameID*/0 to the <u>end</u> of your Steam launch options for the app (ID <a href="https://github.com/Haoose/UPLAY_GAME_ID" target="_blank">list here</a>) which gets around the flashing issue but only works for a specific game at a time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The question is: why didn't I use Bottles like I showed for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heres-how-to-get-the-ea-app-on-steam-deck-with-bottles/" target="_blank">EA App on Steam Deck guide</a>? Well, I thought Ubisoft Connect was broken with Bottles but it's actually not so feel free to use that way instead. For some reason, Ubisoft Connect just takes a <em>very</em> long time to properly load in my account details (it's fine for others) but this is still a valid guide if you don't wish to use Bottles and prefer just directly using Steam and Proton together.</p>

      <title>Free and open source level editor LDtk 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LDtk (formerly known as LEd) is a free and open source level editor, developed by Sébastien Benard who previously worked on the successful Dead Cells and also recently Nuclear Blaze.</p>
<p>It's cross-platform too across Linux, macOS and Windows and with it being under the MIT license you can do mostly whatever you want with it. Although supporting the developer if you find it useful would of course be a good thing to do, if you wish to see it continued to be supported. Linux support is still considered "experimental", so perhaps with the source available issues can be found and fixed more easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10629908331648644377gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10629908331648644377gol1.jpg"/></a>Seems to run fine on Arch Linux.</em></p>
<p>What's new in 1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>New entity reference system</li>
<li>Great performance boost for large projects</li>
<li>Integrated icons and many quality-of-life changes</li>
<li>New world layers</li>
<li>User interface reworks</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the key points of LDtk include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Easy to use - Every UI details were carefully designed to make the process of creating levels as smooth as possible.</li>
<li>Auto-rendering - Define some simple rules in a visual editor and let LDtk do the boring part of the skinning job for you.</li>
<li>World editor - Choose your world layout among “Grid-vania”, “linear”, or “free” and reorganize all your levels using plain old simple drag-n-drop.</li>
<li>Entities - Create your own game entities, with any custom (typed) properties, like “hit points”, a patrol path or an inventory of items.</li>
<li>Aseprite support - LDtk can load “*.aseprite” files directly, without any whatsoever intermediate PNG conversion. And with live-reloading support, you paint your tiles, save and LDtk updates everything accordingly, including image resizing.</li>
<li>Side &amp; top-downs - LDtk focuses on these perspectives to make sure the user experience feels just right. Sorry, no isometric here!</li>
<li>JSON - The app outputs a well documented JSON format that you can easily parse in your favorite game engine.</li>
<li>Tiled export - Tiled (TMX) optional export to try it out before implementing your own importer.</li>
<li>Backups - We know bad things can happen. LDtk offers a strong backup system and can even restore unsaved changes if the app crashes. Which shouldn’t happen, but we don’t live in a perfect world.</li>
<li>Pay what you want! - LDtk can be used for free without any limitation. But if you want to support my work, please consider buying it, or becoming a direct sponsor.</li>
<li>Optional Haxe API - If you are a Haxe user, you can benefit from a powerful and fully typed Haxe API, generated by macros as you type.</li>
</ul>
