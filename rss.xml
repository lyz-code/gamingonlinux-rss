      <title>Cyber Knights: Flashpoint adds full gamepad support and Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little heist on the go perhaps? Cyber Knights: Flashpoint from Trese Brothers is steadily turning into a favourite turn-based tactics game and now with all the controller improvements it should feel a whole lot better on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>More about it: "Squad tactics heist RPG! Clever stealth, strategic combat, unique 23rd-century cyberpunk. Build your crew of hackers, mercs and malcontents wisely; their stories will become interwoven with your own. Use powerful cyberware, faction connections, and more to outsmart the odds &amp; determine your future."</p>
<p>The game has a Native Linux version, and a Steam Deck Playable rating that should eventually get bumped up to Verified as the Trese Brothers continue putting in effort to make it better on Deck.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/7025135705479590592" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> they noted some controls issues being solved on Steam Deck, and with the new default configuration you "should be very good to go with the Steam Deck". But, they're not using Steam Input on Deck specifically due to issues, but you can turn it back on in their settings. Elsewhere it should use Steam Input for the full controller support now.</p>

      <title>Blender 4.2 is another crazy-big release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From game devs to movies and all sorts, Blender is a truly incredible bit of free and open source tech and it has evolved a lot with Blender 4.2 out now.</p>
<p>One of the biggies from this release is the next generation of their rendering engine, EEVEE. They said it has been completely "rewritten from scratch to allow global illumination, displacement, better SSS, viewport motion blur, and so much more" so it's more feature-filled than ever. Cycles also got a huge upgrade to make renders look better and render even faster.</p>
<p>Need to extend Blender? Add-ons and Themes have been overhauled into a new Extensions system, allowing you to update them from inside Blender which sounds useful. Plus check out the <a href="https://extensions.blender.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Extensions site</a>.</p>
<p>Another fun one is Blender has become more portable than ever before. Now you can just take your entire config with you, as long as you have a folder named "portable" next to where you run Blender, it will load settings from there first.</p>
<p>For those who want a quick round-up:</p>

<p>And if you've got a little more time for the deep-dive:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iwpBgtKilvw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/96ad3a25a294e30a116b8bacac77759b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iwpBgtKilvw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Or just go and read the changes on the <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blender website</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a Blender user, let us know what you're up to with it in the comments, and what you think of the 4.2 release.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky - Worlds Part I is out now and drastically transforms the planets</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah hell, here we go again. Hello Games just released another massive free update to No Man's Sky with Worlds Part I out now. No Man's Sky is rated Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>This looks like probably one of the best updates yet, which I'm sure I've said before, but it's been true almost every time. Giving planets a really fresh feel some have big floating islands and you might even get a few waterfalls coming down from them which looks amazing. Flying around a planet is even more interesting with their new volumetric clouds with a mixture of wispy cirrus clouds and dark, rain-laden nimbus clouds. There's much more detailed shadows, high definition dynamic water with realistic wave formations and foam generation, lots of strange new creatures across various planets, full wind simulation, more dramatic storms, frozen worlds were given a big overhaul with ice-laden trees and glittering glacial rocks, new sky colours and the list just keeps on going and going.</p>
<p>What I've noted there is but the tip of the iceberg. There's walking buildings, aquatic landing jets, a new mech, more water colour variety, walker battles got more interesting, new base parts, richer atmospheric effects and then lots of random quality of life features.</p>
<p>On top of that there's also a brand new expedition that sees you go on an alien bug hunt. Oh, and you can finally rename your discoveries any time now too.</p>
<p>Main update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s7-9Bf47yfs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e816234c32fcbacd5947f730f2ca2b37.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s7-9Bf47yfs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hello Games also mentioned how they refined input for touch screen interfaces with the Steam Deck and Switch being mentioned directly, along with fixing various input bugs there. Nice to see!</p>
<p>Check out their deep-dive video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XmU3_6BK-Ro"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d55434ef33323ac9908e90290175a3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XmU3_6BK-Ro" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Clearly, Hello Games are doing some fantastic work and it seems a fair bit of this is coming over from their world-generation for their upcoming game Light No Fire.

      <title>Get a Drawful 2 free with The Jackbox Megapicker for the first 30 days after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jackbox Games are soon to release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828500/The_Jackbox_Megapicker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Jackbox Megapicker</a>, which is basically a launcher that shows all their games so you won't need to keep switching between packs for all their different games.</p>
<p>As they explained: "The Jackbox Megapicker is your all-in-one solution for organizing, buying, and launching all of your Jackbox games. You no longer have to switch between Party Packs to start playing your favorite games. The Megapicker will give you an overview of the games that you own so you can launch them directly. View games you might be missing, and see news updates and ongoing sales all in one place. Filter your games by genre and create an account to store your preferences and see your game history."</p>
<p>It's releasing on July 29th, and the sweet treat to come with it, is that for 30 days following the release they will be giving away the 3-8 player game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/442070/Drawful_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drawful 2</a>. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20762653071721216351gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20762653071721216351gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Usually I would moan about a launcher within a launcher, but in this case, when you think about how many game packs Jackbox Games now have it actually makes a good bit of sense to put it all together somehow.</p>

      <title>Fanatical&#39;s Bundle Bash has new game bundles every day this week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of a fresh set of games, you may want to hop over to Fanatical's Bundle Bash as they're putting out a new bundle every day this week.</p>
<p>The first was the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/summer-mystery-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Summer Mystery Bundle</a>, allowing you to buy up to 20 mystery keys. While I don't particularly like the gambling aspect to it, generally it does give out some pretty good titles. This year there's some added bonuses too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What makes this year's bundle stand out is that with each purchase, you're automatically entered into our competition for a chance to win a Red Devil AMD Radeon™ RX 7800 XT 16GB GDDR6 PowerColor GPU worth over $500! But the excitement doesn't stop there. We are also including a chance to find AAA Game Packs within the bundle, featuring top-tier titles like Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR’S CUT, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance, Dragon's Dogma 2 Deluxe Edition, Manor Lords, and No Rest for the Wicked. Will fortune favour you?</p>
<cite>Fanatical</cite></blockquote>
<p>The next is the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-rpg-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own RPG Bundle</a> starting from 3 for £4.99, and 8+ games end up as £1.25 a game so it's pretty good value overall. Especially when you look at just some of the titles you can pick that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mortal Shell (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>The Ascent: Cyber Edition Bundle (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>For The King - Deluxe Edition (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Deck Playable)</li>
<li>ATOM RPG Trudograd (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then from yesterday there's the new <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-empire-bundle?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own Empire Bundle</a> which offers up a similar deal to the above. In it you can get some sweet builders like:</p>
<ul>
<li>APICO (Native Linux / <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>URBO (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Deck Verified)</li>
<li>Coffee Shop Tycoon (<img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Deck Playable)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There will be another bundle release around 4PM BST today too.</em></p>
<p>Oh, and while it's not part of this bundle event, they do also have a bundle for GOG fans with the <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-bethesda-bundle-gog-edition?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build your own Bethesda Bundle - GOG Edition</a>.</p>

      <title>Enlisted from Gaijin and Darkflow returns to Steam and now free to play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After initially releasing on Steam as Enlisted: Reinforced back in March, it was quickly taken down but now it's back on Steam just as Enlisted. Players initially took issues with the fact that the Steam release was paid-only, while it was free direct from their website.</p>
<p>With the re-release, it still has Native Linux support and Valve gave it a Playable rating on Steam Deck (using the Native version too). While the developer said: "Enlisted also works on Steam Deck! We've adapted the game's interface and controls to ensure that the gaming experience on Steam's proprietary console is as comfortable as on other platforms where Enlisted is already available.".</p>
<p>So it seems they still have some work to do on small text and gamepad controls not being default which is holding it up from being fully Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="34TB7NnfI9I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4b99b106657f1b52ebce32533d43bb4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/34TB7NnfI9I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Enlisted is quite unique when it comes to an online FPS, as you control a squad instead of a single person, with you being able to switch between them. It's pretty interesting but as usual for Gaijin there's a fair amount of in-app purchases just like War Thunder.</p>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051620/Enlisted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>TheForceEngine adds initial Dark Forces Remaster support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TheForceEngine is an open source modern "Jedi Engine" replacement supporting Dark Forces, mods, and in the future Outlaws. A new release version 1.10.000 just rolled out.</p>
<p>With this new version the initial support of Nightdive's Dark Forces Remaster has landed, however a bunch of its HD Assets are not supported <em>yet</em> but will be in future. TheForceEngine is also set up to now automatically detect the Dark Forces Remaster as a game data source.</p>
<p>Some new cheats were added including one hit kill, one hit death, 9 lives, the ability to render everything at full-brightness and a new cheat menu is also in. Plenty of bug fixes too, you can also now disable screen flashes, crouch toggle is now an option and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11996793681721210225gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This release also came with a few Linux fixes too:</p>
<ul>
<li>SDL2 fixes on Linux.</li>
<li>Fixed numerous clang/gcc warnings, Linux issues, 32-bit issues (though no 32-bit support on Windows is planned), and enabled GCC LTO (Link Time Optimizations).</li>
<li>Added workaround for GLEW on Wayland.</li>
</ul>
<p>Coming up in a future release is also a full Level Editor, so it will be interesting to see if a community builds up around that. We could end up seeing some pretty fun stuff made for it. Nice to see another game engine reimplementation keep getting better!</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/luciusDXL/TheForceEngine/releases/tag/v1.10.000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full release notes</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out The Immortal Lock, an impressive new Quake 1 mod</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more retro shooting goodness in your life? How about a little more from Quake 1? The Immortal Lock is a brand new pack from modder ComfyByTheFire that's well worth a look.</p>
<p>Before getting into it though, just note they do say you need an up to date install of <a href="https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vkQuake</a> (1.31.0+), which is a Vulkan Quake port based on QuakeSpasm.</p>
<p>Story: "You are Ranger, an operator of the UTJR stationed at a secret, multinational research facility in Finland. You are being deployed to investigate the disappearance of a survey team that went missing beyond the slipgate, cast into the farthest reaches of existence. Yet through the thin veil of reality, you find only a desolate plane of flesh and despair, and a dread voice that beckons your name."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yOZwx5Zn--U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a8fde97f4af8bb076cd3aa64512c3cba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yOZwx5Zn--U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for what it includes: prepare for extremely challenging fights. The developer actually suggests you start on Easy mode. There will be plenty of "trick jumping, and a vast amount of large secret areas, but is difficulty scaled to accommodate everyone" and the map is "larger than an entire episode, if played in its entirety, and is best experienced in segments".</p>
<p>Go and <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/the-immortal-lock.371/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

      <title>Try the demo for Pest Apocalypse a horde survival game where you deliver pizza in a van</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VANpire Survivors. I know, I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/pest-apocalypse-is-a-new-hilarious-survivor-like-game-with-a-death-mobile/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">already did that joke before</a>, but it's a good one. Pest Apocalypse is an upcoming chaotic horde survival game where you drive a vehicle to deliver pizza for hungry survivors.</p>
<p>The developers, Kikimora Games, have just recently put up a demo with Linux support (built with Godot Engine) so this might be a good one for you to give it a spin. Previously, Kikimora Games released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2341410/Wizards_Way_Out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wizard's Way Out</a>, a small puzzle game about getting out of big trouble.</p>
<p>"Assemble a ragtag band of survivors, turbocharge your death-mobile, and rush straight into the thick of the action with a fearless grin. Your mission? To deliver steaming hot pizza to hungry customers, while fending off hordes of mutated pests!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YySZsiN_E_c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b085fe93c09c8aeb8a1404648f712620.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YySZsiN_E_c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hordes of disgusting pests to slaughter!</li>
<li>Personalize your vehicle and build your team of survivors, each with unique skills and abilities!</li>
<li>Use your wits and reflexes to outmaneuver and outrun the enemy!</li>
<li>Deliver scorching hot pizza, or risk the wrath of the chef!</li>
<li>Quick runs( &lt; 15 minutes) for maximum enjoyment!</li>
<li>Sweet 3D/2D pixel art graphics!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like a lot of fun from my time in the demo, especially chaotic when you're able to get a bit further into it. Driving a vehicle certainly gives the survivor-like genre a different feel. I was already excited to see more from this and it looks like it may deliver.</p>

      <title>Infest is a deckbuilder where every pixel on the battlefield can burn, freeze, melt and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking some inspiration from the excellent Noita perhaps, Infest brings the mechanic of destroying all the pixels and puts it into a deckbuilder. Recently the developer announced Early Access for July 31st, and their testing showed it working great on the Steam Deck. It also appears to have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Here you build up a unique deck and deploy your cards to alter the environment, buff your status and unleash hell as you burn, freeze, corrode, shock and melt all the pixels on the screen during your battle. Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Customize your deck and upgrade cards along the way. Make sure it is well balanced to handle a variety of environmental effects. Can you melt ice? Can you stop mutant plants? Foresight is key.</p>
<p>Deal damage card by card, when your stack is exhausted the enemies get their chance to attack! They will create defensive barriers, throw damage cards at you, buff themselves and heal others! Anticipating their moves and playing the right card is key.</p>
<p>Choose your path through the alien universe. Each run is different so you can replay many times without getting bored. Besides the playable levels, you'll encounter shops, hospitals, and dozens of different bonus challenges. Picking the right path is key to survival.</p>

      <title>Amusingly British point &amp; click adventure Heir of the Dog now on Kickstarter (demo available)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tall Story Games are working on another quality British point and click adventure game, with Heir of the Dog now on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hardwidge/heir-of-the-dog-a-pixel-art-point-and-click-comedy-adventure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> with a demo available. Previously the developer released Lucy Dreaming, which was well received and had Linux support just like Heir of the Dog will.</p>
<p>More about it: "Replete with intricate, witty, and sardonic storytelling, Heir of the Dog, tells the story of bachelor and upper class twit, Cummerbund Bandersnatch. When visiting his uncle's laboratory, Bandersnatch discovers an experimental new formula guaranteeing a ‘good time’ for whoever drinks it. Seduced by the promises listed in his uncle's journal, he drinks the strange elixir and undergoes a monstrous transformation. Life will never be the same again."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sf4RvyPpPMg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/547c7db1f87decf4251489c21cd5a099.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sf4RvyPpPMg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They have 28 days to hit £15,000, with £7,557 already pledged at time of writing. So clearly there's quite a bit of interest for the funding to flow in so rapidly. As a Brit myself, I of course was legally obliged to cover this. Kidding of course, but I do love seeing British humour in more games.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hilarious dialogue and narrative.</li>
<li>Atmospheric and nostalgic pixel-art style.</li>
<li>Play as man, beast or dog to experience their extra senses and dirty habits.</li>
<li>Switch between night and day to solve puzzles and discover new abilities.</li>
<li>Choose between classic point &amp; click or character-based controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2431920/Heir_of_the_Dog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Also on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/heir_of_the_dog_demo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> but no Linux build there right now.</p>

      <title>Marathon 2 a classic FPS originally from Destiny developer Bungie now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the Aleph One developer community released the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/bungies-classic-free-fps-marathon-is-now-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first in the trilogy of Marathon on Steam</a>, originally created by Bungie, they've now put up Classic Marathon 2.</p>
<p>As a reminder: the Marathon series was created by Bungie (Halo / Destiny) originally back in the 90s for Apple computers. Later Bungie opened up the source code of the Marathon 2 engine in 1999 with the game assets being made freeware in 2005. Now all three games are available via <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Aleph One</a>, the open source continuation of Bungie's <cite>Marathon.</cite></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16183667261721127925gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16183667261721127925gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured: Classic Marathon 2 running with Proton 9</em></p>
<p>About Classic Marathon 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fresh from your triumph on the colony ship Marathon, you are seized by the rogue AI Durandal to do his bidding in a distant part of the galaxy. Within the ruins of an ancient civilization, you must seek the remnants of a lost clan and uncover their long-buried secrets. Battle opponents ancient and terrible, with sophisticated weapons and devious strategies, all the while struggling to escape the alien nightmare…<br/>
<br/>
This classic 1995 Bungie™ FPS is now maintained by the fan community. Experience authentic game play using the original data files, with optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60+ fps interpolation, just in case the original is <em>too</em> authentic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><cite>For the Steam release of </cite>Classic Marathon 2, they are once again only providing macOS and Windows builds. So you can either play it via Proton on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398490/Classic_Marathon_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, use <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> for the Native Linux release from Steam or just download Aleph One directly.</p>
<p>The Steam version though does have the free XBLA Graphics Pack DLC, which is a "Replacement textures from the XBLA game Marathon: Durandal by Freeverse".</p>

      <title>SCAD is Twisted Metal meets Vampire Survivors and I want it now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm a total sucker for over the top action, especially when you're tearing down hordes of enemies in whatever bullet hell / bullet heaven game comes along since Vampire Survivors kicked it all off. The next one I need in my life is SCAD.</p>
<p>More about it: "Adrenaline Fueled Chaos - Take a journey through a dangerous world where humanity is on the verge of extinction. Following a catastrophic event caused by a malicious corporation's experiments, the remnants of civilization survive in fortified junkyard enclaves. Take on missions. Engage in a never-ending battle with hordes of enemies across different environments."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="F7yurJ--pBc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c27f3a388244aabc388de26c27c5faa4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/F7yurJ--pBc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Story mode.</li>
<li>Complete challenging missions enriched with special tasks.</li>
<li>Salvage materials from the remnants of civilization.</li>
<li>Destroy thousands of zombie hordes.</li>
<li>Face off and defeat monstrous bosses.</li>
<li>Upgrade your vehicle and weapons to change the course of the world.</li>
<li>Beautiful isometric pixel art.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What's also interesting here is the developer, NAISU, usually make <em>hentai</em> games. And somehow, an aspiring game dev managed to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1e3uwdp/comment/ldae1fi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">convince them</a> to work on something else. I'm glad they did, because this looks <em>nuts</em>.</p>

      <title>GameCube emulator Dolphin adds RetroAchievements support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another nice win for people who love hitting challenges, as <a href="https://retroachievements.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RetroAchievements</a> support has now been added to Dolphin for GameCube. Currently not in the Wii side of the emulator, right now the focus is on getting it working well for GameCube emulation.</p>
<p>Showing the true power of open source, they were able to do this thanks to the PlayStation 2 emulator PCSX2, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/ps2-emulator-pcsx2-20-is-out-now-and-its-a-huge-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also recently had a major new release</a> that came with RetroAchievements support.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/07/15/unlocked-retroachievements-come-dolphin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the Dolphin team mentioned how "One of the things that helped was the PCSX2 implementation of RetroAchievements, which acted as a base for the developers who worked on the Dolphin version of the implementation. As well, their own achievement creation library had to be ported over to work with Dolphin's memory handling.". </p>
<p>Took them a good while to get it going, 18 months to get it all ready and due to how GameCube games work, it sounds like it was a lot of effort to ensure they actually work correctly.</p>

      <title>Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess is a quality shoot &#39;em up throwback to Desert Strike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the Strike series (Desert/Jungle/Urban Strike) and Choplifter, Megacopter: Blades of the Goddess is a lot of fun if you love fast-paced shoot 'em up action. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>As someone who grew up playing Desert Strike and later games, this one really spoke to me. Even if you don't have any nostalgia for the classics, it's still a well-made shoot 'em up full of twists and turns. Here you're not just flying any old helicopter, but the Megacopter, which appears to be somewhat alive and thirsty for blood.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rtM2r14BoNA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/119fe974539fd7ee2c79ff87ae6d932a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rtM2r14BoNA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here you go through a series of missions with increasing difficulty, as it sprinkles in various different types of enemies where your focus ends up split between ground and air attacks to counter and dodge. It needs some pretty fancy finger-work on the controls at times too, it can be quite challenging not to get destroyed. Some missions are a straight-up fight, others see you being sent to rescue people. There's even defence missions with enemy waves coming at you and boss fights too — it has a bit of everything.</p>
<p>A bit of a learning curve to the controls too. In a few ways it reminds me of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/06/incredible-top-down-shooter-brigador-gets-a-huge-free-enhancement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brigador</a> (also brilliant), with how you aim along a specific line that you move the crosshair inside. So you have to be aware of your position relative to the enemies, while they're firing at you, as you're also trying to line up your shots. It actually becomes pretty chaotic in the best possible way because you firing at both ground and air targets, with a separate button to target each. You'll spend a fair amount of time ducking and dodging in circles.</p>
<p>The story is a bit wild too, some crazy Reptoid people are trying to take over. Obviously it's your job to stop them. A job that perhaps they should have sent an army in for but they have you. Thankfully the Megacopter is powerful, with various different weapons and special ability combinations to unlock and pick your load-out for each mission. The story is just the right amount of ridiculous to make it feel not too far from an absured 80s action movie script. Great soundtrack to get the blood pumping too!</p>
<p>My only real issue is the graphical style. A bunch of it doesn't really fit together like the terrain and trees, when compared with the buildings and enemies all look a bit off and a bit out of place perhaps but once you get past that and sink some time into the game it really doesn't matter. Gameplay is king here, as they say and Megacopter is certainly a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It has full Native Linux and Steam Deck support. In fact, the developer <a href="https://x.com/megacoptergame/status/1810521250516586999" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> earlier this month that nearly 20% of the sales for it at that point were from Linux / Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Since release the developer has repeatedly improved all aspects of the game from player feedback too, including new ways to control the Megacopter and they continue to push out improvements even now.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a well-built shoot 'em up that you can't go wrong with.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1228360/Megacopter_Blades_of_the_Goddess/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods new cross-platform app adds experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On top of fixing up various issues with Stardew Valley modding, the new Alpha of the cross-platform and open source Nexus Mods app introduces experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support.</p>
<p>For those just joining us, this is for the <em>new</em> Nexus Mods app that will <em>eventually</em> replace things like Vortex with full Linux support so you can mod on desktop Linux and Steam Deck much easier as I reported on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/nexus-mods-want-feedback-from-linux-steam-deck-users-on-their-new-cross-platform-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in July</a> and initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/nexus-mods-app-is-an-in-development-replacement-for-vortex-that-will-support-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in November last year</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1595693931721050152gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1595693931721050152gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus Mods app on Linux</em></p>
<p>Version 0.5.3 of the app includes all these fixes on top of experimental Cyberpunk 2077 support:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the "SMAPI is disabled"-diagnostic for multiple SMAPI installations (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1674" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1674</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed Loadout disappearing when applying (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1737" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1737</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed un-managing a game removing all Loadouts instead of just the ones for the current game (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1738" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1738</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed sorting in the Mod Library and the "Completed Downloads"-section (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1690" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1690</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed SVGs not loading and rendering properly in the markdown viewer (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1661" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1661</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed SVGs throughout the App (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1622" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1622</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1681" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1681</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed not disposing services on close correctly (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1679" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1679</a>).</li>
<li>Windows: Fixed log file creation failing due to illegal character in path (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1728" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1728</a>). Thanks, <a href="https://github.com/ZeeWanderer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@ZeeWanderer</a>!</li>
<li>Linux: Fixed protocol registration (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1691" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1691</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1689" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1689</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1683" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1683</a>).</li>
<li>Linux: Upgraded <a href="https://github.com/erri120/GameFinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameFinder</a> to fix an issue with not being able to find Steam installed as a Flatpak or Snap (<a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/pull/1720" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#1720</a>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a few other assorted improvements behind the scenes on this too.</p>
<p>I really cannot tell you how excited I am to see this app expand. Modding support on Linux has traditionally been a bit messy, and with a proper cross-platform Nexus Mods app, things will become so much easier.</p>
<p>Just to note: it <strong>didn't</strong> initially launch for me, I had to remove the configs from the previous version to get this latest to work. The bug was <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/issues/1765" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> but given it's in Alpha, such breakages are to be expected and they don't plan to support migrations yet. So keep that in mind. If you also tried the previous version, you can find the configs in "/.local/share/NexusMods.App".</p>
<p>For Linux / Steam Deck, download the "NexusMods.App.x86_64.AppImage" from the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.5.3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release page</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.10 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linus Torvalds announced the release of Linux kernel 6.10 and with it, plenty of new hardware support and improvements to existing hardware. You know the drill.</p>
<p>Announcing the release Torvalds <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/7/14/250" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So the final week was perhaps not quote as quiet as the preceding ones, which I don't love - but it also wasn't noisy enough to warrant an extra rc. And much of the noise this last week was bcachefs again (with netfs a close second), so it was all pretty compartmentalized.</p>
<p>In fact, about a third of the patch for the last week was filesystem-related (there were also some btrfs latency fixes and other noise), which is unusual, but none of it looks particularly scary.</p>
<p>Another third was drivers, and the rest is "random".</p>
<p>Anyway, this obviously means that the merge window for 6.11 opens up tomorrow. Let's see how that goes, with much of Europe probably making ready for summer vacation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Just some cherry-picked items that made it into Linux kernel 6.10 below.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Gaming Related:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck IMU support, plus the kernel now accounts for both versions of the Steam Deck (LCD / OLED).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/proposed-windows-nt-sync-driver-brings-big-wine-proton-performance-improvements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NTSYNC driver </a>was merged to hopefully improve Wine / Proton game performance, but not enabled yet.</li>
<li>Improvements to Xbox Elite 2 controller back paddle buttons over Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Added support for the Machenike G5 Pro Controller.</li>
<li>Improved support for some ROG Ally buttons.</li>
<li>Added support for the ASUS ROG RAIKIRI PRO.</li>
<li>New support for GameForce Chi retro handheld.</li>
<li>Improved Aya Neo KUN support.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other picks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Panthor driver for Arm Mali Valhall GPUs landed.</li>
<li>More work on bringing up support for the upcoming Intel Battlemage.</li>
<li>A new mseal() syscall for the Linux kernel that "protects the VMAs of a given virtual memory range against modifications", currently Google Chrome plans to hook into it.</li>
<li>Lots of RISC-V support improvements.</li>
<li>More WiFi 7 hardware support.</li>
<li>Lots of new Arm device support across various small boards like the ArmSom Sige7, Forlinx FET3588-C and others.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's thousands of changes of course that I'm not going to go over, those are just a few bits that jumped out that I thought you might want to know. If I missed anything important and gaming related, be sure to send in a tip.</p>

You can support development by buying their bananas micro-transactions on Steam for some cosmetics.</p>

      <title>Check out Quantum Witch, a platformer meets point and click choose your adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer NikkiJay recently revealed Quantum Witch, a rather quirky sounding mix of game genres that blends a platformer with a sort-of choose your adventure style.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned it will have Native Linux support and Steam Deck support, with them working as a solo developer getting it ready to release next June.</p>
<p>More about it: "It's a straightforwardly lovely day in Hus.</p>
<p>It's always a lovely day in Hus. That's not suspicious at all! The bovey is grazing in the field, the faer are roaming around town causing chaos, the shadies are out preaching (they're not a cult!), and a giant stone portal to another dimension has appeared in the woods.</p>
<p>I hope nothing goes hideously wrong and results in an adventure."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rsWw8ZABdVU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34c0af9c41f552f5b20484436aabb8b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rsWw8ZABdVU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>A little more about it:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Narrative and choice driven platform adventure. Imagine choose your own adventure meets point and click meets platformer. Yes, you've got it! It's that.</li>
<li>Hand crafted retro resolution pixel art in a cute style that definitely doesn't unexpectedly turn creepy.</li>
<li>Not a cult.</li>
<li>Choices matter. Convince a character to wear something? They'll wear it for the rest of the game. Save a character? They'll be there as part of your story.</li>
<li>Very, very gay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.1.1 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear players of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and fheroes2 project supporters. The team is excited to present the new version of the fheroes2 engine - 1.1.1 for Heroes of Might and Magic II after more than a month of hard work.<br/>
This release was mainly focused on polishing the <strong>Editor</strong>, but not only.<br/>
<br/>
The Editor got support for <strong>Rumors</strong>, <strong>Daily Events</strong> and <strong>special Victory and Loss conditions</strong>. These were missing features that are present in the original game. However, as promised we added them as quickly as possible after the new Editor was launched. The team used different design of dialogs in comparison to the original Editor to make it more user-friendly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9997418791721035154gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9997418791721035154gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13645266861721035170gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13645266861721035170gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Besides fixing several issues in the Editor and adding missing parts we also made multiple improvements. First of all, the team redesigned the <strong>hero selection window</strong> in the Editor. No more scrolling through similar icons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12070103501721035224gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12070103501721035224gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Secondly, we started adding new content to the game. As a start, the team added a missing part of the Sphinx and a new variation of the adventure map Cave object.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1107085551721035247gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1107085551721035247gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A brand new feature now available in the Editor is the ability to <strong>restrict the construction</strong> of any building in towns and castles. This gives a lot of flexibility for map makers to design maps with unique gameplay conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5423572931721035280gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5423572931721035280gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The <strong>AI</strong> was updated as well. We reworked all bonuses the AI had in the past and reduced them significantly to have a fair play for AI. This aligns with our goals: we want difficulty level affect only AI behaviour without giving it any perks.<br/>
Additionally, we fixed few places in AI logic.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, the team updated multiple translations, improved various UI elements and closed <strong>over 40 issues</strong> since the previous release.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your invaluable support, and we hope you will enjoy this release!</p>

      <title>RPG Maker MV / MZ for Linux tool now supports TyranoBuilder, RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's in need of a better name, the RPG Maker MV / MZ for Linux tool had a new release recently that expanded the support for running games on Linux from TyranoBuilder, and RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace.</p>
<p>Initially covered here on GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/this-open-source-project-runs-rpg-maker-mv-mz-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in early May</a>, it's a collection of scripts and tools bundled together to allow you to run various games natively on Linux. Initially only for games built with RPG Maker MV / MZ, the developer released version 1.0.9 on July 1st adding support for TyranoScript/TyranoBuilder engine V4 and V5, plus now also RPG Maker XP / VX / VX Ace games via the <a href="https://github.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mkxp-z</a> linux library.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned how it can now also be used as a compatibility tool in Steam, so you can run games from Steam using it like you would with Proton or Luxtorpeda.</p>
<p>Picking a completely random game, I tested it with the demo of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2455920/Mimic_Logic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mimic Logic</a> using it as the compatibility tool in Steam and it runs perfectly. Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/Engine/RPGMaker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> having an RPGMaker Engine tag.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2770381201720898467gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2770381201720898467gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5797098391720898467gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5797098391720898467gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other features the developer listed on the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Sharp increase in fps (from 2 to 4 times more compared to Wine, can be viewed by pressing the F2 key).</li>
<li>Updating Pixi 5 libraries for RPG Maker MV games (that's supposed to increase performance).</li>
<li>Downloading and selecting any version of NWJS (using the command line).</li>
<li>Easily installable SDK version of NWJS with one click in the gui, or via cli.</li>
<li>Starting a game with the Japanese locale option.</li>
<li>Launching a game using a command line.</li>
<li>Showing the NWJS, Nodejs, Chromium versions of your downloaded game.</li>
<li>Installing the Text hooker plug-in that copies the game's dialogs automatically to your clipboard.</li>
<li>Can be used as compatibility tool in steam for Windows games.</li>
<li>The Native support of 4 architectures: x86-64, i386, armhf, arm64</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So in future if you see any games you wish to play on Linux that were made with one of the RPG Maker game engines or TyranoBuilder, perhaps this tool might end up as one of the best ways for compatibility and performance.</p>
<p>A total no-fuss experience too. Download the release package from <a href="http://github.com/bakustarver/rpgmakermlinux-cicpoffs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GitHub</a>, run the included installer, and it adds it to Steam's Compatibility menu for you.</p>

      <title>PS2 Emulator PCSX2 2.0 is out now and it&#39;s a huge upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PCSX2 is a popular open source emulation for the Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2) and PCSX2 version 2.0 is now officially available with a great many changes and improvements.</p>
<p>There's so many changes in fact, that it's pretty difficult to give you a summary of what's new. Quite literally every part of the emulator has been improved.</p>
<p>For starters they've moved away from wxWidgets for the interface to the much more modern and cross-platform Qt. The developers said Qt brings with it a "slick appearance, more efficient UI backend, and provided the perfect opportunity to redo all our menus and widgets" with the addition of themes to personalise it to your liking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11754074481720895468gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11754074481720895468gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20725618001720895469gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20725618001720895469gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Along with Qt also comes SDL2 now integrated, which gives vast improvements to controller mapping and works across different platforms. Thanks to that PCSX2 now has automatic controller mapping, so you're only a few button clicks away from being set up with your favourite gamepads.</p>
<p>Plugins were removed, but they've now added in Automatic Game Fixes. Using their own database of all the games, they ship pre-configured fixes to ensure games will run smoothly so you shouldn't need to go in and change various settings for different games. However, the UI also now has a section for per-game settings for any personalized changes and tweaks you do wish to make.</p>
<p>The list just keeps going on and on. PCSX2 even has its own Big Picture Mode now too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8729967531720895879gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8729967531720895879gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also now support for <a href="https://retroachievements.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RetroAchievements</a>!</p>
<p>So many other additions like Vulkan API support, an upgraded patches system, various performance improvements, FFMPEG for video capture support, improved game compatibility, sound system improvements and much more.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://pcsx2.net/blog/2024/pcsx2-2-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lengthy blog post</a> for all the details.</p>

      <title>RPG Maker / Pixel Game Maker devs move to Godot for Action Game Maker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is certainly an interesting one. Gotcha Gotcha Games known for the RPG Maker series and Pixel Game Maker have announced Action Game Maker and it's being made with the open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Announced on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987180/ACTION_GAME_MAKER/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam page</a>, they said it's "designed to be the successor to Pixel Game Maker MV", which brought over their visual scripting inspired by the RPG Maker series but for a wider range of 2D action games. Their current code base was making things difficult to expand, with a lot of limitations and so they "decided that it is in the best long-term interests of our users to build a brand new Maker title, created from the ground up with a new framework" and that's where Action Game Maker comes in.</p>
<p>Much like their previous RPG Makers and Pixel Game Maker, it will be a no-code game creation tool that "builds on the node-based visual scripting system" from Pixel Game Maker MV so you don't need to know line-by-line written programming. And since they're building it on Godot, it's going to have a bunch of advanced features for those who want it, as noted on the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advanced Engine Technology With Godot Engine!</strong></p>
Take advantage of the excellent 2D functionality provided by Godot Engine, the popular open source engine powering ACTION GAME MAKER!
<ul>
<li>UI design based on the existing Godot UI</li>
<li>Support for GDScript is provided for those who want to move beyond visual scripting.</li>
<li>A complete 2D pipeline</li>
<li>Tile Map Editor with auto-tile function</li>
<li>Supports both sprite and 2D bone animation systems</li>
<li>Access to Godot's rich particle and shader systems as well as support for dynamic lighting and shadows, enabling a full suite of graphics features!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this time we might even see a proper Linux version for more game development to be done on Linux. Or at the very least, properly support Linux builds of game exports from it.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 30.2 is out now with native NVENC encode for Linux, shared texture support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Video recording and livestreaming tool OBS Studio version 30.2 is officially out now, bringing with it various new features and a nice few Linux improvements too.</p>
<p>For Linux users this release adds in native NVENC encoder support, which includes NVENC AV1! Plus there's also now shared texture support for the NVENC encoder, QuickSync encoder and VA-API encoder. For Linux they're also now enforcing the Qt Fusion style and they've also combined the PipeWire window/display capture into unified "Screen Capture" source to align with other platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10150475231720893427gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10150475231720893427gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's also a new Hybrid MP4 output format in Beta that "Combines fault-tolerance of fragmented MP4 with wide compatibility and faster access times of regular MP4", which also supports chapter markers in the file.</p>
<p>Some other new features include Enhanced RTMP/FLV multi-track audio and video, HEVC support to WebRTC output, an upgrade to the theme system, plus various other smaller UI improvements and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>One major new feature with Multitrack Video streaming (known as <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/multiple-encodes?language=en_US" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Enhanced Broadcasting</a> on Twitch) was added in, but that's currently <em>only</em> supported on Windows with other operating systems planned for a future release.</p>

      <title>Open Source implementation of GOG Galaxy&#39;s Communication Service, Comet sees a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it still has plenty of work ahead of it, Comet is a very promising project to bring the full power of GOG Galaxy over to Linux without needing to run their client in Wine. <em>Note: this is a community project, not from GOG themselves.</em></p>
<p>The first tagged release version 0.1.0 is out now bringing with it "all necessary SDK calls", allowing you to blast through GOG games and properly earn 100% of the achievements on Linux too. All without having to actually use GOG Galaxy. The whole point of Comet is to provide a platform-agnostic SDK, so it can be used in launchers like Heroic, Lutris and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15450684871720719014gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some of what they wish to do in future versions includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bring native comet support in Lutris and Heroic (have an option to toggle comet for games or globally without any manual effort).</li>
<li>Support official overlay on Mac and Windows. <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/issues/17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#17</a></li>
<li>Support overlay on Linux for Windows games.</li>
<li>Create decky loader plugin to display invites and achievements as you unlock them. <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/issues/18" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#18</a></li>
</ul>

      <title>Cute pet sim Hamster Playground is out now, free and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hamster Playground has today left Early Access as a finished game, ready for you to jump in and get adopting cute little furry friends. It has Native Linux support and is now Steam Deck Verified too!</p>
<p>If you like your more casual games, this is for you. Giving you a little world where you can take care of, train, and style your very own hamsters. A good one for audiences young and old. Have to admit, they did some pretty great work on the hamster movement in this, they're really cute…and silly. I had a good belly laugh seeing my little one bouncing up and down on a toy for the first time. What an odd game but adorable.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6X7hZQSkhK0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fef6bda1d2bc9c64e1922bc413e6ab95.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6X7hZQSkhK0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new 1.0 release brings some fresh mini-games, a whole bunch of new customization items for your hamsters and their home, new quests to run through and new rewards.</p>
<p>While the game is free to play, it does have some monetisation. There's various DLC you can buy that add in new items, costumes, more quests and so on. You can get a bit more of everything. They also have Diamonds you can buy from the Steam store to also buy more stuff in-game. Not too fond of the micro-transaction style currency, but the rest is fine.</p>
<p>It's very much like a simple The Sims, but for Hamsters. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience laid-back competition with a single button, yet prepare to break a sweat!</li>
<li>Race AI-driven hamsters in mazes and on drag strips, and other challenging mini-games.</li>
<li>Enjoy multiplayer modes, competing with up to 4 players locally or online.</li>
<li>Develop your hamsters' abilities and skillsets to take on higher-level opponents.</li>
<li>Expand and furnish your hamsters' house to create the mansion they deserve.</li>
<li>Customize your hamsters with over 100 cosmetic items and enjoy detailed graphics and cute animations throughout the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1442670/Hamster_Playground/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Super reaKtor is the most insane-looking bullet hell I&#39;ve seen in a good while</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Think you have fast reflexes? Super reaKtor looks like it will thoroughly test you with its rather unique take on bullet hell.</p>
<p>Here it's about avoiding and collecting at the same time with a rather original seeming control system. You directly control a laser beam with the ability to move it around quickly, resize it and rotate it. With a point of collecting green energy orbs flowing through the level, while avoiding everything else trying to smash you as you try to keep the weak-point ends of your beam safe.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARCADE MODES:</strong> Over 300 hand crafted patterns across 5 levels.</li>
<li><strong>ONLINE LEADERBOARDS:</strong> Compete with the world and your friends.</li>
<li><strong>TRAINING MODE:</strong> Master the patterns in a safe zone.</li>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Originally a hit arcade game from the 80s that eventually made its way to other popular systems at the time, Arc System Works acquired the rights to Double Dragon, Super Dodge Ball and Kunio-kun (River City) from Million Co, Ltd way back in <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/arc-system-works-acquires-property-rights-of-double-dragon-super-dodge-ball-kunio-kun-series-from-million-co-ltd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2015</a> so this has been in the works for a while.</p>

      <title>Drop Duchy combines Tetris-like block-dropping with kingdom building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have to admit, Drop Duchy is a clever blending of genres. Giving you the block-dropping from the likes of Tetris with you building up a kingdom. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> for this one.</p>
<p>Coming from developer Sleepy Mill Studio, founded by a former former lead game designer at Ubisoft Paris, it sounds really interesting. Here it's not just about stacking differently shaped blocks together to fit, it's also about strategy as you need to align certain blocks together to activate them fully to produce more resources and units. So it's a fair bit like the tile gameplay from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/planetiles-is-a-beautiful-blend-of-tetris-and-dorfromantik/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Planetiles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/relaxing-and-gorgeous-city-builder-dorfromantik-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dorfromantik</a> with a more Tetris-like theme.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dQMy_pAEwEQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f9a01e56ccfd505af5bf059575d5841.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dQMy_pAEwEQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intuitive, puzzle-esque nature of placing pieces makes <em>Drop Duchy</em>’s rewarding complexity welcoming to all. Well-played rounds lead a kingdom’s forces to branching, decision-packed routes in a grand march to storm an enemy fortress. Unlock upgrades and modifiers in the form of cards, gaining new bonus-granting structures, boosts to soldier recruitment &amp; resource gathering, and other perks through deep deck customization. Should forces fall before claiming the fortress as their own, jumping into a new round to experiment with an altered strategy takes a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>New factions and modifiers await the most formidable leaders, keeping <em>Drop Duchy</em>’s gameplay loop of block stacking, deck customization, and decision making fresh in challenge and opportunity. A delightful maquette-inspired aesthetic adds charm to <em>Drop Duchy</em>’s moment-to-moment action, upholding a cheery sense of adventure. Regardless of the battles and scenarios at hand, <em>Drop Duchy</em>’s challenge constantly feels exciting and packed with possibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An original mix of puzzle gameplay and real-time strategy.</li>
<li>A brand new game experience with each run thanks to procedural generation.</li>
<li>Play with 3 Factions: The Duchy, The Order, The Republic.</li>
<li>Meta progression: 50 challenges designed to help you through your journey.</li>
<li>Build the perfect deck with 80 unique cards.</li>
<li>An elegant and charming art direction to please your eyes.</li>
<li>An engaging and ever-evolving soundtrack to please your ears.</li>
<li>Choose your path between lakes, glades, forests, villages, guilds… and more!</li>

      <title>Customize your slice in Pizza Hero a (currently free) Vampire Survivor-like</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pizza Hero is a new Vampire Survivor-like that you can currently add a free copy of to your Steam account for a limited time. There's no date mentioned yet when it will become a paid game, but it's in their plans, so you may want to quickly add it to your Steam Library to keep it.</p>
<p>Seems it works well enough on Linux desktop / Steam Deck with Proton 9, although you do need to currently force-quit the game as it seems to stay open when you exit. Apart from that, a fun little idea to customize a pizza slice with toppings and spices as your powers while fighting off waves of enemies.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K8zr8rzLIw8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5cf833f79edc11b756bb6101d92071ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K8zr8rzLIw8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>15+ Damage Toppings.</li>
<li>6+ Passive Toppings.</li>
<li>Upgradable overall stats.</li>
<li>Auto rotate/firing controls (with option to focus different enemy types - Tank, Damage and Support).</li>
<li>Endless gameplay.</li>
<li>Survive waves to unlock the next stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2202770/Pizza_Hero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free (for now) on Steam</a>. It does have some items you can buy in the form of Pizza Tokens, which the developer said is purely to support development.</p>

      <title>Popular multiplayer code editor Zed gets a Linux release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little break in the gaming news for a moment to mention that Zed, a "high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of Atom and Tree-sitter", now has a Linux version available.</p>
<p>Something many have been wanting, because of how popular it is. Previously only officially available for macOS, the developers are not yet even providing official builds for Windows (but it can be built from source).</p>
<p>Announced via their blog in the "<a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-on-linux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux when? Linux now.</a>" post, it included a nice thank you note about how vital the community has been in pushing the rapid development of the Linux build.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/163177061720690828gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/163177061720690828gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It has some of the fanciest sounding features I've ever read for a code editor. Built like a video game as they said: "Zed’s breakthrough performance starts with our GPUI framework, a new way to build 2D user interfaces. GPUI rasterizes the entire window on the GPU, just like a 3D video game. The result? Fast, reliable, and smooth delivery of pixels on every frame.".</p>
<p>Not just that, it's built for collaboration too with a virtual office system with different channels, shared documents for notes, audio and text-based chat and so on. So, it sounds like an open-source Discord for programmers in a way.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://zed.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta adds many more Game Recording improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For both Steam desktop and Steam Deck, Valve released a fresh Steam Beta update that includes more improvements for the awesome <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/steam-game-recording-beta-announced-works-on-linux-and-steam-deck-too/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Game Recording feature</a>.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck Beta, the only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4257672198527349238" rel="noopener" target="_blank">change</a> that seemed specific to the Deck was this note: "Improvements to UI behaviors when finalizing the beginning and end of a clip". Other than that, it seems the rest apply to all platforms (except the Linux + macOS specific stuff of course).</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4230650600763090834?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for desktop:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Improved detection of Nintendo Switch Pro controller.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could delete a workshop file if the file had failed a file validation check and had been reacquired.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to drag and scroll behaviors when finalizing the beginning and end of a clip.</li>

<li>Added a warning to the user if game recording has been turned off to prioritize broadcasting.</li>
<li>Ignore user marker shortcut key if game recording is disabled.</li>
<li>Improved reliability of saving/renaming of .m4s video segment files when antivirus software locks the files temporarily.</li>
<li>Added the ability to save a specific frame of a video as a Steam screenshot.</li>
<li>Improved default naming of clip files to improve readability and sortability. Steam will also scan game state descriptions to apply to default clip filename, if available.</li>
<li>Fixed an exception thrown if the user cancelled a clip save in the file picker dialog.</li>
<li>Updated message displayed when there is no recent other session where the user can send a clip.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed some UI issues in user login.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you been enjoying the Game Recording feature? Let me know how you've been getting on with it in the comments. I'm currently missing the option to just open the folder where the shots are stored, which Valve seems to have removed.</p>

<p>More about it: "Inspired by the golden age of street skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity, including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots."</p>

      <title>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers is releasing in August to be your next obsession</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This might perhaps pull a bunch of you away from Balatro, as Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers a card-flipping, risk-taking roguelike deckbuilder is releasing on August 8th. It comes with Native Linux support and a demo is still currently available to try it.</p>
<p>Seems it was quite popular too with the developer noting it was one of the top 25 most-played demos, and it's managed to amass over 120K wishlists. So, it should do quite well at release then.</p>
<p>In Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers, players build powerful decks to take on the greedy upper echelons of capitalist business baddies exploiting the local gamblers. Come launch, players will be able to choose from a collection of over 300 cards, with each round demanding new and improved strategies in order to bag the jackpot. </p>

      <title>Satisfactory 1.0 is releasing in September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of sprawling building and automation sims, Satisfactory 1.0 is planned to release on September 10th. Satisfactory works well on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, and it's rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/4270057097478183701" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> post goes into a little detail on what to expect that include highlights like a flushable toilet. Yes really. But there's more than just some plumbing being done. The developer mentioned an update to the map to have some more resource nodes, changes to recipe costs, research updates, lots and lots of performance optimizations. Going over the details of their tweaks, it certainly looks like progression will be a bit smoother.</p>
<p>Another interesting one is the improvements to dedicated servers that will introduce a new API so "it will be possible to develop external applications that can talk directly to the server". Will be fun to see what people come up with for that.</p>
<p>Plus so much more they will reveal over time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="febekpSoEbA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ace6e2aa66c5b7df468e96f163ee5bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/febekpSoEbA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The price is also due to rise soon from $29.99 to $39.99. Currently it's 50% off during the Steam Summer Sale so you may want to be quick before it jumps up a fair bit.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley is getting a Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 cross-over mod with Baldur&#39;s Village</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only a matter of time wasn't it? 3 fans of both games decided to take matters into their own hands to combine Stardew Valley and Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>There's no clear timeline on a release just yet, but the <em>latest</em> update from one of the people working on it <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1809977536342032475" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> the first part may appear "this fall or winter".</p>
<p>The original announcement <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1784190551211839734" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> plans for including "a new map and residents from Baldur's Gate 3" which includes the likes of Astarion, Shadowheart, Gale and Halsin. Originally, Astarion was the single character you could date and they said he will have a "unique romance plot" but they've now <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1792230292230438960" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added</a> Halsin into that too with more romance options based on voting from their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xunhe1145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a>. The map size has also doubled since their original plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14824536511720613863gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14824536511720613863gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>In the latest update they also mentioned Roland being added as a new character, they're working on the daily schedule of each NPC to "make their relationship more real" and for "some old friends to have activities together", along with ongoing work on "spouse rooms, patios, and special furniture related to the character's experience". We're even going to get some seasonal outfits.</p>
<p>Some other shots they shared:</p>

<p>This would be a good time to remind you of the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/nexus-mods-want-feedback-from-linux-steam-deck-users-on-their-new-cross-platform-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cross-platform Nexus modding app</a>, which recently had a first Alpha release and Stardew Valley is the initial supported game. So hopefully by the time Baldur's Village releases it will be super-simple to get it working on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>AMD releases FidelityFX SDK 1.1.0 with FSR 3.1 and Vulkan support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for developers and open source, as AMD have now finally put up a new release of the FidelityFX SDK which now has FidelityFX FSR 3.1.</p>
<p>The AMD FidelityFX SDK v1.1 update bringing FSR 3.1 includes quite a lot of fun sounding changes, hopefully something we will see more developers now implementing into their games and game engines.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">FSR 3.1 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>FSR 3.1 Upscaler reduces ghosting, improves convergence speed and reduces flickering.</li>
<li>Frame pacing for FSR Frame Interpolation has been improved for an even better experience.</li>
<li>FSR3.1 adds the ability to decouple the frame interpolation process from that of upscaling, so it can be used with any upscaler the user desires, or at native resolution.</li>
<li>FSR 3.1 introduces the FSR API, which makes integrations of FSR future proof, so applications using this interface can be updated to upcoming versions of FSR more easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus FSR 3.1 also has a new a new API added for "forward compatibility" that includes native DirectX 12 and Vulkan backends. The Vulkan support is also brand new as of this release!</p>
<p>This release also introduces the new FidelityFX Breadcrumbs library to help detect sources of GPU crashes. Also new is Brixelizer, that's a highly-optimized GPU sparse distance field builder that can handle both static and dynamic geometry and features a shader API that allows you to trace rays against the scene from any shader of your choice. Then there's also Brixelizer GI, which is a compute-based real-time dynamic global illumination solution built upon the sparse distance fields built by FidelityFX Brixelizer.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.4 brings D8VK for Direct3D 8 support, frame rate limiter adjustments, lots of game fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big release of DXVK, the Vulkan-based implementation of Direct3D for Linux with Wine / Proton, has arrived. Version 2.4 expands the Direct3D support to version 8 now thanks to D8VK. So this means now DXVK as of this version covers Direct3D 8/9/10/11 and VKD3D-Proton continues for Direct3D 12.</p>
<p>Developer Ethan Lee (FNA / Linux ports) also had a nice <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3738" rel="noopener" target="_blank">code merge</a> for this release with the addition of support for multiple window system backends that the application can choose between at runtime. On top of that, there's now proper ABI versioning for native libraries.</p>
<p>The frame rate limiter was also adjusted for non-native refresh rate emulation as explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In environments where the display mode cannot be changed (e.g. Proton), it is possible that DXVK reports a different refresh rate to the game than what the display is currently running at. This is problematic for games that require to be run at 60 FPS but do not limit their frame rate when using a 60 Hz display mode.</p>
<p>To work around this, the frame rate limiter will now be engaged automatically if a game runs in full-screen mode with vertical synchronization enabled, and if the detected frame rate over a short period of time is higher than the refresh rate of the selected display mode.</p>
<p>In case a game runs at a lower rate than expected and does not provide an in-game option to change refresh rate, this behaviour can be disabled by setting <code class="inline-code">d3d9.maxFrameRate = -1</code> (or the corresponding <code class="inline-code">dxgi</code> option for D3D10+ games). Setting <code class="inline-code">DXVK_FRAME_RATE</code> also overrides this behaviour as usual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This now also applies to VKD3D-Proton as of <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/commit/80f6c46e43e9f018d34e266ed939c4531a283b05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this commit</a> or later.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">You will also find game fixes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battlefield 2, 2142:</li>
<li>Dead Space 2</li>
<li>Dragonshard</li>
<li>Fallout 4</li>

<p>There's more like improved compatibility to third-party mods hooking various DXGI entry points and various other miscellaneous fixes and updates.</p>
<p>For the full detail see the <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>If you're curious on how to upgrade, you don't actually need to do anything. Proton and GE-Proton use DXVK directly, and so they both pull in updates in their new releases. However, for those who like to live on the wild side, you can upgrade the DXVK version in Proton yourself. Do it at your own risk.</p>
<p>To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of the latest DXVK. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p>For Proton 9 and Proton Experimental:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/files</code></p>
<p>Proton 8 and below:</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>Relaxing nature-stacking puzzle-building game Preserve launches August 8</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Preserve from developer Bitmap Galaxy is a relaxing puzzle nature-building game that's going to enter Early Access on August 8th. With full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Taking a rather relaxed approach to building sims with puzzle elements, Preserve certainly looks interesting. The objective is to foster and sustain a thriving and diverse biomes, where each component coexists in a symbiotic harmony. By utilizing strategic thinking and a keen eye for balance, players are granted the power to position a wide array of plants and animals, curating an environment that caters to their preferences and aspirations. Reminds me a bit of Terra Nil in a way.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e_y3W7biWcE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f3ac33f1df37c835201f40d0a9555fa8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e_y3W7biWcE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vertical map expansion - In Preserve, you can expand the map not only horizontally, but you also posses an ability to stack layers of nature, forming a vertical network of interconnected habitats.</li>
<li>Diverse biome habitats - From alpine forests and savannas to carribean reefs, each biome will have its own unique set of plants, animals, and environmental challenges to discover and overcome.</li>
<li>Multiple Game Modes - Besides regular harmony and puzzle game modes, creative mode lets you build the land without limitations and photo mode allows you to capture and share your creations at the end of each session.</li>
<li>Natural Wonders - Nothing can beautify your map more than natural wonders like the snowy Alps, lavender fields or redwood forests, which you can acquire thanks to a unique card upcycle system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“We are thrilled to finally release Preserve into Early Access and let fans get their hands on all the new content we’ve been working on” said Peter Janosik, Studio Lead &amp; Programmer at Bitmap Galaxy. “The new Marine Biome adds a whole new dimension to the game, and players will love creating ocean-dwelling habitats. We can’t wait to hear feedback from our community and we have more to reveal throughout Early Access leading up to our 1.0 launch.” </p>

      <title>90s styled Old School Rally hits Early Access on July 19</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old School Rally is bringing some serious vibes from retro 90s racers like Colin McRae Rally and it's confirmed to hit Early Access on July 19th.</p>
<p>The developer noted that the Steam Deck is "fully supported" through Proton. There's no official verification done from Valve yet, but I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/old-school-rally-plans-full-support-for-steam-deck-got-me-feeling-nostalgic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously highlight</a> their support of it. So it will also work great on desktop Linux!</p>
<p>From what the developer said: "'Old School Rally' features nostalgic visual aesthetics and thrilling racing gameplay loyal to the classic era. With over 55,000 wishlists and a passionate community, "Old School Rally" has taken players' feedback seriously. The Early Access version of 'Old School Rally' includes many important features and improvements requested by the community, such as Ghost, Steering Sensitivity, Stage Optimization, and Wheel Support, along with new cars, new stages, and a brand new "Rally" mode. Of course, as Early Access progresses, planned new game modes, new features, and new content will be patched into the game regularly!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="62T8hbNBXfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fdb06debb31eecbe3832d3f42dc0fe46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/62T8hbNBXfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2824660/Old_School_Rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will be priced at $9.99.</p>
<p>Nice to see a resurgence in these retro-racers that go for fun, rather than realistic visuals. Like we've seen with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/drive-rally-gets-a-new-trailer-to-show-off-new-gameplay-and-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#DRIVE Rally</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/parking-garage-rally-circuit-coming-by-dev-of-jellycar-with-linux-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a> recently.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers for installing popular stores on Steam Deck has big improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NonSteamLaunchers is a tool for installing various popular game stores / launchers on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with the latest release being a big improvement.</p>
<p>The developer released version 3.9.1 towards the end of June, which included a big refactor to the code and managed to cut it down quite a lot. As a result, it has also fixed "the EA APP path not found error as well as battles nets and GOG's errors from installing at times".</p>
<p>Not only that, the developer said it's much easier to add launchers now, so anyone can take a look at the code and submit a launcher they think will work.</p>
<p>ProtonTricks compatibility has also seen a big improvement with this release. The uninstall button should now work properly for all launchers and there's a new "Legacy Games" scanner.</p>
<p>It currently supports the Amazon Games Launcher, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Humble Games Collection, IndieGala, Itch.io, Legacy Games, Rockstar Games Launcher, Ubisoft Connect, Glyph, Playstation Plus and also VK Play. On top of that it supports setting up various streaming services like Netflix. This is probably one of the simplest ways to get everything you need up and running.</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>You can download it manually and use it as a standalone app on Linux desktop / Steam Deck, and it's also being made into a Decky Loader plugin but it's <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-plugin-database/pull/527" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not quite</a> finished for that yet. See all on <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Clean up the ocean in the demo for Spilled!</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spilled! from developer Lente is a sweet casual game about driving your little boat around to clean up the ocean. It has a new demo available with a big graphics upgrade. Tested working great on desktop Linux with Proton 9.</p>
<p>Not only is this cute game about a boat, it's <em>made</em> on a boat too. Solo developer Lente from the Netherlands lives and develops her games on a boat. She grew up on a ship and that has always stayed with her, and she and her mother renovated the boat, making it one of the most original game studio locations!</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6DEt2Yw8GrM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/579f15458375cfb1fce915a805a94b7b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6DEt2Yw8GrM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Short but satisfying - Move through 8 areas, each bigger in size and with more waste. No rush, take as long as you want. Spilled! is a short yet cozy game that you can finish in 1 hour, but you can use the level select to go back to any area if you just want to relax!</li>
<li>Recycle &amp; earn coins - Clean up a whole area to move on to the next! The water gets clearer the more you recycle, revealing underwater life that is different for each area!</li>
<li>Upgrade your boat - Prepare for the next area: tackle bigger oil spills with a bigger collector, hold more oil with an upgraded tank and cover larger distances with upgraded speed!</li>
<li>Find &amp; rescue animals - Each area has 2 different animals to find and rescue, for a total of 16! See which ones you've already saved in the options menu. Or which ones you've missed!</li>
<li>Face new challenges - Each area has a new challenge to overcome! Push plastic to the recycling centre, wash oil off of the land, help retrieve lost items to other boats, put out wildfires, go magnet fishing and more currently in development!</li>
<li>Explore new biomes - While cleaning up the environment, you move through 4 biomes: grass, rock, sand and snow!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Dimhaven Enigmas is a new first-person puzzler from the team behind Quern</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zadbox Entertainment who created the Myst-like Quern - Undying Thoughts are working on another interesting first-person puzzler with Dimhaven Enigmas. It's confirmed to once again have Native Linux support.</p>
<p>In Dimhaven Enigmas the player takes on the role of Emily Ravenstone on a mission to find her uncle on Dimhaven: an isolated island in an alternate reality in the 1980s. The once lively tourist paradise is now left almost completely abandoned and isolated by the mysterious events of the last few years. Air traffic is almost non-existent, and most of the residents left just before the closure of the airport. Cargo transportation ceased long ago, and barely any news reaches the island - and none leaves it. Or at least so it seems.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cm2BFzqnQnI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/09f80f3ead9d18a9a36101a2770f6c49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cm2BFzqnQnI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To tackle annoying pixel hunting and to be a little more inviting for casual adventurers, the game also features interaction indicators and a progressive hint system. This system offers gradually more revealing hints based on the items in your inventory, puzzle progress, found clues and most importantly: a safe way to nose around inside the game without breaking immersion.</p>
<p>The game's soundtrack is composed by Marcell Kerepesi, who scored the whole of Quern’s beautiful OST. Dimhaven’s music and atmosphere is powered by a dynamic system that will always adapt to the player’s progress.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2458980/Dimhaven_Enigmas/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> and support it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zadbox/dimhaven-enigmas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>

      <title>Chaotic multiplayer physics-brawler Bare Butt Boxing releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Early Access since May last year, Tuatara Games are readying up their chaotic brawler Bare Butt Boxing for release on August 1.</p>
<p>Tuatara Games usually work in the field of visual effects for AAA studios like Riot Games (Valorant), Epic Games (Fortnite), Counterplay Games (Godfall), and many more but wanted more and so Bare Butt Boxing is their first self-published game.</p>
<p>Colourful and mischievous aliens land on Earth to host unregulated boxing matches. Launch your opponents or the giant beach ball in portals to earn points based on which game mode is on. Whoever has the most points when the round is over wins! Face up to 3 friends locally, join 6-player online matches, or fight with bots in single player mode.</p>
<p>Punching is not the only key to victory : collect item boxes to use special powers like the powerful vacuum and super frenzy to turn the tides of battle. Keep an eye on stage hazards to avoid falling off the level! The gusting winds on the Mountain top and disappearing platforms at the neon disco Arcade can mess your score badly if you are not careful.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3Sb3wLYwedg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dff5c3959b8bab1914898745617a61c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3Sb3wLYwedg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We are truly grateful to all the players that joined us in Early Access. With 1.0 we wanted to wrap up the game with more content and a bigger emphasis on local multiplayer, which has been heavily requested.” said Klemen Lozar, founder of Tuatara Games.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186660/Bare_Butt_Boxing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it or buy it on Steam right now</a>. The full game updates on August 1st. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating currently.</p>

      <title>Bite-sized roguelike tower defense game Bella Wants Blood releases July 24</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Sonderland (previously worked on Landnama, Core Defense) announced their roguelike tower defense game Bella Wants Blood is going to release on July 24 and it's a perfect coffee-break game. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent over a key, thoughts will be up around release.</p>
<p>What they said about it: "We made Bella Wants Blood as an absurd, bite-sized roguelike terror defense game with a ‘Slay the Spire’ style map of branching paths to choose the battles you want to face along with the rewards that come with them. It’s bloody, silly, easy to pick up and play, and brimming with ridiculous atmosphere."</p>
<p>Giving you small levels where you carve out a path, along with different types of strange towers, and then the progress from the likes of Slay the Spire, it's certainly an interesting combo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pl3KKcAHPUk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aafffec8e205c5e1516e0f055d9aeab7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pl3KKcAHPUk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's now releasing July 24th with Native Linux support for $4.99.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3007660/Bella_Wants_Blood/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes up the new Riven from Cyan Worlds videos on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyan Worlds Inc recently released the brand new Riven that's a re-imagined, and expanded version of the classic from 1997. It had a bit of trouble with videos on Linux / Steam Deck though.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter), Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://x.com/Plagman2/status/1809637510047576444" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fix has just been deployed for the missing videos in Riven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griffais didn't go into detail on what was changed, and it seems it wasn't through a Proton update. Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1712350/history/?changeid=24262025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, they've tagged it as using H.264. So it's a back-end change Valve did on their servers, to ensure that the videos get sorted correctly for Linux players using Proton on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LN1TQm942_U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/263aebe9a1b0d4a989efe9d8d0417f1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LN1TQm942_U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Riven takes you on a journey through dense jungles, awe-inspiring caverns, and monolithic structures. Explore a world bent to the whims of a man who sees himself as a god and where every corner will immerse you in an otherworldly adventure.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em> rewards careful observation. Challenge <em>Riven’s</em> cunning puzzles, deftly woven throughout its narrative. The environment of <em>Riven</em> will reveal the story of this world as you make meaning from seemingly disparate bits of information and learn everything you need to know about this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a reminder, to get the re-encoded videos for games in Proton, you need to have the Shader Pre-Cache system turned on in Steam (Settings -&gt; Downloads). Otherwise, for the games Valve has sorted the videos for, you'll end up seeing a <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14577733731720432045gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank">test-screen</a> instead of videos.</p>
<p>You can buy Riven from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/riven" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-10 adds ELDEN RING EAC fix, pulls in latest DXVK code for d8vk</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 9-10 was released July 7th updating various internal tech as usual to improve gaming on Linux / Steam Deck so here's what's new.</p>
<p>Firstly, until FromSoftware actually fix up ELDEN RING EAC for players who don't own the DLC, GE-Proton now includes the fix I suggested users try <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/elden-ring-should-now-have-fixed-the-inappropriate-activity-issue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in my previous article</a>. Apart from that, it's just updating the various included parts like DXVK and VKD3D-Proton to the very latest code available from Git which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>Updated wine-mono to 9.2.0</li>
<li>Updated dxvk to latest git (which includes d8vk now)</li>
<li>Removed d8vk build options as it's part of dxvk now</li>
<li>Updated proton script so that d8vk is enabled by default as part of dxvk's files</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While DXVK hasn't seen a fresh release yet (likely sometime soon), the latest Git code has now pulled in d8vk for supporting Direct3D 8 over Vulkan. Which means DXVK now does Direct3D 8/9/10/11!</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>.

      <title>Tech-noir musical tactics game All Walls Must Fall is now permanently free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer inbetweengames announced that their game All Walls Must Fall from 2018 is now permanently free.</p>
<p>More about it: All Walls Must Fall is an isometric tactics game where actions happen to the pulsing beat of the music. You control time travelling secret agents as they jump and loop through a single night in the city of Berlin. Using a pausable real-time system, carefully plan your decisions and use powerful time manipulation abilities to your advantage, as you carry out your mission in the shadows or in plain sight. Levels are procedurally recombined, giving All Walls Must Fall a highly replayable campaign structure, while still offering individually crafted components and set-pieces.</p>
<p>All Walls Must Fall takes inspiration from genre classics like X-Com, Syndicate and REZ, as well more recent indie games like The Banner Saga, Braid, SUPERHOT and Crypt of the Necrodancer.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy playing our tech-noir tactics game that we made. We put a lot of our hearts into it, and while we've all moved on to other projects now, that time we made our own little indie game will always be special to us.</p>
<p>Love from Berlin,<br/>
Isaac, David and Rafal<br/>

      <title>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak adds English support plus Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak from Nihon Falcom, PH3 GmbH and NIS America, Inc. hit Steam back in March 2023. However, it was only supported for the Japanese language, now it's been updated in a big way with English language support and Steam Deck improvements too.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> they mentioned they made changes to the UI to render at a better quality for lower resolutions where "UI text is now much more readable on these devices". So it should be a good experience now too. Nice to see some attention there as always!</p>
<p>There's lots more new in this update including improved shadows, improved reflections, HDR support, Dynamic Steam Cloud support, MSAA, SGSSAA, and transparency MSAA, a modification to the physics system to improve it at high framerates and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138610/view/4156338670609987904" rel="noopener" target="_blank">list goes on</a>.</p>

      <title>Comedy adventure 3 Minutes to Midnight set to release in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a good bit of silence, 3 Minutes to Midnight is pretty much done now with the developers noting they're reading it for release in August. This follows their Kickstarter success back in 2019.</p>
<p>What is it? A comedy adventure with a sprawling story and colorful cast. Betty Anderson can’t remember who she is, but she has bigger worries—like a doomsday plot threatening to wipe out the human race. Join Betty to crack the conspiracy that starts with a bang and ends at 3 Minutes to Midnight.</p>
<p>The latest update on their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scarecrowstudio/3-minutes-to-midnight-a-comedy-graphic-adventure/posts/4138491" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter notes</a> it will be "released between the 5th and the 16th of August 2024" with a proper set date and new trailer due <em>sometime</em> soon. Language support has also expanded so now it will have support for Spanish, German, English, French, Brazilian Portuguese, and Catalan with others coming post-release.</p>
<p>It also clearly notes the game will have full Native Linux and Steam Deck support at release.</p>
<p>They also put up a sneak-peak video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JPap_Yw5kxw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fac080816129a03e1095e9829c4613d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JPap_Yw5kxw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full post goes into a fair bit of detail all the improvements they've managed to put in, along with various things that went wrong like logistical issues with the actors, technical issues and more. Worth a read.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/832500/3_Minutes_to_Midnight__A_Comedy_Graphic_Adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Factorio: Space Age and the 2.0 free update set for release in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Factory building sim Factorio is getting a huge expansion with Factorio: Space Age set for release on October 21st along with a big free 2.0 update for everyone. The expansion will be priced at $35, the same as the base game and seems it will be absolutely full of new toys for you.</p>
<p>This expansion continues your journey after finishing the base game where you blast off into space. Here you get to discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms. Of course that comes with its own set of perils like asteroids that need to be shot down, or captured for fuel and ammo.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10707153091720201602gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10707153091720201602gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The new planets will each be rather different with these being revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulcanus - Blazing volcanic mountains, imposing geological landforms, plains blanketed in ash, and thick yellow sulfuric fog that burns your lungs and etches your eyes.</li>
<li>Fulgora - A lifeless and desolate place. The thin air is freezing cold but bone dry. A distant sun twinkles in the dull purple of the sky. Wispy clouds race by as a gale whips up sand that grates against your armour.</li>
<li>Gleba - A vibrant multi-coloured swampy landscape shrouded in a light mist. The air is thick and humid, carrying the muffled cries of unseen animals from far away.</li>
</ul>
<p>They say a 5th planet yet to be shown "promises some of the most unique gameplay but it remains shrouded in mystery". It's the furthest from the sun so it's going to be dark and cold. <em>Curious.</em></p>
<p>We're also getting elevated rails, so your rail networks can cross over obstacles, cross the oceans and — you get the idea. You'll be able to make much more fancy rail systems. There's also a new quality system for items, entities and equipment, new music, new enemies and defence systems and plenty more to be announced.</p>
<p>And that's all on top of the big 2.0 update that will give us goodies like a new fluid system, smarter worker robots and much more.</p>
<p>You can see their <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full blog post</a> for more on what's to come.</p>
<p>Factorio is available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Happy Birthday to GamingOnLinux - 15 years old today</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are those some spots I see in the mirror? Must be the teens. GamingOnLinux, the website, is another year older today and I'm still blown away by what we've achieved together. 15 years! I can hardly believe it.</p>
<p>This year, amazingly, I don't have a whole lot to talk about for this article. Why? Well, things are — great? Looking back over the years of website birthdays at things I've talked about we've been through the Steam Machines, Proton, Steam Deck and so much more. Right now, it's the best Linux gaming has ever been. It's easier than ever. What a fantastic place to be in.</p>

      <title>GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin moves to a more rapid release cycle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind the free and open source GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin have announced a big change to their plans, along with a new much more rapid release schedule.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/07/02/dolphin-releases-announcement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned how the last actual "release" with 5.0 was back in 2016, and they've just continually added bits to it over time. Now though, they're doing away with that and moving to a "rolling release cycle" as they said:</p>
<p>"However, the purpose of our old stable builds is now no longer relevant to Dolphin Emulator. We no longer need a benchmark to compare against or an anchor to ground us. We have grown beyond them. So in leaving the 5.0 era behind, we are also leaving behind that release scheme and all it offered. In exchange, we're not just giving you a release today, but also a commitment to continuous releases from now on. The long drought of Dolphin releases is no more and will never happen again!"</p>
<p>Now they will have proper fully tagged releases based on the year and month, so the latest brand new release is 2407 that went up 2 days ago. Development builds will simply add a number after for the number of code commits done like 2407-144 and they will continue to roll out multiple releases a year and said they will keep doing progress report blog posts too.</p>
<p>The blog announcement goes over details about why it's not just being called Dolphin 6.0 and to sum up a few paragraphs there — they just didn't feel it was needed due to how development has come along in the last eight years</p>
<p>Also they have a refreshed logo:</p>

      <title>#DRIVE Rally gets a new trailer to show off new gameplay and features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>#DRIVE Rally is actually looking pretty darn good. A reinvention of classic 90s rally racing with a whole lot of content and features to be excited about.</p>
<p>From a roster of up to 36 legendary rally cars, to the more than 400 kilometers of winding roads and paths that you will be able to drive with keyboard and mouse, gamepads and yes racing wheels are supported too. We'll be able to experience the thrill of rally racing with passionate co-drivers that "react dynamically to your driving, offering both praise and critique while helping you navigate the twists and turns of every stage". Plenty of customization too with a variety of paint jobs, decals, and performance upgrades to make each car truly your own.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bFQKXF8DFl4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6018b1fd3f2d83a6d3f41efadc5d9616.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bFQKXF8DFl4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>#DRIVE All Over the World</strong>: From the sunny landscapes of Dry Crumbs, through the whispering woods of Holzberg, to the chilly wilderness of Revontuli, each track offers unique features and asks drivers to go the distance.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Cars</strong>: Jump behind the wheel of legendary rally cars, including Das Holzwagen, The Doggo, The Bobond, and many more from the studio’s previous title #DRIVE. New from the ‘90s era are Das Sandsturm and Celestia, just for a start!</li>
<li><strong>Passionate Co-Drivers</strong>: For better or worse, your co-driver is with you to the end! There to help and lend some humourous jabs, they’re your trusty navigator —and your worst critic.</li>
<li><strong>#DRIVE Design</strong>: It’s your way <em>and</em> the highway, baby! From tires to tailpipe, build your car to your liking. Add your special touches with paintwork, decals, and decorations. Take a picture in Photo Mode - it’ll last longer.</li>
<li><strong>#DRIVE Like it’s 1999</strong>: pumped up with 90’s Easter Eggs and references in an adoring homage to the thunderous days of rally racing circa 1990s, this game feels like a finely-tuned arcade experience, with no coins needed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release. With a plan for Early Access sometime "this Autumn".</p>

      <title>Castle Come is a &#39;walking fortress roguelike&#39; that sounds simply awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now and then I come across a game and just think - I have to have it. Castle Come is one of those times, a roguelike where you control a walking fortress you build up as you go. Hopefully it will work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux / Steam Deck, I will be surprised if it doesn't.</p>
<p>In Castle Come, you scout a strange land full of bandits in search of new parts, defeat enemy fortresses and scavenge the wreckage, recruit crew to man your growing arsenal of weapons and build your way from an agile little fortling into a deadly, hulking, monster machine.</p>
<p>In combat, <em>Castle Come</em> switches to a <em>Tekken</em>-inspired 2.5D fighting view where you can make use of sidesteps, dodges and rams. Take advantage of a stylish time-slowing feature that kicks in whenever you line up a shot from one of your arsenal of weapons - from machine guns and mine launchers, to chicken pens and giant boulders. Take control of every weapon yourself, or leave your crew to fire at will as you juggle active reloads, cooldowns and movement in the search for maximum efficiency on the battlefield. </p>
<p>Yep, I absolutely need to play this. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qyk-7FXxxI8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44e24dcf16631a4da4bb0351d82e3c63.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qyk-7FXxxI8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Our tiny two-person team is really excited to be able to announce Castle Come to the world with our first trailer,” said Sam Vonäsch, producer and designer. “We’re looking forward to being able to share more about the game’s mechanics, our special take on narration and when it will be releasing, in the future.” </p>
<p>Give it a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902970/Castle_Come/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">click to follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to fix the ELDEN RING &#39;inappropriate activity&#39; issue on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new patch has been rolled out for ELDEN RING, and it's supposed to fix the inappropriate activity detected message from their anti-cheat with a bit of manual effort. Here's what to do. This issue affected Linux desktop, Steam Deck and it seems people on Windows PCs as well.</p>
<p>From their patch notes for version 1.12.3 it notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the PC Version, the message "Inappropriate activity detected" may appear without cheating.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix this issue, please verify the integrity of the game's files before restarting the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the PC version, unstable framerate may be caused by third party applications that control mouse behavior. Deactivating these third party applications may improve performance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>For once, it wasn't a Linux system specific issue.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13498587471720086053gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13498587471720086053gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To note, I do <strong>not</strong> have the DLC yet. And it seems FromSoftware haven't been doing thorough testing for people who do <em>not</em> have the DLC. If you <em>do</em> have the DLC, verifying the files might be enough to fix it as they suggest.</p>
<p>What if you <em>don't</em> have the DLC? Well, thanks to an answer on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1245620#pqU185GyV2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, you <em>can</em> fix it yourself. As always, do my fix suggestions <u>at your own risk</u>.</p>
<p>All you have to do is open up the installed folder, go into the "Game" folder and create an empty "DLC.bdt" file.</p>
<p>So in Steam (Desktop mode for Steam Deck) -&gt; Right click on ELDEN RING -&gt; properties -&gt; Installed files -&gt; Browse. Then go into the Game folder. Two ways to do it (tested using KDE Plasma):</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click -&gt; create new -&gt; text file -&gt; name it in the text box "DLC.bdt" (remove the .txt).</li>
<li><u>OR</u> Right click in an empty space -&gt; select Open Terminal Here and type "touch DLC.bdt".</li>
</ul>
<p>And you're done. It will now work.</p>

      <title>The community won the battle, so PvP battler Fishards is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in June the developers of Fishards put out a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/fight-the-devs-of-fishards-if-you-win-it-goes-open-source-lose-and-its-deleted-from-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bit of an ultimatum</a>: fight them in-game and win to make the game open source, or they will nuke the game from orbit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the community came together, and won. So now Fishards has been made <a href="https://github.com/charlesmaddock/fishards" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source</a>, and it's still free to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637140/Fishards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DHhCwnTPqf8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c49fc4a35152bb162d3e71ba1f99d0d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DHhCwnTPqf8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A good chance for people to learn from a complete and released game.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. Perhaps now someone can put in a few fixes to get it bumped up to Steam Deck Verified, and keep expanding it. The game uses <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, so there's nothing stopping a willing developer having a look to see what they can do.</p>
<p>Always nice to see another game become open source to ensure it can live on forever.</p>

      <title>PSA: If you use Bazzite you need to do a manual fix to get updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, the popular version of Linux powered by Fedora and Universal Blue that's great for handhelds including the Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go and others needs a little manual user effort after a bit of human error.</p>
<p>Unless you take action, you will <em>not</em> get any updates going forward. Developer Jorge O. Castro noted in a forum post how they "were rotating our cosign keypairs this morning, which is the method that we use to sign our images" and unfortunately they "made a critical error which has resulted in forcing you to take manual steps to migrate to our newly signed images".</p>
<p>However, this only affects people who installed Bazzite on a device before July 2nd, if you downloaded it <em>after</em> July 3rd, you're all good.</p>
<p>They have a script set up that you can run that will fix the problem, so all you have to do is run this in a terminal app (<a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/config/blob/5c4144d38a2a61e44ca704ffdf2d50bbcb9ff7ed/scripts/fix-key-and-update.sh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">code source</a>):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">curl -sL https://fix.universal-blue.org/ | sudo bash </code></p>
<p>To ensure it doesn't ever happen again, they've noted some <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main/issues/600" rel="noopener" target="_blank">process changes</a> to be implemented.</p>
<p>See all the details in the <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/important-announcement-regarding-system-updates-action-needed/2689" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum post announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus mods want feedback from Linux / Steam Deck users on their new cross-platform app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/nexus-mods-app-is-an-in-development-replacement-for-vortex-that-will-support-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I wrote about the brand new Nexus mods app</a> before, as it's quite a promising and <em>exciting</em> development for the future of modding (especially for Linux and Steam Deck). And now, they want your feedback.</p>
<p>This is going to replace their previous apps like Vortex, eventually anyway. Right now, it's only made ready for Stardew Valley, since it's a very popular game for mods and is also cross-platform so it makes it simpler for them to get all the features of the app ready.</p>
<p>Yesterday, July 1st, they announced the Alpha release of this next-generation mod manager and their new Product Manager got in touch to mention they "would be really keen to get feedback from Linux users". So this is your chance to ensure Linux (and Steam Deck) finally become a first-class citizen for game modding.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4821676801719938448gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4821676801719938448gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - me testing out the Nexus Mod app</em></p>
<p>They said they plan to release an app update every 3 weeks going forward, and the next game they plan to add support for will be Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15033" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their news post</a>. Exciting times ahead!</p>
<p>You can grab it from their <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/GettingStarted/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download page</a>, and the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

      <title>Magnificent chunky shooter Selaco gets a &#39;MEGA&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco is easily one of the biggest highlights of the year, with its mixture of over-the-top action and chunky retro visuals. Altered Orbit Studios also just pushed out a big upgrade for it. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">See my initial review for more thoughts</a>.</em></p>
<p>Not only is there a lot of improvements to the game, but the soundtrack is now live too, along with a bunch of bonus content thrown in like unused tracks that didn't make it into the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1606647811719935736gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1606647811719935736gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights from the update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added "Resume Game" button in the main menu.</li>
<li>Added level versioning system.</li>
<li>Added "Hard-Boiled!" mutator.</li>
<li>Added "Armor Up" mutator.</li>
<li>Added "Extended Bullet Casings" graphical setting.</li>
<li>New weapon upgrades.</li>
<li>Weapon kit reworks.</li>
<li>Improved navigation in the earlier levels.</li>
<li>Improved general feel of the game.</li>
<li>Improved map screen.</li>
<li>Improved movement options.</li>
<li>Blood is now 0.2% more purple.</li>
<li>+ lots more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also mentioned a save issue between Steam Deck / Linux and Windows that should be solved now too. So if you've swapped between Proton and the Native Build (Or a Windows PC and a Steam Deck), it shouldn't lose any saves. For some reason, Valve still have it tagged for Proton.</p>
<p>Improvements to the save system are welcome, especially with it being in Early Access and many updates are expected, it's nice to see they're working to ensure progress isn't lost. And for those of you who love the gore, they made various improvements to the gore system too like applying more speed variations between different chunks of gore and they added sound effects when gibbing corpses (oh my!).</p>
<p>Altered Orbit Studios mentioned they're taking a short vacation now but after that expect work on the Randomizer Mode, more story elements and production for Chapter 2 to continue.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy Selaco on Steam</a> priced at $24.99 / €24.50 / £20.99.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 22 &#39;Wilma&#39; gets a Beta release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 22 'Wilma' has a first Beta release available for testing, built on top of Ubuntu 24.04 it will be supported until 2029. With this being a Beta it's not recommended for everyone, only if you wish to test for issues and help get it primed for the full release that's likely due either late this month or early August.</p>
<p>A pretty big upgrade overall. Thanks to the jump in the Ubuntu package base it's using, with kernel version 6.8 along with Pipewire by default. With the newer kernel, you'll get support for newer hardware too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1687156611719934951gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1687156611719934951gol1.png"/></a><br/>

<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Various artwork improvements.</li>
<li>HiDPI support improvements were made in the boot sequence, in Plymouth and Slick-Greeter.</li>
<li>A new Matrix Web App for chat, replacing Hexchat.</li>

<ul>
<li>Less printer added notifications (silenced for 2 hours).</li>
<li>Wayland support: Clutter polkit agent.</li>
<li>Spices: keybindings support.</li>

      <title>Will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While other vendors continually push out new handheld pc models, sticking similar internals into different shell designs and gradually bumping up RAM or the Processor, the Steam Deck just keeps selling like hot tasty cakes.</p>
<p>There's multiple other devices out there now that are in a few ways more powerful than the Steam Deck, but that hasn't seemed to matter a whole lot to Valve. Especially since the release of the Steam Deck OLED, which was a pretty huge upgrade, it's constantly a global top seller for Valve.</p>
<p>I've been tracking it over time from their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2024-6-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public list</a>, which is done by revenue (not units sold), and of course the price of the Steam Deck compared with games and DLC is a lot higher, but when you think about how many units the likes of ELDEN RING and other top games sell - it's clear Valve are shifting a lot of Steam Deck units still.</p>
<p>Here's the latest data based on the global position:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8349785691719914623gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8349785691719914623gol1.png"/></a></p>

<p>When compared with other vendors like GPD, AYANEO, ASUS and all the others, Valve of course have the Steam store to back it up. Other vendors don't really have anything like that, so Valve are in a more unique position to stick to one main model. And when Valve discount it, people will continue to flock to it. Other vendors continue to be a <em>gamble</em>, as you buy one model and they're probably just about to move onto their next.</p>
<p>This has so many benefits for players as well though, like good consistent support and <em>constant</em> software upgrades. You only have to look at the new built-in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/steam-game-recording-beta-announced-works-on-linux-and-steam-deck-too/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Recording feature</a> to see, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6</a> that recently moved from Preview to Beta that again brings in some big additions.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Currently there's <u>15,398</u> games for Steam Deck rated to be Playable or Verified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified: 5,047</li>
<li>Playable: 10,351</li>
<li>Unsupported: 4,297</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, the title, will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not. <em>Well, not until the Steam Deck 2.</em></p>

      <title>100 updates later, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is shaping up to be a fantastic squad-tactics RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since entering Early Acccess in October last year, Trese Brothers have been steadily building up Cyber Knights: Flashpoint into something great. They sent word that they've recently hit over 100 updates, and there's some really big stuff that's being added.</p>
<p><em>If you're into XCOM / XCOM 2, this is a game for you.</em></p>
<p>For controller and Steam Deck players, you're going to want to give it another go. As they said they've "smoothed out navigation, scrolling, screen transitions, and made it so that the Steam virtual keyboard now appears for all controller types". They'll also be sending it into Valve for another verification round soon after all the changes, along with a new default controller configuration set up.</p>
<p>As for everyone else, there's loads new. Like the revamped new game experience to add in a full character creation kit for your main character. So you can pick your own background, traits, and attribute bonuses for your Knight, dive into visual customization if you want, then select your starting squad members.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12534878311719858343gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12534878311719858343gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's plenty that will affect your run too like backgrounds having stat bonuses, open up new trait options, adds in tags that their "Casting Director" story engine can uses to offer up more context, with more background options planned to be added over time. And then you get 12 points to spend on your character across attributes like Reaction, Strength, Will, and Tech depending on how you want to play.</p>
<p>Traits sound pretty fun too giving you special stat bonuses, that grow over time with your Knight as they achieve "limit breaks" where they can potentially pick new trait upgrades as a reward.</p>
<p><em>Showing their original EA trailer just doesn't do it any justice now. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8396172951719858607gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8396172951719858607gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Check out all the changes in the <a href="http://4246413199410228682" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last</a><small>[1]</small> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/4246413199418195008" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two</a><small>[2]</small> updates for more info.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> with Native Linux support. It's 34% off in the Steam Summer Sale. Well worth it if you love turn-based tactics.</p>

      <title>Flaw in OpenSSH Server nicknamed regreSSHion could cause some problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're dealing with Linux servers, or you have an active OpenSSH Server on your desktop, you may want to look into regreSSHion.</p>
<p>Made public by Qualys today, who you might remember from the vulnerabilities in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/qualys-discovers-glibc-flaw-that-could-enable-attackers-to-gain-full-root-access/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNU C Library they announced earlier this year</a>. Their latest discovery is actually a regression, but quite a serious one. Tagged as <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6387" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2024-6387</a> it's "a signal handler race condition in OpenSSH’s server (sshd), allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) as root on glibc-based Linux systems".</p>
<p>Their research showed it's a regression of CVE-2006-5051, which was reported in 2006 but then introduced again as an issue going back to October 2020 (OpenSSH 8.5p1). Woops.</p>
<p>Here's what they said about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent access. It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other vulnerable systems within the organization.</p>
<p>Moreover, gaining root access would enable attackers to bypass critical security mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and logging mechanisms, further obscuring their activities. This could also result in significant data breaches and leakage, giving attackers access to all data stored on the system, including sensitive or proprietary information that could be stolen or publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>This vulnerability is challenging to exploit due to its remote race condition nature, requiring multiple attempts for a successful attack. This can cause memory corruption and necessitate overcoming Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Advancements in deep learning may significantly increase the exploitation rate, potentially providing attackers with a substantial advantage in leveraging such security flaws.</p>

Otherwise, it will likely run well enough with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Bazzite 3.5 gets updated NVIDIA drivers, expanded handheld support (including Steam Deck OLED)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite is one of the best options to get Linux on various gaming handhelds, and the 3.5.0 release is out now that has improvements pretty much everywhere with expanded hardware support.</p>
<p>For people using it on desktop with an NVIDIA GPU, they've switched to a different driver repository, so you'll get newer drivers faster. Along with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/nvidia-driver-555-58-released-as-stable-bringing-wayland-explicit-sync/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA 555.58</a>, you'll get better Wayland support now. They also said the the Steam Deck OLED is now good to go as well. You'll also see KDE Plasma 6.1, Linux kernel 6.9 and Mesa 24.1.2 in this release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3556422751719835222gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Another big update is the latest version of the Handheld Daemon, a tool for configuring handheld devices. <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd/releases/tag/v3.0.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Version 3.0</a> of that brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Xbox Elite Emulation! Extra buttons with no glyphs.</li>
<li>Proper dual gyro support for the go. Works in all emulators by shaking!</li>
<li>Fixes the Steam slider + other TDP features (see <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/adjustor/releases/tag/v3.0.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/hhd-dev/adjustor/releases/tag/v3.0.0</a>)</li>
<li>New desktop layout (see <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd-ui/releases/tag/v3.0.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd-ui/releases/tag/v3.0.0</a>)!
<ul>
<li>Opens automatically by double tapping side button!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Controller caching! Instant controllers after suspend + no controller breaking after suspend
<ul>
<li>Games that do not support controller disconnection (e.g., Super Meat Boy) will no longer break after suspend!</li>
<li>After suspend or when detaching the legion go controllers, the controllers disconnect and reconnect from the system, breaking certain games.</li>
<li>Handheld Daemon will now cache the existing emulated controller and reuse it when the controllers reconnect, making reconnections instant.</li>
<li>It will cache the controllers with configuration changes, making them instant too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Autocalibration Proper Support
<ul>
<li>Opening the overlay used to allow steam + emulators autocalibrate the controller incorrectly due to filtering the controller.</li>
<li>Handheld Daemon will now send fake accelerometer values to the emulated controller, ensuring games cant calibrate without moving the gyro incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full RGB support for the Ally and Legion Go within the UI, RGB for the other devices.
<ul>
<li>RGB is set during AC events as well, which should fix Ayaneo devices resetting RGB when plugged in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Xbox and Dualsense controller have new shortcuts
<ul>
<li>Left button is keyboard, right button is Handheld Daemon Overlay</li>
<li>On the Legion Go with the Dualsense controller, bottom buttons are still touchpad clicks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default is now the Xbox controller, as Dualsense is not needed for RGB support now.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bazzite 3.5 also brings <em>initial</em> support for many ONEXPLAYER handhelds like the ONEXPLAYER 2 PRO 8840U handheld as well as the AYANEO AIR 1S, OXP2/Pro and ONEXFLY handhelds.</p>
<p>There's also a new boot video and suspend animation, Bazzite updates are smaller in size, bluetooth controller fixes, Wallpaper Engine works again,</p>

      <title>Drill-ship survival game Volcanoids has a new cozy looking update out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Volcanoids is a brilliant idea for a survival game where your base is a moving drill-ship, and the Interior Innovations Update allows you to make things look a lot more cozy.</p>
<p>More about it: Volcanoids is a base-building open-world survival shooter that replaces the boring old base with a steampunk drill. Alone or with up to 3 other crewmates, explore an ever-changing volcanic island, build out your drill, and fight hostile machines to reveal what's been hiding in the depths of the underground.</p>
<p>The developers are currently working on a whole new map, so this is a sort-of interim update. Adding in cosmetic devices for drillship interior, phonograph device with songs, drillship overview to hand bracer, a new weapon, Steam Workshop support for drillship designs / paint jobs and decals, new quests, new Achievements, improved enemy AI and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9mQ5JXJaDgs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d2d203fe7f5f18abdd29c72b25c66a18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9mQ5JXJaDgs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/951440/Volcanoids/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Available on Steam</a> with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Playable. It's also 30% off until July 11th for the Steam Summer Sale.</p>

<p>With the original <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/gog-revives-the-original-resident-evil-plus-resident-evil-2-and-resident-evil-3-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil now on GOG</a> and the later games to come, GE-Proton / Proton-GE has a new release out to fix some issues in it and other games.</p>
<p>This is the community-build of Proton, not to be confused with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, or for using Proton outside of Steam.

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh update to Proton Experimental for June 28th, bringing their usual assortment of game fixes for Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Aspyr Media announce a STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter remaster arriving on August 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2002 is calling. STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter is making a return and coming to PC from Aspyr Media, with their remaster arriving on August 1st.</p>
<p>Given how bad the release of STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection also by Aspyr has been, it's probably worth holding back a little to see some reviews on this one because that is still sitting at a Mostly Negative rating on Steam.</p>
<p>From the press release it notes: "Become the most feared Bounty Hunter in the galaxy! As Jango Fett, you’ll have to jump, jetpack, climb, and maneuver in this iconic action-adventure game featuring a variety of visual improvements on modern platforms, as well as <strong>Steam Deck support</strong> and a number of DualSense controller features for PlayStation 5 players." <em>[emphasis added]</em></p>

<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let the Hunt Begin: </strong>In this classic third-person action-adventure, you'll play as Jango Fett, Prime Clone of the Grand Army of the Republic, hired to capture a deranged Dark Jedi.</li>
<li><strong>Relive the Timeless Tale: </strong>Experience the legendary Bounty Hunter fantasy set before the events of <em>Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones™</em>. Face off against foes and maneuver through acrobatic battles in this adaption optimized for today's consoles and hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Armed to the Teeth: </strong>Fight your way through the galaxy’s underbelly, equipped with Dual Blasters, your Flamethrower, Whipcord, and pure Mandalorian Rage.</li>

      <title>A favourite coffee-break game Rack and Slay now Steam Deck Verified plus a big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rack and Slay is a dungeon crawler where you're a billiard ball, and you've got to shoot yourself across every dungeon level to pot all the other very angry balls. It's good fun and now it's even better.</p>
<p>Easily my current favourite coffee-break game, it's so easy to just jump into it for a quick run to load up on various abilities and see how ridiculous you can make it. A week ago, Valve gave it the green tick to be Steam Deck Verified, so now taking it on the go is a great experience too.</p>
<p>On top of that, Update 1.1 released this week adding in an Endless Mode, so once you've finished you can keep going and it will just keep upping the stakes giving you additional enemies and generating harder layouts, but on top of it an ever-increasing enemy damage multiplier is introduced, making it especially tricky to survive not clearing all enemies with your initial set of shots.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yq5msXmcTe4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85271d3f788165d8e2e76dc1aa287f3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yq5msXmcTe4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The update also gives you a new item, Stop Shot, which the developer explained: "Some players found themselves wishing for more post-shot control, and Stop Shot is here to help. With this item, if you aim at an enemy straight on you will stop in place after hitting it. The maximum angle is 5° with one copy of the item but can be multiplied by stacking it."</p>
<p>You'll also find a new enemy, Floaty, a balloon-carrying enemy ball that slows down quicker than normal balls and it sounds like quite a nuisance, shedding balloons when you pot it into a hole so you need to hit it again.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned a few more small Steam Deck improvements. See more in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2311990/view/4192369369666376737" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update notes</a>.</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2311990/Rack_and_Slay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to buy on Steam</a>. It's also 15% off until July 11th.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Odencat developer of Bear's Restaurant, Fishing Paradiso and Meg's Monster recently revealed their next little adventure game with Mousebusters.</p>
<p>The day after moving into your new living space, you wake up to find that you’ve been inexplicably transformed into a mouse. Luckily, you soon meet a hard-boiled rodent with a crass but loveable manner of speaking who asks you to call him “Chief.” He claims he can help you turn back into a human…if you’re willing to undertake a few missions for him in return. Together, you’ll form the titular team, and embark on expeditions to bust the ghosts that haunt each unit and break the curse on the apartment building.</p>

      <title>Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator is a fresh feel-good, puzzle-platforming adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from developer Adventure Works L.L.C., a feel-good, cinematic thrill-ride inspired by classic '80s adventure films and developed by one of the producers behind the interactive Millennium Falcon ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios, coming soon to Steam.</p>
<p>Here you step into the shoes of high school student Ari Buktu as you venture into the past with his eccentric science teacher Professor Lionel Raventhorpe and his trusty chinchilla-shaped friend Julius. Making use of a time machine elevator, you're on a quest to help your teacher find a special gift worthy of the woman who has claimed his heart.</p>
<p>You'll meet a cast of eclectic characters and uncover ancient ruins lost to mankind for centuries as you work to solve mystical puzzles, but don’t let your guard down! Deadly threats, such as pirates and tomb raiders, lurk around every corner and will do their best to put a quick end to your quest. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PrF3Loz9Y4o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/00ef841a66a49c6110fd79c905695fd6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PrF3Loz9Y4o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their press team told me via email it will have full Linux support.</p>
<p>A little about the developer, Adventure Works: Jeffrey Ashbrook founded the production company Adventure Works after spending more than a decade at Disney Imagineering, where he focused on the creation of physical spaces in theme parks. In 2017, Jeffrey’s brother Walter joined the team, and together they are working diligently to bring an adventure that spans across entire civilisations in Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator.</p>

      <title>Endless launch Block Coding for Godot Engine, great for beginners</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Block Coding tools are pretty popular like Scratch, where you do visual scripting using blocks instead of typing out code and now <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> has an impressive looking version of this with Block Coding from Endless.</p>
<p><em>It looks so simple even my stupid brain could probably do something with it. </em></p>
<p>Announced via the <a href="https://www.endlessos.org/post/block-coding-for-godot-lowering-the-bar-of-entry-for-a-powerful-tool" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Endless Foundation blog</a>, the new system is available to add into Godot via the <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3095" rel="noopener" target="_blank">asset library</a>. The plugin itself is open source under the MIT license and can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/endlessm/godot-block-coding" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>A great initiative, especially with it being inside a game engine that's already free and open source, so people can easily progress onto traditional programming whenever they want. That's part of the point too, as Endless's Will Baumgartner wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of our main goals is to make the transition from using our simplified tools to using the Godot engine on its own as seamless as possible. So, as we start to make blocks more abstract than the code itself, it’s important that we stick to the same sort of language that Godot runs on.</p>
<p>As we have designed more and more blocks, we have thought carefully about this balance between lowering the bar of entry with simplified blocks, and trying to teach the concepts intrinsic to Godot. As more people find and experiment with the plugin, we hope to narrow down on this balance to make the transition to working with the real editor as smooth as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Palworld&#39;s Sakurajima update brings a new island, battle arena, a new raid and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld has just expanded in a rather big way with the Sakurajima Update, giving players a lot of new content to play through and it sounds pretty awesome. Palworld runs great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, but is a little rough on Steam Deck and is only rated Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>There's a whole new island to explore that has many new Pals to find, there's an Arena to battle in multiplayer, a new Oil Rig Stronghold to fight through, level cap was raised to 55, there's a new Crude Oil resource required by new high-tier equipment, a new Raid, a Meteorite Event, all tower bosses have a Hard Mode, you can find a new Merchant and then there's all the new items, weapons and cosmetics. </p>
<p>Pocketpair have clearly be very busy since release. And it's caused the player count to once again rocket seeing a peak of just over 100,000 in the last day. Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fKzLdPZr2Fk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54a29d5156032aa808738cc16664c148.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fKzLdPZr2Fk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I pretty quickly burned out on it at release, so I'm quite looking forward to all the improvements. Are you jumping back in again this weekend?</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>
