      <title>Chaotic multiplayer physics-brawler Bare Butt Boxing releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Early Access since May last year, Tuatara Games are readying up their chaotic brawler Bare Butt Boxing for release on August 1.</p>
<p>Tuatara Games usually work in the field of visual effects for AAA studios like Riot Games (Valorant), Epic Games (Fortnite), Counterplay Games (Godfall), and many more but wanted more and so Bare Butt Boxing is their first self-published game.</p>
<p>Colourful and mischievous aliens land on Earth to host unregulated boxing matches. Launch your opponents or the giant beach ball in portals to earn points based on which game mode is on. Whoever has the most points when the round is over wins! Face up to 3 friends locally, join 6-player online matches, or fight with bots in single player mode.</p>
<p>Punching is not the only key to victory : collect item boxes to use special powers like the powerful vacuum and super frenzy to turn the tides of battle. Keep an eye on stage hazards to avoid falling off the level! The gusting winds on the Mountain top and disappearing platforms at the neon disco Arcade can mess your score badly if you are not careful.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3Sb3wLYwedg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dff5c3959b8bab1914898745617a61c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3Sb3wLYwedg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We are truly grateful to all the players that joined us in Early Access. With 1.0 we wanted to wrap up the game with more content and a bigger emphasis on local multiplayer, which has been heavily requested.” said Klemen Lozar, founder of Tuatara Games.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186660/Bare_Butt_Boxing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it or buy it on Steam right now</a>. The full game updates on August 1st. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating currently.</p>

      <title>Bite-sized roguelike tower defense game Bella Wants Blood releases July 24</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Sonderland (previously worked on Landnama, Core Defense) announced their roguelike tower defense game Bella Wants Blood is going to release on July 24 and it's a perfect coffee-break game. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent over a key, thoughts will be up around release.</p>
<p>What they said about it: "We made Bella Wants Blood as an absurd, bite-sized roguelike terror defense game with a ‘Slay the Spire’ style map of branching paths to choose the battles you want to face along with the rewards that come with them. It’s bloody, silly, easy to pick up and play, and brimming with ridiculous atmosphere."</p>
<p>Giving you small levels where you carve out a path, along with different types of strange towers, and then the progress from the likes of Slay the Spire, it's certainly an interesting combo.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pl3KKcAHPUk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aafffec8e205c5e1516e0f055d9aeab7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pl3KKcAHPUk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's now releasing July 24th with Native Linux support for $4.99.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3007660/Bella_Wants_Blood/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>VR game streaming tool ALVR adds PipeWire support on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Linux support of ALVR is still quite rough due to various issues with SteamVR, ALVR is a very promising way to stream VR games to your headset via Wi-Fi and a new release is out now with v20.9.1.</p>

      <title>Valve fixes up the new Riven from Cyan Worlds videos on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyan Worlds Inc recently released the brand new Riven that's a re-imagined, and expanded version of the classic from 1997. It had a bit of trouble with videos on Linux / Steam Deck though.</p>
<p>Writing on X (Twitter), Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://x.com/Plagman2/status/1809637510047576444" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A fix has just been deployed for the missing videos in Riven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griffais didn't go into detail on what was changed, and it seems it wasn't through a Proton update. Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1712350/history/?changeid=24262025" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, they've tagged it as using H.264. So it's a back-end change Valve did on their servers, to ensure that the videos get sorted correctly for Linux players using Proton on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LN1TQm942_U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/263aebe9a1b0d4a989efe9d8d0417f1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LN1TQm942_U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Riven takes you on a journey through dense jungles, awe-inspiring caverns, and monolithic structures. Explore a world bent to the whims of a man who sees himself as a god and where every corner will immerse you in an otherworldly adventure.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em> rewards careful observation. Challenge <em>Riven’s</em> cunning puzzles, deftly woven throughout its narrative. The environment of <em>Riven</em> will reveal the story of this world as you make meaning from seemingly disparate bits of information and learn everything you need to know about this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a reminder, to get the re-encoded videos for games in Proton, you need to have the Shader Pre-Cache system turned on in Steam (Settings -&gt; Downloads). Otherwise, for the games Valve has sorted the videos for, you'll end up seeing a <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14577733731720432045gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank">test-screen</a> instead of videos.</p>
<p>You can buy Riven from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/riven" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-10 adds ELDEN RING EAC fix, pulls in latest DXVK code for d8vk</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton 9-10 was released July 7th updating various internal tech as usual to improve gaming on Linux / Steam Deck so here's what's new.</p>
<p>Firstly, until FromSoftware actually fix up ELDEN RING EAC for players who don't own the DLC, GE-Proton now includes the fix I suggested users try <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/elden-ring-should-now-have-fixed-the-inappropriate-activity-issue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in my previous article</a>. Apart from that, it's just updating the various included parts like DXVK and VKD3D-Proton to the very latest code available from Git which includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>Updated wine-mono to 9.2.0</li>
<li>Updated dxvk to latest git (which includes d8vk now)</li>
<li>Removed d8vk build options as it's part of dxvk now</li>
<li>Updated proton script so that d8vk is enabled by default as part of dxvk's files</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While DXVK hasn't seen a fresh release yet (likely sometime soon), the latest Git code has now pulled in d8vk for supporting Direct3D 8 over Vulkan. Which means DXVK now does Direct3D 8/9/10/11!</p>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a>.

      <title>Tech-noir musical tactics game All Walls Must Fall is now permanently free</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer inbetweengames announced that their game All Walls Must Fall from 2018 is now permanently free.</p>
<p>More about it: All Walls Must Fall is an isometric tactics game where actions happen to the pulsing beat of the music. You control time travelling secret agents as they jump and loop through a single night in the city of Berlin. Using a pausable real-time system, carefully plan your decisions and use powerful time manipulation abilities to your advantage, as you carry out your mission in the shadows or in plain sight. Levels are procedurally recombined, giving All Walls Must Fall a highly replayable campaign structure, while still offering individually crafted components and set-pieces.</p>
<p>All Walls Must Fall takes inspiration from genre classics like X-Com, Syndicate and REZ, as well more recent indie games like The Banner Saga, Braid, SUPERHOT and Crypt of the Necrodancer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's been 6 years since we released All Walls Must Fall, and we've decided that we'd love if everyone who always wanted to play but never quite got around to buying it has the opportunity. So it's now totally free on Steam and itch.io!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy playing our tech-noir tactics game that we made. We put a lot of our hearts into it, and while we've all moved on to other projects now, that time we made our own little indie game will always be special to us.</p>
<p>Love from Berlin,<br/>
Isaac, David and Rafal<br/>

      <title>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak adds English support plus Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak from Nihon Falcom, PH3 GmbH and NIS America, Inc. hit Steam back in March 2023. However, it was only supported for the Japanese language, now it's been updated in a big way with English language support and Steam Deck improvements too.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> they mentioned they made changes to the UI to render at a better quality for lower resolutions where "UI text is now much more readable on these devices". So it should be a good experience now too. Nice to see some attention there as always!</p>
<p>There's lots more new in this update including improved shadows, improved reflections, HDR support, Dynamic Steam Cloud support, MSAA, SGSSAA, and transparency MSAA, a modification to the physics system to improve it at high framerates and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138610/view/4156338670609987904" rel="noopener" target="_blank">list goes on</a>.</p>

      <title>Comedy adventure 3 Minutes to Midnight set to release in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a good bit of silence, 3 Minutes to Midnight is pretty much done now with the developers noting they're reading it for release in August. This follows their Kickstarter success back in 2019.</p>
<p>What is it? A comedy adventure with a sprawling story and colorful cast. Betty Anderson can’t remember who she is, but she has bigger worries—like a doomsday plot threatening to wipe out the human race. Join Betty to crack the conspiracy that starts with a bang and ends at 3 Minutes to Midnight.</p>
<p>The latest update on their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scarecrowstudio/3-minutes-to-midnight-a-comedy-graphic-adventure/posts/4138491" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter notes</a> it will be "released between the 5th and the 16th of August 2024" with a proper set date and new trailer due <em>sometime</em> soon. Language support has also expanded so now it will have support for Spanish, German, English, French, Brazilian Portuguese, and Catalan with others coming post-release.</p>
<p>It also clearly notes the game will have full Native Linux and Steam Deck support at release.</p>
<p>They also put up a sneak-peak video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JPap_Yw5kxw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fac080816129a03e1095e9829c4613d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JPap_Yw5kxw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full post goes into a fair bit of detail all the improvements they've managed to put in, along with various things that went wrong like logistical issues with the actors, technical issues and more. Worth a read.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/832500/3_Minutes_to_Midnight__A_Comedy_Graphic_Adventure/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Factorio: Space Age and the 2.0 free update set for release in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Factory building sim Factorio is getting a huge expansion with Factorio: Space Age set for release on October 21st along with a big free 2.0 update for everyone. The expansion will be priced at $35, the same as the base game and seems it will be absolutely full of new toys for you.</p>
<p>This expansion continues your journey after finishing the base game where you blast off into space. Here you get to discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms. Of course that comes with its own set of perils like asteroids that need to be shot down, or captured for fuel and ammo.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10707153091720201602gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10707153091720201602gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The new planets will each be rather different with these being revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vulcanus - Blazing volcanic mountains, imposing geological landforms, plains blanketed in ash, and thick yellow sulfuric fog that burns your lungs and etches your eyes.</li>
<li>Fulgora - A lifeless and desolate place. The thin air is freezing cold but bone dry. A distant sun twinkles in the dull purple of the sky. Wispy clouds race by as a gale whips up sand that grates against your armour.</li>
<li>Gleba - A vibrant multi-coloured swampy landscape shrouded in a light mist. The air is thick and humid, carrying the muffled cries of unseen animals from far away.</li>
</ul>
<p>They say a 5th planet yet to be shown "promises some of the most unique gameplay but it remains shrouded in mystery". It's the furthest from the sun so it's going to be dark and cold. <em>Curious.</em></p>
<p>We're also getting elevated rails, so your rail networks can cross over obstacles, cross the oceans and — you get the idea. You'll be able to make much more fancy rail systems. There's also a new quality system for items, entities and equipment, new music, new enemies and defence systems and plenty more to be announced.</p>
<p>And that's all on top of the big 2.0 update that will give us goodies like a new fluid system, smarter worker robots and much more.</p>
<p>You can see their <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full blog post</a> for more on what's to come.</p>
<p>Factorio is available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin moves to a more rapid release cycle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind the free and open source GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin have announced a big change to their plans, along with a new much more rapid release schedule.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/07/02/dolphin-releases-announcement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned how the last actual "release" with 5.0 was back in 2016, and they've just continually added bits to it over time. Now though, they're doing away with that and moving to a "rolling release cycle" as they said:</p>
<p>"However, the purpose of our old stable builds is now no longer relevant to Dolphin Emulator. We no longer need a benchmark to compare against or an anchor to ground us. We have grown beyond them. So in leaving the 5.0 era behind, we are also leaving behind that release scheme and all it offered. In exchange, we're not just giving you a release today, but also a commitment to continuous releases from now on. The long drought of Dolphin releases is no more and will never happen again!"</p>
<p>Now they will have proper fully tagged releases based on the year and month, so the latest brand new release is 2407 that went up 2 days ago. Development builds will simply add a number after for the number of code commits done like 2407-144 and they will continue to roll out multiple releases a year and said they will keep doing progress report blog posts too.</p>
<p>The blog announcement goes over details about why it's not just being called Dolphin 6.0 and to sum up a few paragraphs there — they just didn't feel it was needed due to how development has come along in the last eight years</p>
<p>Also they have a refreshed logo:</p>

      <title>#DRIVE Rally gets a new trailer to show off new gameplay and features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>#DRIVE Rally is actually looking pretty darn good. A reinvention of classic 90s rally racing with a whole lot of content and features to be excited about.</p>
<p>From a roster of up to 36 legendary rally cars, to the more than 400 kilometers of winding roads and paths that you will be able to drive with keyboard and mouse, gamepads and yes racing wheels are supported too. We'll be able to experience the thrill of rally racing with passionate co-drivers that "react dynamically to your driving, offering both praise and critique while helping you navigate the twists and turns of every stage". Plenty of customization too with a variety of paint jobs, decals, and performance upgrades to make each car truly your own.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bFQKXF8DFl4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6018b1fd3f2d83a6d3f41efadc5d9616.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bFQKXF8DFl4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>#DRIVE All Over the World</strong>: From the sunny landscapes of Dry Crumbs, through the whispering woods of Holzberg, to the chilly wilderness of Revontuli, each track offers unique features and asks drivers to go the distance.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Cars</strong>: Jump behind the wheel of legendary rally cars, including Das Holzwagen, The Doggo, The Bobond, and many more from the studio’s previous title #DRIVE. New from the ‘90s era are Das Sandsturm and Celestia, just for a start!</li>
<li><strong>Passionate Co-Drivers</strong>: For better or worse, your co-driver is with you to the end! There to help and lend some humourous jabs, they’re your trusty navigator —and your worst critic.</li>
<li><strong>#DRIVE Design</strong>: It’s your way <em>and</em> the highway, baby! From tires to tailpipe, build your car to your liking. Add your special touches with paintwork, decals, and decorations. Take a picture in Photo Mode - it’ll last longer.</li>
<li><strong>#DRIVE Like it’s 1999</strong>: pumped up with 90’s Easter Eggs and references in an adoring homage to the thunderous days of rally racing circa 1990s, this game feels like a finely-tuned arcade experience, with no coins needed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release. With a plan for Early Access sometime "this Autumn".</p>

      <title>Castle Come is a &#39;walking fortress roguelike&#39; that sounds simply awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now and then I come across a game and just think - I have to have it. Castle Come is one of those times, a roguelike where you control a walking fortress you build up as you go. Hopefully it will work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux / Steam Deck, I will be surprised if it doesn't.</p>
<p>In Castle Come, you scout a strange land full of bandits in search of new parts, defeat enemy fortresses and scavenge the wreckage, recruit crew to man your growing arsenal of weapons and build your way from an agile little fortling into a deadly, hulking, monster machine.</p>
<p>In combat, <em>Castle Come</em> switches to a <em>Tekken</em>-inspired 2.5D fighting view where you can make use of sidesteps, dodges and rams. Take advantage of a stylish time-slowing feature that kicks in whenever you line up a shot from one of your arsenal of weapons - from machine guns and mine launchers, to chicken pens and giant boulders. Take control of every weapon yourself, or leave your crew to fire at will as you juggle active reloads, cooldowns and movement in the search for maximum efficiency on the battlefield. </p>
<p>Yep, I absolutely need to play this. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qyk-7FXxxI8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44e24dcf16631a4da4bb0351d82e3c63.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qyk-7FXxxI8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Our tiny two-person team is really excited to be able to announce Castle Come to the world with our first trailer,” said Sam Vonäsch, producer and designer. “We’re looking forward to being able to share more about the game’s mechanics, our special take on narration and when it will be releasing, in the future.” </p>
<p>Give it a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902970/Castle_Come/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">click to follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to fix the ELDEN RING &#39;inappropriate activity&#39; issue on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new patch has been rolled out for ELDEN RING, and it's supposed to fix the inappropriate activity detected message from their anti-cheat with a bit of manual effort. Here's what to do. This issue affected Linux desktop, Steam Deck and it seems people on Windows PCs as well.</p>
<p>From their patch notes for version 1.12.3 it notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the PC Version, the message "Inappropriate activity detected" may appear without cheating.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix this issue, please verify the integrity of the game's files before restarting the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the PC version, unstable framerate may be caused by third party applications that control mouse behavior. Deactivating these third party applications may improve performance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>For once, it wasn't a Linux system specific issue.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13498587471720086053gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13498587471720086053gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To note, I do <strong>not</strong> have the DLC yet. And it seems FromSoftware haven't been doing thorough testing for people who do <em>not</em> have the DLC. If you <em>do</em> have the DLC, verifying the files might be enough to fix it as they suggest.</p>
<p>What if you <em>don't</em> have the DLC? Well, thanks to an answer on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1245620#pqU185GyV2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, you <em>can</em> fix it yourself. As always, do my fix suggestions <u>at your own risk</u>.</p>
<p>All you have to do is open up the installed folder, go into the "Game" folder and create an empty "DLC.bdt" file.</p>
<p>So in Steam (Desktop mode for Steam Deck) -&gt; Right click on ELDEN RING -&gt; properties -&gt; Installed files -&gt; Browse. Then go into the Game folder. Two ways to do it (tested using KDE Plasma):</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click -&gt; create new -&gt; text file -&gt; name it in the text box "DLC.bdt" (remove the .txt).</li>
<li><u>OR</u> Right click in an empty space -&gt; select Open Terminal Here and type "touch DLC.bdt".</li>
</ul>
<p>And you're done. It will now work.</p>

      <title>The community won the battle, so PvP battler Fishards is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in June the developers of Fishards put out a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/fight-the-devs-of-fishards-if-you-win-it-goes-open-source-lose-and-its-deleted-from-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bit of an ultimatum</a>: fight them in-game and win to make the game open source, or they will nuke the game from orbit.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the community came together, and won. So now Fishards has been made <a href="https://github.com/charlesmaddock/fishards" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source</a>, and it's still free to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637140/Fishards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DHhCwnTPqf8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c49fc4a35152bb162d3e71ba1f99d0d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DHhCwnTPqf8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A good chance for people to learn from a complete and released game.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. Perhaps now someone can put in a few fixes to get it bumped up to Steam Deck Verified, and keep expanding it. The game uses <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, so there's nothing stopping a willing developer having a look to see what they can do.</p>
<p>Always nice to see another game become open source to ensure it can live on forever.</p>

      <title>PSA: If you use Bazzite you need to do a manual fix to get updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, the popular version of Linux powered by Fedora and Universal Blue that's great for handhelds including the Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go and others needs a little manual user effort after a bit of human error.</p>
<p>Unless you take action, you will <em>not</em> get any updates going forward. Developer Jorge O. Castro noted in a forum post how they "were rotating our cosign keypairs this morning, which is the method that we use to sign our images" and unfortunately they "made a critical error which has resulted in forcing you to take manual steps to migrate to our newly signed images".</p>
<p>However, this only affects people who installed Bazzite on a device before July 2nd, if you downloaded it <em>after</em> July 3rd, you're all good.</p>
<p>They have a script set up that you can run that will fix the problem, so all you have to do is run this in a terminal app (<a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/config/blob/5c4144d38a2a61e44ca704ffdf2d50bbcb9ff7ed/scripts/fix-key-and-update.sh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">code source</a>):</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">curl -sL https://fix.universal-blue.org/ | sudo bash </code></p>
<p>To ensure it doesn't ever happen again, they've noted some <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/main/issues/600" rel="noopener" target="_blank">process changes</a> to be implemented.</p>
<p>See all the details in the <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/important-announcement-regarding-system-updates-action-needed/2689" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum post announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Nexus mods want feedback from Linux / Steam Deck users on their new cross-platform app</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/nexus-mods-app-is-an-in-development-replacement-for-vortex-that-will-support-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I wrote about the brand new Nexus mods app</a> before, as it's quite a promising and <em>exciting</em> development for the future of modding (especially for Linux and Steam Deck). And now, they want your feedback.</p>
<p>This is going to replace their previous apps like Vortex, eventually anyway. Right now, it's only made ready for Stardew Valley, since it's a very popular game for mods and is also cross-platform so it makes it simpler for them to get all the features of the app ready.</p>
<p>Yesterday, July 1st, they announced the Alpha release of this next-generation mod manager and their new Product Manager got in touch to mention they "would be really keen to get feedback from Linux users". So this is your chance to ensure Linux (and Steam Deck) finally become a first-class citizen for game modding.</p>

<em>Pictured - me testing out the Nexus Mod app</em></p>
<p>They said they plan to release an app update every 3 weeks going forward, and the next game they plan to add support for will be Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

      <title>Magnificent chunky shooter Selaco gets a &#39;MEGA&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco is easily one of the biggest highlights of the year, with its mixture of over-the-top action and chunky retro visuals. Altered Orbit Studios also just pushed out a big upgrade for it. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">See my initial review for more thoughts</a>.</em></p>
<p>Not only is there a lot of improvements to the game, but the soundtrack is now live too, along with a bunch of bonus content thrown in like unused tracks that didn't make it into the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1606647811719935736gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1606647811719935736gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights from the update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added "Resume Game" button in the main menu.</li>
<li>Added level versioning system.</li>
<li>Added "Hard-Boiled!" mutator.</li>
<li>Added "Armor Up" mutator.</li>
<li>Added "Extended Bullet Casings" graphical setting.</li>
<li>New weapon upgrades.</li>
<li>Weapon kit reworks.</li>
<li>Improved navigation in the earlier levels.</li>
<li>Improved general feel of the game.</li>
<li>Improved map screen.</li>
<li>Improved movement options.</li>
<li>Blood is now 0.2% more purple.</li>
<li>+ lots more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also mentioned a save issue between Steam Deck / Linux and Windows that should be solved now too. So if you've swapped between Proton and the Native Build (Or a Windows PC and a Steam Deck), it shouldn't lose any saves. For some reason, Valve still have it tagged for Proton.</p>
<p>Improvements to the save system are welcome, especially with it being in Early Access and many updates are expected, it's nice to see they're working to ensure progress isn't lost. And for those of you who love the gore, they made various improvements to the gore system too like applying more speed variations between different chunks of gore and they added sound effects when gibbing corpses (oh my!).</p>
<p>Altered Orbit Studios mentioned they're taking a short vacation now but after that expect work on the Randomizer Mode, more story elements and production for Chapter 2 to continue.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy Selaco on Steam</a> priced at $24.99 / €24.50 / £20.99.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 22 &#39;Wilma&#39; gets a Beta release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 22 'Wilma' has a first Beta release available for testing, built on top of Ubuntu 24.04 it will be supported until 2029. With this being a Beta it's not recommended for everyone, only if you wish to test for issues and help get it primed for the full release that's likely due either late this month or early August.</p>
<p>A pretty big upgrade overall. Thanks to the jump in the Ubuntu package base it's using, with kernel version 6.8 along with Pipewire by default. With the newer kernel, you'll get support for newer hardware too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1687156611719934951gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1687156611719934951gol1.png"/></a><br/>

<ul>
<li>Improved multi-threading, a new preferences page and a banner slideshow.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Various artwork improvements.</li>
<li>HiDPI support improvements were made in the boot sequence, in Plymouth and Slick-Greeter.</li>
<li>A new Matrix Web App for chat, replacing Hexchat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's lots of updates to the Cinnamon 6.2 desktop too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less printer added notifications (silenced for 2 hours).</li>
<li>Wayland support: Clutter polkit agent.</li>
<li>Spices: keybindings support.</li>
<li>Better avatar support in polkit agent and user applet.</li>

      <title>Will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While other vendors continually push out new handheld pc models, sticking similar internals into different shell designs and gradually bumping up RAM or the Processor, the Steam Deck just keeps selling like hot tasty cakes.</p>
<p>There's multiple other devices out there now that are in a few ways more powerful than the Steam Deck, but that hasn't seemed to matter a whole lot to Valve. Especially since the release of the Steam Deck OLED, which was a pretty huge upgrade, it's constantly a global top seller for Valve.</p>
<p>I've been tracking it over time from their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/2024-6-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public list</a>, which is done by revenue (not units sold), and of course the price of the Steam Deck compared with games and DLC is a lot higher, but when you think about how many units the likes of ELDEN RING and other top games sell - it's clear Valve are shifting a lot of Steam Deck units still.</p>
<p>Here's the latest data based on the global position:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8349785691719914623gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8349785691719914623gol1.png"/></a></p>

<p>When compared with other vendors like GPD, AYANEO, ASUS and all the others, Valve of course have the Steam store to back it up. Other vendors don't really have anything like that, so Valve are in a more unique position to stick to one main model. And when Valve discount it, people will continue to flock to it. Other vendors continue to be a <em>gamble</em>, as you buy one model and they're probably just about to move onto their next.</p>
<p>This has so many benefits for players as well though, like good consistent support and <em>constant</em> software upgrades. You only have to look at the new built-in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/steam-game-recording-beta-announced-works-on-linux-and-steam-deck-too/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Recording feature</a> to see, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6</a> that recently moved from Preview to Beta that again brings in some big additions.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Currently there's <u>15,398</u> games for Steam Deck rated to be Playable or Verified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified: 5,047</li>
<li>Playable: 10,351</li>
<li>Unsupported: 4,297</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh yeah, the title, will anything dethrone the Steam Deck? Probably not. <em>Well, not until the Steam Deck 2.</em></p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While there's been a clear drop, the Linux user share on Steam for June 2024 still remains about 2% showing the clear upwards trend overall. Interestingly, this is another month where Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam saw a jump, and quite often we see Linux drop when this happens.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">According to Valve the latest operating system details are:</p>

<em>You can see it on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker page</a>.</em></p>

      <title>100 updates later, Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is shaping up to be a fantastic squad-tactics RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since entering Early Acccess in October last year, Trese Brothers have been steadily building up Cyber Knights: Flashpoint into something great. They sent word that they've recently hit over 100 updates, and there's some really big stuff that's being added.</p>
<p><em>If you're into XCOM / XCOM 2, this is a game for you.</em></p>
<p>For controller and Steam Deck players, you're going to want to give it another go. As they said they've "smoothed out navigation, scrolling, screen transitions, and made it so that the Steam virtual keyboard now appears for all controller types". They'll also be sending it into Valve for another verification round soon after all the changes, along with a new default controller configuration set up.</p>
<p>As for everyone else, there's loads new. Like the revamped new game experience to add in a full character creation kit for your main character. So you can pick your own background, traits, and attribute bonuses for your Knight, dive into visual customization if you want, then select your starting squad members.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12534878311719858343gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12534878311719858343gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's plenty that will affect your run too like backgrounds having stat bonuses, open up new trait options, adds in tags that their "Casting Director" story engine can uses to offer up more context, with more background options planned to be added over time. And then you get 12 points to spend on your character across attributes like Reaction, Strength, Will, and Tech depending on how you want to play.</p>
<p>Traits sound pretty fun too giving you special stat bonuses, that grow over time with your Knight as they achieve "limit breaks" where they can potentially pick new trait upgrades as a reward.</p>
<p><em>Showing their original EA trailer just doesn't do it any justice now. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8396172951719858607gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8396172951719858607gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Check out all the changes in the <a href="http://4246413199410228682" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last</a><small>[1]</small> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1021210/view/4246413199418195008" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two</a><small>[2]</small> updates for more info.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> with Native Linux support. It's 34% off in the Steam Summer Sale. Well worth it if you love turn-based tactics.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 555.58.02 released to improve GSP offload on KDE</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA released a tiny driver update today with version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/228421/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">555.58.02</a> that some KDE Plasma users may want to have a look at.

      <title>Flaw in OpenSSH Server nicknamed regreSSHion could cause some problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're dealing with Linux servers, or you have an active OpenSSH Server on your desktop, you may want to look into regreSSHion.</p>
<p>Made public by Qualys today, who you might remember from the vulnerabilities in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/qualys-discovers-glibc-flaw-that-could-enable-attackers-to-gain-full-root-access/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNU C Library they announced earlier this year</a>. Their latest discovery is actually a regression, but quite a serious one. Tagged as <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-6387" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2024-6387</a> it's "a signal handler race condition in OpenSSH’s server (sshd), allows unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) as root on glibc-based Linux systems".</p>
<p>Their research showed it's a regression of CVE-2006-5051, which was reported in 2006 but then introduced again as an issue going back to October 2020 (OpenSSH 8.5p1). Woops.</p>
<p>Here's what they said about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This vulnerability, if exploited, could lead to full system compromise where an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the highest privileges, resulting in a complete system takeover, installation of malware, data manipulation, and the creation of backdoors for persistent access. It could facilitate network propagation, allowing attackers to use a compromised system as a foothold to traverse and exploit other vulnerable systems within the organization.</p>
<p>Moreover, gaining root access would enable attackers to bypass critical security mechanisms such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and logging mechanisms, further obscuring their activities. This could also result in significant data breaches and leakage, giving attackers access to all data stored on the system, including sensitive or proprietary information that could be stolen or publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>This vulnerability is challenging to exploit due to its remote race condition nature, requiring multiple attempts for a successful attack. This can cause memory corruption and necessitate overcoming Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Advancements in deep learning may significantly increase the exploitation rate, potentially providing attackers with a substantial advantage in leveraging such security flaws.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Cattle Country is Red Dead Redemption meets Stardew Valley</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Castle Pixel, LLC. who made Blossom Tales recently announced Cattle Country, a pixel-art take on Red Dead Redemption meets Stardew Valley. Their last game, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/blossom-tales-2-the-minotaur-prince-out-with-linux-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blossom Tales II: The Minotaur Prince</a>, actually did have Native Linux support so perhaps they may do it again for this one. Otherwise, it will likely run well enough with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

However, this is not entirely a little cozy game, as it's the Wild West, you'll also have to take on a few bandits.</p>

      <title>Bazzite 3.5 gets updated NVIDIA drivers, expanded handheld support (including Steam Deck OLED)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite is one of the best options to get Linux on various gaming handhelds, and the 3.5.0 release is out now that has improvements pretty much everywhere with expanded hardware support.</p>
<p>For people using it on desktop with an NVIDIA GPU, they've switched to a different driver repository, so you'll get newer drivers faster. Along with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/nvidia-driver-555-58-released-as-stable-bringing-wayland-explicit-sync/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA 555.58</a>, you'll get better Wayland support now. They also said the the Steam Deck OLED is now good to go as well. You'll also see KDE Plasma 6.1, Linux kernel 6.9 and Mesa 24.1.2 in this release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3556422751719835222gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Another big update is the latest version of the Handheld Daemon, a tool for configuring handheld devices. <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd/releases/tag/v3.0.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Version 3.0</a> of that brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Xbox Elite Emulation! Extra buttons with no glyphs.</li>
<li>Proper dual gyro support for the go. Works in all emulators by shaking!</li>
<li>Fixes the Steam slider + other TDP features (see <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/adjustor/releases/tag/v3.0.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/hhd-dev/adjustor/releases/tag/v3.0.0</a>)</li>
<li>New desktop layout (see <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd-ui/releases/tag/v3.0.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/hhd-dev/hhd-ui/releases/tag/v3.0.0</a>)!
<ul>
<li>Opens automatically by double tapping side button!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Controller caching! Instant controllers after suspend + no controller breaking after suspend
<ul>
<li>Games that do not support controller disconnection (e.g., Super Meat Boy) will no longer break after suspend!</li>
<li>After suspend or when detaching the legion go controllers, the controllers disconnect and reconnect from the system, breaking certain games.</li>
<li>Handheld Daemon will now cache the existing emulated controller and reuse it when the controllers reconnect, making reconnections instant.</li>
<li>It will cache the controllers with configuration changes, making them instant too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Autocalibration Proper Support
<ul>
<li>Opening the overlay used to allow steam + emulators autocalibrate the controller incorrectly due to filtering the controller.</li>
<li>Handheld Daemon will now send fake accelerometer values to the emulated controller, ensuring games cant calibrate without moving the gyro incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full RGB support for the Ally and Legion Go within the UI, RGB for the other devices.
<ul>
<li>RGB is set during AC events as well, which should fix Ayaneo devices resetting RGB when plugged in</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Xbox and Dualsense controller have new shortcuts
<ul>
<li>Left button is keyboard, right button is Handheld Daemon Overlay</li>
<li>On the Legion Go with the Dualsense controller, bottom buttons are still touchpad clicks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default is now the Xbox controller, as Dualsense is not needed for RGB support now.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bazzite 3.5 also brings <em>initial</em> support for many ONEXPLAYER handhelds like the ONEXPLAYER 2 PRO 8840U handheld as well as the AYANEO AIR 1S, OXP2/Pro and ONEXFLY handhelds.</p>
<p>There's also a new boot video and suspend animation, Bazzite updates are smaller in size, bluetooth controller fixes, Wallpaper Engine works again,</p>

      <title>Drill-ship survival game Volcanoids has a new cozy looking update out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Volcanoids is a brilliant idea for a survival game where your base is a moving drill-ship, and the Interior Innovations Update allows you to make things look a lot more cozy.</p>
<p>More about it: Volcanoids is a base-building open-world survival shooter that replaces the boring old base with a steampunk drill. Alone or with up to 3 other crewmates, explore an ever-changing volcanic island, build out your drill, and fight hostile machines to reveal what's been hiding in the depths of the underground.</p>
<p>The developers are currently working on a whole new map, so this is a sort-of interim update. Adding in cosmetic devices for drillship interior, phonograph device with songs, drillship overview to hand bracer, a new weapon, Steam Workshop support for drillship designs / paint jobs and decals, new quests, new Achievements, improved enemy AI and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9mQ5JXJaDgs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d2d203fe7f5f18abdd29c72b25c66a18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9mQ5JXJaDgs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/951440/Volcanoids/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Available on Steam</a> with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Playable. It's also 30% off until July 11th for the Steam Summer Sale.</p>

<p>With the original <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/gog-revives-the-original-resident-evil-plus-resident-evil-2-and-resident-evil-3-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil now on GOG</a> and the later games to come, GE-Proton / Proton-GE has a new release out to fix some issues in it and other games.</p>

You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons) but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, or for using Proton outside of Steam.

      <title>Aspyr Media announce a STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter remaster arriving on August 1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2002 is calling. STAR WARS: Bounty Hunter is making a return and coming to PC from Aspyr Media, with their remaster arriving on August 1st.</p>
<p>Given how bad the release of STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection also by Aspyr has been, it's probably worth holding back a little to see some reviews on this one because that is still sitting at a Mostly Negative rating on Steam.</p>
<p>From the press release it notes: "Become the most feared Bounty Hunter in the galaxy! As Jango Fett, you’ll have to jump, jetpack, climb, and maneuver in this iconic action-adventure game featuring a variety of visual improvements on modern platforms, as well as <strong>Steam Deck support</strong> and a number of DualSense controller features for PlayStation 5 players." <em>[emphasis added]</em></p>
<p>Trailer is below:</p>

<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Let the Hunt Begin: </strong>In this classic third-person action-adventure, you'll play as Jango Fett, Prime Clone of the Grand Army of the Republic, hired to capture a deranged Dark Jedi.</li>
<li><strong>Relive the Timeless Tale: </strong>Experience the legendary Bounty Hunter fantasy set before the events of <em>Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones™</em>. Face off against foes and maneuver through acrobatic battles in this adaption optimized for today's consoles and hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Armed to the Teeth: </strong>Fight your way through the galaxy’s underbelly, equipped with Dual Blasters, your Flamethrower, Whipcord, and pure Mandalorian Rage.</li>
</ul>

      <title>A favourite coffee-break game Rack and Slay now Steam Deck Verified plus a big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rack and Slay is a dungeon crawler where you're a billiard ball, and you've got to shoot yourself across every dungeon level to pot all the other very angry balls. It's good fun and now it's even better.</p>
<p>Easily my current favourite coffee-break game, it's so easy to just jump into it for a quick run to load up on various abilities and see how ridiculous you can make it. A week ago, Valve gave it the green tick to be Steam Deck Verified, so now taking it on the go is a great experience too.</p>
<p>On top of that, Update 1.1 released this week adding in an Endless Mode, so once you've finished you can keep going and it will just keep upping the stakes giving you additional enemies and generating harder layouts, but on top of it an ever-increasing enemy damage multiplier is introduced, making it especially tricky to survive not clearing all enemies with your initial set of shots.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yq5msXmcTe4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85271d3f788165d8e2e76dc1aa287f3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yq5msXmcTe4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The update also gives you a new item, Stop Shot, which the developer explained: "Some players found themselves wishing for more post-shot control, and Stop Shot is here to help. With this item, if you aim at an enemy straight on you will stop in place after hitting it. The maximum angle is 5° with one copy of the item but can be multiplied by stacking it."</p>
<p>You'll also find a new enemy, Floaty, a balloon-carrying enemy ball that slows down quicker than normal balls and it sounds like quite a nuisance, shedding balloons when you pot it into a hole so you need to hit it again.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned a few more small Steam Deck improvements. See more in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2311990/view/4192369369666376737" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update notes</a>.</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2311990/Rack_and_Slay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to buy on Steam</a>. It's also 15% off until July 11th.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Odencat developer of Bear's Restaurant, Fishing Paradiso and Meg's Monster recently revealed their next little adventure game with Mousebusters.</p>
<p>The day after moving into your new living space, you wake up to find that you’ve been inexplicably transformed into a mouse. Luckily, you soon meet a hard-boiled rodent with a crass but loveable manner of speaking who asks you to call him “Chief.” He claims he can help you turn back into a human…if you’re willing to undertake a few missions for him in return. Together, you’ll form the titular team, and embark on expeditions to bust the ghosts that haunt each unit and break the curse on the apartment building.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator is a fresh feel-good, puzzle-platforming adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from developer Adventure Works L.L.C., a feel-good, cinematic thrill-ride inspired by classic '80s adventure films and developed by one of the producers behind the interactive Millennium Falcon ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios, coming soon to Steam.</p>
<p>Here you step into the shoes of high school student Ari Buktu as you venture into the past with his eccentric science teacher Professor Lionel Raventhorpe and his trusty chinchilla-shaped friend Julius. Making use of a time machine elevator, you're on a quest to help your teacher find a special gift worthy of the woman who has claimed his heart.</p>
<p>You'll meet a cast of eclectic characters and uncover ancient ruins lost to mankind for centuries as you work to solve mystical puzzles, but don’t let your guard down! Deadly threats, such as pirates and tomb raiders, lurk around every corner and will do their best to put a quick end to your quest. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PrF3Loz9Y4o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/00ef841a66a49c6110fd79c905695fd6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PrF3Loz9Y4o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their press team told me via email it will have full Linux support.</p>
<p>A little about the developer, Adventure Works: Jeffrey Ashbrook founded the production company Adventure Works after spending more than a decade at Disney Imagineering, where he focused on the creation of physical spaces in theme parks. In 2017, Jeffrey’s brother Walter joined the team, and together they are working diligently to bring an adventure that spans across entire civilisations in Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator.</p>

      <title>Endless launch Block Coding for Godot Engine, great for beginners</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Block Coding tools are pretty popular like Scratch, where you do visual scripting using blocks instead of typing out code and now <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> has an impressive looking version of this with Block Coding from Endless.</p>
<p><em>It looks so simple even my stupid brain could probably do something with it. </em></p>
<p>Announced via the <a href="https://www.endlessos.org/post/block-coding-for-godot-lowering-the-bar-of-entry-for-a-powerful-tool" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Endless Foundation blog</a>, the new system is available to add into Godot via the <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/3095" rel="noopener" target="_blank">asset library</a>. The plugin itself is open source under the MIT license and can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/endlessm/godot-block-coding" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>A great initiative, especially with it being inside a game engine that's already free and open source, so people can easily progress onto traditional programming whenever they want. That's part of the point too, as Endless's Will Baumgartner wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of our main goals is to make the transition from using our simplified tools to using the Godot engine on its own as seamless as possible. So, as we start to make blocks more abstract than the code itself, it’s important that we stick to the same sort of language that Godot runs on.</p>
<p>As we have designed more and more blocks, we have thought carefully about this balance between lowering the bar of entry with simplified blocks, and trying to teach the concepts intrinsic to Godot. As more people find and experiment with the plugin, we hope to narrow down on this balance to make the transition to working with the real editor as smooth as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Palworld&#39;s Sakurajima update brings a new island, battle arena, a new raid and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld has just expanded in a rather big way with the Sakurajima Update, giving players a lot of new content to play through and it sounds pretty awesome. Palworld runs great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, but is a little rough on Steam Deck and is only rated Playable by Valve.</p>
<p>There's a whole new island to explore that has many new Pals to find, there's an Arena to battle in multiplayer, a new Oil Rig Stronghold to fight through, level cap was raised to 55, there's a new Crude Oil resource required by new high-tier equipment, a new Raid, a Meteorite Event, all tower bosses have a Hard Mode, you can find a new Merchant and then there's all the new items, weapons and cosmetics. </p>
<p>Pocketpair have clearly be very busy since release. And it's caused the player count to once again rocket seeing a peak of just over 100,000 in the last day. Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fKzLdPZr2Fk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54a29d5156032aa808738cc16664c148.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fKzLdPZr2Fk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I pretty quickly burned out on it at release, so I'm quite looking forward to all the improvements. Are you jumping back in again this weekend?</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>Valve has a new Steam Chart for the most played Steam Deck games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While every month Valve has been posting a fresh set of the most played Steam Deck games for the previous month, they've now added a dedicated Steam Chart for it. Like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hades-ii-tops-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-may-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most played for May</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-most-played-for-april-2024-has-plenty-of-fallout/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">again for April</a>.</p>
<p>So you no longer have to wait for Valve to post about what's currently hot, you can just go and see for yourself. Like other Steam Charts you can filter it and with the Steam Deck chart it lets you view the most played games over the last week, month and year based on player counts.</p>
<p>For example, this is for the last week, and handily it shows the Deck Verified rating too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20755362461719506384gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20755362461719506384gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Clarifying the date periods, Valve <a href="https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1806375121726452164" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X/Twitter that "The data for these lists updates daily across a rolling time window. For example, on June 27th the Top 100 for “past week” would cover June 21st - June 27th.". They will be adding a note on the page to say so too.</p>
<p>If you look over the last year, it's impressive to see Baldur's Gate 3 remaining as the number one most played game on Steam Deck with DAVE THE DIVER in second and ELDEN RING in third place.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 555.58 released as stable bringing Wayland Explicit Sync</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The time is finally here. The next big stable update to the NVIDIA proprietary driver for Linux with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/drivers/details/228289/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version 555.58</a> bringing Wayland Explicit Sync.</p>
<p>Following on from the initial NVIDIA 555.42.02 Beta and the 555.52.04 Beta, NVIDIA noted some rather <em>vague</em> "Minor bug fixes and improvements" since the last Beta. With this release, you should be truly good to go with Wayland on NVIDIA GPUs now.</p>
<p>All the changes are below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highlights from R555 2nd Beta Release, 555.52.04</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a segmentation fault when running multi-threaded NvFBC applications.</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension on Xwayland to work around a bug that could cause corruption.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause corruption when the GLX_EXT_buffer_age extension is used on X.org with PRIME render offloading.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when graphics applications requested single-buffered drawables while certain features (such as Vulkan sharpening) are enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to a kernel panic, due to a failure to release a spinlock under some conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition which could lead to crashes when Xid errors occur concurrently on multiple GPUs.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Highlights from R555 Beta Release, 555.42.02</p>
<ul>
<li>The GSP firmware is now used by default on all GPUs which support it. It can be disabled by setting the kernel module parameter `NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0`.</li>
<li>Added support for the linux-drm-syncobj-v1 protocol for Wayland explicit sync in EGL.</li>
<li>Removed support for Base Mosaic on GeForce, which was previously available only on select GPU boards with some motherboards, and limited to five display devices.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused "Failed to apply atomic modeset" and "Flip event timeout" messages to be printed to the system log when a DRM client such as ddcutil drops "master" permissions while a framebuffer console is being initialized.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, when nvidia-drm is loaded with the fbdev=1 module parameter on some kernels, that caused incorrect colors to be displayed.</li>
<li>Changed the minimum required Linux kernel version from 3.10 to 4.15.</li>
<li>Added immediate presentation mode support to Vulkan Wayland WSI. This presentation mode instructs the compositors not to wait for a vertical blanking period to update the application's surface content, which may result in tearing.</li>
<li>Enabled HDMI 10 bits per component support by default; disable by loading nvidia-modeset with `hdmi_deepcolor=0`.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that led to Xid errors when loading the NVIDIA driver on some notebook systems with RTX 4xxx series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused driver build failure when using separate kernel source and output directories on Linux v6.6 and later.</li>
<li>Added an interactive prompt to nvidia-installer to allow selecting between the proprietary and open kernel modules, on systems where both kernel module types are supported.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that incorrectly allowed `nvidia-smi -r` to reset the primary GPU when using the open kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR to incorrectly report support for Wayland surfaces when nvidia-drm is not loaded with modeset=1.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the display to lock up when suspending on a kernel with CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DEFERRED_TAKEOVER enabled with nvidia-drm loaded with modeset=1 and fbdev=1.</li>
<li>Added support for using EGL instead of GLX as the OpenGL ICD for NvFBC.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to a system hang and "Idling display engine timed out" messages when VT switching on an HDMI Fixed Rate Link (FRL) display.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Sci-fi racing platformer Distance gets a surprise update with Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Distance is a name I've not heard for a while. A really good fun sci-fi racing platformer from developer Refract that released in 2018, and they're bringing it back for v1.5: The Kinetic Update.</p>
<p>More about it: "Distance is an atmospheric racing platformer. Fusing futuristic arcade racing with parkour, survive a deadly, mysterious, neon-drenched city by jumping, rotating, and flying.</p>
<p>The roads are treacherous with obstacles around every corner. Instead of doing laps on a loop, survive to the end in the quickest time. Your car has abilities that not only allow you to drive on the track, but upside down and on buildings and walls! You can also fly to discover new shortcuts and paths. Take on the roads alone, or in multiplayer with your friends!"</p>
<p>With the update both Linux and Windows versions are now 64bit builds, which should keep it running smoothly into the future. And for Steam Deck specifically, there's a few nice adjustments to make it a better experience out of the box and just nicer to play through on it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck plugin system Decky Loader 3.0 gets a first pre-release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Decky Loader is a very popular tool to add plugins to the Steam Deck Gaming Mode, and Decky Loader 3.0 should be a big improvement.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/releases/tag/v3.0.0-pre1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first pre-release</a> is now available for testing, allowing you to give feedback before the final 3.0 release. Naturally, if you don't want to deal with any breakage, you should wait for the the main 3.0 release.</p>
<p>Here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Along with fixing the newest break in the steam beta, we're proud to announce we're releasing the first prerelease of Decky Loader 3.0, the websocket rewrite! We'd love users to give any feedback about any new errors that might show up.</p>
<p>For users, it means a hopefully more stable experience with better error handling, as well as more in-depth progress indication in Decky and its plugins. It's also allowed us to fix a bug where Decky would sometimes not start without an internet connection.</p>
<p>For plugin developers, it means a significantly easier to use API (it is now also asynchronous) and an easy way to do backend -&gt; frontend communication. You can read more about how to migrate <a href="https://wiki.deckbrew.xyz/en/plugin-dev/new-api-migration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> and about the new api <a href="https://wiki.deckbrew.xyz/en/plugin-dev/backend-frontend-communication" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

      <title>Forza Horizon 4 is getting delisted in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of racing games, you may want to act quickly and pick up Forza Horizon 4 before it gets delisted in December.</p>
<p>On December 15th, Microsoft / Xbox Game Studios will remove it from all digital stores. They said this is being done due to "licensing and agreements with our partners". A common occurrence for racing games, often due to music and car licenses. It will still be fully playable though as they said "Players who already own the game and its content will be able to download and play it as normal, including its offline, online, and multiplayer features; physical copies of the game purchased after this date will also work and will be able to use online features".</p>
<p>The game currently has a <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Steam Deck Playable rating, and works on desktop Linux too with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2549301881719487027gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Such a shame, all these licensing deals wreak havoc on game preservation. That's only 6 years after release, which is really not a long time. Sure, there's games following it, but still complete rubbish to have games just vanish from stores like this. At least in this case Playground Games are keeping the servers online, but for how long exactly when they won't be making any money from it?</p>
<p>It's 80% off on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> for the next 5 hours, ending at 5PM UTC. There's a chance it may have other discounts later before finally being removed but it also may not.</p>

      <title>Steam Game Recording Beta announced - works on Linux and Steam Deck too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another big upgrade for Steam desktop and Steam Deck fans, with Game Recording now in Beta allowing you to easily clip your favourite moments with no external apps needed. Valve said this system is Steam Deck Verified and fully functional there too!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This will work across two modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Background Recording - always active when in-game, with you being able to set the limits on it.</li>
<li>On Demand - recording from when you tap a key.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's not all. It's an entire system for developers to hook into for their games as well. When you're recording, you get a special timeline that appears. Developers can hook into this, to show event markers on this. Overall, it sounds pretty awesome.</p>
<p>It even makes sharing the clips relatively simple too with you being able to send it to different devices, like from a Steam Deck to desktop PC.</p>
<p>What we're getting is only the start, since this is in Beta. Valve said to expect more "upcoming features, including individualized game settings (coming soon)". And with this, they've also redesigned the Screenshots interface in Steam to include Recordings now too.</p>
<p>Here's a quick clip I recorded directly via Steam on my Kubuntu Linux desktop (game is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/rack-and-slay-answers-the-question-of-what-if-a-dungeon-crawler-was-like-billiards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rack and Slay</a>):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Fo0071Vrd98"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd51de9930539341f1b5491ee60c112a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Fo0071Vrd98" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As you can see, all fine! That was on the default 12Mbps High setting.</p>
<p><em>The export function at least on Kubuntu seems broken, as it tries to open a file instead of saving the file. So for now you can make a temporary share link instead, and download it from that. <strong>Update 27/06/24</strong>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/steamos-3-6-8-beta-for-steam-deck-released-plus-more-steam-game-recording-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this is solved in a new update</a>.</em></p>
<p>And a clip recorded from my Steam Deck LCD 512GB, which I then used the built-in feature to send it to my desktop and upload (game is Brotato):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FKj59AvH_4A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e5a3882e60a51f98614f7d8cfd37f496.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FKj59AvH_4A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This was again on the default of 12Mbps High setting.</p>
<p>From the brief test there across the two systems, it's really useful and works <em>very</em> nicely. This is a feature many have been asking for and Valve delivered. Even editing the clips directly on a Steam Deck is stupidly easy to do. I'm seriously impressed by this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20747079731719427985gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20747079731719427985gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - me editing the Brotato video clip included above, directly on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/gamerecording" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Game Recordings Beta page</a>. And the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4167599571728987172?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta Changelog</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, on Steam Deck in the Beta update, Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4194621169493214895" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> "Client and OS beta settings been updated to include a new "Preview" build of SteamOS when available for testing".</p>
<p>Finally there's a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/6489204638529587039" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamworks SDK update</a> to go with it.</p>
<p>Valve are once again clearly showing why they earn my monies.</p>

      <title>HORI announced a special gamepad for Steam / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HORI, a manufacturer of popular gaming accessories have today revealed the <a href="https://hori.jp/products/hpc/hpc-055/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wireless Horipad for Steam</a>. So if you're in need of a gamepad, this might be for you.</p>
<p>The main thing that concerns me here for Linux and Steam Deck support, is their mention of a dedicated app for it. We've seen before from the likes of 8BitDo, that certain buttons on their controllers (like back paddles) require a dedicated app and so cannot be configured directly on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In this case though, HORI do show a shot of Steam Input which has the back paddles listed on it, so perhaps we might see <em>full</em> Steam Input support for it. Considering it's a dedicated Steam controller, it would be <em>odd</em> if you <em>couldn't</em> adjust everything in Steam Input. They do also mention Steam Deck repeatedly too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12836888071719419542gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12836888071719419542gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Back paddles (L4/R4) <em>and</em> 2 extra custom buttons (M1/M2) right on the bottom.</li>
<li>A dedicated Quick Access button.</li>
<li>Support for Bluetooth, XInput and DirectInput, but seems XInput only via Wired connection.</li>
<li>Estimated 12 hour battery life (3.5 hours to fully charge).</li>
<li>Gyro in the "Steam mode". With the sticks having a touch sensor too.</li>
<li>Rapid fire ability on face buttons (ABXY).</li>
</ul>
<p>Their info mentions it does <em>not</em> have vibration though, or a microphone port.</p>
<p>So far, it seems to be only announced via their Japanese store with no mention on their USA or UK stores. Price according to their page is 9,780 Japanese Yen, so about £50 GBP / $60 USD.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4142827237888316811" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> about Steam Input, Valve confirmed they have added support for the new HORIPAD for Steam and they "worked with HORI's team to make their controller work well with Steam Input".</p>

      <title>COSMIC Alpha coming in July - System76 reveal branding, a big hardware sale with new merch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 are making a bit of a splash today, ahead of the Alpha release of their new desktop environment named COSMIC. They told me that COSMIC is still planned to have an Alpha release in late July, although that's still just an estimate it could be pushed back if there's issues.</p>
<p>To get things started, they've released the COSMIC branding:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17734498891719416053gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17734498891719416053gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC logos, colours, gradients, and tagline.</em></p>
<p>Speaking about COSMIC and their new branding, here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COSMIC makes it easy for distro developers to create the experience they envision for their users, while empowering users to curate an environment that works for them. This is the crux of COSMIC that became its slogan: Visions enacted, users empowered. And not just on the desktop, either. COSMIC is designed for creating custom experiences on any device with a display.</p>
<p>The open-ended ‘O’ logo mark not only represents a display, but also signifies an unwavering commitment to open source, an invitation for community, and vast possibility through customization. Beneath it, the System76 blip in an orange-red gradient resembles a keyboard with customized LEDs, representing what’s possible with COSMIC.</p>
<p>COSMIC offers the freedom to put your best foot forward across workflow, navigation, theming,<br/>
updates, security — and stability, thanks to its memory-safe Rust code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that, they've revealed the <a href="https://system76.com/specials" rel="noopener" target="_blank">COSMIC Freedom Sale</a> where you can get some big discounts on Desktops, Laptops, and Keyboards. To entice you even further you'll even get a free COSMIC T-Shirt with every laptop or desktop order, and COSMIC stickers with every computer.</p>
<p>Items on sale:</p>
<ul>
<li>$100 off the Lemur Pro 14” ultraportable laptop.</li>
<li>$200 off the Pangolin 16” ultraportable laptop.</li>
<li>$200 off the Oryx Pro 16” powerful laptop.</li>
<li>$200 off the Thelio Spark starter desktop.</li>
<li>$200 off the Thelio small form factor desktop.</li>
<li>$30 off the Launch Lite 67% keeb.</li>
<li>$50 off the Launch 76% keyboard.</li>
<li>$50 off the Launch Heavy full-size keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sale runs through July 9th.</p>
<p>Here's also a recent shot of COSMIC in action that the System76 Founder showed off on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@carlrichell@fosstodon.org/112650021377699895" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>:</p>

      <title>Lueur and the Dim Settlers renamed Dawnfolk, new trailer shows off accessibility features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dawnfolk (previously called Lueur and the Dim Settlers) is a very promising minimalist survival city-builder, one that suckered me in with the various mini-games in every tile you build and it's looking great.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Dawnfolk, you will manage resources, explore the surrounding tiles, and grow your city. The choices you make affect the success of your fledgling town. You might opt to uncover a hunting ground to provide more food for your villagers through meaningful minigames. Or you might choose to forge a path towards the mine and yield a recurring source of materials.</p>
<p>Minigames add a unique challenge to supporting your people. The better you are at the minigames, the more resources you get and the more likely your community will weather the darkness.</p>
<p>Every choice matters as you explore different strategies and play styles in Dawnfolk."</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2308630/view/4168724203080217981" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> the new name earlier this month, which is quite a <em>lot</em> better and easier to remember. They also just showed off a brand new trailer, showing off the accessibility work that's gone into it to hopefully make it playable for everyone. Heck, they even showed playing it with what looks like a Guitar Hero controller.</p>
<p>Check it out:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve didn't really do anything to mark the 25th anniversary of Counter-Strike 2, they have at least put out another small update that brings in the first community maps for CS2. Yes it's really been 25 years. First released on June 19th, 1999 as a mod for Half-Life.</p>
<p>Anyway yesterday Valve released "The Real MVP" update bringing in maps <em>Memento</em> and <em>Assembly</em> for Wingman, <em>Pool Day</em> for Arms Race and then finally <em>Thera</em> and <em>Mills</em> in Deathmatch, Casual and Competitive Matchmaking. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8242505051719402049gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8242505051719402049gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>

<p>The full changes are below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Community Maps</p>
<ul>
<li>Added community maps <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3121217565&amp;snr=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Thera</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3152430710&amp;snr=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mills</a> to Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch map groups</li>
<li>Added community maps <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3165559377&amp;snr=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Memento</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3071005299&amp;snr=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Assembly</a> to the Wingman map pool</li>
<li>Added community map <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3263935964&amp;snr=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pool Day</a> to the Arms Race map pool</li>

<p>Vertigo</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed c4 stuck spots and clipping</li>
</ul>
<p>Anubis</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes for grenade collision and clipping</li>
</ul>
[ UI ]
<ul>
<li>Updated the MVP panel in all game modes</li>
<li>Added all-new animated MVP panels to Premier matches</li>

<li>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync support is detected but not enabled at startup. Using G-Sync is generally recommended if your system supports it.</li>
<li>Added a Settings Recommendation popup if NVIDIA G-Sync is enabled but not V-Sync and/or NVIDIA Reflex. It is generally recommended to enable all three settings together when they are available. Note that applying these settings will limit your frame rate to your display's refresh rate or slightly lower, which is usually the smoothest-looking and lowest input latency settings combination. See <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/418E-7A04-B0DA-9032" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/418E-7A04-B0DA-9032</a> for technical details.</li>

<li>The "Refresh Rate" setting now shows your display's current refresh rate in Windowed and Fullscreen Windowed modes.</li>
<li>Removed the "Laptop Power Savings" setting which has never actually been configurable in CS2.</li>
<li>Added a "Frame Pacing" section to the Advanced Video settings page.</li>
<li>Added an "NVIDIA G-Sync" row to the Frame Pacing section which tells you whether or not G-Sync is active with your current display settings. This row may be hidden if you're using the Vulkan renderer or if you're not using an NVIDIA graphics card.</li>
<li>Added "Maximum FPS In Game" and "Maximum FPS In Menus" sliders to the Frame Pacing section. These control the fps_max and fps_max_ui convars respectively.</li>
<li>Increased the default "Maximum FPS In Menus" setting from 120 FPS to 200 FPS.</li>
<li>The Advanced Video visual preview now uses the "In Game" maximum FPS instead of the "In Menus" maximum.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Infogrames (Atari) have acquired the Surgeon Simulator franchise</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari continue their mini-spree of buying up games and studios, with their relaunched Infogrames label acquiring the Surgeon Simulator franchise. This was announced today after they reached an agreement with tinyBuild.</p>
<p>“More than 10 years after the release of the original, <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> remains a popular and unique franchise,” said Infogrames Manager, Geoffroy Châteauvieux. “This was a rare opportunity to acquire a game with a timeless appeal, and we are excited to have <em>Surgeon Simulator</em> within the Infogrames portfolio.”</p>
<p>The press release noted how Infogrames will look to expand the distribution of the current games, and potentially look at making new titles in the series or new content for extending games. On top of exploring merchandising collaborations all with a long-term plan to "preserve and expand the franchise". So, you know, the usual stuff publishers do when acquiring a series.</p>
<p>Other somewhat recent Atari acquisitions include <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/atari-revives-infogrames-and-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nightdive Studios</a>, plus <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intellivision brand and over 200 games</a> and it seems there will be plenty more to come with Infogrames being set up specifically to acquire IP and publish games outside of Atari's usual stuff.</p>

      <title>Classic flash game Neon Rider returns on Steam with Neon Rider Classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Neon Rider Classic is the new and improved definitive collection of classic Flash games, Neon Rider and Neon Rider World, which were played more than 15 million times and now it's on Steam. Developed by Louissi and Jeff Wofford and publisher Armor Games Studios.</p>
<p>Dash, speed, and flip through hand-crafted levels while matching the bike’s color with the track to reach the finish line in style. Loop through spiraling neon tubes, dodge incoming obstacles, and perform gravity-defying stunts while seamlessly shifting colors on the fly.</p>
<p>This is probably quite a niche, with games having progressed a lot since the Neon Rider days, but still nice to see them revived for some preservation.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c-ex1PEEfwk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e891ed3bd908f17252b2ce31a5eaa561.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c-ex1PEEfwk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Neon Rider and Neon Rider World defined a seminal moment in gaming for us,” said Louissi and Jeff Wofford, developers of Neon Rider Classic. “We hope that our passion for these classic Flash games invites newcomers and veterans alike to test their reflexes on the race track.”</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2757770/Neon_Rider_Classic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam now</a>. It has a Native Linux version.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice little win for preserving the classics. GOG teamed up with Capcom to bring <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 3</a> to their store with a few improvements.

      <title>Archrebel Tactics is a wild sci-fi turn-based strategy game inspired by Rebelstar and X-COM</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Inspired by the original Rebelstar from 1986 and in parts UFO: Enemy Unknown / X-COM: UFO Defense, you may want to take a look at Archrebel Tactics if you like your strategy games with a retro look and feel.</p>
<p>As a huge fan of X-COM and similar turn-based strategy games, after growing up playing it on the Amiga, I'm a big sucker for games like this. Spotting it pop up on social media recently, the style is really what pulled me in. With its mixture of a clear retro looked, spruced up with various animations and cool lighting effects it's really looking great.</p>
<p>Story: "Seeking prosperity on a newly colonized planet named Kaprical, the player is coerced to fight for survival, skirmishing against an unexpected totalitarian faction. By gathering followers, looting, purchasing, and capturing powerful droids, the player will eventually assemble a force to repel the intruder that took control of the planet's colonies in secrecy."</p>
<p>Check out their early trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ohuC0Qng76Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a2ee0d527a690ef59f39cd6c7189ae4f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ohuC0Qng76Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>All the features you would expect in such a game will be there, here's some of what's planned for the release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Single-player campaign with persistent and multiple-choice progress.</li>
<li>Partially procedurally-generated campaign missions.</li>
<li>Good old Laser Squad/X-COM action point system.</li>
<li>Partially destructible environments.</li>
<li>Pixel precision shooting.</li>
<li>Ranged and melee combat.</li>
<li>Full programmable and procedurally-generated single missions for endless replay value.</li>
<li>An inventory system with slot and weight limit control.</li>
<li>Optional permadeath (Iron-mode).</li>
<li>A reactive morale system able to cause effects like bravery, fear, or panic.</li>
<li>A stamina system that controls tiredness and the need for resting.</li>
<li>Retro-looking GFX with modern VFX like particles, shaders, and bone-based animations.</li>
<li>Skill-based actions for shooting, melee combat, repairing, healing, etc.</li>
<li>Level-up system with class selection for specialized perks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also noted they're planning post-release additions like local campaign co-op and PvP. If it sells well enough, they will also look into online play.</p>
<p>If you're a turn-based tactics fan, this seems to have it all. Still early on in development though, but very promising so far and recently the demo put up a Linux demo too.</p>
<p>There's a Native Linux demo available<a href="https://ularis-badler.itch.io/archrebel" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> via itch.io</a>. You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1889700/Archrebel_Tactics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Battle Train is a deck-builder where you throw trains at your enemy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battle Train sounds unique and hilarious! You've seen plenty of deck-builders, but instead of various creatures, here you throw trains at your enemy. <em>This has gone right to the top of my wishlist.</em></p>
<p>From Terrible Posture Games who created Tower of Guns and Mothergunship, along with Nerd Ninjas they say it's the "World’s FIRST Explosive Dueling Locomotive Deck-n-Track Builder Played Over the Backdrop of a Game Show". Bit of a mouthful, but seems like an apt description of the madness in this one.</p>
<p>Outfit your train, lay down tracks to your enemy's base, and obliterate them with dynamite, natural disasters, and mildly harsh (but still all-ages appropriate) language! Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zOACIXgZPp8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/954da3bea08688c1cec9952d3bc46643.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zOACIXgZPp8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duel a wide range of foes, each with their own unique cards and abilities.</li>
<li>Customize your train with your favorite power ups.</li>
<li>Build your deck with an array of cards--both functional and fantastical--to obliterate your opponent.</li>
<li>Win riches and prizes through a myriad of special events.</li>
<li>Experience a hilarious story told by the makers of "3 out of 10", Tower of Guns, and Mothergunship.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a delay, Paradox Interactive have now launched the first proper major expansion for Victoria 3 with Sphere of Influence along with the free Update 1.7 "Kahwah". So far it has gathered a Mostly Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>This expansion adds greater depth to the diplomatic game, with new ways of managing subject states, greater opportunities for economic investment in foreign economies, and, at the center of the expansion, Power Blocs that allow great powers to throw their weight around the globe to increase their prestige, influence and wealth. While the free update brings lots of AI improvements and various improvements throughout the whole game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rz3l4bY0A-4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e68b1710bb79f7d17d18955f4f9646e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rz3l4bY0A-4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

You can even customize colors and emblems for your bloc!</li>
<li><strong>“The Great Game”:</strong> New events, journal entries and decisions inspired by the Russian and British rivalry in Central Asia, and a new Objective - you can play as any of the powers central to that conflict, including Persia and Afghanistan. A newly redrawn map highlights the many competing interests in this frontier between empires.</li>
<li><strong>Foreign Investment:</strong> Invest in the economic development of countries outside of your direct influence, making a profit from their financial success.</li>
<li><strong>Nationalization: </strong>Start a Diplomatic Play to seize foreign assets in your country and prevent your wealth from going overseas.</li>

<li><strong>Power Bloc Monuments:</strong> Build majestic monuments to emphasise your bloc’s influence and domination over world events.</li>
<li><strong>New Historical Flavor:</strong> New historical characters and companies, most centered on the Great Game content, as well as more events, new journal entries, Lobby related content, new clothing and event art.</li>

      <title>The Vita Nova update for Terra Nil is out now bringing an overhaul to animals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terra Nil is a wonderful reverse-builder, where instead of building a city you're restoring the environment from a wasteland to a successful green ecosystem and the latest free update is a big one.</p>
<p>In this update they've added more content into each region so you can spend a bit more time there. There's 5 new missions with new biomes, new structures, new achievements, new handbook pages, new music and even a new animal.</p>
<p>The animal system was totally re-done too. Instead of manually bringing in animals, it's now a bit more natural so they will migrate to your current map when the habitat has enough for them to survive. You might even need to build some wildlife bridges for them, which is a sweet idea.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4qHI5xBa5q0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7444fce7673d6d7ec35be0c6c7573750.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4qHI5xBa5q0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like the future is bright for the game too, with more updates planned. Free Lives mentioned they've begun working with a new developer, Clockwork Acorn, who helped with this update and will continue to work on the game going forward with Free Lives overseeing the direction. It was also mentioned in the update notes that Clockwork Acorn are already working on the next update.</p>
<p>Terra Nil has Native Linux support. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Mix and match quirky weapons and gadgets to build your perfect fighter in Counterpick Labs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo available on Steam and Native Linux support, Counterpick Labs looks like a fun addition to the platform fighter genre and it's going to be free too.</p>
<p>The idea that you get to build your own fighter in Counterpick Labs sounds quite fun, and pretty different from the static roster you usually get from these types of games, so it's worth keeping an eye on. Nice to see a developer try something just a bit different in an established genre.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4H8tdZe4OdU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/153f7e0ee726ab1b86ec1299fefaffad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4H8tdZe4OdU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smooth platform fighter action</strong> - Combo your opponents and knock them offstage to secure the win. Play locally or online with rollback netcode. Free to play with no way to buy power.</li>
<li><strong>Build your perfect fighter </strong>- Over 200 (and growing!) loadout combinations, plus countless cosmetic options. For a tanky, ranged build, pair Oleg's might with the Warp Mine's teleport, and hurl Chakrams to deal damage from afar. Or dominate the skies by combining Space Suit's triple jump with Jet Boots' maneuverability and the momentum-altering recoil of the Flame Cannon.</li>
<li><strong>Classic &amp; roguelike combat</strong> - Enjoy intense, skill-based combat in Classic mode. Or try your luck in the roguelike Arena mode, where you'll earn powerful upgrades as you fight, from elemental weapon auras to ricocheting projectiles to dramatic stat boosts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2837280/Counterpick_Labs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it out on Steam</a>. A demo is available and it enters Early Access on July 12th.</p>

      <title>Slow down a bit and go collecting in Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge is another wonderful game built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, for gamers who prefer things a whole lot more chilled. Developed by Humble Reeds and published by Armor Games Studios, my key was provided by Stride PR.</p>
<p>Here you play as Cleo, a young woman who decided to take a break from their boring day-to-day modern life to connect up with an old friend, Axel, who shares your love of Frogs. With your friends help, you begin to build up a sanctuary for frogs and restore the biodiversity of the dried-up wetlands.</p>
<p>This is as much a creature collector as it is a little farming game. Nothing like Stardew Valley though, it's even <em>more</em> laid-back and chilled. Here you're designing and building up a little Frog sanctuary by spreading out various items like bathtubs, logs, chairs, wells and all sorts that will attract new frogs to the area for you to feed up and befriend to add to your collection. You can even take a few snaps of them with your camera to add to your book.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CcEa7KM_j04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/983730d3a9c5297c42c946f7c96b6b25.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CcEa7KM_j04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Outside of building up your sanctuary, you're also something of a conservationist, working to restore the wetlands and bring back some biodiversity. It's a bit of a side-hustle, as it allows you to build up your resources to expand your sanctuary so the two parts of the game go nicely hand in hand.</p>
<p>There's a pretty satisfying loop to it once you get past the tutorial, where you're mostly left to your own devices to continue on as you see fit with some quests. What initially seems quite simple, actually has a surprising amount of depth to it. With a tech tree to unlock more for the wetlands, little mini-games at various parts to help mix-up the gameplay a little and yes there's even Frog breeding so you can fill up that Frogedex.</p>
<p>You can end up finding more than 500 different Frogs across 8 species, so there's always something you could be doing. Although, at times, there is just a bit of sitting around while you wait for your little friends to come and appreciate all the random junk you've put down for them to hop onto. Getting them to be friendly is a bit of a grind too, as they all like different bugs to eat, which is again where restoring the wetlands comes in because that's where you'll get a lot of the bugs. </p>
<p>Not just that, but you also need to keep improving the bioscore of the wetlands, which will help attract more different types of frogs to your sanctuary. So you're constantly flicking around between all the screens to get little jobs done. It is a bit unusual, at least to me, that you don't walk or run around directly yourself, with everything just based on moving the screen around and flicking between parts of the UI. But, you do get used to it, and it does help you slow down a bit and appreciate all that's going on with it being less distracting controlling a character directly.</p>
<p>I've certainly been a bit guilty of being non-stop on many things recently. Never stopping to smell the flowers, so Kamaeru: A Frog Refuge was exactly what was needed for a bit.</p>
<p>With some truly wonderful artwork, it looks rather like a watercolour painting with some gentle motion added, it's quite a little treat for the eyes. Moving items around is also almost like putting stickers in a book too, it's just really rather lovely overall. Much like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/its-beeautiful-apico-4-0-brings-automation-machines-to-the-chilled-beekeeping-sim/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">APICO</a>, another gem about saving the Bees, it gives off coze vibes but has an important message.</p>
<p>“The comforting wetlands of Kamaeru are a great way to unwind and escape from daily life,” said Dan McNeely, CEO &amp; Founder of Armor Games Studios. “As cozy gamers all over the world restore the wetlands in Cleo’s story, we hope it inspires a greater appreciation for nature, the ecosystem we live in, and a drive to protect the froggy friends we make along the way.”</p>
<p>Available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978150/Kamaeru_A_Frog_Refuge/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Rig the game in Pip My Dice, a Yahtzee roguelike experience inspired by Balatro</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Yahtzee Roguelike experience? That's going to be a thing. FokazLabs recently revealed Pip My Dice and the idea does sound quite interesting.</p>
<p>They're hoping in some ways to replicate what Balatro did for Poker, being directly inspired by it. Giving you the ability to customise different dice and use them together with powerful relics to break high scores and climb the leaderboard.</p>
<p>Check out the early trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_uV0V4MegLY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07a6be1d09d66d6d7b1a41b5a3559c74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_uV0V4MegLY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As the developer says: "Although very easy to learn and playable with only the mouse, you will have to understand the symbiosis between the different elements of the game to beat it."</p>
<p>You will need to take your time to evaluate what dice you should reroll to get the best combinations. Giving you endless replayability with every run being different than the one before, plus you'll be able to save and replay your favourite seeds and share those you liked the most.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Climb the leaderboard with seeded or random runs to compete with the world or your friends!</li>
<li>Select from 10+ different starting decks.</li>
<li>15+ different dice modifiers with unique effects.</li>
<li>100+ relics to create insane combos.</li>
<li>10+ different bosses to defeat.</li>
<li>Level up your combination slots as the run goes on.</li>
<li>Save your favourite seeds to replay and share with your friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2797650/history/?changeid=24086623" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, the developer recently updated it to note Linux support too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2797650/Pip_My_Dice/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. No word on a release date yet other than Q4 2024.</p>

      <title>Warzone 2100 version 4.5.0 Beta enhances support for campaign mods, improved multiplayer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of my favourite RTS games, Warzone 2100, just keeps on getting better thanks to it being open source. A major new Beta has been released that has some really great improvements for both singleplayer and online play.</p>
<p>Version 4.5.0 Beta 1 released on June 23rd adds in enhanced support for campaign mods (and campaign balance mods). With that, two entirely new campaigns have been added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Addon Campaign: Reclamation</strong>
<ul>
<li>A brand-new campaign from @DARwins1 with an original story taking place before the events of the main game:</li>
<li>“Set out under the command of renowned General Edmund Clayde with the goal of laying the foundations of a new world. What could possibly go wrong?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Addon Campaign: Fractured Kingdom</strong>
<ul>
<li>A brand-new campaign from @DARwins1 with its own self-contained story:</li>
<li>“After crash-landing in the territory of a once powerful kingdom, you must navigate your way through the various factions fighting over what remains. Can you prevail against the odds, facing relentless foes, and see this story to its end?”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a new in-game guide you can bring up any time, and a classic feature returns with formation speed limiting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13957022831719236746gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13957022831719236746gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>For people who enjoy online play there's several big improvements there too including a new UI for joining games, there's advanced port mapping so you can now use PCP, NAT-PMP, and UPnP to improve the ability to successfully host games. Hosts can now kick stuck-loading players and various bug fixes. <em><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">Lots more smaller changes too in the </span><a href="https://wz2100.net/news/version-4-5-0-beta1/" rel="noopener" style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); font-size:17px" target="_blank">changelog</a><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">.</span></em></p>

      <title>Flathub continues growing with over 2 billion downloads recorded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://flathub.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub</a>, the main front-end for Flatpak packages, which serves various applications and games to many different Linux distributions and Steam Deck has surpassed 2 billion downloads.</p>
<p>At time of writing there's been 2,004,922,946 downloads. To me, it's quite worth celebrating. Long have we seen the complaints from people wanting to switch to Linux, or testing out the waters, with how fractured the ecosystem is overall. <em>You've seen the complaints at some point I'm sure.</em></p>
<p>But, being able to tell people "just download it from Flathub", and for a lot of Linux distributions that's now simply a case of opening up the local software app like GNOME Software or KDE Discover, it's a different and much easier world.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://flathub.org/statistics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub Statistics page</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10884162981719236050gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10884162981719236050gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A keen eye might note when it started rocketing upwards. As a reminder, the Steam Deck from Valve released in February 2022, and it certainly seems like around that time it started shooting up. Not surprising, since a lot of people enjoy the Steam Deck's Desktop Mode, which is powered by KDE Plasma with Flathub being the way to install most things there.</p>

      <title>Mesa gets a nice performance boost for Proton games with various videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Mike Blumenkrantz has another blog post up and Merge Request ready for Mesa, the set of open source graphics drivers, which gives a big boost to performance for Windows games with various videos.</p>
<p>As noted in the <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/closing-the-loop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the tests were done on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/586140/BlazBlue_Centralfiction/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BlazBlue Centralfiction</a>, which has some issues. As Blumenkrantz noted it's a DirectX game, one which embeds video files. In Proton, GStreamer is used to play those videos while DXVK renders the game but GStreamer uses OpenGL and the performance was not great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8690092691719235398gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8690092691719235398gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - BlazBlue Centralfiction</em></p>
<p>From the Mesa <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/29841" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> that's only a few lines of changes it "massively improves (&gt;100%) ReadPixels perf in a number of cases". Which should hopefully result in a smoother overall experience in games that do similar things with videos on Linux / Steam Deck with Mesa.</p>
<p>Seems like another nice win for open source driver performance, if it's merged into Mesa.</p>

      <title>Dice rolling dungeon crawler Dice &amp; Fold is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released today with Native Linux support, Dice &amp; Fold from Tinymice Entertainment is a turn-based dungeon crawler where your only way of attacking the enemy is by rolling dice.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dice &amp; Fold is a game that combines the strategic depth of turn-based dungeon crawlers with the thrill of chance inherent in dice games. Players unfold cards to face the creature cards and try to beat the card and fold it. Reminiscent of classic table-top RPGs and Solitaire, the game adds a simple layer of strategy."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>The developer mentioned they have a full roadmap ahead of content to add to it. Although it's not an Early Access title, they will keep expanding it. Currently they plan 5 free post-release updates filled with new companions, new items, new bosses to beat, new difficulty modes and so on.</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group put out their plans for AI in game development </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After killing off and selling off various studios and causing lots of job losses, Embracer Group have put out their latest annual report and they have big plans for AI.</p>
<p>Embracer Group control the likes of THQ Nordic, PLAION, Coffee Stain, Amplifier Game Invest, DECA Games, Easybrain, Asmodee Group, Dark Horse Media, Freemode and Crystal Dynamics – Eidos. They have around 106 game development studios under their belt.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time of course until they started talking up AI, as with other major game developers and publishers, and basically every big company that exists — they're all trying to shove AI into something so they can say "hey look we have AI too!".</p>
<p>Embracer think AI and large language models (LLMs) will <em>empower</em> their developer teams and say they don't want AI to replace people. From the <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Embracer-Group-publishes-Annual-Report-20232024-240620.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">annual report</a> in their Risk and Mitigation overview it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI has the capability to massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency, adding intelligent behaviors, personalization, and optimization to gameplay experiences. By leveraging AI, we create more engaging and immersive experiences that provide each player with a unique, dynamic, and personalized experience. We also see great opportunities for AI in game development speed, logistics and planning. Embracer Group also understands the potential risks associated with the use of AI. Our aim is to empower our employees with AI applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what they've done is create a "Group AI Policy" that includes various guiding principles, risk assessment, and a risk framework that they're implementing across their companies with the idea being "human empowerment". Here's what Tomas Hedman, Head of Privacy &amp; AI Governance at Embracer Group, had to say about it:</p>
<p>"Certainly, one of the major risks for a company is not to use AI, as this would mean a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other industry players. Most companies will move forward on AI integration in different ways. For us, it is the way that we do this that is the most critical element.</p>
<p>We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them. This is the core of our human-centric approach to leveraging the potential with AI.</p>
<p>It’s not just that AI enables our developers to do even more, and to become more efficient on certain tasks, it will also open up coding to a broader group of developers. Entry into the industry might be easier for individuals with disabilities who, for instance, cannot use a keyboard as easily as others.</p>
<p>AI is trained on historical data, which tilts in a certain direction. As a result, you can end up with imbalanced automated decision-making. Let’s say you’re building a village. If you use AI for this, depending on how it’s trained and the decisions it takes, you may end up with a village with a demography that displays some sort of imbalance.</p>
<p>As AI models become more powerful, we can leverage their capacity also in the creative process, for example, by identifying inconsistencies in scripts and storytelling. There will be tremendous benefits for our creative teams regarding scriptwriting, image creation, idea generation, quality control, and more. And, as models become more human-like, the interaction between players and AI-supported functions will be much more dynamic. If in a game scenario you bargain, AI can remember this the next time. That makes the whole gaming experience much more interesting and lifelike."</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's worth noting that in the last GDC Survey, it showed that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/31-of-devs-already-using-ai-pc-platform-is-healthy-overall/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">31% of devs were already using AI</a>.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this?</p>

      <title>X4: Foundations Update 7.00 and X4: Timelines DLC are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>X4: Foundations 7.00 Update and X4: Timelines from Egosoft bring some huge changes to the huge space sim and there's never been a better time to try it out.</p>
<p>The new expansion for starters, X4: Timelines, is something quite different. Designed for new players and veterns alike, Egosoft say it uses "novel ways to introduce new players to X4's core gameplay mechanics" and it introduces a whole new storyline that takes place outside the main X4 sandbox so its properly standalone (but still a DLC) that will give you "colossal challenges and unexpected excursions into the depths of the X series lore and history" and it's an "adventure that transcends time and space"</p>
<p>Check out the DLC trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6WV1YJsfSss"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b09f2d0f7a604d29eb8877342ab30ce6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6WV1YJsfSss" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that of course is the next major free upgrade, X4: Foundations 7.00. This brings in additional advice for new players, expanded tutorials, improved AI, a FOV slider, TAA support, improved explosions, improved shadows, additional sectors and landmarks, new accessibility options, a customizable radial menu for quick access to actions, a new late-game crisis for advanced players and so much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9dumQL9dK-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62e94f12a7c3150d1692a98c4e56de8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9dumQL9dK-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall this all sounds pretty incredible. </p>
<p>Available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Cosmic horror post-apocalyptic RPG Death Trash has a teaser for a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Trash features a world where cosmic horrors long for humanity but meet punks with shotguns. Influenced by post-apocalyptic, horror, and cyberpunk classics. Death Trash is certainly promising, and it's finally gearing up for a content update.</p>
<p>There's no date for it The Perished City update yet but developer Crafting Legends mentioned there will be a Beta in the coming months, after that we will see another content update with Northern Wasteland planned for the end of 2024.</p>
<p>Check out the teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FvMoiEELr0c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8298fa102a8f43f6619081c696ebb400.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FvMoiEELr0c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Death Trash is an open-world, singleplayer role-playing game with handcrafted levels, a strong story campaign and optional local co-op gameplay.</p>
<p>The game features real-time gameplay with ranged and melee combat, stealth, multiple choice dialogue, an inventory of items and worms, a crafting system, and skills like pickpocketing and puking."</p>
<p>This update has been a long time coming, with no released update to the game since December last year. Slow going, but it should be worth it. Based on what I've already played, the style and atmosphere is awesome.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/death_trash?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://craftinglegends.itch.io/deathtrash" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/941460/Death_Trash/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>PVKK from the Dome Keeper devs has you manually control a massive planetary defence cannon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Bippinbits have announced PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant (yes really) as their next game following Dome Keeper. It looks suspiciously like Dome Keeper is 3D, but it's a lot more than that.</p>
<p>More about it: "In PVKK, you step into the role of a cannon pilot for an autocratic regime, confined to a defense bunker. Your mission: manually control a massive planetary defense cannon to fend off an ongoing interplanetary invasion. Master the various systems to protect your home world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Interact with a retro-tech cockpit filled with satisfying buttons, levers, dials, and switches. Manage energy generators, scan the skies for enemy vessels, analyze threats, calculate fire trajectories, and execute precise firing procedures. With limited resources and a strict regime, strategic thinking is key to your success."</p>

<li>Atmospheric Setting: Enjoy the unique blend of a cozy yet oppressive bunker environment.</li>
<li>Multiple Endings: Your decisions have a significant impact on the story's outcome.</li>
<li>Hidden Secrets: Uncover bit by bit what is going on outside of the bunker through engaging escape room-style puzzles.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> again and the developer <a href="https://x.com/Bippinbits/status/1803909544617156681" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> Linux support for it.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree DLC update causing problems on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree releases soon, and there's a patch out but sadly this has been causing issues for players on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patch 1.12</a> has gone live, and unfortunately it seems to cause two major problems. The first, is that you can no longer do online play as their Easy Anti-Cheat for Linux platforms seems a bit broken. It will just refuse to let you play online with an error message.</p>
<p>On top of that on Steam Deck, if you leave it idle for more than 5 minutes, it seems to just break the game and you can no longer do anything, so you would need to quit it and reload. <em>That's…annoying.</em></p>
<p>The official ELDEN RING account on X (Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: a Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on. Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs. We apologize for inconvenience. The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully they won't keep players waiting long. And so far, they haven't acknowledged the anti-cheat issue. Seems like not enough (or any?) testing was done here. Quite problematic for a Steam Deck "Verified" title.</p>

<p>I will aim update the article if they fix it any time soon. If it's a couple of days or longer though, look out for a future article noting the fix is live.</p>

      <title>DRM lease protocol support finally merged for GNOME Wayland - great for VR fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VR fans rejoice! The GNOME project has finally pulled in DRM lease protocol support today, something required for getting VR under GNOME on Wayland working well.</p>
<p>The issue was posted to the GNOME GitLab <em><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/1743" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 3 years ago</a></em>, so this really has been a long time coming.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/3746" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> to actually add in support for it was created by developer José Expósito on May 10th, based on work done by developers Jonas Ådahl and Sebastian Wick. So now the issue noted above created over 3 years ago has been <em>closed</em> with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/tagline_images/90803740id24762gol.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Valve Index</em></p>
<p>So with this, you should hopefully be good to go using services like SteamVR on Linux (and others) under GNOME Wayland, once the next release of GNOME and Mutter are out with this new code pulled in.</p>
<p>The next release, GNOME 47, is due on September 14th. Followed up by GNOME 47.1 due on October 12th.</p>
<p>Really great to see!</p>

      <title>Selaco now has a Bullet Time mod inspired by Max Payne and it&#39;s amazing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I was already a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/selaco-is-now-in-early-access-one-of-the-best-shooters-ive-played-in-forever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ridiculously big fan of Selaco</a>, with it being one of the best retro-styled shooters (and just...shooters in general) I've played in forever and now the Bullet Time X mod has just made it even more amazing.</p>
<p>Available via the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3268589630" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Workshop</a> making it a one-click addition to the game, thanks to Selaco having great modding support. It adds in a slow-motion system to the game you can activate at the touch of a button. Inspired by the Max Payne game not only is the world slowed down but everything including weapons, movement, sounds, everything.</p>
<p>The mod gives you a new adrenaline meter that slowly fills up by itself, and you can bump it up by taking down enemies. There's two modes where you can tap B to slow things down, or press V to activate "Shootdodge" to jump and make it go <em>even slower</em>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kuddK5vdyt8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de020108dd08ba4c940c096fba550f8c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kuddK5vdyt8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You also get a mod menu, so you can adjust some settings, like giving yourself infinite bullet time.</p>
<p>This is going to be so much fun to use and it works with existing save games, no need to start over with it. I can't wait to see what other crazy mods people make for Selaco. You might also want the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3258941092" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Infinite Flashlight</a> mod too perhaps.</p>
<p>Selaco has Native Linux support and is playable on Steam Deck. It's currently in Early Access.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">buy Selaco on Steam</a> priced at $24.99 / €24.50 / £20.99.</p>

      <title>Guide a caravan of adventurers through hostile environments in Sandwalkers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of a blending of Curious Expedition and Vagrus - The Riven Realms we have here with Sandwalkers, a roguelike turn-based exploration game where you guide a caravan across hostile environments. From Goblinz Studio the same group that made Legend of Keepers.</p>
<p>Story: "Every decade, the Mka tribe sends caravans of adventurers into the Phithi, the meteorological chaos that keeps the Uwando tribes isolated from each other and makes life outside the refuges almost impossible.</p>
<p>Their mission: to establish diplomatic and trade relations, to explore and reclaim the lands left to the mercy of monsters and pirates, and, most importantly, to plant a new tree city that can become a refuge for the Mka and their allies. Regardless of the success or failure of their mission, the caravans must send the memories they have gained back to the capital, using the crystospheres carried by traveling beetles."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guide a caravan of adventurers through varied landscapes.</li>
<li>Fight hordes of pirates, wizards and monsters, and survive acid rain, storms and heat waves.</li>
<li>Rescue refugees, seek allies to support you and stir up the past in search of the causes of Phithi.</li>
<li>Keep <em>hope</em>: in this hostile desert, the caravaneers' faith in their mission is all that protects them from certain death.</li>
<li>Progress by passing on your knowledge to a new caravan.</li>
<li>Make choices that will affect your future expeditions.</li>
<li>Each character has different powers. It's up to you to explore lost ruins as an archaeologist or to track down massive creatures as a hunter.</li>
<li>Don't underestimate the weather! It conditions the movements of caravanners and the outcome of confrontations.</li>
<li>Repair the broken climate, and put an end to centuries of wandering.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking Star Fox and putting the survivor-like spin on it with lots of upgrades and repeat runs, Whisker Squadron: Survivor has levelled up with a new campaign mode that's really worth a go.</p>
<p>With the new campaign mode, they said they've redesigned the overall experience of the game, giving you a choice of randomly generated paths. Each campaign will include a variety of environments, and increasingly difficult combat encounters culminating in a boss fight at the end of each of the 3 acts.</p>
<p>This includes major additions like 2 shops with new characters, the start of a deeper narrative, various new enemies to face, a new wave-based spawning system for enemies, 3 save slots now, a new intro cut-scene and lots of other <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2140100/view/6085006571972613994" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements</a>.</p>

      <title>Death Road to Canada gets a major 2024 upgrade with new events, characters, perks and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Road to Canada is a name I haven't heard for quite a while. A co-op action post-zombie apocalypse road trip game and it just had a big update for 2024.</p>
<p>Built for you to replay it as many times as you like everything is randomized including locations, events, survivor appearances and personalities as you hit the road and attempt to survive.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11584291871718881739gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The new OMENTUM update that launched today has added in plenty for you to jump back in including 4 new special rare characters to find, 11 new events to play through, various new event images, you can now use a fire extinguisher as a weapon (and support for putting out more fires), AI improvements so they can actually pick up and throw zombies now, new character perks and traits added and plenty of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Sounds like an excellent time to try it out again.</p>
<p>Death Road to Canada has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>ElectricMaple joins WiVRn and ALVR in giving options to stream VR to a headset</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Helping you cut down on all those wires, and potentially making way for cheaper low-end VR headsets for streaming, ElectricMaple was announced by Collabora and PlutoVR joining the likes of WiVRn and ALVR.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ALVR</a> is probably one of the best known VR streaming options, allowing you to stream VR games from your PC to your headset via Wi-Fi that works with SteamVR or Oculus Software (using Revive), and it supports various headsets although their Linux support is still rough.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Meumeu/WiVRn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WiVRn</a> is another, that the developer of posted in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Discord</a> recently, which implements OpenXR, built on top of Monado that the developer says "the client application works on most standalone headsets". This project is a bit more fresh and recent, with the developer noting they "think it is now mature enough for people to use".</p>
<p>And now another has arrived with <a href="https://github.com/PlutoVR/electric-maple" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ElectricMaple</a> that Collabora posted about on <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/electricmaple-remote-rendering-debuts-at-awe-2024.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their blog</a> today. Working in collaboration with PlutoVR, they note it's "designed to enhance standalone XR experiences through remote-rendering" and that it uses "the power of Monado OpenXR and GStreamer, ElectricMaple enables high-quality XR streaming from graphics-capable servers to lightweight standalone headsets".</p>
<p>ElectricMaple seems like it's geared more towards hardware vendors, whereas ALVR and WiVRn are more for users to try on existing headsets. But it will still be usable on desktop Linux, and eventually Windows too. Collabora are showing it off at the <a href="https://awexr.com/usa-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Augmented World Expo (AWE)</a>.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0E2C-406B-9135-38A4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Link for Meta Quest</a>, allowing you to stream games directly from Steam to a Meta Quest headset. Although, Valve are yet to hook up Linux support for that, perhaps some of these projects may help them.</p>

      <title>Heroes Of Loot: Gauntlet Of Power is a fresh take on dungeon crawling with a very unique weapon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you absolutely love action-heavy dungeon crawlers like The Binding of Isaac, and the chaos from Vampire Survivors you're going to <em>need</em> to take a look at Heroes Of Loot: Gauntlet Of Power from Orangepixel. </p>
<p>There's a very familiar feeling with Gauntlet Of Power, giving you a randomly generated dungeon to run through a room at a time with your little character and take down all the enemies in each room. If you've ever played a real-time dungeon crawler (especially Isaac), you'll be instantly familiar with one major difference and it's thoroughly unique which is — the Gauntlet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16451212251718812988gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16451212251718812988gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Your Gauntlet is your weapon. Well, actually, it's many different weapons in one. It has eight slots, one for each direction you can fire in. When you pick your starting character, you get an initial weapon on one direction slot. As you take down enemies and level up, you get to pick a new weapon to stick into one of the directional slots to then fire that weapon automatically in that direction. You can also pick the same weapon, to place onto an existing one in a slot to power it up a level too.</p>
<p>That alone would be pretty darn interesting and it's a really fun spin on the genre, giving you an endless amount of replay value, allowing you to make some really interesting characters during your run. There's more to it though. Plenty more.</p>
<p>Not only do you pick a random weapon to add in a direction of your choosing, there's also various special weapon combinations to discover in the Gauntlet slots. Two weapons together might create a union with a new weapon. There's also a whole bunch of items to find, to further boost and change your character during your run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12364519461718813308gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12364519461718813308gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's boss battles, a shop to spend your coins in, new characters to unlock and more.</p>
<p>There's definitely some Vampire Survivor style chaos going on as you're running around in here. At times, it can be a little difficult to tell what's going on, as you're firing off eight different weapons with pixel-art enemies running around at the same time, some coming straight for you and some keeping distance firing at you. It definitely could do with highlighting enemy projectiles better but that's about my only issue with it.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L3Ga3SNmTY8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2111dfc602f55d0711e70b06d2f48f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L3Ga3SNmTY8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Randomly generated dungeons, items enemies and bosses, you never play the same game twice.</li>
<li>5 base weapons and 9 special combo's and union weapons - all upgradable in strength.</li>
<li>Unique items that enhance your powers against the horde of enemies.</li>
<li>Over 14 end bosses.</li>
<li>6 dungeons covering 16 levels and a final boss-of-all-bosses battle.</li>
<li>2 playable and 2 unlockable classes.</li>
<li>Unlockable Rune-power options to support you in completing the game.</li>
<li>Perma unlockable Forged cards.</li>
<li>Secret rooms, Quests, Treasure rooms, and Shops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Works great on desktop Linux (Kubuntu 24.04) and perfect on Steam Deck too. Might actually be my favourite game so far from Orangepixel.</p>
<p>Heroes Of Loot: Gauntlet Of Power is available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2374320/Heroes_Of__Loot_Gauntlet_Of_Power/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>.</p>
