      <title>Saints Row IV getting a free upgrade to Saints Row IV: Re-Elected and store cross-play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>All owners of Saints Row IV are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/206420/view/3646256550316263153" target="_blank">getting bumped up</a> to the Saints Row IV: Re-Elected edition, plus cross-play across different stores. So players on Steam, GOG and Epic will be able to play together.</p>
<p>This means everyone who didn't have it before will gain access to the Enter the Dominatrix and How the Saints save Christmas mission DLC, plus various outfits and weapon DLC (there's quite a lot) including the Anime Pack, Dubstep Remix Pack, Presidential Pack, Wild West Pack and so on.</p>
<p>From the announcement it will go live for Windows on December 8th, with a note that it will be "later for Linux players". The Linux port was originally done by Virtual Programming, who we've not heard from or seen ports from in a long time, so it will be interesting to see if they do fully hook up the cross-play for the Linux version too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Civilization VI updated properly for Linux from Aspyr but still has problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently Sid Meier's Civilization VI from Firaxis Games had a major update and DLC release <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/sid-meiers-civilization-vi-gets-a-leader-pass-breaks-it-on-linux-and-macos/" target="_blank">that broke it</a> on macOS and reverted to a really old version for Linux but porter Aspyr Media has partially fixed it for Linux now.</p>
<p>For the Native Linux build, it is at least now up to date with version 1.0.12.9 instead of the <em>really old</em> version they seemingly put up by accident. It still won't launch on a lot of newer Linux distributions without workarounds though, which Aspyr are likely to never fix and that has been a problem for years. This means the new Leader Pass should work fine.</p>
<p>As an example of the Linux workaround for the Native version, you can use a simple Steam Launch Option:</p>
<p>Arch:</p>
<p><code>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6 %command%</code></p>
<p>Fedora:</p>
<p><code>LD_PRELOAD=/lib64/libfreetype.so.6 %command%</code></p>
<p>Debian:</p>
<p><code>LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so.6 %command%</code></p>
<p><em>I'm still honestly amazed such a seemingly simple library issue was left in for years. It's also surprising it took over a week for them to fix the wrong game version for Linux…</em></p>
<p>However, due to performance, you're likely <em>far</em> better off with the Windows version in Proton and you can work around the problematic 2K launcher with this Steam launch option:</p>
<p><code>eval $( echo "%command%" | sed "s/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe'.*/Base\/Binaries\/Win64Steam\/CivilizationVI.exe'/" )</code></p>
<p>Seems like they haven't yet fixed it for macOS, with lots of complaints on Steam about it. Aspyr really dropped the ball on this update and the annoyance from users is quite understandable.</p>

      <title>OpenRA for classic Command &amp; Conquer, Dune 2000, Red Alert has a new Playtest</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> is one of my absolute favourite open source projects allowing you to play the Westwood classics like Command &amp; Conquer, Dune 2000 and Red Alert has a new <a href="https://www.openra.net/news/playtest-20221203/" target="_blank">Playtest</a> up over a year after the last release.</p>
<p>Some of the big highlights includes the new hierarchical pathfinder, which increases performance on large maps. New and improved netcode, better notifications for people playing without sound, a lot of balance and polish in Dune 2000 due to the rising popularity after the Dune filme and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11005969511670243653gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11005969511670243653gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Dune 2000 in the new Playtest</em></p>
<p>Here's an overview of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of the more visible new features and improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measures against sound / notification overlap. No more u-u-u-u-unit lost</li>
<li>Measures against spamming the multiplayer lobby and in-game chat</li>
<li>The ability to mute players</li>
<li>Support for disabling the chat in replays</li>
<li>An ingame encyclopedia in Dune 2000</li>
<li>New Red Alert missions</li>
<li>Community balance changes for all mods</li>
</ul>
<p>Notable changes for mappers and modders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic map reloading in the background</li>
<li>A change to the way speed is calculated for ground units</li>
<li>A new map format which includes the map preview (minimap) in the map versioning (map hash)</li>
<li>Loaders for more audio formats (e.g., mp3 and ogg), and formats used by the remasters</li>
<li>Many linting and documentation updates</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as some other changes worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Toolchain and changes to support the .NET 6 runtime</li>
<li>A massive amount of upgrades to both ingame and client UI</li>
<li>Many more hotkeys became rebindable</li>
<li>Substantial progress towards localisation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a pretty good one too. The upcoming OpenRA version of Tiberian Sun saw plenty of work too, although <em>not</em> ready for release yet, they implemented unit tilting on slopes. It's a small visual feature but another part of what made the Tiberian Sun atmosphere and style so good for the time:</p>

      <title>ProtonPlus is a new in-development Proton version manager</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we already have ProtonUp-Qt which works just fine, it seems another thought they could do it better and differently with Proton version manager <a href="https://github.com/Vysp3r/ProtonPlus" target="_blank">ProtonPlus</a>. For those of your on GNOME desktops, you might like this one more eventually when it's more developed, since it's using GTK.</p>
<p>It's early days yet, with nothing pre-built and a lack of build instructions but it seems like they have a nice idea for it. To help you manage Proton for Steam, Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher and Bottles.</p>

      <title>Amnesia: The Bunker from Frictional Games announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frictional Games have another Amnesia game coming next year with Amnesia: The Bunker that puts a gun in your hand with a single bullet, and it also features a semi-open world.</p>
<p>In a press release they said "For the first time, players are equipped with high levels of freedom to impact gameplay, choosing their playstyle as they explore at will this semi-open world. With hardly any scripted events, and constant tension brought about by an ever-present threat, it is up to each player to finesse their approach to survival.".</p>
<p>Certainly sounds interesting and a major departure from the previous games with "emergent gameplay and sandbox elements" thrown into the mix. You'll be walking through a dark WWI bunker as a French soldier, armed with a revolver gun and a noisy dynamo flashlight.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OxLSsDmtj-U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fac03ee69bb3acff7af79579d3672421.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OxLSsDmtj-U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Player choice - emergent gameplay in a sandbox horror survival experience</li>
<li>Unscripted environment - objects, threats, and resources, change in every playthrough</li>
<li>Adaptive horrid threats - an ever-present gruesome creature that stalks the player.  </li>
<li>Tactile immersion - all-new levels of interaction with the world through puzzle-solving and tool handling</li>
<li>Absorbing yet terrifying tale - experience hell on earth in a fictional appalling story</li>
<li>Engrossing atmosphere and tension - enhanced lighting effects and carefully designed sound effects for a real horror experience. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I reached out to Frictional to see if it will have a Native Linux build like all their previous games, however their official email bounced back and didn't accept it and no reply to a Twitter DM as of yet. So stay tuned. If it doesn't, then hopefully Steam Play Proton will run it nicely.</p>

      <title>Valve are finally fixing buying games on Steam Deck that need a pop-up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's hard to imagine for a lot of people, buying games directly on Steam Deck has been <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/1/3186864655193756275/" target="_blank">broken</a> this long but Valve are finally looking to fix it.</p>
<p>The issue is that certain methods of payment, and probably only in certain countries, require a special pop-up browser window to do some security checks. It was broken at release of the Steam Deck, with an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-update-fixes-buying-games-for-some-touch-input-on-digital-keyboard-theme/" target="_blank">update</a> attempting to fix it back in March, which only fixed it for some.</p>
<p>In a fresh Steam Deck Beta Client <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3647382900914478171" target="_blank">Update</a>, the single note is that it "Fixed Store payment methods which require popup windows for processing not working".</p>
<p>Nice to see but that sure took a lot longer than expected for something so essential. It was frustrating, as every time I forgot it was broken, I then had to wait to buy it on my desktop because it was stuck since it didn't fully go through.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS 3.4 Preview adds support for 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless controller dongle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put out a small and sweet <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3647382450221491185" target="_blank">update</a> for Steam Deck OS (SteamOS) 3.4 Preview, which adds in support for the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2.4g-wireless-controller/" target="_blank">8BitDo Ultimate Wireless</a> controller dongle.</p>
<p>While it already worked in the Bluetooth mode, it didn't without a load of tinkering with the dedicated low-latency dongle. Nice to see Valve move quickly to support third-party pads like this. Must admit my own temptation to pick one up has increased. Seems like a nice controller, especially nice with the back paddles too.</p>

<p>Other additions in the update include rumble support to the built-in hid-steam controller driver and they fixed a USB crash when using certain controllers such as the Hori Fighting Stick α.</p>

      <title>Google are now processing Stadia Hardware refunds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the closing of Stadia fast approaching, Google has already run through plenty of refunds for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/stadia-refunds-are-starting-to-begin-no-word-on-controller-bluetooth-yet/" target="_blank">Stadia game purchases</a> and now they're moving onto Stadia Hardware refunds.</p>
<p>I have now received refunds for all of my Stadia game purchases, and just recently a fresh email entered my inbox from Google about Stadia Hardware. In the email it reiterated the January 18th, 2023 shutdown date and mentioned Google Store purchases of Stadia Hardware will be refunded "within two weeks" (from November 30th). So if you're waiting on the refund, you might want to keep an eye out soon.</p>
<p>For any issues on refunds, you'll get an email on how to proceed with an alternative account to get the money.</p>
<p>Stadia have a bunch of info in <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/12790109" target="_blank">their FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Did you game on Stadia and want to move progress over? So far <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521" target="_blank">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162" target="_blank">I/O Interactive</a>, <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/stadia/sp-technical/issue/1709/where-are-my-game-saves-located-1" target="_blank">CD Projekt Red</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsColourTV/status/1582853316727275522" target="_blank">Rockstar Games</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/10/20/elder-scrolls-online-stadia/" target="_blank">Bethesda</a> have already shared plans on that but it's down to each developer and publisher to sort it.</p>
<p>What a massive shame for a once promising Cloud Gaming service, Google just had no real idea of what they were doing or what the industry actually truly wanted. Thankfully, Cloud Gaming fans still have the likes of GeForce NOW, Xbox Cloud Gaming and Luna.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 update adds VScript and you can now run Linux inside it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not only has Team Fortress 2 been updated but it seems like quite a huge one thanks to the addition of VScript, and you can now run Linux inside it. That's right, TF2 came to Linux back in 2013 and now TF2 itself can run Linux. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>Developer Joshua Ashton, who also works on DXVK and VKD3D-Proton (part of Steam Play Proton) has been busy it seems, helping out with other Valve projects like TF2 adding in VScript which enables map makers to do some pretty wild stuff. Here's the main <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=166703" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implemented VScript
<ul>
<li>VScript allows mappers to embed script code (Squirrel3) into maps. This system is already being used for L4D2 and CS:GO maps.
<ul>
<li>Interface with entities and the world like regular Hammer logic</li>
<li>Simplify things that were previously incredibly complicated/tedious in Hammer logic</li>
<li>Interact with and control bots, bosses, player attributes, entities, and game state closely, allowing for enhanced, modified or entirely custom game modes</li>
<li>React to game events and change the outcome of certain things, such as damage calculations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More technical info about VScript for Team Fortress 2 is available on the Valve Developer Community
<ul>
<li>https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VScript</li>
<li>https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_TF2_Script_Functions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the ability to change the skybox dynamically using the skybox_swapper entity or SetSkyboxTexture</li>
<li>Added support for custom MvM upgrade files packed into the map</li>
<li>Added point_worldtext, an entity that can show text dynamically, with support for multiple SDF (signed distance field) fonts, multiple colors and a rainbow mode</li>
<li>Exposed several movement related ConVars</li>
<li>Implemented support for func_monitor and cameras</li>
<li>Implemented logic_eventlistener for listening to game events from Hammer logic</li>
<li>Added the ability to pass parameters and delay to MvM populator actions</li>
<li>Improved compile time with VRAD</li>
<li>Special thanks to Jakub and everyone on the GitHub VScript Mega Issue for testing, providing feedback, and submitting requests</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Ashton even did a little video, to show Linux running <em>inside</em> Team Fortress 2 and you can find the code behind it on <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/riscv-vscript" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It's quite fascinating, and probably means it won't be long before someone puts Doom inside TF2 if they haven't already somehow.</p>

<p>Want to actually know more about it and what it can possibly do? YouTuber shounic, who I imagine you already know if you're into TF2, did a video on the Beta version of this which you can see below and explains it many times better than I could hope to for you:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA puts out Security Bulletin for various driver issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today put out an official <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5415" target="_blank">Security Bulletin</a>, noting multiple flaws found in their Windows and Linux drivers. The good news is that drivers are already out that fix the problems, which I'll detail below.</p>
<p>Here's all those that affect Linux, brace yourself, there's quite a few of them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34670 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an unprivileged regular user can cause truncation errors when casting a primitive to a primitive of smaller size causes data to be lost in the conversion, which may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42263 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an Integer overflow may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34676 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an out-of-bounds read may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42264 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where an unprivileged regular user can cause the use of an out-of-range pointer offset, which may lead to data tampering, data loss, information disclosure, or denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34674 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where a helper function maps more physical pages than were requested, which may lead to undefined behavior or an information leak.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34678 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where an unprivileged user can cause a null-pointer dereference, which may lead to denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34679 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an unhandled return value can lead to a null-pointer dereference, which may lead to denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34680 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an integer truncation can lead to an out-of-bounds read, which may lead to denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34677 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an unprivileged regular user can cause an integer to be truncated, which may lead to denial of service or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34682 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where an unprivileged regular user can cause a null-pointer dereference, which may lead to denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42257 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow may lead to information disclosure, data tampering or denial of service.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42265 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow may lead to information disclosure or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34684 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an off-by-one error may lead to data tampering or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42254 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an out-of-bounds array access may lead to denial of service, data tampering, or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42258 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow may lead to denial of service, data tampering, or information disclosure.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42255 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an out-of-bounds array access may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42256 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow in index validation may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑34673 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an out-of-bounds array access may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data tampering.</p>
<p>CVE‑2022‑42259 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (nvidia.ko), where an integer overflow may lead to denial of service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a few for NVIDIA VGPU and they affect Tesla too. There's also some that only affect Windows, this isn't a Linux-specific thing but a lot of them are just in their Linux drivers.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the good news is that drivers are already out that solve them. For GeForce users you want minimum driver versions 525.60.11, 515.86.01, 510.108.03, 470.161.03 or 390.157. For RTX, Quadro or NVS you want a minimum driver version of 525.60.11, 515.86.01, 510.108.03, 470.161.03 or 390.157. To put it very simply, if you're not using the very latest NVIDIA drivers in whatever series — update now, all previous versions are vulnerable to the drivers released on November 22nd.</p>
<p>Going by the bulletin page, the issues were public on November 28 but they've seemingly only just actually put out the security bulletin email.</p>

      <title>November&#39;s Steam Survey shows another uptick for Linux thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>November is over which means a fresh Steam Hardware Survey, and it continues the trend we've been seeing with the Linux user share rising and now it's bigger than ever.</p>
<p>At the end of November, Linux hit 1.44% on Steam against 2.45% on macOS and 96.11% on Windows. Going by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a>, where we've been tracking the Linux user share for a few years, it has hit another all-time high. The usual caveat of course: tiny compared to Windows, but the trend towards Linux is clearer than ever.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7184054341669971640gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7184054341669971640gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>This growth is easy to see is largely down to the Steam Deck, with SteamOS 3 being clearly the most popular way to play games on a Linux system now:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 25.77% + 0.79%.</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 10.89% - 1.38%.</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.37% + 0.25%.</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.72% - 0.20%.</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.82% + 0.11%.</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21 64 bit 3.90% + 3.90%.</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.71% + 3.71%.</li>
<li>Other 33.81% - 7.18%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Steam Deck is also the biggest device as a whole for Linux gaming with the AMD Custom GPU 0405 taking 25.77% + 0.76% with the next most popular being the AMD Radeon RX 480 3.75% - 0.15%. It's also interesting to see that SteamOS and the Steam Deck GPU percentages match in the Linux data, along with it not showing up on the Windows data at all making Windows on Steam Deck a tiny minority.</p>
<p><em>Edit: as also pointed out rightly so in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/novembers-steam-survey-shows-another-uptick-for-linux-thanks-to-steam-deck/comment_id=236133" target="_blank">comment</a>, since the Deck GPU shows up now in the combined platform data for all of Steam (AMD Custom GPU 0405 0.37% + 0.05%), we can see that nearly all are on SteamOS.</em></p>

      <title>The best Linux distribution for gaming in 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/the-best-linux-distros-for-gaming-in-2021/" target="_blank">Back in 2020</a> I pointed out what were the best Linux distributions for gaming, so here's the current state and what you should go for in 2023.</p>
<p>The thing is: not a lot has changed since my last article. Linux is still a minefield of many different distributions for people, and it can be very confusing. There's a lot of articles out there recommending really random and outdated distributions in lists too, so here's the real thing.</p>
<p>Without getting bogged down into packaging issues, and just giving you the basics of "this will work just fine" — go and install <strong><a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a></strong>. People will (and I expect them to) argue for others, and people are free to, but a lot of people suggest other distributions for the wrong reasons. Manjaro has too many problems both technical and management, Arch can and will break things if you don't know exactly what you're doing, Fedora is messy with NVIDIA drivers and SELinux on Fedora is a nuisance and so on. Ubuntu is still to this day, the most simple distribution of Linux to install and get gaming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/66409371669912009gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/66409371669912009gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Ubuntu isn't perfect by a long shot, but it remains as my number 1 choice to suggest to people both new and old to get into Linux and get gaming. It's one of the most used on desktop by any statistic you can find, which also means troubleshooting it is generally easier too.</p>
<p>With the Ubuntu LTS (long term support) releases, you also get support for at least 5 years, so you don't have the hassle and potential breakage of major system internal updates for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Valve's own stats show Ubuntu as one of the most popular too and it has been the same since Steam came to Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6792767281669909890gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6792767281669909890gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As a user of Fedora myself, take it from me if you're in any way new to Linux: just go with Ubuntu. If you ever decide you "really know Linux now", then you can think about using something else. Don't make it difficult for yourself.</p>
<p>How might this change in future?</p>
<p>Well, Valve are here with the Steam Deck and SteamOS. Eventually, Valve will release SteamOS 3 so anyone can download it and install it. That might end up being a good pick, but right now it's not on the table as it's not released and anyone making their own version of it (like HoloISO and others) are too small to recommend serious use of them.</p>
<p>If you need help and support, specifically for Linux and also Steam Deck gaming, you can try asking in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/" target="_blank">Forum</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/0rxBtcSOonvGzXr4" target="_blank">Discord</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/irc/" target="_blank">IRC</a> and <a href="https://t.me/linux_gaming" target="_blank">Telegram</a>.</p>

      <title>Mesa 22.3 open source graphics drivers released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 22.3 is the latest and greatest the open source community has to offer for graphics drivers, and it's now available with lots of improvements. Announced <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2022-November/225898.html" target="_blank">yesterday</a>, the open source drivers cover the likes of AMD, Intel, ARM and more on Linux.</p>
<p>For people concerned about stability and bugs, it's always best to wait at least for the first point release update to it like 22.3.1.</p>
<p>Newly supported extensions and features in Mesa 22.3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GL_ARB_shader_clock on llvmpipe</li>
<li>VK_KHR_shader_clock on lavapipe</li>
<li>Mesa-DB, the new single file cache type</li>
<li>VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_layout on RADV, lavapipe</li>
<li>VK_KHR_global_priority on RADV</li>
<li>GL_KHR_blend_equation_advanced_coherent on zink</li>
<li>VK_EXT_load_store_op_none on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_mutable_descriptor_type on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float on lvp</li>
<li>VK_EXT_shader_atomic_float2 on lvp</li>
<li>GL_NV_shader_atomic_float on llvmpipe</li>
<li>VK_EXT_image_robustness on v3dv</li>
<li>VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 on lavapipe</li>
<li>VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 on RADV &amp; anv</li>
<li>VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness on v3dv</li>
<li>Mali T620 on Panfrost</li>
<li>Shader disk cache on Panfrost</li>
<li>Support for R8G8B8, B8G8R8, R16G16B16 and 64-bit vertex buffer formats on RADV</li>
<li>Initial GFX11/RDNA3 support on RADV</li>
<li>Various ray tracing optimizations on RADV</li>
<li>ExtendedDynamicState2PatchControlPoints on RADV (VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state2 feature)</li>
<li>Radeon Raytracing Analyzer integration (using RADV_RRA_* environment variables)</li>
<li>OpenGL 4.5 on freedreno/a6xx (up from 3.3)</li>
<li>VK_EXT_mesh_shader on ANV</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>RADV = AMD Vulkan Driver</li>
<li>ANV = Intel Vulkan Driver</li>
<li>Panfrost = Arm Mali Driver</li>
<li>V3DV = Raspberry Pi 4 Driver</li>
<li>Lavapipe = A CPU-based Software Vulkan driver </li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Hopefully, later this month, I'll be looking to buy one of the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/amd-announce-rx-7900-xtx-and-rx-7900-xt-plus-fsr3-teased/" target="_blank">AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</a> so I can finally see what Mesa is like myself to use on desktop. </p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 is approaching release, future plans detailed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine 4.0 is so close now, with an overhauled and powerful Vulkan rendering system and now their developers have a new <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/release-management-4-0-and-beyond" target="_blank">blog post</a> up detailing some plans.</p>
<p>Right now they consider it "finally ready for production use" (but it's not out just yet) and they're keen to point out that "bugs and issues are inevitable" so regular bug fix releases will go up after. In the post from developer Clay John they point out that they do expect "users will encounter workflow-breaking bugs (especially on less common hardware), many workflows will feel unpolished, and performance won’t quite reach the goals we have set" which again follow-up releases will help clean up.</p>
<p>The good news is that for follow-up feature update release like 4.1, 4.2 and so on they plan to speed things up with quicker release cycles. For each big point release they will start merging new features, transition over to a period for just bug fixes, a release and then return back to merging in new features again. So they will get into a particular rhythm that should result in plenty of updates without such a long time in between.</p>
<p>For the first major point release in 4.1, they plan to focus on "stability, performance improvements, and usability".</p>
<p>When 4.0 does release, they say the Godot 3.5 "will remain the much more stable and battle-tested option" and they advise to continue using 3.5 until at least some of the 4.x releases.</p>
<p>So with the regular 4.0 Betas being released, they're getting it out the door when "it is ready to be used in production, not when it is perfect".</p>

<p>After many years of development and going through multiple different names like Subvein, Mutant Factions and Gene Shift — the online mode has gone free to play as Gene Shift Auto. Offering a lot of fun for the price of nothing, this Native Linux game is inspired by Grand Theft Auto 2 for a lot of it.</p>
<p>There is a single-player (with co-op) that's a paid DLC but the main part of it being the online mode has been set free in Early Access.</p>
<p>Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CMrdRiQ0A_0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce173e71cdb1aab67e6b3cb55266f44c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CMrdRiQ0A_0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gene Shift Auto has been in development since 2009, starting off as a hobby project under the name Subvein. When it was Greenlit for a Steam release in 2014, the sole developer - Ben Johnson of Nik Nak Studios - decided to take the game full-time. Sydney is expensive though, so he quit his job and set off to code in cheap youth hostels around the world, including 18 months living in Peru. This cheaper lifestyle allowed Ben to just scrape by and launch Gene Shift onto Steam Early Access on May 23rd, 2017. Now back in Sydney, Ben is finishing up the game in preparation for the full release.</p>

      <title>Two Point Campus: Space Academy announced for December 6th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Campus: Space Academy is the first expansion for the popular university building sim from the makers of Two Point Hospital. Releasing on December 6th it brings with it a whole universe of new features including three stellar campus locations, six student archetypes to welcome aboard, six far-out courses and classrooms and more.</p>
<p>Starting off in Universe City, you need to rebuild Two Point County's defunct space program and eventually sees you take up base on a suspiciously cheesy asteroid, and pillage it of its natural (and delicious) resources.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B1soHdxPLn4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ba34c479350e496cb7b5933643535ff.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B1soHdxPLn4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New classrooms like the Command Room will give your students the confidence to set phasers to stun, while the Battle Space will turn up the heat and let students duke it out with energy batons. You’ll need to attract (out of this) world class talent to fill your campus not only with burgeoning astronauts and space knights, but also alien students with a thirst for the forbidden knowledge of the galaxy...such as how Cheesy Gubbins are made.</p>
<p>It’s not a college without a party, and students will have ample opportunities with new events like hosting a sci-fi convention in your student union, watching the cosmic king of rock’n’roll, or joining a brand-new club with a time traveling twist. Two Point Campus is a charming university management simulator that tasks players with building and running the university campus of their dreams. From designing stylish dormitories to laying down ornamental pathways and gardens, players are given the freedom to pimp their Campus with new and easy-to-use creative tools to build their own educational masterpiece.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Releasing on December 6th for $9.99 / €9.99 / £8.99.</p>
<p>You can buy Two Point Campus on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/two-point-campus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1649080/Two_Point_Campus/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<li>An improved local authority action window which now shows you actions you can’t afford, instead of hiding them.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, some new tools are available to AI and Game Script authors:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Scriptable league tables which can replace the default scoring system.</li>

      <title>Portal with RTX releases on December 8th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lightspeed Studios and NVIDIA have announced that the Portal with RTX free DLC will be release on December 8th. It's only been announced with a Windows build, so for Linux you'll need to run it with Proton.</p>
<p>As a reminder: this is NVIDIA attempting to bring another little showcase example, like they did with Quake II RTX, although that one actually had a Native Linux build. It's free for owners of Portal with it adding in full ray tracing, new, hand-crafted hi-res physically based textures, and new, enhanced high-poly models. It also includes support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AZHBl5yWqJk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3884cf9fdd1738bfb1764726c4ec41f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AZHBl5yWqJk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This was made possible with their RTX Remix modding platform, that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/nvidia-announces-ada-lovelace-their-3rd-generation-rtx-dlss-3-and-portal-rtx/" target="_blank">announced back in September</a> that makes use of DXVK to do a Vulkan conversion.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.5.0 is out with Downloads Manager, App Sideloading</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> v2.5.0 is out now for managing GOG and Epic Games Store, this new release has some pretty exciting features like sideloading.</p>
<p>The first big new addition is the Downloads Manager, allowing you to queue up many downloads. You can't yet change the download order, but it's a great start for a very useful feature.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2010961841669736038gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2010961841669736038gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can also now sideload anything. Heroic is no longer just for GOG and Epic Games. This means you can add any game or application on your PC, to launch inside Heroic. Not just that, Heroic is also now a Wine manager, allowing you to add and install various Windows-only games, launchers and more. It will even use SteamGridDB to pull in app images if it finds one for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17509371261669736161gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17509371261669736161gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>HowLongToBeat data was also added to game pages, if it can find it. So as you go through your library, you can see how long it might take you to play through. Another useful addition.</p>
<p>Other improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An option to automatically add new game installs to Steam.</li>
<li>Custom Theme support.</li>
<li>Notify you if the installed game is not available (e.g. from a drive not plugged in).</li>
<li>Show unsupported games - like Star Wars Squadrons on Epic not being supported as it needs EA app.</li>
<li>Improved performance in the UI in general, so some pages load without any delay now like the Game Page and the Install Modal.</li>
<li>Better online/offline system so Heroic can handle better when no network is available.</li>
<li>GamePad navigation was redone so now the Library Cards do not show any button and also the commands were changed to work exactly like the SteamOS for better familiarity.</li>
<li>Changelog will now be shown after Heroic is updated (or by clicking on Heroic Version on Sidebar), so you will be aware of all new features for that new release.</li>
<li>Login Screen was redesigned for a more modern look.</li>
<li>Added two new themes: Nord Light and Nord Dark.</li>
<li>It is now possible to force an installation even if Heroic detects no space left on the device.</li>
<li>Heroic will show a warning in case you are not logged in to a store and try to access it from the sidebar.</li>
<li>Updated Legendary and Electron to the latest versions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a little demo of how useful it is on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>OpenRGB v0.8 adds support of a ton more devices to control RGB lights on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://openrgb.org/" target="_blank">OpenRGB</a> is a stellar open source project that aims to allow you to deal with all the various RGB lights your hardware comes with, as most vendors don't have apps for Linux. It's cross-platform so it works across Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>It's great not just because vendors don't support Linux officially (usually), but some vendors are often slow to update their apps and this puts them all under one roof instead of needing many apps for different lights.</p>
<p>Version 0.8 is out now and it's a big one. New features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Translation support
<ul>
<li>Automatically detect language from OS or manually select in settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UI cleanup, frames around UI elements</li>
<li>Automatic udev rules generation</li>
<li>Improved AMD ADL I2C driver to support more AMD GPUs on Windows</li>
<li>Option to enable SMBus mutex in Windows for compatibility with other hardware management and RGB software that accesses SMBus.</li>
<li>Switched from inpout32 to WinRing0 low level access library. inpout32 is a great library, but Valorant's garbage anti-cheat attacks it while it is fine with WinRing0.
<ul>
<li>It is safe to remove inpout32.dll, you can follow the instructions here: <a href="https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/issues/669" target="_blank">#669</a> to do so.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More Intel chipsets added to Intel SMBus detection</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that, a ton of new devices have been added in including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many additional GPUs added to existing GPU controllers:
<ul>
<li>ASUS Aura GPU (Legacy)</li>

      <title>Stellaris 3.6 &#39;Orion&#39; is a big free update to many parts of the game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have put out the latest free update to their grand space strategy game Stellaris, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/281990/announcements/detail/3516777336839176007?snr=1_2108_9__2107" target="_blank">3.6 "Orion" update</a> is less about new content and more about improving the game.</p>
<p>It does still have a small sprinkle of new content though like the new Galaxy Shapes including a 3 Arm Spiral Galaxy, 6 Arm Spiral Galaxy, Barred Galaxy, Starburst Galaxy, Cartwheel Galaxy and a Spoked Galaxy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6095473251669724596gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6095473251669724596gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - the new Spoked Galaxy type.</em></p>
<p>Other changes include new textures and shaders for Reanimated Leviathans, the ability for Hive Minds to choose a variation on the Reanimators Civic from the Necroids Species Pack and a fleet combat rebalance to address these issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Artillery Battleships dominate the late-game</li>
<li>Disengagement mechanics favor artillery battleships</li>
<li>Destroyers and Cruisers have extremely limited uses once the next ship size is unlocked</li>
<li>Command Limits are ineffective</li>
<li>Doomstacks aren’t fun</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>They also reworked how the Ascension Paths from Utopia work, as well as added a new ascension path. There's a new Spiritualist Federation type to the specialized federation types from Federations, and added a new “Politics” tradition tree, which also requires Federations.</p>
<p>Additionally they added in new Orbital Ring buildings, which are included with the Overlord expansion.</p>
<p>For the base game they've added a new relic, accessibility improvements, new first contact events, included terraforming candidates on the galaxy map, added a new event chain, and tweaked some empire modifiers.</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a GOG release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fans of GOG and adventure games will be happy, as the new <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/return_to_monkey_island" target="_blank">Return to Monkey Island</a> is now available on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/return_to_monkey_island" target="_blank">GOG</a>. The release comes with the Native Linux build too. Probably one of the most highly rated games of the year too, nice to see it didn't take long to come to other stores.</p>
<p>Released originally on September 19th, it gained the Native Linux build on October 25th.</p>
<p>Here's the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QW9NWLYhD00"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9b54529f30b433b2f751d1cf70f5e260.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QW9NWLYhD00" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>

      <title>Steam Client Beta update has a few more New Big Picture Mode fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continues working towards replacing the old Big Picture Mode with the UI from the Steam Deck, a few more fixes are in the new Steam Client Beta.</p>
<p>They still haven't fixed <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8916" target="_blank">the bug</a> of it now not working at all on NVIDIA though, hopefully they will get to that before deciding to replace it completely. Quite annoying though, as I can't test it at all on my desktop now.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in the November 28th <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3504392437880389332" target="_blank">update</a>:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Linux driver 525.60.11 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today rolled out the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/196736/en-uk" target="_blank">525.60.11 driver</a>, following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/nvidia-52553-beta-is-out-now-for-linux/" target="_blank">525.53 Beta</a> earlier this month. It is largely the same as the Beta, with a few extra fixes included and since it's not tagged as a Beta driver you should be all fine to upgrade to it.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog, with the additions in this new release added in bold:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Dynamic Boost to not engage on certain Ampere GPU based notebooks.</li>
<li>Added support for Dynamic Boost on notebooks with AMD CPUs.</li>
<li><strong>Improved the performance of PRIME render-offloaded applications.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fixed a regression that prevented Warp &amp; Blend from working correctly.</strong></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that resulted in stutter when moving windows in GNOME.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless extension.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to prevent the creation of display layouts that exceed hardware size limitations when using the SLI Mosaic configuration page, and to display a warning if such a layout is created manually in the Display Configuration page.</li>
<li>Removed the hard dependency on GTK 2 when building nvidia-settings from source. nvidia-settings may now be built with support for GTK 2 only, GTK 3 only, or both GTK 2 and GTK 3.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed a bug which caused suspend to fail on systems running GNOME 3 as a Wayland compositor with NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations enabled.</strong></li>
<li>Updated the open kernel modules to support Quadro Sync, Stereo, rotation in X11, and YUV 4:2:0 on Turing.</li>
<li>Updated an error message that nvidia-installer displays when kernel header files cannot be found to print full paths for the missing files.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to use "command -v" in place of depending on"which" to determine the availability and location of certain tools.</li>
<li>Implemented support for over-the-air updates in the Proton and Wine NVIDIA NGX build. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Updated the Vulkan driver so that the following extensions no longer depend on nvidia-uvm.ko being loaded at runtime:
<ul>
<li>* VK_KHR_acceleration_structure<br/>
* VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_query<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline<br/>
* VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur<br/>
* VK_NVX_binary_import<br/>
* VK_NVX_image_view_handle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow use of the "--add-this-kernel" feature by non-root users.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a more accurate progress bar when building the kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a warning message if a Vulkan ICD loader is not detected.</li>
<li>Reworked nvidia-installer's support for DKMS: the kernel modules willnow be optionally registered with DKMS after the installer has already built and installed them on its own. nvidia-installer will now register the kernel modules with DKMS by default when the dkms(8) utility is detected on the system.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption ingeometry and tessellation control shaders.</li>
<li>Added a new CUDA Debugger implementation for Pascal and newer architectures as a part of the driver package: libcudadebugger.so (previously released separately as "CUDA GDB Developer Preview").</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-settings to find incorrect fan speedranges on some GPUs.  Lower-level layers of the driver protected the hardware from programming incorrect fan speeds, so the symptom was only incorrect reporting.  Now, reporting in nvidia-settings matches what actually gets programmed in hardware.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs whenstarting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crashwith Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Half-Life: Alyx LEVITATION mod adds four hours of new story - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life: Alyx LEVITATION is an incredibly ambitious mod for Valve's amazing VR FPS and it's out now! To this day, Alyx remains as one of my all time favourite gaming experiences and so I've been eagerly awaiting more of it with this free expansive mod.</p>
<p>What it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New story (3-4 hours in length).</li>
<li>New voicelines.</li>
<li>New character animations.</li>
<li>Eight challenging levels.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>LEVITATION starts right after the official story: Alyx returns to City-17, and teams up with Russell once again. During her absence, a mysterious levitating building appeared in the Sector X region of City-17. Two key members of the resistance named Barry and Maya decided to infiltrate and investigate Sector X -- until their signal went quiet... Now, Alyx must save her friends, and possibly the whole resistance.<br/>
<br/>
See the launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ualjhzxufpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c863e1ba8dcff26d70e37532b46a623.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ualjhzxufpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can grab it from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2881604879" target="_blank">Steam Workshop</a>. It comes in 5 parts due to the size but you can subscribe to all at once.</p>
<p>Currently, it seems there's a bug where the AI can break at an excavator section. The developers are working on an official fix but there is a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830812479" target="_blank">workaround</a> you can use.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, Valve have still not fixed the issue with Alyx <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/332" target="_blank">not launching</a> on Linux with a "Timed out waiting for response from Mongoose" error that's been around since 2020. Thankfully, a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/332#issuecomment-1272934934" target="_blank">workaround</a> of temporarily disabling ipv6 enables it to launch again and I can confirm LEVITATION appears to work fine on Linux with Proton.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.22 out now with more 32bit on 64bit work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.22" target="_blank">Wine 7.22</a> development release is now available for the open source Windows compatibility layer, as they continue working towards the Wine 8.0 release. This is part of Steam Play Proton, which allows you to play tons of Windows games on Steam Deck and Linux desktops. Once a year they make a big new stable release, and eventually Proton updates to it too.</p>
<p>Here's the highlights of Wine 7.22:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>32-on-64 thunks for both Vulkan and OpenGL.</li>
<li>OpenLDAP library bundled and built as PE.</li>
<li>Support for the RAW print processor in WinPrint.</li>
<li>More progress on the long types printf format conversion.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>JSAUX release &#39;CaseKiller&#39; for the official Steam Deck Dock to help with protective cases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have the official Steam Deck Docking Station and find your Steam Deck doesn't fit in it with a protective case on? JSAUX are back with another new product, the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/anti-slip-stand-for-steam-deck-dock-sg0104" target="_blank">CaseKiller Anti-Slip Stand</a>.</p>
<p>I wonder where they got that naming from huh? Announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1596178599580561409" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the idea comes from a complaint that I saw quite often on Reddit when the official Docking Station arrived — people had to take off their protective casing to fit it in, otherwise it would just sit of rest on top and not exactly safe as it could easily be knocked out.</p>
<p>This new little attachment works as a stand by itself, or it can slot over the official Docking Station to have your Steam Deck sat nicely with it. Seems like it's quite a useful addition to their various Steam Deck accessory line-up.</p>

<p>They say it's "compatible with almost all cases".</p>

      <title>Cyberspace hacking looter-shooter Black Ice gets a big content upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Ice is an indie first-person looter-shooter about hacking in cyberspace, I'm quite fond of it but it's not very well known even though it's a lot of fun. A big new update just rolled out with a bunch of extra content.</p>
<p>You run around hacking these big servers, that each have a different difficulty rating. When you start hacking, you have to start within the hacking zone and defeat the various enemies that appear. It gets seriously frantic and it has grown dramatically since I last took a look. The various weapon types are seriously fun to use as well.</p>
<p>In this new update it adds in multiple new enemy types, new types of servers to hack including one that will damage you if you leave the hacking area, new weapons, performance improvements, player nameplates in multiplayer, tons of new additions to the world and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/311800/discussions/0/5855270367462437746/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" target="_blank">more</a>. They also have a new trailer below:</p>

<p>You can find Black Ice on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/black-ice?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/311800/Black_Ice/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Seems like the version on <a href="https://superdupergc.itch.io/blackice" target="_blank">itch.io</a> is quite out of date.</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper adds new cave types and little critters to make exploration more interesting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dome Keeper is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/dome-keeper-is-a-nice-twist-on-base-tower-defense/" target="_blank">one of my favourite</a> indie releases this year, blending together casual underground mining with frantic base-defence and a new update just rolled out making it even more interesting.</p>
<p>One of the problems with the initial release, was that the underground mining wasn't as interesting as it could have been. This update should help a bit there with the addition of 4 new cave types and little critters that roam around in the mines. With the new caves you can make tunnels in all directions, expand your vision, improve your bedrock scanner to see beyond and even unleash a caged squid.</p>
<p>New trailer is below:</p>

<p>You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> with the <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dome_keeper?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> version only being for Windows.</p>
<p><em>I'm looking forward to checking out the new content, once I eventually finish Mass Effect 3 (Legendary Edition) that I've been powering through on Steam Deck (with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/how-to-fix-the-ea-app-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">my EA app fix</a>).</em></p>

      <title>SCS Software celebrate 25 years with a mini-documentary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator? Two very popular games that SCS Software have been upgrading for a long time now, and they're celebrating their 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>It's a little hard to believe that games about driving cross-country in trucks are as popular as they are, with both games regularly seeing multiple tens of thousands of people playing at the same time on Steam.</p>
<p>To celebrate the occasion, SCS made made a little documentary. In their <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/11/a-trip-down-memory-lane.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they said it was originally only supposed to be shared internally for their team but they " realized that all dedicated fans in the #BestCommunityEver may appreciate getting a glimpse of the memories of some important moments in the history of our company". You can check it out below, and it's 45 minutes long so you might want to grab a brew.</p>

      <title>System76 tease the new Launch Heavy keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a fancy new keyboard from a Linux vendor that makes their own? System76 are adding the Launch Heavy to their line-up that includes a full NumPad.</p>
<p>They've put up a <a href="https://system76.com/accessories/launch-heavy-teaser" target="_blank">teaser website</a>, which gives some of the details on what to expect from it. Just like the previous two models, it will be fully customizable with their open source Keyboard Configurator app. Considering the excellent build quality of the original Launch Keyboard <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/the-system76-launch-configurable-keyboard-is-tiny-sturdy-and-very-slick/" target="_blank">that I reviewed</a>, I have high hopes for this one and the full size is great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1898128991669403850gol1.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center"> </p>
<p>From the public details the chassis continues to be open source, it has a detachable bar on the bottom to lift it up at an angle, it has an open source PCB design, RGB LED lighting that you can customize, a few different types of switches you can choose from, 2 × USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type C (Up to 10 Gbps), 2 × USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A (Up to 10 Gbps) and open source firmware.</p>
<p>Certainly sounds like something great. What do you think?</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher for GOG and Epic Games v2.5.0 Beta 3 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Probably one of my favourite open source projects, Heroic Games Launcher helps you manage your GOG and Epic Games accounts on Linux and Steam Deck. A big new release is getting closer, with <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.5.0-beta.3" target="_blank">v2.5.0 Beta 3</a> out now integrating How Long to Beat data.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/247425131669381087gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/247425131669381087gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Sounds like a really useful addition, and something I often want to know before starting a game is how long it is so it will be thoroughly useful for me.</p>
<p>What's new in V2.5.0 Beta 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Integrated How Long to Beat data on GamePage</li>
<li>Downloads manager now will add uploads to the list as well and had UI improvements as well</li>
<li>The interface when using a joystick should be more seamless and follow the same controls as the SteamDeck UI.</li>
<li>Heroic will detect if the game folder installed on an External Drive/SDCard is available or not and change it is status to not installed, just like Steam Deck behaves after removing the SDCard, for instance.</li>
<li>Improved how Heroic gets the saves path for cloud sync saves.</li>
<li>[Linux] Added a checkbox to use the default wine settings when installing a game.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Heroic could not install VKD3D correctly</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where autosaves sync was not working when launching games from Steam.</li>
<li>Updated Legendary to the latest version.</li>
<li>Added some performance improvements, especially on the game page and install dialog.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's not fully ready yet, there are some noted issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Not available games still being ordered along with installed games.</li>
<li>Importing games from GameCard does not change the status to installed.</li>
<li>Not available games still shows the update icon.</li>
<li>HowLongToBeat date does not return anything if the game title has some characters like for trademark or copyrights.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Europa Universalis IV is now finally available on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After many years being released on Steam back in 2013, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/europa_universalis_iv" target="_blank">Europa Universalis IV</a> from Paradox has finally arrived on game store <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>. So for those of you who prefer it, for their DRM-free stance, now is your time.</p>
<p>This classic grand strategy game gives you control of a nation through four dramatic centuries. Rule your land and dominate the world with unparalleled freedom, depth and historical accuracy. Write a new history of the world and build an empire for the ages. During GOG's Black Friday sale, it's also 80% off, so seems like a good time to grab a copy.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KviqRb6vHfk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ecf58da4af6aa9736b7b3a7002e48dd9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KviqRb6vHfk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep Historical Settings - Start before the Renaissance on a map of the world as it was then. Choose from any of hundreds of nations and then rule up to the Age of Revolutions. Or, if you wish, start your game at any date in the span, with historical monarchs and other leaders.</li>
<li>History come to life - Hundreds of dynamic historical events are yours to experience, from merely troubling civil wars to world changing moments like the Protestant Reformation. Discover and settle the New World, or resist European conquest.</li>
<li>Fill your pockets - Control the flow of trade by developing your trade power in key provinces, using ships and governmental policy to bring the wealth of the world to your own ports.</li>
<li>War and Peace - Build alliances into iron bonds, cemented by royal marriage or play a flexible hand, keeping your options open. Strike when your enemies are weak, using your armies to grab new land and new potential riches.</li>
<li>Good rulers, good times - Your nation’s pace of development will be heavily influenced by the person on the throne. Experience rapid development under a skilled monarch only to see things slow down when a less competent heir takes over. Plan for the future by spending monarch power wisely.</li>
<li>Scientific revolution - Four hundred years of research into new ways of war, administration and trade are available. Unlock new weapons, new buildings and new ship types. Over time, you can embrace national ideas that represent both your historic legacy and your ambitions for the future.</li>
<li>From grand voyages of discovery to religious wars to revolutionary governments, the entire history of the early modern world waits for you to rewrite it in Europa Universalis IV.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also quite a <em>lot</em> of DLC, which you can see on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20221123_launch_europa_universalis_iv" target="_blank">main page</a>.</p>

      <title>Quiet survival adventure Aquamarine got a big free Explorer&#39;s Edition upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aquamarine has some great artwork but it seems the initial release didn't stick with a lot of people, which hopefully the new free Explorer's Edition upgrade will solve. The developers said they have "listening to our players' comments since the game initially released in January 2022, and have brought their feedback and suggestions to this huge, game-changing update".</p>
<p>What's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Overall <strong>difficulty has been refined and balanced for multiple game modes</strong>, including NORMAL, RELAXED, EXPLORE, and EXPERT</li>
<li><strong>New game mode EXPLORE</strong> introduces the option to safely experience the world &amp; story without consequences</li>
<li><strong>New game mode EXPERT </strong>introduces a "hardcore" difficulty option for those looking for a serious test of their survival skills and knowledge of the planet's ecosystem</li>
<li>A <strong>brand-new save system</strong> has been added, giving players three individual save slots to load and reset as they wish</li>
<li>Multiple <strong>accessibility options</strong> have been added, including an optional tool-tip system that explains the functions of each of control</li>
<li>New <strong>environment art and creature animations</strong> have been added to each exploration area</li>
<li><strong>Localization</strong> has been added in English, French, Spanish, Chinese (Simplified), and Thai</li>
<li><strong>Full gamepad support</strong> has been added</li>
<li>Plus tons of bug fixes, polish updates, performance optimizations, and much more...</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Next-Gen update to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with FSR 2.1 should be fun for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, in case you haven't heard, is getting a free next-gen update releasing on December 14th and it might make it even better on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While it is already Steam Deck Verified, a few additions to the new version sound like they might improve it. The big one is FSR 2.1, which should allow you to get some better performance and battery life with it. It's worked wonders for other games, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0Bgy5Eabw" target="_blank">Dying Light 2</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvuDVGMPQNk" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Another nice addition is the ability to scale up subtitles, dialogue text and NPC chatter (things all games should have!).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Eqvcbfsk8IU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e72e3b43753c1992873acd4d5c00abe7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Eqvcbfsk8IU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's been announced includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved visuals - Ray Tracing, improved Screen Space Reflections, improved foliage, better textures and more visual improvements are coming to the game. Enjoy them to the fullest thanks to FSR 2.1 and DLSS 3 support!</li>
<li>Camera, controls and UI changes - Rediscover the Continent from a new perspective — we've added an alternative camera option that'll bring you closer to the action. Combined with the alternative Quick Sign Casting option, map filtering and the option to dynamically hide the minimap, it will make exploration even more exciting than before!</li>
<li>Photo mode - Capture the moment with the added photo mode! Does that mean there will be a The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt photo mode contest in the near future? Maybe.</li>
<li>Integrated mods - We've included some community-made favourites in addition to our own modifications.</li>
<li>Quest fixes - You've been asking for them — and we couldn't say no! The next-gen update has also been an opportunity to revisit some of the issues in the quests. The free next-gen update brings fixes to <em>From Ofier's Distant Shores</em>, <em>Scavenger Hunt: Wolf School Gear</em> and more!</li>
<li>Netflix DLC -We have a very special treat for all of the fans of the Netflix show! Enjoy alternative looks for Dandelion and Nilfgaardian soldiers, as well as a new quest, inspired by the show, where you'll be able to get diagrams for new equipment for Geralt. What's the quest? Shhh! No spoilers!</li>
<li>Cross-progression - A feature you know from Cyberpunk 2077 — play the game how you like, wherever you like and carry over your latest save between platforms.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe I'll finally do a full play-through thanks to all these additions coming. Sounds quite exciting! Nice to see that's it's going to be a free update too, not some kind of "remastered" edition you have to pay extra for.</p>

      <title>Tower-defense base-building mining game Lumencraft adds procedural maps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lumencraft is a really interesting game that blends together elements of tower-defense, base-building, mining and a little Deep Rock Galactic in a top-down view. A big new release is out now and it's Steam Deck Verified with Native Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8376991151669293033gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8376991151669293033gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the new version include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>​​​​​​Procedural maps: from baked handcrafted maps to 100% procedurally generated roguelike levels!</li>
<li>New Weapon: Lumenal Discharger - a dramatic armament charged with a lightning beam.</li>
<li>Balance changes:many costs changed from metal to Lumen, requirements added for some upgrades (eg. have a building placed)</li>
<li>New Steam achievements: unlock 80 new achievements - some are easy and some are tricky!</li>
<li>New languages: the game is now available in French, Spanish and Russian.</li>
<li>Improvements and fixes: various UI, VFX, and sound changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been loving watching this one grow, it scratches multiple gaming itches at the same time but the lack of variety in the levels was a downside they've now nicely solved so you can play fresh each time. A full release is planned next year, and their roadmap suggests they will add online multiplayer if its enough of a success to fund it.</p>
<p>My main issue with it currently, is that in full-screen it doesn't cover the KDE Plasma menu at the bottom. A little annoying on desktop but not a problem on Steam Deck of course.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/lumencraft?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713810/Lumencraft/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE has a fundraiser for all their work like the Plasma desktop (used by Steam Deck)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE have put up a <a href="https://kde.org/bluefriday/" target="_blank">new fundraising platform</a>, with an aim to make it easier for people to donate with a tongue-in-cheek anti-black-friday event they're calling Blue Friday.</p>
<p>Developer Nate Graham mentioned in a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2022/11/23/a-better-fundraising-platform/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that their previous way of raising funds was split between two platforms, one for single donations and a totally different one for reoccurring donations. They've now put up a new one that allows you to specify if your donation is one time, monthly or annually.</p>
<p>The donations will go towards all their work in things like the Plasma desktop environment, that Valve ships for the desktop mode on the Steam Deck, Plasma Mobile for phones and tablets, all the various KDE apps like the Dolphin file manage or KDE Connect and much more.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will be a success, as KDE have been going from strength to strength lately and they're currently hiring for a <a href="https://ev.kde.org/resources/callforproposals-platform2022/" target="_blank">Software Platform Engineer</a> to work on many different parts of the KDE system as a whole.</p>
<p>The fundraiser has a current goal of €15,000.</p>

      <title>WW1 FPS &#39;Isonzo&#39; is getting a free expansion on December 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Isonzo from M2H, BlackMill Games is set to get bigger on December 5th, with the release of a free expansion featuring the Germans.</p>
<p>The Caporetto expansion for Isonzo will be free, with an option for players to expand their visual customization options for the German Empire with the Royal Units DLC. As per their roadmap, this is one of three expansions that are planned and all will be free. They have multiple new maps planned to be added in too, along with a new game mode planned next year.</p>
<p>Here's the expansion teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w58hPwegk1I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cfb75e8dd023abc1af26734175b76b4e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w58hPwegk1I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Wow, that was sure a <em>teaser</em> huh? </p>
<p>The full complement of Isonzo classes are represented in the new German Empire faction including the Mountaineer, with uniforms, weapons and equipment based on historical research to authentically recreate the German army as it was on the Italian Front. They're a fully fledged fighting force consisting of the previously revealed Stoßtrupp and the Rifleman, amongst others, and are ready to take the fight to the Italian defenders of Monte Kolovrat – the first of three maps to be added as part of the Battle of Caporetto Offensive.</p>
<p>Jos Hoebe, Creative Director and co-founder of the WW1 Game Series says: “We’re looking forward to releasing the free Caporetto expansion for Isonzo this December 5 – the first of several free updates we have planned. It expands Isonzo to cover more of the key aspects of the war on the Italian Front, adding both German Empire troops and the first part of a new German Offensive.”</p>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 2 has a Native Linux port available now, more stable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As promised recently, Rogue Legacy 2 from Cellar Door Games now has a Native Linux version available to give you the best experience possible on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck, the Windows version with Proton was suffering from crashing issues that the new Native Linux version should solve. You will need to opt into this manually in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu and select the Steam Linux Runtime.</p>
<p>"Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be a Ranger. She could also be vegan. It’s a new experience every time. Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4VFRTUxPIwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77ae6b365edfac51ccdeedba90f53b99.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4VFRTUxPIwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Have to admit, not only is it a great action-platformer metroidvania but it also has a little comedic flair thrown in too. Can't tell you the amount of laughs I had when an heir's ability was "Super IBS" that enabled them to fart, allowing higher jumps and it was as amusing as expected.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9350650551669222840gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9350650551669222840gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In my time playing it, I can confirm it's another quality port. The only weird issue I encountered was a Stadia Controller forcing the camera to pan upwards, but it was fine with keyboard and an Xbox controller. Admittedly that's going to be a very tiny amount of people seeing it. Other than that, very smooth and stable across both desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Enjoy the challenge in games like Dead Cells? You'll probably like this a lot too.</p>
<p>On desktop with Fedora, as expected it's silky smooth on max settings. On Steam Deck, keeping it to 40Hz (45Hz in the below video though, as my monitor doesn't work with 40Hz) resulted in a smooth experience too, along with some great battery life. Another quality title not to be missed.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253920/Rogue_Legacy_2/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and it's 25% off in the Autumn Sale.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VI gets a &#39;Leader Pass&#39;, breaks it on Linux and macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games recently launched their new Leader Pass for Sid Meier's Civilization VI, and it seems they broke it on both macOS and Linux.</p>
<p>The Linux and macOS versions were done by Aspyr Media, who don't really do ports any more. The store page on Steam still shows both as clearly supported though, and the new Leader Pass indicates both are supported platforms too. However, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/289070/discussions/0/340412628172881722/" target="_blank">macOS</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/289070/discussions/0/144512942755435118/" target="_blank">Linux</a> support topics on Steam are filling up with people reporting the game is now broken or has major issues on these platforms.</p>
<p>For the Linux version, it seems the update actually <em>downgraded</em> the game to a much older version "1.0.1.104" (I was able to use an old <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/04/civilization-vi-has-a-final-free-update-of-the-season-hinting-at-more/" target="_blank">workaround</a> - see the bottom, to get it to launch) with the latest being 1.0.12.9. Even for people on macOS who have managed workarounds, some are reporting other major <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/289070/discussions/0/340412628172881722/?ctp=265#c3589960830785074484" target="_blank">problems</a> like Civ Vi eating all their RAM.</p>
<p>At least for Linux users, a workaround is to use Proton on it to run the Windows version. Here though, some users report the 2K Launcher doesn't work, but for me it was fine. You can skip the 2K Launcher on Linux with Proton by adding this as a launch argument for the game on Steam:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">eval $( echo "%command%" | sed "s/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe'.*/Base\/Binaries\/Win64Steam\/CivilizationVI.exe'/" )</code></p>
<p>It's a shame, as it shows even though they're selling it clearly as supported, seemingly no one at Firaxis / 2K / Aspyr is even testing either Linux or macOS now.</p>
<p>I've reached out to the publisher to see if they have anything to say about what is happening, although they never replied  to my initial email asking about the new DLC. I've also reached out to Aspyr Meda directly about it. Will update if either reply.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 515.86.01 fixes Spider-Man Remastered, plus black screen issues on RTX 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released a fresh update to their stable driver series for Linux with 515.86.01 with some fixes.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/194662/en-us/" target="_blank">515.86.01</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to correctly limit the allowed values for GPUTargetFanSpeed to match the existing valid fan speed ranges for supported NVIDIA GPUs. The valid ranges are 30%-100% for Ampere or newer GPUs, and 1%-100% for older GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs when starting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crash with Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also being a bit confusing on the 525.53 that went into Beta <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/nvidia-52553-beta-is-out-now-for-linux/" target="_blank">earlier this month</a>. Depending on where you look it's either <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/194315/en-uk" target="_blank">Beta</a> or it's <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/194518/en-uk" target="_blank">not</a> — both links are the same driver on different pages and one shows it not in Beta. Seems not even NVIDIA know what their own drivers are doing huh?</p>

      <title>JSAUX M.2 SSD Steam Deck Docking Station gets a sale, adding a 65W charger too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>JSAUX have announced that their excellent <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/m-2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0604" target="_blank">M.2 Docking Station</a> for Steam Deck that allows you to add in an SSD, is about to go on sale and they're now bundling a charger. Mentioned in a <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/blogs/steam-deck/price-reduction-on-hb0604" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they're doing a nice discount between November 24th - November 28th.</p>
<p>When the sale goes live, the prices will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dock + 65W Charger - $119.99 (Use the code JS20 to save $20, you can get one at $99)</li>
<li>Dock + 65W Charger + 1TB M.2 SSD - $189.99 (Use the code JS20 to save $20, you can get one at $169.99)</li>
<li>Dock + 65W Charger + 2TB M.2 SSD - $259.99 (Use the code JS40 to save $40, you can get one at $219.99)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even better, for people who already purchased one, they're going to be sending you out a free 65W charger or if you email them you can get $20 sent back to you. They don't exactly need to do this, companies run sales and change up bundles all the time but this is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Why are they now including a charger? According to testing, Valve's official charger wasn't providing enough power to ensure the SSD could continue to be powered so they're ensuring people get the best experience.</p>
<p>You can see my previous little overview of it in the below video:</p>

      <title>Valve puts up Proton Next (7.0-5) to provide easier testing of future upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proton Next has been announced by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1595247355879911424" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, as an easier way to check out and test the upcoming stable releases of new Proton versions for Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It is mostly the same as the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/proton-70-5-is-coming-soon-improving-steam-deck-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Release Candidate for Proton 7.0-5</a> that was put up in October. However, it's now its own entry in Steam as Proton Next. This makes it far easier to test, since you can set it to games individually, instead of opting into a Beta with the current main version of Proton.</p>
<p>This new Proton Next will only become available when there is a new version of Proton ready for testing, and once stable it will be retired. So games you've set to it, would likely just get bumped to the main version of Proton since it would replace it.</p>
<p>Here's what's now available in Proton Next as version 7.0-5:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The following games are now playable:
<ul>
<li>Rift</li>
<li>Unravel 2</li>
<li>Airborne Kingdom</li>
<li>Nancy Drew: Legend of the Crystal Skull</li>
<li>Re-Volt</li>
<li>Aspire: Ina's Tale</li>
<li>Battle Realms: Zen Edition</li>
<li>Deathsmiles II</li>
<li>Primal Carnage: Extinction</li>
<li>Pico Park Classic Edition</li>
<li>Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind</li>
<li>Darkstar One</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Emperor Tomb</li>
<li>Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix Batman: Arkham City GOTY launching in the background on Steam Deck when set to fullscreen.</li>
<li>Fix Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered displaying dialog about outdated drivers on AMD systems.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) having no audio.</li>
<li>Fix Return to Monkey Island not reacting to mouse clicks after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix upsidedown videos in VRChat and many other games.</li>
<li>Fix Call of Duty Black Ops II Zombies and Multiplayer hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fix Bail or Jail crashing when opening the Terms of Serivce.</li>
<li>Improve GTA V situation with not loading textures.</li>
<li>Fix Red Dead Redemption 2 crashing after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher functionality after game update.</li>
<li>Fix cutscene stutter in Disgaea 5.</li>
<li>Fix Thrustmaster HOTAS having non-functional dial in Elite Dangerous.</li>
<li>Fix Planet Zoo randomly crashing.</li>
<li>Fix SCP: Secret Labratory not being playable after a recent game update (again).</li>
<li>Fix Tekken 7 crashing at launch.</li>
<li>Fix Armello hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fix Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization freezing after the tutorial.</li>
<li>Fix Space Engineers intro video not playing correctly.</li>
<li>Fix Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen videos not playing correctly.</li>
<li>Implement network video support for VRChat.</li>
<li>Update dxvk to v1.10.3-28-ge3daa699.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">Changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>To opt into it, go into the Properties of a game on Steam and go into the Compatibility menu. Tick the box on the right and select Proton Next from the dropdown:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20952225211669198408gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20952225211669198408gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can do the same on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>There's a few version of the official Proton now so here's a brief explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proton Experimental - Gets regular updates, with features and fixes not ready for everyone and can include some breaking changes that need new driver versions.</li>
<li>Proton Next - The upcoming new stable version of Proton that needs testing.</li>
<li>Proton Hotfix - A few extra fixes for specific games.</li>
<li>Proton 7.0-x - The current stable series of Proton used for most Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck.</li>
<li>There's also the Proton 6.3 series, Proton 5.0 series, Proton 4.2 and so on - these are all older stable versions left up in case specific games need them.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Watch your wallet run away from you as the Steam Autumn Sale 2022 is here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I hear the faint sound of my wallet trying to escape, as the Steam Autumn Sale 2022 is now live with the usual massive discounts on thousands of games. Running until November 29th at 10am PT / 6pm UTC.</p>
<p>On top of that Valve are also kicking off the Steam Awards, with a brand new category (inspired by the Steam Deck) of "Best Game on the Go". Who bets Vampire Survivors wins that? I wouldn't be surprised.</p>
<p>Their trailer is below for the event:</p>

<p>This time I've gone over and picked out some deals for you on games I know that are good (that I've actually played). I'll be mainly sticking to <u>Steam Deck Verified</u> titles, with a note in brackets if they have a Native Linux version or the rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> (also not going below a Gold rating on ProtonDB for desktop Linux).</p>

      <title>Armello gets full Linux support restored with cross-platform online play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is really great to see! Armello from developer League of Geeks has a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/290340/view/3494259338696364285" target="_blank">update</a> out, and it restores full Linux support. Armello is a lot of fun to play with friends, and quite a few hours were put into it by me at the original release playing it online together with our contributor Samsai.</p>
<p>For those who don't know what it is: Armello is a grand swashbuckling adventure that combines three styles of play; The deep tactics of card games with the rich strategy of table top board games, combined with a character role-playing system.</p>
<p>So what happened? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/armello-removes-advertising-linux-and-macos-support-due-to-their-party-system/" target="_blank">Back in July</a>, the developer stopped advertising Linux (and macOS) support on it, due to an update that pulled in a whole new online system with their service provider actually dropping both platforms, so they were stuck. Thankfully, their provider has now hooked up full support for both and so League of Geeks "pounced on the opportunity to restore Party functionality here".</p>
<p>With the update it now means players on Linux and macOS are once again fully supported, advertised as being so and have access to cross-platform online play (with everyone even consoles) with the party system.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft making a return to Steam with Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla on December 6th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Linux desktop and Steam Deck players! Assassin's Creed Valhalla is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on December 6th.</p>
<p>Yet another company who tried vanishing to their own launcher, or to the Epic Store, is returning to Steam. Not really surprising though, considering Steam is still the biggest PC store around. I'll be giving it a run on Steam Deck when it releases, so I'll let you know what to expect from it.</p>
<p>This is not the only title coming to Steam, as Ubisoft confirmed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-valhalla-headed-to-steam" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a> that Anno 1800 and Roller Champions will also be getting a Steam release.</p>
<p>Hopefully Ubisoft Connect won't be too problematic for Proton, so that players on Linux desktop and Steam can get to play them too. Considering how big a title like Assassin's Creed Valhalla is, I've no doubt if there's major problems that Valve would promptly look into getting it working.</p>

      <title>Nintendo goes after SteamGridDB, likely for people doing emulation on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems with all the people emulating games on the Steam Deck and how popular doing so has become, Nintendo has continued to take notice and fired off some DMCA requests to have images taken down (thanks <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/nintendo-issues-dmca-takedowns-for-specific-switch-games-to-art-library-sharing-site-steamgriddb.621911/" target="_blank">GBAtemp</a>).</p>
<p>To get started with: what is SteamGridDB? It's a website that hosts various images for various games, to help you add fancy artwork into Non-Steam games you add into your Steam Library. So instead of seeing Steam's default image for Non-Steam games, you get it all looking nice. Naturally, this means people will be uploading plenty of images they don't own, and often the official game images for various games on other platforms for when people are doing emulation.</p>
<p>Nintendo being clearly unhappy with this, fired off many DMCA requests and now you might spot several images across the likes of (each link an example of one removed): <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272687" target="_blank">Pokémon Scarlet</a>, <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272686" target="_blank">Pokémon Violet</a>, <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272688" target="_blank">Splatoon 3</a>, <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272690" target="_blank">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272689" target="_blank">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, and <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272446" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20183999121669121277gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20183999121669121277gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just for emulation though, it has game pictures for tons of games that you can use as an alternative to the official images included with Steam.</p>

      <title>Steam Play compatibility tool Luxtorpeda moves to Godot Engine for the UI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a Steam Play compatibility tool (like Proton), that allows you to run various games on Steam with Native Linux game engines.</p>
<p>What's the point? Well, many games on Steam are old and no longer updated. However, a growing amount have community-build game engines that dramatically upgrade them and Luxtorpeda allows you to just install them directly in Steam. I previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">did a guide</a> on how to use it, and while focused on the Steam Deck the same applies to using it on a Linux desktop:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BxIKfWGdSh0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e793555e6ab33bed36d08111e87bfb2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BxIKfWGdSh0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From what the developer told us in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>, here's what's changed in Luxtorpeda version 60:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* Move GUI to Godot, using godot-rust<br/>
    * godot-rust allows for the underlying code for downloading, extracting, etc to stay the same in rust, and then allow for fairly simple communication between Godot and rust, using the Godot signal method. The Godot layer handles user input and the UI, and rust handles all the pieces behind the scenes<br/>
    * This move makes maintaining the UI easier, with being able to use the many built-in Godot features and the editor<br/>
    * Controller and window support, such as DPI, is now handled by Godot, instead of custom code on top of SDL2<br/>
    * Instead of opening individual windows for each action (like choices, download progress, etc), one Godot window is used for the full flow until the game has closed, which should make the UI flow better<br/>
* Progress is now shown for install and setup steps, to make it clearer to the user what is going on<br/>
* [striezel] misc - fix a typo<br/>
* [striezel] Update crate dependencies<br/>
* [striezel] update actions used in GitHub Actions workflow</p>
<p>The big part of that is moving the UI to Godot, using godot-rust to keep all the logic inside rust. This was mainly to take advantage of Godot's easy to use editor and all the GUI tools available. This should make creating and maintaining UI easier. If you run into any issues with it, please feel free to open a issue about it or talk to me on discord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a quick example, with Morrowind in Steam set to use Luxtorpeda, you will see after downloading the UI that allows you to pick what to run it with:</p>

      <title>Pixel-art open-world pirating adventure Arcane Waters is now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I just finished watching all of Black Sails (which was fantastic) and was in the mood for some pirating fun, so the Early Access release of Arcane Waters makes for good timing. This is a new pixel-art open-world single-player and online pirating adventure game. </p>
<p>Featuring a great big mix of gameplay mechanics including trading, exploration, combat, and farming. You get to explore handcrafted sea and land maps, sail to visit remote towns to trade goods, hunt for treasure in dangerous waters and lands filled with monsters, or play against other pirates in PvP sea battles. After you've done all that, go back to your farm to tend to your crops and make some more monies to buy and upgrade your fleet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nV5wIPazemk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a719bcbc60c2b23692440dfa3de1b07d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nV5wIPazemk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer expects to remain in Early Access until some time next year. Currently it has a few of the unique regions ready to explore, with 7 planned for the full game but they said the core gameplay elements are done and included in the game right now.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Embark on thrilling online co-op voyages. Work together with a group of up to 6 real-life people and explore unchart- ed territories. Rogue pirates and monsters await you in the waters and on land. Can you survive and get the treasure waiting for you at the end?</li>
<li>Battle in intense online PvP arenas. Two teams of up to 24 fight against each other in MOBA-like arenas. Destroy the enemy’s towers and base before they destroy your’s!</li>
<li>Farm, craft &amp; trade. When you need a break from all of the action, enjoy farming, crafting new equipment and trading your items all across the world!</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamOS 3.4 gets a fix for Resident Evil 4, plus new Steam Deck Client Beta out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released two updates for the Steam Deck. One being an OS update for SteamOS 3.4 and the other being another Deck Beta Client update. Both of these updates are available in the Preview channel. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>For the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3497637038418713123" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4 Preview update</a>, the only change is a regression fix that gets Resident Evil 4 working again. Nice to see they're taking on reports from players, like another previous update fixing Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>Here's what's in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3497637038418820025" target="_blank">Steam Deck Client Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed controllers being treated as Xbox One controllers by default when defining their layout</li>
<li>Fixed the L3/R3 buttons not being detected for some third party PS3 controllers</li>
<li>Added Left and Right Stick Deflection as an option for Gyro Activation Buttons. Stick deflection is no longer considered a part of "Touch" (Cap Sense) on SteamDeck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed getting the wrong personalization (colors, etc.) for streaming PS4 controllers</li>
<li>Fixed streaming Bluetooth controllers not turning off</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you didn't see it, here's a look at the new Spider-Man: Miles Morales on Steam Deck and getting it to run smoothly at 30FPS with some changed settings:</p>

      <title>Half-Life 2, Portal, Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2 all get upgraded with DXVK 2.0 Vulkan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the recent release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0</a>, the Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan translation layer, it pulled in DXVK-Native for Native Linux builds and so Valve has upgraded Half-Life 2, Portal, Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? Well, the original Linux ports used TOGL to convert the original Windows Direct3D rendering system over to OpenGL. Then Valve began updating each of them all to DXVK last year to give them better performance on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. With DXVK 2.0, they're ready to take advantage of all the extra performance improvements to be found there.</p>
<p>Why the need for the translation between graphics APIs? This was before Source 2, which eventually gained Native Vulkan support, so these older ports didn't have it available. Portal 2 additionally noted in the update it had "Fixed some controller input bugs" as well. Nice.</p>
<p>Great to see Valve support their classic titles for so long.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will find out whatever <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/" target="_blank">NEON PRIME</a> actually is from Valve soon.</p>

      <title>Inspired by F.E.A.R., the retro FPS &#39;Selaco&#39; is getting a big demo upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Possibly one of the most promising retro-styled FPS games coming to Linux, Selaco is getting a huge demo upgrade next month. Built with GZDoom, it's ridiculously impressive with so much going on it's hard to believe it's using that game engine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selaco is a brand new original shooter running on GZDoom, featuring thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart AI and a fleshed out story taking place within an immersive game world. It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing traditional retro-FPS elements from QUAKE and DOOM, along with some more modern features. Together with professional artists who work in the industry, several having worked on successful throwback FPS games in the past, Selaco is a fully fleshed out world full of character, action, and mystery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arriving on December 16th, here's what's coming to the updated demo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full gamepad &amp; Steam deck Support</li>
<li>Level-design Enhancements</li>
<li>Hundreds of Quality of Life Improvements</li>
<li>Improved AI</li>
<li>Rebalanced Gameplay</li>
<li>Art Pass</li>
<li>Performance Optimizations</li>
</ul>
<p>See their new trailer:</p>

<p>I cannot wait to get my hands on this. The initial demo was very impressive and a lot of fun to play, and these upgrades to it sound quite fantastic.</p>

      <title>Take on Chess-based enemies in the roguelike Chess Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another developer attempting to turn the classic Chess into something weird and wonderful. Chess Survivors takes set pieces and moves from Chess, sticks it into a blender and out came a grid based, quick-turn, roguelike.</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access, the developer said they plan to keep it under development there for at least until Summer 2023. During development they plan to add in more unique characters, abilities, game modifiers, new enemy types based on Chess pieces, mod support and more. So far, it seems like they've crafted an interesting take on the survivor phenomenon (think Vampire Survivors) especially since it uses fast-paced turns instead of throwing a constant overwhelming force at you in real-time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3yNzoyMPmLY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6f1024a23aa9aff7d9478248f7f4bd2b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3yNzoyMPmLY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Chess based enemies and player movement.</li>
<li>Unique runs by choosing a Character, Starting Ability, and Relic.</li>
<li>Casual quick 10-21 minute play sessions, for busy gamers.</li>
<li>Unlock new characters, cosmetics, and relics.</li>

      <title>This might be the most expensive and over the top Steam Deck bag I&#39;ve seen yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WaterField Designs, maker of various luxury accessories for different types of hardware, has announced their "<a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/complete-case-for-steam-deck?variant=40417097449555" target="_blank">Complete Case for Steam Deck</a>" ready for all your travelling.</p>
<p>It will hold pretty much everything you could need a for a full experience. There's space inside for all of this together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck console</li>
<li>Steam Deck dock</li>
<li>Two Charging blocks</li>
<li>Controller</li>
<li>75% Keyboard</li>
<li>Mouse</li>
<li>HDMI Cable</li>
<li>Ear buds</li>
<li>Micro SD cards</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup, it will carry all of that and the bag itself is not even particularly big either. They managed to make it snugly hold plenty, while not looking ridiculous — quite a feat that. The problem though? The price. It's an eye-watering $239 and there's even a special strap you can add for another $24.</p>

<p>Based in San Francisco, USA, their gear is all built in their local workshop.</p>
<p>Shipping starts by December 9th, and they ship internationally, so perhaps a good holiday gift for the Steam Deck nerd in your life? Or just something for yourself to look fashionable on the train?</p>

      <title>Broforce is coming back for more action in 2023 with &#39;Broforce Forever&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Broforce Forever is the name of a new free update coming to the crazy action-platform Broforce, sometime in early 2023.</p>
<p>It originally came out in 2015, following the initial idea in the Ludum Dare 23 Game Jam where it was called Rambros. News of a new update coming makes me rather happy, as it's probably one of the most fun action-platformers ever made. It's completely ridiculous in all the best ways.</p>
<p>You don't have to take my word for it, on Steam it has an "Overwhelmingly Positive" user rating from over 40,000 people. Featuring parodies of various well known action stars, explosions and a fast-pacing it's just a whole lot of fun in a small package.</p>
<p>Check out the teaser below:</p>

      <title>Crysis 2 &amp; 3 Remastered finally land on Steam, work great on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being Epic Store exclusive since last year, Crysis 2 &amp; 3 Remastered are finally available on Steam and they run rather nicely on Steam Deck. Now the full trilogy is finally on Steam.</p>
<p>I remember playing through the original Crysis on Windows at release back in 2007, and my PC at the time could only just about run it. To see all three working so well, in their updated form, on a Steam Deck that runs SteamOS (Linux) is quite incredible really. Technology really has moved on and times like this make me really see it. Honestly, I've been massively impressed with how both look and run on the Steam Deck with pretty reasonable settings on both too:</p>
<p>Here's plenty of gameplay of both, with timestamps in the video between the two games so you can get a good look at how they run.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wPnW1nw9sck"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d108f6ab93178bed410dc561c7b88800.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wPnW1nw9sck" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you're after a good shooter series, overall it's one not to be missed. Although, plenty of people feel that the original Crysis is better than then Remastered version, but 2 and 3 are much improved in the Remastered versions.</p>
<p>Where to buy:</p>

      <title>System76 upgrades the Thelio Major desktop with a removable I/O shield</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thelio Major, System76's high-end Linux desktop is going through a big upgrade that's due out on November 28th.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thelio Major is System76's most powerful gaming system, placing some of the largest GPUs on the market in a machine engineered for quiet, effective cooling. This custom cooling system uses a phase-change cooling method to move heat away from the components, and large fans to quickly and quietly exhaust hot air. The goal: To ensure these powerful components run as close to their top performance as possible.</p>
<cite>System76</cite></blockquote>
<p>One of the major design changes, is that it will finally have a removable I/O shield like most other cases. While the case is design specifically by System76 for their systems, it's nice to see this now an option so you can easily change the motherboard for future upgrades. In a press note, they said the change should roll out to other Thelio models in future too.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the new refreshed Thelio Major include:</p>
<ul>
<li>13th Gen Intel Core i7 or i9.</li>
<li>Up to 72TB of Storage.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi 6E.</li>
<li>Up to NVIDIA 3090 Ti graphics.</li>
<li>10 Gb Ethernet.</li>
<li>Removable I/O shield for future upgrades.</li>
<li>PCIe 5.0 M.2 storage compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also shared a video talking a little about the R&amp;D process:</p>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III for Linux updated to v2.2.0, Immortal Empires beta available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A whole month later, Feral Interactive have updated the Native Linux port of Total War: WARHAMMER III to be in parity with Windows at version 2.2.0 and it's a big update. Not only that, but this update finally brings the huge Immortal Empires beta to the Linux version, <em>three months</em> after it became available for Windows.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights in 2.2.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changes to settlements and garrisons to reduce the frequency of settlement battles.</li>
<li>Additional flavour for some of the special settlement garrisons—including Karak 8 Peaks, Black Pyramid, Skavenblight and more—by allowing them to use additional units.</li>
<li>A character experience rebalance, reducing the importance of victory types and focusing on enemy unit destruction.</li>
<li>Tweaks to the victory objectives of several legendary lords, including those of the Lizardmen, High Elves and Empire.</li>
<li>A game mode split option has been added to ranked multiplayer, letting you join separate queues and giving you greater control of your online experience.</li>
<li>Adjustments to AI aggression, strategy and overall game difficulty.</li>
<li>Plus, monsters are invading the old world in the form of Regiments of Renown III, and a new endgame crisis brings ruin-death to all! Yes-yes…</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Linux version also now has support for the Champions of Chaos DLC, which is again, multiple months late for Linux.</p>
<p>Here's the changes overview trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pQDafMXk_6A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e766881fb4bc82d654d04cbda762df17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pQDafMXk_6A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It is nice to see that Feral are actually keeping the port up to date, but the time between it being available on Windows and on Linux is not great. Hopefully they will be able to get that time down in future. Still a shame the Linux port doesn't support cross-platform online play too, so if you want to play with people on Windows you will need to run it through Proton.</p>

      <title>Box64 and Box86 get more games running on Arm plus DXVK 2.0 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Box64 and Box86 are userspace emulators to run traditional x86 and x86_64 applications on Arm, and the 0.2 release of both are a nice big step forward. For those of you with Arm devices (like the Raspberry Pi), these two projects definitely sound interesting and will expand what you're able to do.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>DXVK 2.0 working.</li>
<li>Unity3D games now work.</li>
<li>Reduced memory footprint.</li>
<li>Added support for wrapped libfuse so AppImage works.</li>
<li>Discord working.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently trying to re-do my Raspberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu, so I can test more things like this but it's proving a bit of a nuisance. Hopefully I'll be able to sort it for an overview video in future.</p>
<p>Box86 <a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/releases/tag/v0.2.8" target="_blank">v0.2.8 changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wrapped more vulkan function, dxvk 2.0 now works</li>
<li>Added support for overriden malloc/free functions</li>
<li>Improved elf loader</li>
<li>Improved dlsym handling with RTLD_NEXT</li>
<li>Added BOX86_DYNAREC_SAFEFLAGS to allow finetuning Dynarec generated code handling of flags accross function calls and returns.</li>
<li>Added BOX86_BASH to setup x86 bash binary, so shell script can be run in x86 world</li>
<li>Added BOX86_ROLLING_LOG to have details log only on crash</li>
<li>Improved TLS Size handling (Unity3D games now works)</li>
<li>Improved <code class="inline-code">execv</code> family of function to have better box86 integration</li>
<li>Added a few more wrapped libs, like FAudio</li>
<li>Improved gtk, SDL2, GL, vulkan (and more) wrapping</li>
<li>Improved Signal Handling and memory protection traking</li>
<li>Added some basic support for statically linked program. Thread are not working yet, but memory allocation and file access does.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also noted:</p>

      <title>How to fix the EA app on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/valve-fix-new-ea-app-in-proton-experimental-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">did an update</a> in Proton Experimental that did get the EA app working again. The problem is that it doesn't stick and the EA app will break itself. It might work fine for a few launches, and then suddenly another it just won't work.</p>
<p>It can be really problematic, especially on Steam Deck, as it might cause a spinning Steam logo of doom that requires a reboot of the Steam Deck to get rid of the broken loading.</p>
<p>Here's one way to fix it: what you'll need to do, is remove the Proton files for the game (it works for any game using the EA app). For Steam Deck players, here's a brief video guide that also warns you about save backups and points you in the direction of where you might need to go to make a backup:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NaPNJSGqxyQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0029a2afc776defa2dbe1a8ed0790cf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NaPNJSGqxyQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Steam Deck:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set EA games to Proton Experimental. Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box -&gt; Select Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Make a backup of save files (IMPORTANT) as they might be removed during this. I cannot stress this enough, find where the save files are and copy them somewhere safe. JUST DO IT. You can find the Windows folders for games in the “compatdata” folder, and then the ID of the Steam game.<br/>
For example: <code class="inline-code">/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/*game_id*/</code></li>
<li>In the games Properties - Developer - Delete Proton Files</li>
<li>Launch the game again</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set EA games to Proton Experimental. Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box -&gt; Select Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Make a backup of save files (IMPORTANT) as they might be removed during this. I cannot stress this enough, find where the save files are and copy them somewhere safe. JUST DO IT. You can find the Windows folders for games in the “compatdata” folder, and then the ID of the Steam game.<br/>
For example: <code class="inline-code">/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/*game_id*/</code></li>
<li>Delete the ID folder mentioned above.</li>
<li>Launch the game again.</li>
</ul>
<p>For save backups, each game is different, it's best to look it up using your favourite search engine first. <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home" target="_blank">PCGamingWiki</a> might list where the save files are.</p>
<p>This is the easiest fix I've found so far, that doesn't require the use of Protontricks or swapping Proton versions that could cause other issues (like a broken Proton Prefix) or anything else. Not all games need a save backup, but it's best not to rely on Steam Cloud (and some games don't have it).</p>

      <title>Valve update desktop Steam Stable Client with the New Big Picture Mode option</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a new desktop update for the Steam Stable Client, and along with it comes the option to use the New Big Picture Mode. However, they broke it on Linux, at least for NVIDIA.</p>
<p>You can try out the New Big Picture Mode by launching Steam with "-gamepadui" as an option to go into it directly or with "-newbigpicture" to launch Steam normally but have the Big Picture button go into the new mode.</p>
<p>It worked mostly fine (outside of a few bugs) for me on desktop, until they also added a special boot-up video for the New Big Picture Mode that was in the last Beta and now everyone has it in the Stable update. For some reason, at least on NVIDIA, you hear the intro video playing but it doesn't actually display anything. So far the only <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8916" target="_blank">people reporting it</a> are on NVIDIA, so I'm unsure if it's on AMD GPUs too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2510637751668692688gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2510637751668692688gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - the New Big Picture Mode on Fedora Linux</em></p>
<p>Hopefully it won't be too long before Valve or NVIDIA figure out what the issue is. I would quite like to use it on my desktop too as it's a nice improvement.</p>
<p>Here's all <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/166019" target="_blank">the changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Big Picture Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Big Picture is now available for testing. You can read more about it in this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3394051164709183116" target="_blank"><u>blog post</u></a>. Modify your Steam client shortcut and add -gamepadui on the command-line to automatically start Steam in the new Big Picture Mode. Alternatively, pass -newbigpicture to start in Desktop mode and have access to the new Big Picture Mode at any time.</li>
</ul>
<strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced client startup times for users with large game libraries</li>
<li>Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection</li>
<li>Fixed VR flags not showing up in app details for some games</li>
<li>Center the popup controller configurator window when viewing controller layout</li>
<li>Fixed circular download progress indicator being broken in game entry list</li>
<li>Fixed downloads page crashing when starting in offline mode</li>
<li>Downloads page now properly responds to online/offline status</li>
<li>Updated “Steam News” popup dialog (again)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sign In</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix a case where if the sign-in UI had cached credentials which had become invalid, it could get stuck and not accept valid credentials thereafter</li>
<li>Fixed an input focus bug requiring an initial click on the sign in UI before you could type your username or password</li>
<li>Fixed issues with dragging or closing the sign in window, and related display scaling issues, on computers with nonstandard desktop scaling</li>
<li>Fixed an edge case in handling of invalid cached credentials affecting reauthentication</li>
<li>Fixed issue with sign in refresh UI when the user had already signed in once during the current session.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gyro Enabling: The "Touch" option is now available to controllers which do not have capacitive touch sensors - Moving joysticks out of their deadzone now counts as a "Touch".</li>
<li>All controller types can each now optionally choose to use a Nintendo-style layout. This flips the A and B button and X and Y button universally in Steam and in games.</li>
<li>The Xbox extended features driver has been updated for Windows 11</li>
<li>Fixed hang when the Amazon Luna controller rumbles on macOS</li>
<li>Fixed issue with the touch binding in As Mouse mode releasing before the end of a swipe</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed occasional long hitches during Windows desktop capture</li>
<li>Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo controllers while streaming</li>
</ul>
<strong>SteamVR</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that caused some OpenXR app images to not appear properly in SteamVR</li>
</ul>

      <title>Thousands of years later, The Bible has arrived on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I had to do a double-take to ensure I wasn't seeing things: The Bible is now available on Steam in the form of a Kinetic Novel. Yes really, a developer going by "Bible Games" has actually put it on Steam. This release supports Linux with a Native build too (Ren'py engine) because of course it needs to reach all God's children — something like that anyway.</p>
<p>Not only does it provide the good book, it also comes with an original soundtrack and an voice over from beginning to end. On top of that, there's even a trivia section so you can really prove your knowledge,</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19312471391668625966gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19312471391668625966gol1.jpg"/></a><em>I don't think it really needs much of an explanation? Or maybe it does? I heard it's a bit unbalanced and gives lots of conflicting information that doesn't hold up well.</em></p>
<p>While some might think this is a little odd, or even a silly gimmick, it's managed a "Very Positive" rating on Steam so clearly some are enjoying their time spent in it with reviews like "I will become the greatest Bible player" and "atheists approved".</p>
<p>Even better, it has achievements, because as God knows, people sure do love earning things on Steam. Going by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/ymbhx3/comment/iv45eg9/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post, the developer mentioned they did this because other ways of reading it on a PC were apparently bad.</p>
<p>Again, yes this is a real Steam "game" release, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2167220/The_Bible/" target="_blank">see it over here</a>.</p>
<p>Oh they even made a little trailer for it:</p>

      <title>Retro inspired RTS Rusted Warfare adds shaders, new units and other huge upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rusted Warfare is a great RTS for people who love the classics. One I discovered years ago on Android and then it later had a PC release. A big new release version 1.15 adds in loads to it. A game built for <em>large</em> battles. If you loved Total Annihilation, you will love this too.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in 1.15 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shaders - Team colour shaders and shader effects like shockwaves, water ripples and more.</li>
<li>New unit - Heavy AA Ship.</li>
<li>New unit - Spy Drone.</li>
<li>Stats - game history shown with graphs on post game win/lose screen and Stats / leaderboard button in replays.</li>
<li>Mods can now replace the streaming resource system with something else.</li>
<li>A new decal drawing system - can be used for a lot of new things from selection interfaces, custom health bars, fake 3d effects, 3d voxel units, animations, etc.</li>
<li>Over "100% faster rendering on PC" with lots going on.</li>
<li>Big dynamic logic improvement for modding, with new dynamic numbers, unit and string types, dynamic text, arrays, memory, unit references, messages sending, events, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus quite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/647960/view/3389548848365069095" target="_blank">a lot more</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 gets a Movie Maker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> 4.0 slowly approaching release, the developers are still hooking up some huge features to this free and open source game engine like a <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/movie-maker-mode-arrives-in-godot-4" target="_blank">Movie Maker</a>. This is something other game engines have too, so it's nice to see it land in Godot. This should make it easier for developers to make trailers of games, and use Godot for other projects too.</p>
<p>From their blog post it could be used for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recording game trailers for promotional use.</li>
<li>Recording cutscenes that will be displayed as pre-recorded videos in the final game. This allows for using higher quality settings (at the cost of file size), regardless of the player's hardware.</li>
<li>Recording procedurally generated animations or motion design. User interaction remains possible during video recording, and audio can be included as well (although you won't be able to hear it while the video is recording).</li>
<li>Comparing the visual output of graphics settings, shaders, or rendering techniques in an animated scene.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some advantages they listed instead of just plain recording gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use any graphics settings (including extremely demanding settings) regardless of your hardware's capabilities. The output video will always have perfect frame pacing; it will never exhibit dropped frames or stuttering. Faster hardware will allow you to render a given animation in less time, but the visual output remains identical.</li>
<li>Render at a higher framerate than the video's target framerate, then post-process to generate high-quality motion blur. This also makes effects that converge over several frames (such as temporal antialiasing, SDFGI and volumetric fog) look better.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also showed an example video made with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e047PL2KyP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/81180860c14d197e1fca4d40211fcc16.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e047PL2KyP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Godot 4.0 is shaping up to be a truly ridiculously big upgrade for game developers. Earlier this month the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-4" target="_blank">4th Beta</a> of Godot 4.0 went out.</p>

      <title>Unreal Engine 5.1 rolled out with plenty of Linux improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games announced that Unreal Engine 5.1 is now available, and along with all the usual big new features, they continued improving their Linux support in this release. You can see the official release <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-1-is-now-available" target="_blank">post here</a>, release <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/unreal-engine-5.1-release-notes/" target="_blank">notes here</a>.</p>
<p>After quietly making the Linux Editor for Unreal Engine <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/unreal-engine-5-editor-quietly-gets-a-proper-linux-version/" target="_blank">properly official</a>, it's nice to see them continue to make developing games on and for Linux better. In their press email, they mentioned how over "half of all announced next-gen games are being created with Unreal Engine" which is quite a few.</p>
<p>Going over the changelog, here's what's new and changed for Linux in Unreal Engine 5.1:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Clang 13 Support</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clang 13 is now the required version when compiling for Clang-based platforms such as Linux.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux IDE Workflow Improvements</strong>
<ul>
<li>In UE 5.1, we improved support for VS Code as a default option for IDEs in Linux. Error handling and messaging is also present when you have multiple IDEs and the code accessor fails to find the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New / Fixed</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved process for exporting to Raspberry Pi 4.
<ul>
<li>Added a new vendor ID for Broadcom.</li>
<li>Split ASTC and ETC2 support into separate texture formats for Vulkan, as ASTC may not be supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>USD: Added support for the usdMtlx plugin on Windows and Linux The usdMtlx plugin included with USD adds a file format plugin for reading MaterialX documents and translating them into UsdShade shading networks.</li>
<li>USD: added support for the usdAbc plugin on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</li>
<li>Added .so and .dylib as files to consider as library files to help reduce relinking on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Implemented a quick workaround to allow munmaps to happen with Mutex unlocked. Currently, We can't define UE_ALLOW_OSMEMORYLOCKFREE on Linux as we'll deadlock with the OsAllocatorCacheLock.</li>
<li>Mutex locks Munmap calls on Linux can take quite a bit of time (few ms in some cases). This should allow these to happen without the Mutex and remove some hitching.</li>
<li>Updated Mac and Linux to use libcurl 7.83.1.</li>
<li>Enabled the experimental Unreal Cloud DDC on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added all files under Unreal Build Tool output directory to fix an issue running build setup on linux builders.</li>
<li>Added support for IsGamepadAttached on Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for Linux to search (using "which") for CLion outside of the default expected location.</li>
<li>Linux windows now have a reasonable minimum size, and no longer can be scaled down to 1 pixel wide/tall.</li>
<li>UE on Linux now locates any standalone Rider installation if it is either installed to the default location "/opt" (Rider Installation Guide), or anywhere else that is on the PATH.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where global shaders would get cooked for Linux Server platforms if it had any targeted RHIs enabled.</li>
<li>The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) library that powers the Web Browser Widget has been updated to use Chromium's "Ozone" rendering backend under Linux. As a result, the Web Browser Widget now renders correctly in Linux environments that lack an X11 server, such as desktops running Wayland without the XWayland compatibility layer, and headless environments such as containers.</li>
<li>Fixed missing quotes in GenerateProjectFiles.sh.</li>
<li>Fixed QMake project generator defines.</li>
<li>Added DumpGPU viewer script for Linux and Mac. Currently requires the Chrome Browser to view the dump files.</li>
<li>Fixed landscape not updating on changes to water on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>The GPU Dump Viewer now dumps both <em>.sh and </em>.bat so a dump can be opened either on Mac, Linux, or Windows regardless of the platform the files were dumped from.</li>
<li>Platform Linux for the LiveLinkOverNDisplay Plugin was whitelisted in nDisplay.</li>
<li>Changed the minimum driver version for Nanite on Vulkan, and also added a check for Linux.</li>
<li>DriverDenyList support was added to Linux.</li>
<li>Added DriverDenyList entries for Vulkan on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for OpenVDB and Blosc on Mac and Linux in addition to Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed audio crashing when outputting audio with Blackmagic on Linux.</li>
<li>Enabled ShotGrid plugin for Linux.</li>
<li>SwitchboardListener: Fixed expansion of %TEMP% in file destination paths on non-Windows platforms. This was causing a crash attempting to launch nDisplay devices running on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see so many additions and fixes for Linux, hopefully it will continue to see this kind of attention.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bit of a delay due to security issues with OpenSSL, Fedora Linux 37 is officially <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-37/" target="_blank">out now</a> with all the usual assortment of major software updates.</p>
<p>Their main edition Fedora Workstation, continues using the GNOME desktop which bumps it up to <a href="https://release.gnome.org/43/" target="_blank">GNOME 43</a>. That along includes a lot of additions like the new Quick Settings menu, more applications upgraded to GTK 4, the Files app got refreshed, the Calendar / Contacts and Calls apps all got upgraded, Device Security Settings and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8144162721668529308gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8144162721668529308gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots more is new like official Raspberry Pi 4 support with working accelerated graphics, plus upgrades to various programming languages and system libraries as they continued to follow their "<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/#_first" target="_blank">First</a>" foundation (where they get stuff in early) like Python 3.11, Golang 1.19, glibc 2.36, and LLVM 15. It also includes Mesa 22.2.2 graphics drivers and the 6.0.7 Linux kernel.</p>
<p>For their other Spins that come with different desktops you get KDE Plasma 5.26.2, Xfce 4.16, Cinnamon 5.4.12 and there's other desktop environments available too.</p>
<p>With this release they slimmed the installation a bit, with Firefox language packs now as subpackages so you can remove the "firefox-langpacks" package if you don't need localization.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8962463541668529316gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8962463541668529316gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Fedora continues to be my go-to system, as it really works quite nicely on desktop. Hopefully my 36 - 37 upgrade will go smoothly but I usually wait a week or so to make sure any kinks are ironed out.</p>
<p>Do you use Fedora? Let us know in the comments what you're excited about in this release.</p>

      <title>Mixing factory management, Tower Defense and RTS - Mindustry 7.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best open source games around, Mindustry from AnukenDev just had a MASSIVE new release out that took quite some time to make. This update was in development for over a year!</p>
<p>It's like a mixture of Factorio with an RTS and Tower Defense blended in together, it's really quite something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7233548371668516603gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7233548371668516603gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in 7.0 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A whole new campaign that includes a new planet, with its own tech tree and 100+ new blocks to research.</li>
<li>15 new units to research and construct.</li>
<li>A new class of tank units.</li>
<li>A new variant of insectoid walkers.</li>
<li>Hovercraft units with unique weapons and abilities.</li>
<li>Various new forms of factory transportation.</li>
<li>Units can now be selected and commanded to positions or enemy targets, similarly to other RTS games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering how long it took, the developer mentioned they've burned-out a bit and so they will be taking a break from any feature updates for a couple of months but they will do smaller maintenance releases during this time to fix up issues as they appear.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support it, or grab it free on <a href="https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Popular Half-Life 2 mod Entropy : Zero 2 is getting full Linux support for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583720/Entropy__Zero_2/" target="_blank">Entropy : Zero 2</a> is a very popular and well reviewed Half-Life 2 mod, and the developer has recently <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1583720/announcements/detail/5025482135637312982" target="_blank">announced</a> the public testing of Native Linux support and Steam Input gamepad support. Available now in the "deck-testing" opt-in Beta, you can try it for yourself!</p>
<p>What is it? "The pessimistic, wisecracking, door-kicking zealot known as 'Bad Cop' is back.</p>
<p>Command a small army of Combine synths and soldiers on a Northern campaign to capture Dr. Judith Mossman.</p>
<p>Tread in the wake of Gordon Freeman at Nova Prospekt. Explore the mysterious 'Arbeit Communications' facility. Discover what lies beneath. Drive an APC through the arctic wastes. Confront the rebels on their doorstep and uncover a long-forgotten secret."</p>

<p>Why are they doing it this now? They're going for <em>full</em> Steam Deck support and they said having it run Native on the Steam Deck avoids various font issues they saw with Proton. Nice to see more developers, even on mods like this, opt for full direct Linux support.</p>
<p>Once it's properly ready, I look forward to giving it a full run through!</p>

      <title>YoYo Games open source the GameMaker HTML5 runtime</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one for open source fans and game developers, as YoYo Games have <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/html5-open-source" target="_blank">open sourced</a> their HTML5 runtime. It's now available on <a href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-HTML5" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, under the Apache 2 license.</p>
<p>The idea is to give developers a better idea of how it all works, plus it means that if there's something essential developers need, they can look to add it in themselves when creating their games. Open source (and even "source available") is just far better than hidden proprietary code.</p>
<p>YoYo Games will continue to update it, so it's not just a code-drop and forget type of deal. They are also encouraging others to create Pull Requests to improve it.</p>
<p>Their own Gurpreet S. Matharoo mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a developer, having access to the HTML5 source helps me understand how functions work behind the scenes, so I can get the most out of them.</p>
<p>I find the source easy to understand, as it’s written in JavaScript, which is similar to GML Code in terms of readability and usage. It’s a breeze compared to reading a source written in C or C++.</p>
<p>In addition to getting to look behind the curtain, I can now submit my own changes if I happen to come across bugs or functions that I can improve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like it makes it easy for game devs to tweak and test it too, with the GameMaker Beta allowing you to pick a different runtime and select your own downloaded version of the code. So you can easily test it locally for your own games, and before potentially sending fixes directly to the new GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Good stuff. Hopefully this is the start of more of GameMaker being open.</p>

      <title>Spider-Man: Miles Morales gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello web slingers! Good news for you, as Spider-Man: Miles Morales has been formally Steam Deck Verified ahead of the release later this week. Yes, it's releasing this week (November 18th), and I didn't realise it was that close either. Going to say goodbye to my backlog for a while again I think.</p>
<p>Sharing the news via Twitter, Nixxes Software <a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1592185956710453248" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21189211841668512354gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21189211841668512354gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see it get full testing, just like we saw with Spider-Man Remastered. I look forward to playing a good few hours in this one too.</p>
<p>Will you be picking it up? Might want to ensure you've got the space ready, as it will take up at least 75 GB (probably more for us, due to shaders and Proton files). So it might be time to pick a couple to remove ready, unless you have a nice big SD Card.</p>
<p>I'll be doing my usual video of such a big release, should be up later on release day.</p>
