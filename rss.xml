      <title>Expansive open world country-life sim The Ranchers gets funded in less than a day</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Ranchers from French developer RedPilz Studio is a very promising looking open world country-life sim, which will be coming with Native Linux support and optimized for the Steam Deck. It recently launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redpilzstudio/the-ranchers/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with it seeing the full funding in less than a day so clearly there's plenty of people out there wanting more farming life sims.</p>
<p>With the developer being inspired by various games like Harvest Moon, The Sims, GTA, Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing they wanted to combine their many mechanics and parts they found fun into a modern game that "pushes all the boundaries of the classics" and so The Ranchers was started.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OMqDwzgYB04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6bc506d39636fce91b0542bd80bed15a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OMqDwzgYB04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to play completely offline in solo, or you can team up with four players total online to do some ranching with others in co-op. You'll be able to explore a village, buy vehicles like cars, trucks and yachts and explore a huge open world filled full of mines, shipwrecks, uncharted islands and the occasional monster encounter too. Then you add in all the main mechanics of farming, fishing, sports and much more.</p>
<p>Seems it's been quite popular on Steam too, with it getting over 225,000 wishlists.</p>
<p>I spoke with the developer, who confirmed their full Linux support plans which will happen quickly after the Windows release if they don't make it on day-1. The Kickstarter campaign additionally confirms their intention to ensure it's optimized nicely for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can help fund it on Kickstarter and follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501310/The_Ranchers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>JSAUX are filling the Steam Deck accessory gap and have a Docking Station ready</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want some accessories for your Steam Deck? Well JSAUX recently put out their Docking Station, along with some other goodies for you to look into.</p>
<p>They have two models available with the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-docking-station" target="_blank">Docking Station for Steam Deck</a> and the newer and more expensive <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Upgraded Docking Station for Steam Deck</a> which come with plenty of ports available. The main difference between the two appears to be the upgraded version having three USB 3 ports and Gigbit Ethernet, with the original having two USB 2 ports and slower Ethernet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8902082371657203148gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8902082371657203148gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It of course also supports power delivery at 100W max, which is plenty to charge and power the Steam Deck at full speed.</p>
<p>Seems like it might be worth picking up, especially since Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-delay-the-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">delayed</a> the official Steam Deck Dock and we have no idea when they plan to make it available as they haven't said much on it lately.</p>
<p>Additionally JSAUX also sell various other accessories like the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-protective-case" target="_blank">Silicon Protective Case for Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-screen-protector-1" target="_blank">Plain Screen Protectors</a>, <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/printing-screen-protector-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Screen Protectors with a fancy border</a>, a <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-stand-protector" target="_blank">Protective Standing Case</a> and more. Perhaps there might be something you like the look of.</p>
<p>I've been told we're getting some sent over here, so I should be able to take a look at them at some point.</p>

      <title>You should avoid the stock Firefox install on Steam Deck as it&#39;s badly outdated (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I spoke with Valve about the issue and they confirmed change is coming — "Yes, we're aware of the issue and will soon be shipping an update to the SteamOS Beta to address it. After the update, Firefox will be installed as a flatpak, making it easier to keep up to date."</p>
<hr/>
<p>For all the pros of the Steam Deck like the full KDE Plasma desktop mode, there's a bit of a sore spot with Valve being too slow to update some of the included software.</p>
<p>Right now, the version of Firefox that is available on the Steam Deck is stuck at 96.0.3 even if you've opted into the very latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/steamos-33-beta-out-plus-a-steam-deck-client-update/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.3 Beta</a>. This is actually rather important, because web browsers are constantly under attack and new vulnerabilities appear all the time. With this version of Firefox, there's various flaws still present in it.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear why Valve don't just remove the Firefox package included directly in SteamOS, and have the Flatpak version installed instead like they give you the option for with Chrome with their built-in installer that keeps it up to date too.</p>
<p>For now if you want a secure browsing experience on the Steam Deck you should either install and run the Firefox version available via Discover as Flatpak or use Chrome that Valve has an easy installer for either via Discover or through the Non-Steam section in Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve directly about this, will update if / when they reply.</p>
<p>Need help installing software on the Steam Deck? See our guide example video below:</p>

      <title>Mark your calendars, Steam Next Fest returns in October 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has sent word that Steam Next Fest is coming back again and it will be live on October 3rd - 10th.</p>
<p>Much like their past editions it will be filled with hundreds of limited-time demos, although plenty of them you can likely just copy out of Steam and they will continue working but of course you're not supposed to know that (shh). On top of that there will be developer livestreams which will be live on their store pages as well as the event page, allowing you to chat to devs about their upcoming games.</p>
<p>For developers to get involved they must send over the registration to Valve by Thursday, July 21st 2022. There's a few boxes they need to tick to be eligible too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Associated with a Steamworks developer account in good standing</li>
<li>Visible on Steam as Coming Soon at the time of registration </li>
<li>Includes a publicly playable demo by the time the festival begins </li>
<li>To be released after the conclusion of the fest on October 10, 2022</li>
<li>Each game can only appear once in Steam Next Fest</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to the final point, Valve said this October's Next Fest will be the final time for a game to appear in Next Fest if it did so previously. So this rule will fully apply going forwards.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">preview page</a>, which gives you the option to set a special reminder.</p>

      <title>Nomad Survival is another great cheap Vampire Survivors styled game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nomad Survival is an auto-attacking rogue-lite action game where you try to survive as long as you can, while you continue to buff up your character as you go. Works great on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>Very much the same basic mechanics as the amazingly popular Vampire Survivors, with attacks firing off automatically. The key to survival is not only your fancy finger-work on the movement but also the build you go for on what attack types and upgrades you pick on each level up. As you take down enemies, they drop little gems to pick up to increase your experience level and then on each level you get to pick from upgrades.</p>
<p>Here's a look at it running on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qzCoryEBmMo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d2f3f3d06cc58afe8513191fed280d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qzCoryEBmMo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Tested working perfectly on Fedora Linux too.</em></p>
<p>It's delightfully engrossing and if you're a fan of auto-attack games like Vampire Survivors, it's another worthy entry to stick into your shopping cart that's only £2.09 and it will only take up around 100MB or so. You've not got much to lose and plenty of fun to gain. It's currently in Early Access and so it's continually growing too.</p>
<p>This is easily going to be my next 100+ game while sitting in bed on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>3 Unique Characters (4 more which can be unlocked!)</li>
<li>17 Active Abilities and 19 Passive Abilities</li>

      <title>I doesn&#39;t exist - a modern text adventure is one you need to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>doesn't exist - a modern text adventure, is an in-development game from LUAL Games KIG that's a love letter to the origins of adventures and gaming. Inspired by the likes of The Beginner's Guide, Stories Untold, Buddy Simulator and Zork it's one for those who love a classic adventure with some nice modern touches.</p>
<p>The developer is going for a modern theme with this too with it exploring themes of isolation, mental health and control. Not only that but they've introduced a clever sounding conversational AI, so you don't have to memorize and repeat exact words needed to progress.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2E074oVGPO4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/385d6d30580d63b84299ed0f39b72978.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2E074oVGPO4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the first act being like a classic text adventure much like Zork, the developer makes clear they don't want you to read endless walls of text, and they're sticking to their design rule on that plus there's plenty of great looking animated pixel-art to help convey the story to you. Plus you're also getting treated to a full musical score for it too.</p>
<p>For the second and third parts though, they plan to expand the scope and mix it up a bit noting that "the story will branch off a bit more and won't be so rule-based anymore" but they don't want to spoil the surprise so they're not going into great detail on that.</p>
<p>You can try the demo on <a href="https://lulatschia.itch.io/i-doesnt-exist" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943420/I_doesnt_exist__a_modern_text_adventure/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>It's also seeking <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/i-doesnt-exist/i-doesnt-exist-a-modern-text-adventure" target="_blank">funding on Kickstarter</a> where the developer hopes to raise at least 10,000CHF (around £8,654.86).</p>

      <title>OpenRCT2 the re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies have arrived for <a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> the open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Although it's fully playable already, the developers of this FOSS project continue to improve it a lot. This is another project that helps to keep a real classic game alive on modern systems, while also continually improving various features to make it feel just that little bit more modern.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16287382281657102302gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of the new additions in version 0.4.1 released on July 4th include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Alpine Coaster track type.</li>
<li>Option to show ride vehicles as separate entries when selecting a ride to construct.</li>
<li>FLAC and OGG/vorbis as supported audio formats for ride music objects.</li>
<li>Add vehicles for the Hybrid Coaster, Single-Rail Roller Coaster and Classic Mini Roller Coaster.</li>
<li>More natural looking shorelines in map generator.</li>
<li>Parks can now be resized into rectangular shapes from the map and map generation windows.</li>
<li>Tree placement is more natural during map generation.</li>
<li>The maximum price for the park entry has been raised to £999.</li>
<li>Weather no longer resets when converting a save to scenario.</li>
<li>Music Style dropdown is now sorted by name.</li>
<li>Transparency can be enabled directly without needing see-through enabled first.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus around 37 bug fixes were noted to make the game much more stable overall.</p>
<p>You need the data files to play it so buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it running on Linux is nice and simple too since they offer an official AppImage and there's also a Flatpak available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Forgotten World free update out for Monster Sanctuary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The creature battling metroidvania Monster Sanctuary has an expansive new free update out with The Forgotten World which is the largest update to the game yet. Adding in a new area, skills, items, new game modes and much more.</p>
<p>About it: "Delve deep into the Metroidvania inspired world of Monster Sanctuary, explore the expansive lands and call upon your monsters to lend their aid in and out of combat! Use their unique skills to fly, ride and brute force your way through environmental puzzles and precise platforming! The world is yours to traverse as you see fit, are you ready to take on the Sanctuary?"</p>
<p>Instead of The Forgotten World being a DLC, they decided to release it free to avoid any separation of the online PvP mode (optional) between people who have it and don't. Seems like a sane idea and gives everyone a bigger and better game. They've also added a "tip jar" on the <a href="https://monster-sanctuary.com/" target="_blank">official site</a> for anyone to donate if they want to support the developer thanks to the free upgrade.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H2e_Vw-ru3U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4354343c787cb397a973a34423efbb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H2e_Vw-ru3U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the full highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new area, larger than any other area of Monster Sanctuary. Forgotten World is meant to be explored in the late game - either before you step foot in the Abandoned Tower, or after you finished the main story. You can find the entrance in the lower area of Horizon Beach. You will need a certain late-game exploration ability to enter this area.</li>
<li>Ten new Monsters.</li>
<li>Nine of them can be found in the Forgotten World. One of the ten new Monsters is a new secret Champion in Blue Cave - which might help you enter the Forgotten World earlier.</li>
<li>New Monster type: Ancient.</li>
<li>Many of the new Monsters have this type. There are also some older Monsters that have gained this type.</li>
<li>Level cap raised to 42 from 40.</li>
<li>All skill trees in the game have gained some new skill nodes. In some cases, we made extensive changes to older Monsters' skill trees.</li>
<li>A lot of new weapons and accessories.</li>
<li>Two new player costumes.</li>
<li>Some new rooms and treasure chests have been added to older areas of the game as well.</li>
<li>Some new exploration abilities have been added to the game as well. Some of the exploration abilities of older Monsters have been updated.</li>
<li>On top of three new Champion fights, there is a new super-secret Champion fight that can only be found by Keeper Masters. It is the most difficult fight in the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>winesapOS is another way to get something like SteamOS on desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has still yet to produce an official installable image of SteamOS 3 for desktops, as always the community provides and another worth looking into is <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS</a>. Another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/holoiso-brings-valves-steamos-3-from-the-steam-deck-to-everyone/" target="_blank">I covered is HoloISO</a>, which tries to stick quite closely to SteamOS 3 but winesapOS aims to be a bit more than that.</p>
<p>Originally called the "Mac Linux Gaming Stick", the aim was to give macOS users an easy bootable disk to run Linux to get expanded game compatibility but it rebranded a while ago to expand the scope for many more users.</p>
<p>From what one of the developers told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our ultimate goal is not to provide the exact SteamOS experience that the Steam Deck provides like HoloISO does. We are focused on the desktop experience and expanding support for SteamOS by making the operating system work on a wide range of hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In keeping with that goal, they have expanded hardware support on desktops / laptops and of course Apple Mac systems too. They also have much more up to date software compared with SteamOS, it supports UEFI and legacy BIOS, encrypted filesystem support, has the Pamac application for installing / updating other software and comes pre-installed with plenty of software like Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, and PolyMC while still keeping the look and feel similar to SteamOS 3.</p>
<p>A big new release with version 3.1.0 went up recently with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch Linux packages upgrades</li>
<li>Graphics driver upgrades with support for Intel, NVIDIA and virtual machines</li>
<li>Improved controller support</li>
<li>An improved upgrade procedure</li>
<li>A fork for the PlayStation 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Organ swapping FPS &#39;Wrought Flesh&#39; gets a huge free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wrought Flesh is a game where you run around and pinch the organs of downed enemies to upgrade your body. It's pretty weird and a big content update is out now.</p>
<p>"Rip out enemies organs and equip them in your own body. Fight biopunk monsters and drugged-up space bandits. You are a Gajeshian Cultist: A near-mythological being built from the bodies of long-dead saints. You have arrived on the partially terraformed planet of Chrisembourgh on a temple-ordained mission to find and kill someone. Explore the planet and trace your victims steps to the end."</p>
<p>The 'Purple Sands of Cumulun' update adds in a reworked oasis area, tons of new quests, new guns, new music, a new monster, reworked AI, new achievements and they had "an actual writer" rework the text too. Seems like a lot of work went into this update.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Starve Together big Curse of Moon Quay update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Curse of Moon Quay is the latest major update for the Native Linux survival game Don't Starve Together and it sounds like a great one. They also updated it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/klei-fixes-up-dont-starve-together-for-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">Steam Deck support</a> recently too!</p>
<p>Easily one of the best survival games you can play on a Linux desktop or Steam Deck, as it's just such a fun game and the style of it is simply magnificent. One of the greatest games Klei has made for sure, but then I like pretty much anything Klei make.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eligdVVedDU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/813cba69f1fea5e25f29441b43ffe0c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eligdVVedDU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features includes:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_ExpandSectionBody_2sCNL">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Moon Quay Island and inhabitants.</li>
<li>Ocean Privateers.</li>
<li>New upgrades for boating:
	<ul>
<li>Grass Boat</li>
<li>Kelp Bumper</li>
<li>Shell Bumper</li>
<li>Cannon and Cannonballs</li>
<li>Rudder</li>
<li>Trawler</li>
<li>Polly Roger's Hat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docks</li>
<li>Nautopilot and Nautopilot Beacon</li>
<li>New perspectives on life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the new content, they also tweaked some existing features like making map controls and zooming much more intuitive and just make more sense. Zooming for example now focuses on the cursor for the map and will be smoother, rotating the map will also be done around the current location and not the player and controllers will see a better directional panning experience.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> where it's 66% off for the 2022 Summer Sale. Absolutely worth getting.</p>

      <title>Quirky murder mystery adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates releases July 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lord Winklebottom Investigates is an upcoming adventure from UK-based developer Cave Monsters, and they've recently confirmed it will release on July 28th. This game will be coming along with full Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from British literature icons such as Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes, Lord Winklebottom and his tea-drinking hippo companion Dr. Frumple will enjoy a journey full of intrigue and secrets that will apparently keep mystery fans gripped. The developer said it's a game with plenty of heart, featuring a script and setting full of bizarre characters and humour that wouldn’t be out of place in a Monty Python or Blackadder sketch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XxxK5ygYBGo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d30f4dd2279933598095d34d70e1f01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XxxK5ygYBGo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign it's set in the 1920s where the world’s foremost detective is about to embark on his most challenging case yet. Set on an isolated island where there's a grisly murder, it's a race against time to track down the killer.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full English voice acting.</li>
<li>An original 1920s inspired soundtrack featuring live instruments.</li>
<li>Play as a gentleman giraffe!</li>
<li>Unique 2D hand painted artwork.</li>
<li>Animals of all shapes and sizes!</li>
<li>Streamlined point and click interface.</li>
<li>Collection of bizarre characters to interrogate!</li>
<li>Dozens of puzzles to solve!</li>

      <title>Last Call BBS, the final game from Zachtronics is out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Zachtronics moving on from game development, their last game is now out in Early Access with Last Call BBS although it's actually not just one game.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics! The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is actually a game pack that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>20th Century Food Court:</strong> Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio:</strong> Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path:</strong> Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sawayama Solitaire:</strong> It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams:</strong> Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional:</strong> Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>HACK*MATCH:</strong> The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire:</strong> Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They will also be doing an <a href="https://askmeanythi.ng/ama/Ll5HypQmU79a" target="_blank">AMA (Ask Me Anything)</a> on Reddit on Thursday where you can fire off those burning questions.</p>
<p>It's a shame to know they won't be making any more games (it really is the last), with Zach moving onto a teaching job that was <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1454395489?t=00h12m36s" target="_blank">confirmed</a> during a recent Q&amp;A livestream.</p>
<p>Available to buy with a Native Linux version from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and soon on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/last_call_bbs" target="_blank">GOG</a> too.</p>

      <title>Feartress is a new incremental city-building RPG in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feartress is a bit of a quirky one. Blending together elements of an idle RPG with some small city-building that sees you go through different dimensions. I'm really not sure on the best way to describe this one, it's just odd but it has a pretty nice idea to play through.</p>
<p>"A new take on the genre of incremental games where you go on a journey to collect all the 21 elemental pearls and restore balance to the universe. You build up a settlement in each world and destroy enemy structures to find loot and unlock new perks. Collect epic and legendary gear to help you venture into new worlds with increasingly powerful enemies."</p>

      <title>Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A second bundle (yes there's two) supporting people in the USA following the overturning of Roe v. Wade is live on itch.io with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1471/worthy-of-better-stronger-together-for-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle</a>. The other is the Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/itchio-are-hosting-a-big-indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 24th, 2022 was a harrowing day for civil liberties. In the United States, basic human rights are being stripped away. It is a stark reminder that even after 50 years of legal protection, equality can be so easily lost. To say nothing of the dangerous precedent this decision sets for other civil rights protections, we believe that the right for a person to pursue safe and legal abortions is more than enough reason to stand up and take action. This decision does not only effect those capable of becoming pregnant. It is a determination of what rights we as a society choose to hold sacred. It is a question of  who is deemed worthy of protecting. The fabric of our society is woven by every single member, to erode a single thread unravels us all. We must all take a stand and demand that our rights and bodily autonomy are federally recognized</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a charity bundle as well with all proceeds being split between these two charities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://now.org/" target="_blank">National Organization for Women</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/about-us/" target="_blank">Center for Reproductive Rights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can pay $10 (or more) to support it and gain access to 169 different items spread across games, tools and more including some gems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Away Team</li>
<li>Aground</li>
<li>Not Actually A DOS Game</li>
<li>Sally Face</li>
</ul>
<p>The bundle is up for the next 11 days.</p>

      <title>Desktopia is a city-builder that runs along the bottom of your desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Desktopia: A Desktop Village Simulator seems like quite a unique idea for a city-builder, also a fun distraction to have open on your desktop. Instead of giving you a big full-screen window, the game sits along the bottom of your screen allowing you to carry on with whatever you're doing while also keeping an eye on your little people.</p>
<p>"Like any city-builder, you get to make the big decisions, while also being able to take control of your own sword wielding character. You can join in the battles, harvest resources, put out fires, or interact with your villagers. In Desktopia, you can be as active, or as idle, as you want!"</p>
<p>You can see the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cGCWSWy4Jnk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6b5806ae2efc9f04fc8548642c6cf9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cGCWSWy4Jnk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also, as a basic demo of how it would work on your actual desktop, they have a video on that too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uw7sz1pA9Ys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/460346435f22a746d343f4fd4924c8c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uw7sz1pA9Ys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A completely original approach in PC gaming: designed with functionality in mind, Desktopia allows you to use your PC for multiple purposes on a single monitor.</li>
<li>Clever UI: with resizeable pop-out windows which can be arranged anywhere on your screen.</li>
<li>A playable character which levels with your village, so you can jump into the action whenever you want.</li>
<li>Detailed logs and statistics arrayed in beautiful charts and graphs.</li>
<li>Spy Mode: focus the camera on any villager, any time, and watch as they live their life.</li>
<li>Resizeable game world, with the option to have it 'always on top' of other windows.</li>
<li>From nothing: grow a series of villages along a dangerous and treacherous road: from a single house to a bustling metropolis.</li>
<li>Construct a range of facilities (inns, libraries, post offices, temples, blacksmiths etc) and watch villagers move in independently.</li>
<li>Keep your villagers happy to collect gratitude, and use it to host festivals which bedeck your village in bunting!</li>
<li>Recruit and upgrade soldiers to defend your village from undead, bandits, fairies, and demons. Join them in battle if that's your thing!</li>
<li>Hire heroes to lead the charge against your foes and destroy their strongholds.</li>
<li>Decide on building low-tech villages with few needs, or risk it big by aiming for high-tech villages with needy villagers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Denuvo announced Denuvo SecureDLC to protect DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Denuvo is not exactly something any gamer I've ever seen be happy about and now it's growing and will likely appear in more games, with the announcement of Denuvo SecureDLC.</p>
<p>Irdeto said in the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2471835/0/en/Denuvo-by-Irdeto-launches-Denuvo-SecureDLC-the-industry-s-first-solution-to-protect-downloadable-content-against-piracy.html" target="_blank">press release</a> it's "the first of its kind in the gaming market and provides opportunities to extend the revenue tail for developers and publishers past the initial launch window".</p>
<p>The main target here appears to be free to play games that offer up DLC and micro-transactions to unlock various features, cosmetics and so on with SecureDLC being positioned to protect against piracy there. So Irdeto are hoping that developers will pick SecureDLC to deal with it apparently becoming "easy to bypass the existing barriers that try to secure DLCs on popular gaming platforms like Steam and Epic" as they found "players can automatically generate and install programs that access downloadable content without paying for it".</p>
<p>According to Reinhard Blaukovitsch, Managing Director at Denuvo by Irdeto, the new technology is already being successfully used with the current Denuvo Anti-Tamper clients: “Denuvo has become a one-stop shop for game developers to ensure the safety of their game against cheating, tampering, and piracy and to protect the gaming experience. Our current clients, big and small, are ecstatic with the results and we are happy to help them maximize revenue and also enable new business models for these games they spent so much effort building.”</p>

      <title>Play as a sarcastic cow in the comedy adventure A Trail of Ooze </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Trail of Ooze is an upcoming comedy adventure where you take on the role of a sarcastic cow who attempts to find their missing human farmer. It honestly sounds quite hilarious and the story sounds like something that I feel I need to play through.</p>
<p>"Majros, the cow, lives on a small farm in the middle of the Swedish forests oblivious to the struggles of the outside world - until genetically engineered chemicals spread across the farm. All animals and plants mutate and gain human-like consciousness and the farmer, who witnessed it all, is kidnapped by agents from the evil agrochemical corporation. So, Majros sets out on a rescue mission following a trail of the chemical ooze. On her adventure she unravels conspiracies, battles social injustices and comes face to face with environmental disaster. Forced to leave her safe bubble, Majros learns that no cow or story is only black and white and that she cannot make it alone against the insidious corporation."</p>

      <title>itch.io are hosting a big Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade in the USA that threatens to remove access to abortions a bunch of indie developers have pulled together to make an <a href="https://itch.io/b/1472/indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds" target="_blank">Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</a> on itch.io.</p>
<p>Much like itch.io did with previous charity bundles like for Racial Justice and Equality, Palestinian Aid, Ukraine Relief and others all the funds will be going to select charities and you can donate while also grabbing a big bunch of games, game assets, physical games to print and much more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>100% of the proceeds from this bundle will go to the National Network for Abortion Fund's <a href="http://nnaf.org/collectivepowerfund" target="_blank">Collective Power Fund</a>, which moves money <em><strong>directly</strong></em> to abortion funds across 20+ U.S. states, with a particular focus on the South and Midwest (where it is often most difficult to get access to abortions). NNAF’s partnerships with these abortion funds provide direct resources and funds to many of the people most impacted by Roe v. Wade, towards immediate action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's included is pretty great too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haque</li>
<li>Pushamo</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw</li>
<li>Bleed</li>
<li>Bleed 2</li>
<li>Buck Up and Drive!</li>
<li>Calico</li>
<li>…and the list goes on</li>
</ul>
<p>It has a minimum payment of $10 but you can donate more and they will be adding more items to the bundle up to July 6th. The bundle runs for another 9 days.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 515.57 and Vulkan Beta 515.49.06 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Multiple driver updates have been released by NVIDIA for Linux recently so here's a look at what's new in each.</p>
<p>First up, for those of you sticking with the "Latest Production Branch" <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/190425/en-uk" target="_blank">version 515.57</a> went up on June 28th which is mainly just fixing up some issues and getting them working nicely. Here's what's new:</p>
<div class="tabcontent" id="tab1_content" style="visibility: visible; display: block;">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some graphics applications to crash when they are started while nvidia-drm.ko is not loaded.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where NvFBC could return an incorrect frame if a capture request timed out.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where NvFBC direct capture would wait for multiple queued frames to finish rendering, instead of returning the next rendered frame.</li>
<li>Added support for NvFBC direct capture to composite the mouse cursor onto frames.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Vulkan direct to display could not drive more than 4 displays from a single VkInstance.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-settings from accurately reflecting changes to some configuration properties.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, we missed covering that NVIDIA also updated the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> during June. Version 515.49.05 on June 17th added support for the new open source kernel modules (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">more on that here</a>) plus these additions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier</a> [Linux]</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fix the depth and stencil clear color for dynamic rendering</li>
<li>Fix possible corruption when the shading rate image is changed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On July 2nd version 515.49.06 also went up with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_shader_module_identifier</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with image copy when one of the formats is a single-plane interleaved video format</li>
<li>Fixed issue with vkCmdResetEvent on compute queues</li>
<li>Fixed regression with tessellation mode set be the tessellation control shader</li>
<li>Fixed issue with underestimate conservative rasterization sometimes not working correctly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want a stable experience, just stick with the mainline drivers as the Vulkan Beta is aimed at developers who need to test out the latest Vulkan extensions.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.12 is out now for improving Windows compatibility on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another two weeks have gone by so the Wine hackers have put out their latest development work with <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.12" target="_blank">Wine 7.12</a> now available.</p>
<p>This is the Windows compatibility layer that allows you to run various applications and games on Linux (and forms part of Steam Play Proton). Once a year or so, a new stable release is made but the development versions are usually fine to use.</p>
<p>Wine 7.12 highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Theming support for Qt5 applications.</li>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.4.</li>
<li>Improved effect support in Direct2D.</li>
<li>QWORD support in registry tools.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the bug fixes for this release include issues solved for Star Citizen, Shogun Total War 2, Argentum 20, Wireshark and others.</p>
<p>Recently they also had the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/news/2022062201" target="_blank">vkd3d 1.4</a> release of their Direct3D to Vulkan translation library (not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton) which included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Many improvements to the HLSL compiler.</li>
<li>A new descriptor heap implementation using the VK_EXT_descriptor_indexing extension.</li>
<li>A new fence implementation using the VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore extension.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux share on Steam hits highest peak in years thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> is out for June 2022, putting the Linux user share at one of its highest ever points and likely thanks to the rise of the Steam Deck and SteamOS. As shown on our dedicated <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>, it's been trending upwards for quite a while but this latest figure is a pretty good showing.</p>
<p>As of June 2022, Linux is sitting at <u><strong>1.18%</strong></u> of the Steam user share.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119921521656754277gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119921521656754277gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Now, that doesn't sound like a lot on paper, but it puts the monthly active Linux user count at around 1,557,600 at least (based on when Valve last gave the monthly active user count).</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of the most popular Linux systems:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Arch Linux" 64 bit 11.42% -1.43%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 10.11% -0.98%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64 bit 9.90% +1.86%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS 64 bit 9.73% -2.02%</li>
<li>"SteamOS Holo" 64 bit 7.58% +2.35%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 20.3 64 bit 6.45% +0.48%</li>
<li>Description:Freedesktop.org 21.08.14 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.05% +6.05%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.79% +4.79%</li>
<li>Other 33.96% -11.11%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So you can pretty plainly see that the Steam Deck with SteamOS is already rising up the ranks, as one of the most popular Linux gaming systems on Steam's survey with it already making up well over 7% of Linux players which is a nice increase from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/steam-deck-already-hits-over-5-of-linux-users-on-steam/" target="_blank">5% from May 2022</a>.</p>

      <title>Crypt of the NecroDancer gets a BIG surprise update with more to come</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer from Brace Yourself Games is a truly wonderful mix of dungeon crawling and a rhythm game that released back in 2015. It just got a huge surprise update and more is on the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer is an award winning hardcore roguelike rhythm game. Move on the beat to navigate an ever changing dungeon while battling dancing skeletons, zombies, dragons, and more. Groove to the epic Danny Baranowsky soundtrack, or select songs from your own MP3 collection!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A no beat mode, to make it easier for some players.</li>
<li>Save and Quit anytime.</li>
<li>Reduced loading time.</li>
<li>Improved controller support via Steam Input, with gamepad-specific button symbols and Steam Deck support.</li>
<li>An overhauled custom music system supporting MP3, OGG and FLAC formats.</li>
<li>Linux gets a Native file-picker for custom music.</li>
<li>New and Improved Co-op.</li>
<li>A new level editor.</li>
<li>Added a fully redesigned mod loader and modding menus.</li>
<li>And loads more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that this is only the start, I'm very curious to see what they have cooking up as they said " this is a precursor to something bigger coming your way, and we want to make sure that we address some of the community’s most significant feedback before we get there".</p>
<p>Since I love the game (although I am horrible at it), I wanted to see how it was on the Steam Deck now so here's a little attempt at it today:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XsnzdN0J6Qo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d0247f465b2c68af9d257e4be86b093.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XsnzdN0J6Qo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Don't judge me, I'm rubbish but it's such a gem.</em></p>
<p>There does seem to be a bug with the Steam Input configuration though. I had to pick a different profile, then back to the new official one for it to actually detect input. Apart from that it seems great on Deck.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/crypt_of_the_necrodancer" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/crypt-of-the-necrodancer?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GOG finally remove the false &#34;in progress&#34; note about GOG Galaxy for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems at some point over the last month or two, GOG finally removed the "in progress" notice for GOG Galaxy coming to Linux.</p>
<p>Something that was a bit <em>overdue</em>, since they clearly have no plans to actually bring GOG Galaxy to Linux despite it being the <a href="https://www.gog.com/wishlist/galaxy" target="_blank">most voted-for</a> feature request for many years. GOG and CD Projekt never really took it seriously though, with even the official Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1012760227148587009" target="_blank">trolling</a> "We can assure you: it‘s not us. We are the driving force behind 'add Linux support for GOG Galaxy' though" in reply to GOG post about showing 2077 gameplay.</p>
<p>Every time I've spoken to the GOG team over the last few years, they just repeatedly told me it wasn't planned, despite the wishlist entry still listing it as "in progress" and their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2014/06/gogcom-announce-galaxy-their-optional-client-linux-support-to-come/" target="_blank">original announcement</a> mentioning it would come to Linux too and that it was "being done with PC, Mac and Linux in mind" (so much for that huh?).</p>
<p>At least there's applications like the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> that can help you manage your GOG games on Linux. Still, it would be nice if GOG at some point put some more resources into improving their Linux support. Plus, if you're going to be using a Steam Deck, buying from Steam just makes a lot more sense when it's far easier to access so I imagine that's eventually going to cost GOG a few more sales too and they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">not exactly doing well</a>.</p>
<p>It is a shame for those that want the Galaxy client, as I actually love what GOG do. The main idea that you can just log in and download a full offline installer is great and their repeated revivals of old games is wonderful too. But without Galaxy, some games end up missing features for Linux or just skipping a Linux build entirely on GOG.</p>

      <title>AK-xolotl mixes the incredibly cute with the deadly in this rogue-lite shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AK-xolotl is an upcoming rogue-lite that answers the question of: what happens if you gave an axolotl an AK? Someone must have asked that somewhere.</p>
<p>Currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter with a few days left, it appears to be rather popular and it was initially funded in only 4 hours. The developer is planning full Native Linux support too so I've no idea how I missed this one originally because the idea is nuts and it looks gorgeous too. Mixing together procedurally generated biomes with handcrafted layouts, it seems like it will have a lot of replay value too. You also get to unlock various powers and the game evolves as you progress through it.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper hits 1 million sales in only a few months</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pugstorm and Fireshine Games have announced that their game Core Keeper has managed to hit 1 million sales only a few months after entering Early Access. This follows on from the rather large Sunken Sea Update that released in the middle of June.</p>
<p>Nice to see another fully supported Native Linux indie game doing so well. Here's what they said about the impressive milestone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re delighted to announce that, shortly after the launch of The Sunken Sea Update - our first major content update - Core Keeper hit 1,000,000 sales. This is a momentous occasion for us as developers and for our publisher, Fireshine Games. In fact, Core Keeper previously set the record for being Fireshine Games’ fastest-selling digital game of all time by selling 100,000 copies within its first two days of Early-Access launch.<br/>
<br/>
We’re truly overwhelmed by the fantastic community response that Core Keeper has had, and we’re thrilled to have hit this milestone so early on in the games’ development. Launching in Early Access has given us a unique opportunity to involve the community in major game decisions and collaborate with them on improvements and optimisations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember all that talk about the indiepocalypse? We seem to be hearing more and more about games doing so well, and a lot of them come from smaller teams like this too. Just like Valheim managed to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/valheim-is-absolutely-smashing-it-with-10-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank">sell over 10 million copies</a>, it just goes to show that some good marketing and an actually good game will clearly sell.</p>

      <title>Free and open source arena shooter Xonotic 0.8.5 now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love some fast-paced first-person shooting action? Xonotic (a fork of the original Nexuiz) has a brand new release available with tons of improvements.</p>
<p>This is a pretty big release for the project touching on nearly every part of the gameplay, with some big tech changes behind the scenes too. Thousands of changes for better and more refined gameplay, new and updated maps and player models, new sound effects, much more dangerous bots, a new HUD, more translations and so much more.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't play online, the changes to bots will be most welcome. Not only have they tweaked their difficulty but various bug fixes came in like underwater navigation, they will no longer get stuck in bad spots, they can properly jump and crouch, they have an improved ability to avoid danger while running and bunny hopping and they're better at chasing enemies down too.</p>
<p>It should be a bit easier to pick out players / bots from the maps to actually shoot them too thanks to improved visibility, plus new and improved primary shirt and secondary glow colouring on some models and they fixed primary and secondary colours getting mixed up.</p>
<p>Two new maps made it in too with Bromine by <em>packer</em>, a rusty styled map for large games!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14047883451656668217gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14047883451656668217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Opium by <em>cityy</em>, a medium sized level with plenty of vertical action!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17338397121656668236gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17338397121656668236gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Various other maps saw updates, there's refreshed weapon and item sound effects to help you better distinguish them during combat and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>A massive release overall and you can see all the changes in the <a href="https://xonotic.org/posts/2022/xonotic-0-8-5-release/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two big updates have rolled out for the Steam Deck which includes an opt-in Beta SteamOS 3.3 upgrade, plus there's also a Steam Deck Beta Client update.</p>
<p>First up, the Beta <u><strong>Client</strong></u> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3323108691056012032" target="_blank">update</a> brings in these fixes:</p>

</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_Whyj8"><strong>Steam Input</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Added missing Deck buttons for Gyro Enable and Button Chord options</li>
<li>Added support for game-bundled Virtual Menu icons in the in-game Deck UI</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Simplified Chinese (Pinyin), Traditional Chinese (Pinyin, Zhuyin, and Cangjie), Japanese, and Korean keyboards. We are still refining these keyboards, please provide feedback in the forums.</li>
<li>Re-enabled the Adaptive Backlight feature.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for SteamOS 3.3 Beta itself <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3410929607716145819/" target="_blank">here's all</a> that was added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean keyboard. These keyboards are now available in Steam Client Beta</li>

<li>Fixed audio output with some 32-bit games that use ALSA</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like Valve have been hard at work to improve much of the experience overall on the Steam Deck, this makes me very happy since I boot mine up every day without fail, it really is my main gaming machine now outside of times where it doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>In other Steam deck news, here's a few recent big bits you might have missed:</p>

      <title>Anti-cheat work on Warhammer: Vermintide 2 for Steam Deck &amp; Linux &#39;on hold&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's supposed to be relatively easy for games with anti-cheat like BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat to get working on Linux and Steam Deck, some developers are having issues like Fatshark with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552500/Warhammer_Vermintide_2/" target="_blank">Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>.</p>
<p>This particular game uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which is supposed to be a case of ticking a few boxes and making sure things are in the right place to allow EAC to work with Steam Play Proton but it turns out it might not be that simple for every game. A shame, but not a big surprise, as if it was truly that simple for every game more would have done it by now, and considering how big game projects and code are, there's likely plenty of smaller gotchas developers need to deal with.</p>
<p>A rep from Fatshark posted on the Steam forum to give an update on the work to get Warhammer: Vermintide 2 playable and it's not good news. Despite chatting to Epic and Valve, they couldn't figure it out and now their team is working on the upcoming Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.</p>
<p>Here's what <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=26#c3419936604888208895" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So we have performed all the requisite steps to have this work. We've ticked the boxes in the EAC portal, included the files in the appropriate places. Problem is, as you can see, it doesn't work in this scenario. We've been in touch with both third parties (in this case Epic and Valve), but we're at a bit of a roadblock truth be told. Those who would work on really digging in to the weeds on this are indeed digging in to Darktide weeds, so aren't able to spend sufficient time liaising with Valve and Epic to figure out what's causing the 'simple steps' to not be as simple as they sounded.<br/>
<br/>
In short, work on this is on hold for now. We'll bark up this thread should things spin up again.</p>

      <title>Strategy-survival game Dice Tribes: Ambitions gets a Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dice Tribes: Ambitions is a pretty interesting looking strategy survival game mix, where you move dice around to keep your tribe and village going. It might not sound or even look like much but it seems like it might surprise you with the mechanics involved.</p>
<p>It's not a particularly well-known game and so far it only has around 23 Steam user reviews, but they are 100% positive. If you're after something different, perhaps this is one to give a go? The developer also just recently updated the game to provide a Native Linux build too. The developer describes it as a "dice worker placement game".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VZHV0iOyxHs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46012b5a36967e70483f21db02319ce0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VZHV0iOyxHs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with a small number of villagers, you will need to manage them and grow the tribes in order to complete one of the ambitions. Opportunities and Dangers lies ahead and you will need to dispatch your villagers to take care of them. Prepare your villagers as you attempt to complete one of the ambition to win the game.</p>
<p>Key Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose from one of 6 tribes, each with their own village building.</li>
<li>Choose from more than 15 different structures and construct them to aid in your Ambition.</li>
<li>Choose from one of many ambitions to complete, including hidden ones.</li>
<li>Draft mode that forces you to adapt to different restrictions and challenges.</li>
</ul>

      <title>73 of the top 100 most popular Steam games are playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a little while since checking how well the top 100 most played games on Steam work on Linux and the Steam Deck, so here's a fresh run over the list for you.</p>
<p>For those who just want the official numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>28 - Verified</li>
<li>45 - Playable</li>
<li>22 - Unsupported</li>
<li>5 - Unchecked</li>
</ul>
<p>So officially <u>73</u> of the top 100 will work on the Steam Deck currently. Any game that is playable on Steam Deck will be playable on Linux desktops too (minus perhaps some very rare exceptions). However, if you take into account ratings also from <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and some personal testing, the number will be likely a little higher especially for those Valve has not yet tested.</p>
<p>Here's the full list below, which is a snapshot taken today (June 30th, 2022). Since it's based on player-counts it fluctuates but not massively so, and it's more the bottom few that move in and out the rest just switch positions.</p>

<p>As pretty much expected, the biggest culprit of what's not playable is issues with Anti-Cheat. Despite Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye supporting Linux and the Steam Deck, there's still a lot of issues there with developers either not updating or having trouble with the integration so it's an uphill struggle there.</p>
<p>For games that are listed as Playable some of the biggest issues there are a mixture of things like: launchers being a nuisance, on-screen keyboard needing to be pulled up manually, no gamepad support and text that's too small. For developers, it often doesn't take much to bump up from Playable to Verified and lots of them have been putting in the effort, which you can see across many articles in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" target="_blank">the Steam Deck tag</a>.</p>
<p>Some games tagged as Unsupported may also appear to work fine, but there's a few cases where they can end up very unstable later on (like Forza Horizon 4). So even if you might think an Unsupported title is wrong, it might not be.</p>

      <title>AOKZOE are the latest to attempt a Steam Deck rival with the AOKZOE A1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AOKZOE will be jumping in the handheld ring with their upcoming AOKZOE A1 AMD Ryzen 7 6800U portable that will offer either Windows 11 or SteamOS to perhaps rival the Steam Deck. They're a rather new company, so everything they're talking about and showing off should be taken with a rather large pinch of salt.</p>
<p>To go against the Steam Deck though they're not only going to have to be able to ship a lot of units, but actually have a price-point that isn't ridiculous like some other vendors. Considering Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">ramping up shipments now</a>, how is a brand new vendor going to cope?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAeZ8ABXx8s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d58a898743dbba90abc99a7ff8f58712.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAeZ8ABXx8s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The specifications they list:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A combo of AMD Ryzen 7 6800U | Radeon 680M | LPDDR5X (Freq. 6400)</li>
<li>8-inch IPS Screen, sRGB 100％, 1920 x 1200</li>
<li>Windows 11 or Steam OS</li>
<li>RGB Breathing Lighting</li>
<li>PD Charge</li>
<li>Gyroscope</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zMMbfJ_JXos"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9b5e819013ed03e12f0baa888934cdd9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zMMbfJ_JXos" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said it will go up for pre-order in July and it's scheduled to start shipping in September.</p>
<p>I'm pretty skeptical of this, since they just popped up out of nowhere but perhaps worth keeping an eye on. Price is going to be the biggest question and currently they're not telling. Even so, if it was reasonably priced, trust is perhaps the second biggest question with such a new vendor.</p>

      <title>Some Steam Decks ship with an x2 SSD instead of an x4 SSD</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve made a change to the specifications of the top two versions of the Steam Deck last month, which it seems plenty of people (including me) completely missed. It's not a massive change but still one to be aware of as not all Decks are the same.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is split across three models either with a 64 GB eMMC, 256 GB NVMe SSD or a 512 GB NVMe SSD (and the top model has the anti-glare etched screen too). Sometime around May 28th though, the SSDs shipping in the Steam Deck changed and now come in <em>two</em> possible editions and you won't know what you have until you get it and check.</p>
<p>On the specifications page, it now lists this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>64 GB eMMC (PCIe Gen 2 x1)</li>
<li>256 GB NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*)</li>
<li>512 GB high-speed NVMe SSD (PCIe Gen 3 x4 or PCIe Gen 3 x2*)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With Valve noting "*Some 256GB and 512GB models ship with a PCIe Gen 3 x2 SSD. In our testing, we did not see any impact to gaming performance between x2 and x4".</p>
<p><em>You can see the change thanks to the Wayback Machine on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220527060926/https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection_24468" target="_blank">May 27th</a> and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220528095946/https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck#SaleSection_24468" target="_blank">May 28th</a>.</em></p>
<p>Really, it shouldn't make all that much of a difference, especially considering the Micro SD slot can load and run even some of the highest-end games just fine. This is quite likely one of the ways Valve has been able to ramp up production to ship <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">more than double each week</a>, along with the two different fan models you might also see.</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a first gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Return to Monkey Island, the continuation of the story from he Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge now has a first gameplay trailer. With a return of series creator Ron Gilbert and developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games, it's certainly an exciting game to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Today, Devolver Digital released the first trailer you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="p3mxq44HhnU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8beb1ca0f98b70fcfed7ee8998cddbf2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/p3mxq44HhnU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’.<br/>
<br/>
Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't quite know what platforms it will be on yet as it's all "TBA" (to be announced).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060130/Return_to_Monkey_Island/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Pocket Wheels looks like a fun toy-car playground that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocket Wheels looks like what you could imagine in your mind when playing with toy cars as a child and it's on the way to Linux with Native support.</p>
<p>A mixture of a 3D platformer and a racing game, inspired by "90s collectathons". In the game you control a toy car that can jump, glide and there's even a grappling hook. The idea is to give you a big playground to race and fly through, just like you always dreamed of right? You get various vehicles to unlock too and there's a number of different rooms each with their own race tracks, objectives and collectibles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZFJocKALaQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b312d3d04043a78170792670e626c55.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZFJocKALaQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This looks like pure joy. Reminds me a little of classic Micro Machines games!</p>
<p>Speaking on the Steam forum, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1129360/discussions/0/5755024051061146444/#c3419934814486215419" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that while it works with Proton already they are "working on a native Build for the future" and they're testing it on the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>Onsen Master blends Overcooked with Spirited Away and releases soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending the frantic action from the Overcooked series with inspiration taken from Studio Ghibli film Spirited Away, the upcoming Linux Native game Onsen Master looks like fun.</p>
<p>Onsen Master features arcade-style single and two-player co-op, where players must manage the customers of their hot springs, and prepare and put together the correct ingredients to cure their ailments. Running around the hot springs, wrangling wandering customers, and putting the right concoctions into the right baths can be hectic enough already, but troublesome yokai look to impede players' service as well.</p>
<p>A new trailer was also sent out recently that you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BhyerDH382k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2804f7d21f00dac49b9481ae1e558a0c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BhyerDH382k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Spring Fling:</strong> Experience a short and sweet story for up to two players, and unveil the island of Izajima in a visual novel style narrative with a cute anime aesthetic.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>The Customer is Always Right: </strong>Skip the story and dive right in with Arcade Mode! Choose one of the six hot spring levels to put your customer service skills to the test.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>The Heat is On: </strong>Take on others in a competitive couch multiplayer mode where players must each work to manage their customers within the same hot spring.</li>
<li style="text-align:left"><strong>Spa Music: </strong>An original soundtrack full of tunes akin to a Feudal fairytale, composed by Dorrell Ettienne.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left">How did the idea come about? The concept for Onsen Master dates back to 2015, when Waking Oni Games founder Derrick Fields was inspired by their regular rewatches of Spirited Away, specifically a section of the film in which the protagonist is working with spirits at a bathhouse. This formed the basis of Onsen Master’s hot spring customer management gameplay, and also the Japanese setting and aesthetic of the game. After five years of development, a successful Kickstarter campaign and beta period, and the partnership with Whitethorn Games, Onsen Master is finally ready to release "this month" they said (although it's now the end of June and a date hasn't actually been given yet).</p>

      <title>Fech The Ferret is an upcoming vibrant parkour rhythm-platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your musical games and want to get into the rhythm? Fech The Ferret looks like a pretty clever blending of ideas.</p>
<p>It's a fast-paced parkour platformer with seriously vibrant and inviting colours. The hook here is that the faster you go, the better the music gets. A mixture of high speed 3D platforming and rhythmic subtones inside of a colorful open world. The developer emailed in about it, making it clear they fully support Linux with a Native build and there's also a demo available to try right now.</p>
<p>"Fech The Ferret especially caters to those who gotta go fast and would rather climb walls than do precise platforming, but you can also enjoy it at your own pace and explore this rich world in search of secrets, or perhaps chat with some Marmocleans."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qft8MGMVnLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5b8aa18f4e95bbe0420a59896e1cd2ad.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qft8MGMVnLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like a fun idea, so will be keeping an eye on this one. If you do give it a go, let us know what you think in the comments, it's fun to see more music games come along for sure.</p>
<p>You can try out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382980/Fech_The_Ferret/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> and also <a href="https://raoulwb.itch.io/fech-the-ferret" target="_blank">follow on itch.io</a> too.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a set of nice bug fixes in a new client update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Deck Client Update is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3323108691045398493" target="_blank">out now</a> pulling in some rather useful sounding bug fixes. They've actually slowed down a little on the updates now, which is actually good to see so hopefully there's something a little bigger cooking in the Valve oven once again.</p>
<p>Here's what's new from the June 28th update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where clicking in-game links when offline would get Steam Deck into a bad state</li>
<li>Fixed navigation issues in the game EULA dialog</li>
<li>Fixed crashing issue when deleting a screenshot</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator failing to load when Steam Cloud is disabled</li>
<li>Fixed configurator failing to load when encountering corrupted controller layout files</li>
<li>Fixed controller virtual menus being limited to 4 active menus</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing the touchscreen to occasionally be stuck in mouse-emulation mode when accessing the configurator in-game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there anything specific you're wanting to be added or fixed on the Steam Deck? Let us know in the comments. I'm off to go update mine now…</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, from Thursday June 30th Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-to-ship-more-than-double-the-number-of-steam-decks-each-week/" target="_blank">will be doubling</a> the number of Steam Decks going out each time as production has ramped up. A designer at Valve also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-designer-warns-people-not-to-put-2242-m2-drives-in-their-steam-deck/" target="_blank">warned against</a> sticking in SSDs that are too big.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we say goodbye to Q2 and hello to Q3, Valve has confirmed that production of Steam Deck units has increased to the point where they're going to be sending out a lot more.</p>

<p>Hello! Some great news on the production front. We just sent the last batch of Q2 emails, and we’ll start sending Q3 reservation emails on the 30th. Production has picked up, and after today we'll be shipping more than double the number of Steam Decks every week!</p>

      <title>Kingdoms and Castles gets Steam Deck and gamepad support, VR version coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A little castle building and AI conquering on the go? Kingdoms and Castles already worked great on Linux with the Native version and now it should be great on the Steam Deck too. Only recently they put out a huge update to the game with AI Kingdoms too.</p>
<p>The developer said they "worked hard to implement intuitive gamepad controls that make it easy to build and manage your kingdom and we've tweaked the UI to work well for the Deck's screen size". It won't mess with anyone using a mouse so no worries there but it also means on PC overall you get gamepad support if you want it. You just need to tick Console Controls in the options (default on Deck).</p>
<p>Here's a short demo of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rDJthIdBdac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce09dcce60ad7c41abdc7a671fc527ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rDJthIdBdac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they've teased these are coming next for the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Fixing bugs - you may have noticed a few small hotpatches over the past few weeks, more to come soon.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">New stuff for the AI Kingdoms based on your feedback so far (for example, getting that pesky aggressive AI to stop asking for tribute after defeating them in a war, and being able to demand tribute yourself).</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">VR version of the game - this is well underway and feels really cool. We'll have some progress to show here soon.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>CorsixTH the modern game engine for Theme Hospital v0.66 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CorsixTH is the absolute best way to play the classic Theme Hospital on any modern system and version 0.66 is now out.</p>
<p>While there's the newer Two Point Hospital from some of the original team, you're simply never going to beat Theme Hospital in my heart since not only is nostalgia at play but it remains a highly enjoyable sim thanks to it being such a great game at the time. CorsixTH keeping it a live with plenty of enhancements helps too of course.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10003537161656342269gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10003537161656342269gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in v0.66-beta1 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Direct Zoom has been improved and is now enabled by default</li>
<li>Nurses can now leave the ward without disturbing her patients</li>
<li>Patients with Serious Radiation now glow a beautiful shade of green</li>
<li>Patients with Jellyitis now wobble wobble wobble</li>
<li>The Hotkeys menu has been overhauled to make it easier to use</li>
<li>You can now reset your zoom level by pressing '0'</li>
<li>A new fax code cheat has been added!</li>
<li>The replace machine prompt will now tell you the new strength before purchase (can be disabled in configuration settings)</li>
<li>A machine's dynamic info will tell you the strength a machine can be upgraded to if you replaced it (can be disabled in configuration settings)</li>
<li>Improved pee and vomit conditions</li>
<li>Patients will no longer queue for reception until nearby</li>
<li>The Adviser will no longer queue repetitive messages</li>
<li>Dropdown menus will now close when clicked outside of</li>
<li>Non-visual diseases can now be delayed in the level config of a custom game</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus the usual assorted bug fixes. It's mostly the same as the Beta release I covered back in May, plus a few additional fixes that were discovered during testing. Not many changelogs will give you the likes of improved peeing and vomiting but here we are, what a gem.</p>

      <title>Pokete is a Pokemon-like game for your terminal</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fancy catching some creatures? How about directly in your terminal window? Pokete is a free and open source Pokemon-like. Just like the classics it features various creatures across different types like Plant, Water, Fire and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>It's currently in active development but it's already quite playable with a long list of features. In the last month it only just had another major release adding in smarter NPCs, achievements, fights with multiple Poketes, in-game time for day and night Poketes encounters and you now get transported to safety if all your Poketes faint during a battle just like a certain other game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7022901491656337431gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7022901491656337431gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5252310631656337431gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5252310631656337431gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pretty fun idea for a terminal game really, can't wait to watch it evolve.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/lxgr-linux/pokete" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.lxgr_linux.pokete" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>Spaceship building game Reassembly goes 64bit, gets Linux and Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reassembly is a highly rated game that mixes spaceship building, exploration and intense combat. It's quite a little gem and has a big update out now. One I was somewhat addicted to back when it originally released in 2015.</p>
<p>With a lot of variety on the parts available to build you ships, it's a little like snapping together LEGO. If you love space combat and building, it's one to check out. Quite amazing to see it still continue to be updated this long after release. As on June 24th here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add 64 bit windows binaries. Should improve performance a bit, especially when many mods are installed.</li>
<li>Add 64 bit linux binaries, and update linux compiler to gcc-9. Linux support now requires a 64 bit OS.</li>
<li>Update mac compiler. Now requires OSX 10.12.</li>
<li>Multi-threaded ship loading. Noticeably faster loading when many mods are installed</li>
<li>UI fixes for steam deck. Scrolling credits with bigger fonts, move some "flying" controls into "advanced", open the on-screen keyboard when relevant, etc.</li>
<li>Fix corruption crash when an explosion creates more explosions</li>
<li>Replace libcurl with cpphhtplib. Should be transparent, and fix some linux issues related to out of date libcrypt etc.</li>
<li>Fix AI for rocket turrets</li>
<li>Fix dancing thruster bug</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Valve has currently rated it was "Playable" for the Steam Deck.</em></p>

      <title>Tactical 2D RPG &#39;Arcadian Atlas&#39; has a new trailer, releasing in 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If the big upcoming update to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/into-the-breach-advanced-edition-releases-july-19th-as-a-free-update/" target="_blank">Into the Breach</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/gorgeous-turn-based-tactics-game-tyrants-blessing-releases-in-august/" target="_blank">Tyrant's Blessing</a> wasn't enough tactics for you, how about a little Arcadian Atlas. Another that was crowdfunded on Kickstarter with $95,204 this one definitely needs to be on your wishlist.</p>
<p>"Arcadian Atlas is a unique, narrative-driven isometric tactical RPG set in Arcadia, a nation tearing itself apart via political and familial factions, nefarious plots, treacherous alliances and clandestine intrigues just as ancient evil forces begin to awaken. With a queen willing to do anything to ascend to the throne, no one is safe."</p>
<p>You build up a party from more than 12 custom classes, with each having their own unique skill types and equipment. It's very character-driven, with the developer explaining that every action during battle will count as "just one wrong move could tear your family, its political alliances and the land itself apart for good".</p>

      <title>Low-poly 3D rail shooter Ex-Zodiac hits Early Access on July 21st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice little early birthday present for me, Ex-Zodiac is a low-poly 3D rail shooter (think like Star Fox) that now has a release date. It's going to release with Native Linux support on July 21st, following on from the successful Kickstarter campaign back in 2020.</p>
<p>With the initial release it will have 6 main stages and 6 bonus stages, which the publisher said brings "the 80's/90's nostalgia to a new level".</p>
<p>See one of the original trailers below but there's a newer sneak-peak on <a href="https://twitter.com/BenHickling/status/1539275535301353474" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style</li>
<li>12 main levels (plus secret areas and side-paths)</li>
<li>Multiple routes to complete the game</li>
<li>Major bosses at the end of each level, each piloted by a member of the Zodiac</li>
<li>A 16-bit style soundtrack by +TEK combining FM and wavetable synthesis</li>

      <title>Valve designer warns people not to put 2242 M.2 drives in their Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, one <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1539296261613944833" target="_blank">modder</a> decided to stick a bigger 2242 M.2 SSD into their Steam Deck and after many other bigger PC sites picked it up — a Valve designer has warned people not to do it.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck was designed to specifically fit the much smaller 2230 M.2 and while it appears the 2242 can work, this appears to be a case of being so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. <em>To completely pinch a quote from Jurassic Park.</em></p>
<p>Designer Lawrence Yang said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1540809830000013313" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-1dbjc4n">
<div class="css-1dbjc4n r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-901oao r-1nao33i r-37j5jr r-1blvdjr r-16dba41 r-vrz42v r-bcqeeo r-bnwqim r-qvutc0" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__nly0s773drk" lang="en">Hi, please don’t do this. The charger IC gets very hot and nearby thermal pads should not be moved. In addition, most 2242 m.2 drives draw more power and get hotter than what Deck is designed for. This mod may appear to work but will significantly shorten the life of your Deck.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The modder <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSmcelrea/status/1541160087900901376" target="_blank">replied</a> to agree too.</em></p>
<p>Remember, Valve did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/get-a-look-inside-the-steam-deck-in-valves-latest-video/" target="_blank">their own</a> teardown of the device but repeatedly told people to leave things to the professionals. However, they also teamed up with iFixit to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/the-official-ifixit-launch-for-steam-deck-parts-and-repair-guides-is-live/" target="_blank">offer spare parts</a> too.</p>
<p>Best to stick to the smaller 2230 series if you really wish to open it up and put a bigger one in, <em>or</em> just put in a good Micro SD that works well and still loads everything quickly. Don't go following every crazy idea you see online, even when big sites report on it.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells gets a huge free accessibility upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells is a great game. Not only does it look great but the action is awesome. However, it is rather difficult and for some nearly impossible so the developers have put out a huge free upgrade to help more people play it.</p>
<p>A rather admirable update really, as accessibility should never be looked down upon and during their testing the developer said they received "pretty much zero negative feedback on the general options that we're introducing". However their new Assist Mode that gives multiple lives, auto-hitting and adjustable trap damage did receive community "pushback". Addressing that in an update they made it clear the whole point is to "let people to enjoy the game who would otherwise be excluded from doing so" and it's entirely optional.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Loads of new options to improve accessibility, such as adjustable font type &amp; size, input customisation and individual adjustment of sound effect volumes</li>
<li>Assist Mode including customisation of enemy health/damage, trap speed/damage and parry window. Plus options for multiple lives, auto-hit with primary weapon &amp; full map reveal</li>
<li>Big reduction in cell cost of early-game weapons</li>
<li>7 weapon reworks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Can't wait to dive back in with all this, sounds amazing.</p>

      <title>Grim Horde is chaotic and there&#39;s a good game hiding in there</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grim Horde is a game that released into Early Access with Native Linux support and it's another fast-paced rogue-lite hell in a slightly similar way to the chaos found in Vampire Survivors only you control a horde of minions.</p>
<p>You float around as a demon lord, lead armies and crush various villages and take on the pesky people in a sort-of auto-battling way. Since you mainly just control your demon lord, your army is running around doing the damage while you're trying to avoid arrows and all sorts.</p>
<p>Once you die you rise again and keep going. It could end up as another fun little game to keep coming back to once it has been further developed but there's a good idea for a game here I'm just not entirely sure on the execution of it just yet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZM0bVNjSsI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3f1410a779e92cfcdbe2bbd59624593b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZM0bVNjSsI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly rough around the edges and needs some work so I'll be keeping an eye on it.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962560/Grim_Horde/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Gorgeous turn-based tactics game Tyrant&#39;s Blessing releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from their successful Kickstarter campaign, Tyrant's Blessing now has a release date and a brand new trailer and it's looking rather good. Seems like a fun blending of styles from Final Fantasy Tactics and Into the Breach! It's confirmed to be launching on August 8th with Native Linux support and there's a demo available on Steam.</p>
<p>"Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LaFT1xdd_4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eae9b67780c2e015a2fa51c32829d3b9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LaFT1xdd_4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Decide whether to fight, rescue the living from the Undying, or gather your strength. Every choice matters throughout every day of the Uprising.</li>
<li>As you fight your way across the face of Tyberia, face off against random encounters that force difficult decisions. Do you intervene and fight highwaymen, putting your warriors at risk? Do you try to save a child, risking valuable time and resources? Only your morals and ideals hold the answer.</li>
<li>Pick your heroic roster carefully. Screeg, the elder wizard advising the Uprising, can only teleport three heroes and a pet at once: Do you send your elite warriors in? Or rookies to train and hold the line? Are they up to the task? Can you handle the consequences?</li>
<li>Enlist twenty hallowed heroes, each with a distinct set of abilities that can dramatically alter the course of any battle.</li>
<li>But stay mindful: Not all heroes appear in a playthrough - and not everyone is guaranteed to make it to the finish line of this quest.</li>
<li>Pick the right team for the task. An assassin may thrive in confined spaces, while an archer will suffer in close quarters. Some heroes may even bring their pets along, who might provide just enough leverage to win a battle for the group.</li>
<li>Even if heroes fall, they can still be freed from the Tyrant's grasp. Track them down, defeat them in combat, and restore them back to their stolen life!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve continues tweaking Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh update to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and they continue focusing on Steam Input improvements, to make playing it with a controller and the Steam Deck a better experience.</p>
<p>Seems they're trying to help controller players catch up at least a tiny bit with those using a mouse, with plenty of working going into changing how gyros work. Quite a small patch overall though but it sounds like some pretty fun and welcome changes, although Gyros Akimbo does sound somewhat hilarious.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck now allows other game controllers to be connected via Steam Input. All connected controllers combine inputs. (You can play with Gyros Akimbo if you are very cool).</li>
<li>“Pitch and Roll Combined” is the new default Gyro conversion on Steam Deck. All other controllers default to “Yaw”</li>
<li>Radial menus (in particular, Quick Buy radials) no longer persist when dying.</li>
<li>Some glyph fixes in Spectator mode.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I did try out CS:GO on Deck myself and was tempted to video it but lets just say it was embarrassing. It's a very tough game to really get into on a controller of any sort. If you have a Deck, have you been playing CS:GO on it? Let us know what your experience has been in the comments.</p>
<p>You can play<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/" target="_blank"> free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>With a quick script you can run Steam Deck Desktop Mode inside Gaming Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're going into ridiculous territory of tweaking now and the possibilities are seemingly endless on what you can do with the Steam Deck. You can even run the Desktop Mode inside of Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uddyat/desktop_mode_within_gaming_mode/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a>, the script is pretty simple and only needs you to add the commands into a text file, set it as executable and add it to Steam as a Non-Steam game. From there, you can launch and switch between desktop mode and games running in the background and it actually works. It's far from perfect with some issues where the desktop mode may freeze up so you need to quit it with certain games, and sometimes the mouse won't go to the very bottom but hey — this is the kind of awesome stuff you can do with Linux right?</p>
<p>Here's a brief demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3uJeqafjwsc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dfa99ec6e4a2899d865f1a40f46e2dcc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3uJeqafjwsc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Love it. If you try it, don't blame me if you break something. Just wanted to highlight something mildly amusing and also somewhat useful too.</p>

      <title>Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop devs detail their support of Proton and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563560/Alien_Swarm_Reactive_Drop/" target="_blank">Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop</a>, a community updated and expanded version of the free Alien Swarm originally by Valve continues to see lots of improvements. The developers also explained their clear support of Linux with Proton and the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Released by Valve originally in 2010, Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop continues the much lesser-known Valve title with an impressive set of extras. It doesn't have Native Linux support like other Valve titles and the Reactive Drop Team has explained it likely never will due to the specific Source engine build used. However "making the game run well on Proton was and continues to be a priority" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/4932019356819234637/" target="_blank">they say</a>.</p>
<p>A bunch of improvements also came along for gamepad and Steam Deck users including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved controller navigation order on several menus.</li>
<li>Made several in-game menus including the briefing menu navigable using ControllerFocus (the red/yellow flashing border).</li>
<li>Added controller button prompts to several places, including the game instructor.</li>
<li>Redesigned some menus entirely, such as the mission selection screen.</li>
<li>Enlarged the main font size on smaller resolutions.</li>
<li>Added a new radial menu system for selecting marines with the d-pad.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said to let them know if you have problems on Linux / Steam Deck in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/563560/discussions/2/4932019356819234637/" target="_blank">this thread in the forum</a>.</p>
<p>It's nice to see more developers do direct support like this. Here's a short video to show it working well:</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets Paladins working on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh upgrade for Proton Experimental on June 22nd which brings even more game compatibility to Linux desktops and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Listed as now playable as of this update includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rising of the Shield Hero: Relive The Animation</li>
<li>Paladins</li>
</ul>
<p>Paladins is an interesting one, as it was sort-of playable for a while using a few workarounds and an older version of GE-Proton but now having it in the official Proton is going to make it so much easier.</p>
<p>This update also solves Tekken 7 crashing at launch and more work has been done on video playback, with many games that previous requires special hacks in Proton no longer being required including: The Long Dark, Trailmakers, Surviving the Aftermath, Haven, TOHU, Hardspace: Shipbreaker, V Rising and more.</p>
<p>The changelog can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a> at any time.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>

<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's also a quick video overview and a short look at Paladins running on the Steam Deck. It's not perfected yet with a few issues remaining but it's starting to get there and performance seems good.</p>

      <title>AMD publishes the source code for FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As they promised they would, AMD has now officially published the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Effects/FidelityFX-FSR2" target="_blank">source code</a> for FidelityFX Super Resolution 2 (FSR 2) under an open source license. With it under the MIT license, developers can pretty much go nuts with it.</p>
<p>This tech is their newer and more advanced temporal upscaling solution, supporting the Vulkan and DirectX 12 graphics APIs, it's fully supported on Linux and works on different vendor GPUs (not just AMDs). AMD say it "uses cutting-edge temporal algorithms to reconstruct fine geometric and texture detail, producing anti-aliased output from aliased input". Developed from the ground-up, it's quite a big difference from FSR 1 to provide even better performance and clearer images. Developers can even use both since they're so different.</p>
<p>FSR 2 features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Temporal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Delivers similar or better than native image quality using temporal data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-aliasing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Includes high-quality anti-aliasing.
	<ul>
<li>FSR 2 replaces any TAA within the game frame.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>High image quality</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Higher image quality than FSR 1 technology at all quality presets/resolutions.
	<ul>
<li>Different quality modes available.</li>
<li>Dynamic Resolution Scaling supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No machine learning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does not require dedicated Machine Learning (ML) hardware.
	<ul>
<li>More platforms can benefit.</li>
<li>Gives more control to cater to a range of different scenarios.</li>
<li>Better ability to optimize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cross-platform</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Boosts framerates in supported games.
	<ul>
<li>Wide range of products and platforms, both AMD and select competitors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cyberpunk point and click adventure Born Punk is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Born Punk is a brand new cyberpunk point and click adventure from developer Insert Disk 22. It just released on Steam on June 18th and now a Native Linux version is also available. Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign, it's nice to see a trickle of games still coming from the crowdfunding platform.</p>
<p>"In Born Punk, the player slips into the role of three people (well, two people, depending on your stance on artificial lifeforms) living on the island: Eevi, a corporate combat hacker turned bartender down on her luck; Mariposa, the CEO of Bornholm's biggest corporation; and a malfunctioning android who calls himself Grandmaster Flashdrive.</p>
<p>The three characters have one thing in common: they all, one after another, get possessed by strange entities of unknown origin and even less known intentions. They must work together - and sometimes against each other - to find out of the nature of those beings, what they want, and why they seem to think that their 'mission' is of vital importance for the future of humanity."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cBJ5mo_rDTk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64100af9ee33066cb1850240479715f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cBJ5mo_rDTk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A classic point-and-click adventure experience:</strong> we're very proud to feature our own distinct style, but we are also definitely influenced by games like Monkey Island or Beneath a Steel Sky and try to please both veteran afficionados of the genre and newcomers alike with a traditional pixel-art appearance and a streamlined, modern approach to game design</li>
<li><strong>Movement everywhere:</strong> you won't feel like you're walking through a still life painting; Born Punk's world is alive and full of animation, soundscapes and small details to discover</li>
<li><strong>Choices and consequences:</strong> often, it's possible to approach dialogues and puzzles from different angles. As a result, interactions and dialogues with other characters, the difficulty to overcome certain obstacles, and the results of many actions will vary greatly depending on what the player chooses to do</li>
<li><strong>Full voice-overs:</strong> every character in Born Punk and every line is voiced by professional voice actors. Yes, that includes the cat.</li>
<li><strong>Bombastic music:</strong> the main theme and various other tracks are composed by Jeff Kurtenacker, composer of Wildstar and choral arranger of World of Warcraft. Jeff is joined by a merry band of synthwave musicians to create a genuine and emotional cyberpunk/sci-fi soundtrack with a Nordic twist</li>
<li><strong>Let's be serious, it's funny:</strong> Born Punk is science-fiction with heavy cyberpunk influences; but we're also boasting a hopeful, often humorous undertone. Point &amp; click adventures without at least a bit of humour are unthinkable to us!</li>
<li><strong>A comprehensive universe:</strong> there's a slew of background info to read and experience, all of which becomes available in your PDA as you interact with the game world. Sometimes, in-game lore will also serve as an optional gameplay mechanic.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/979480/Born_Punk/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets a surprise update fixing many problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Valve are getting back into fixing up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, which has been a long-time coming and after fans have been campaigning to get Valve to do something.</p>
<p>TF2 has had so many problems with bots over the last year or two, that it became largely unplayable most often as bots would just repeatedly ruin games. There were other issues but that was the biggest. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/valve-say-they-will-look-into-fixing-up-the-bot-problems-in-team-fortress-2/" target="_blank">Valve said back in May</a> they were listening and would do something about it.</p>
<p>On June 21st a fresh update was released that fixed quite a few exploits like being able to clear the in-game text chat and players could use cheats on secure servers amongst other annoyances. There's various bug fixes too like projectiles sometimes colliding with teammates too early / late and the Spy using the incorrect weapons when disguised.</p>
<p>Another addition in this patch is an updated voting system that should also help that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both teams can have a kick vote running at the same time</li>
<li>Can have a global vote running at the same time as a kick vote</li>
<li>Fixed sometimes not being able to vote on maps at the end of the round</li>
</ul>
<p>Really great to see Valve giving TF2 some love. It remains as one of the most popular games available on Steam and it appears this patch has bumped the player numbers up once again.</p>

      <title>Inscryption from Daniel Mullins Games now supported on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The mixture of a deckbuilding roguelike with escape-room style puzzles and psychological horror in Inscryption is now officially available for Linux with a Native build. Developed by Daniel Mullins Games and published by Devolver Digital, this very popular and well-reviewed game originally released back in October 2021.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the developer noted that while working on the Linux (and macOS) ports that they "came across some issues that have existed in the Windows version since Kaycee's Mod" so thanks to the porting work the game will be improving for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WDAJ10sjpPI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/856b0175cdbdf8372ac9250eb50eb631.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WDAJ10sjpPI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creator of Pony Island and The Hex comes the latest mind melting, self-destructing love letter to video games. Inscryption is an inky black card-based odyssey that blends the deckbuilding roguelike, escape-room style puzzles, and psychological horror into a blood-laced smoothie. Darker still are the secrets inscrybed upon the cards...</p>
<p>In Inscryption you will...</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire a deck of woodland creature cards by draft, surgery, and self mutilation</li>
<li>Unlock the secrets lurking behind the walls of Leshy's cabin</li>
<li>Embark on an unexpected and deeply disturbing odyssey</li>
</ul>

      <title>Meet me at NooN is a sweet new puzzler with time-loop mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Meet me at NooN is the first game from the duo at Pandaroo Interactive and quite an impressive entry to the puzzle genre.</p>
<p>In the game you control two spirits that create time loops of their day. So each move you do is recorded and played back, while you're controlling the other. It's pretty fun to see in action and while simple, quite an enjoyable little experience to watch and learn and go through the levels. The good thing is that this is a game with no pressure. There's no way to actually lose and no timers so you go at your own pace. If you go wrong you can just adjust the timeline and go back.</p>

      <title>RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent gets a great looking roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TFC: The Fertile Crescent is a pixel-art RTS that resembles some of the classics like Age of Empires. It's currently in Early Access with Native Linux support and their new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1674820/view/5967847045493589913" target="_blank">roadmap</a> looks great.</p>
<p>Inspired by real history of the Near East Bronze Age era, TFC utilizes classic RTS elements while offering a unique perspective for the genre. One big change is how Food is not just used for building up your army but also changes how your population grows, and how quickly you can gain Knowledge Points to do research. It's a very interesting system that feels quite different to others like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z6qLkWwHx4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02477f4d339ac25c54e11aec5b3f3e1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z6qLkWwHx4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their new roadmap shows that across this year they plan to add in more single-player skirmish options, the ability to play against AI with friends online, an online co-op horde mode, neutral settlements, hotkey customization and unit stances. That's only for this year. Next year they have some other big updates planned too like new civilizations, new technologies, new map types like oceans and rivers, multiplayer matchmaking and more.</p>
<p>All sounding pretty great and it's easily worth playing right now.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Powered by the awesome GZDoom game engine, Hands of Necromancy looks like another solid choice for those of you (like me!) who absolutely love retro shooters. Made in the spirit of the classics like Heretic, Hexen, Doom and Quake it does look pretty good.</p>
<p>"You are a Necromancer: a lone sorcerer who seeks to grow ever more powerful and learn new forms of dark magic. You search for challengers to fight, so you can hone your wicked craft. You destroy many monsters and wild creatures, yet none of them seem truly worth the fight...</p>
<p>However, one day, suddenly more creatures entering your world. You know something bad is happening, but maybe this is an opportunity to prove your might and show the world that you are the truly fearsome mage you always knew yourself to be."</p>

<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore many beautiful environments - a country side, a forest, a cemetery, a castle, an ice cave, a volcano, and more - all teeming with danger to prove yourself against, as their denizens try to destroy you.</li>
<li>Get weapons, use magic spells, and learn transformations to fight your enemies, using their own abilities against them and bending nature to your own will.</li>
<li>Use the Tornado Spell to toss your enemies away with wind, or the Ring of Ice to freeze them solid, or even an Unholy Hand Grenade to blow them to smithereens!</li>
<li>Gain transformations as you grow in power - become the Swamp Serpent who can slither into tight spaces while breathing underwater, or the Stone Breaker Golem that smashes walls into tiny bits, the Hell Burner Demon that safely walks on lava, or even a flying Wyvern!</li>
<li>All of them are your key to defeating the many creatures in this metroidvania, as you explore the 21 maps in 3 giant and exciting hubs!</li>

      <title>3,500 games now Steam Deck Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another great milestone has been hit for the Steam Deck, with Valve's popular Linux-powered handheld now having 3,500 games rated as either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Back on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/new-steam-deck-verified-titles-now-over-3200-playable/" target="_blank">June 7th</a> it only just hit 3,200 so the rate continues at a nice steady pace. As a reminder though, Deck Verified is just the formal verification system. Plenty of games that haven't been tested work just fine, and some that are listed as Unsupported also work fine (or can do with one or two tweaks). You also have access to emulation and retro gaming, external launchers and much more. The Steam Deck is incredibly versatile.</p>
<p>The numbers right now at time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified: 1755</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable: 1803</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="flex-image-text-align"><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported: 1505</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some recently fully Verified games include:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/" target="_blank">Divinity Original Sin 2</a></li>

      <title>Erannorth Chronicles gets fixed up for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Erannorth Chronicles, what the developer says blends together an old-school card game with tabletop RPG-like progression recently had an upgrade to make it work nicely on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A game all about freedom, with some pretty deep mechanics allowing you to build up your character and your deck of cards while you explore a giant sandbox world with many different locations, challenges, and treasure hunts. There's no big story to follow, so the game is very much what you make of it. The intention from the developer appears to be giving you a big playground to have a run through and see what you can create and conquer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828555721655815984gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/828555721655815984gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently tagged as Unsupported by Valve on the Steam Deck, a new release went up on June 12th aiming to fix up some issues so hopefully this will bump it up to at least Playable officially.</p>
<p>Here's what they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a check if the game is running in Steam Deck to set the resolution to 1280x720 instead of 1280x800. As the game only supports that.</li>
<li>Settings for the Steam Deck will be stored in a separate file. The corresponding settings will load based on whether you are running the game on Steam Deck or your PC.</li>
<li>The split effect wasn't displaying in the non-Damage cards, which could be confusing as to why it appears if a Damage effect was added to them.</li>
<li>Chaotic effect in Split cards didn't have a visual indication that its damage would Split. It will now display both elements.</li>
<li>Updated Unity to v2021.3.4.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Looks like Valve are gearing up for a new &#39;Deckard&#39; VR Headset</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've sort-of known for a while that Valve were working towards a next-generation VR headset to succeed the Valve Index and we've now seen a lot more supporting evidence that it's getting closer.</p>
<p>Plenty of this is thanks to the tireless work of XR Hardware Analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley" target="_blank">Brad Lynch</a>, who had been keeping an eye out for anything interesting that pops up. The codename of the device appears to be "Deckard", and a lot of the information is actually thanks to SteamDB who constantly track updates to Steam code on their <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/GameTracking-SteamVR" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where you can see a lot of the text strings being added in preparation.</p>
<p>You can see Lynch go over plenty of the leaked info in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ovlbXVwoN8s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a31ac79f35ae73506de165abfa36c975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ovlbXVwoN8s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a huge fan of the Valve Index, which I took a look at some time ago, the idea that we might be able to play without wires hooked up to a PC is thoroughly exciting. Even more exciting, is that it's quite likely in any standalone mode that it would use Linux, which is again a good reason for Valve to continue working on Proton outside of the use on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Then there's also the <a href="https://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0&amp;docid=20220187609&amp;IDKey=62CCF93BD70F" target="_blank">recent Patent</a>, which shows off a possible new design of Valve's upcoming VR headset. The patent was filed in December 2021, and went public on June 16 2022. The patent is focused more on the fitting with the strap system, rather than going into technical details on how it will function. Still, we do get a little hint as to what it may have with the patent mentioning "the rear housing may house wireless transceivers, a battery, microphones, input/output devices, processors" and it also mentions the front may have "antenna(s)" and a few other references that do indicate wireless play.</p>
<p>Obviously it's not a confirmation that one will actually be released but still fun to see and clearly Valve are working on something big.</p>

      <title>Missed your Steam Deck email? Valve confirms a grace period to still get one</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Given how busy some of us are, it can still be quite easy to miss that Steam Deck email coming in to make your purchase through the reservation system. The good news is, you do actually have a few extra days after the timer is up.</p>
<p>The way the system works is that you put down a reservation (only one per Steam account at a time), and <em>eventually</em> you get the chance to buy a Steam Deck. This has helped against scalpers buying them all up and allow Valve to have time to produce enough. Once you get your final purchase email, you have about 72 hours to actually pay for it otherwise it's supposed to go onto the next person in the queue. The purchase email even clearly says " If you don't complete your purchase by this time, we will automatically cancel your reservation.".</p>
<p>However, Valve has now officially <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1538949772010086400" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that's <em>not</em> quite the case.</p>
<p>If you do <em>miss</em> that window of opportunity to buy your Steam Deck, there "is a grace period of a few days" where you can reach out to Steam Support who will hook you up. All you need to do is go to the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/wizard/HelpWithSteamDeck" target="_blank">support page</a>, and hit "Contact Steam Support".</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve are giving people more than one opportunity to ensure they get their Deck.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 17: The Llama Master</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-16-we-are-all-doomed/" target="_blank">Part 16: We Are All Doomed</a></strong></p>
<p>While first person shooters dominated the Linux gaming scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was still more than a place for the venerable strategy genre; it should be remembered that the first game Loki Software ported over to Linux was the then latest iteration in the <em>Civilization</em> series. From this foundation other strategy titles soon followed, with Ubi Soft entering the fray thanks to the work of Linux friendly Philos Laboratories.</p>
<p><em>Theocracy </em>is a mix of real time and turn based strategy that sees you leading an Aztec tribe in the century leading up to the arrival of Hernán Cortés, with the ultimate goal being an alternate history scenario where the Aztecs are able to fend off the Spanish conquistadors. Beyond this the game is fantastical, inventing tribes, magical sects, fabled heroes, and featuring a whole host of fauna alien to Mesoamerica, including dragons, llamas, chickens, and the most inaccurate, pigs.</p>
<p>The game overall has an admirable depth of well crafted lore only brought down by the Hungarian developer's occasional lapse into broken English; the worst offender being the use of the word "Wary" to mean belligerent in the Diplomacy Panel. The narrator for the tutorial and scenario briefings also has a way with words that can be at best described as memorable, with his use of the phrase "llama masters can be educated in the llama lair" being a particular earworm. </p>
<p>Unlike with games from Loki Software or similar porting houses, Philos Laboratories bundled the Linux version alongside the Windows retail release, making <em>Theocracy</em> that much easier to track down. On the first CD-ROM you can find a directory containing a text based linux.inst installer, which sets the file paths and copies over the relevant data files. From there the game can be ran using the /usr/games/theocracy binary as long as the second disc is mounted.</p>
<p>The Linux version demands the game be launched at 16 bit colour depth and shows at a fixed 800x600 resolution, either in windowed mode or borderless fullscreen. Cutscenes meanwhile are displayed at 640x480 without any kind of scaling. The option for grabbing the mouse inside the game window only applies while in Province View, and I was unable to have the game recognize the keyboard from Blackbox, forcing me to play <em>Theocracy</em> from Gnome instead.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/376340911655670281gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/376340911655670281gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10974161811655690882gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10974161811655690882gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Released in March 2000 with a historical theme and similar art style, <em>Theocracy</em> was most often compared to and was largely overshadowed by <em>Age of Empires</em>, even though they are very different games. In terms of my tactics I actually found more in common with Infinity Engine titles such as <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and <em>Icewind Dale</em>, with the emphasis on choke points, crowd control, magical buffing, experience leveling, and war party formation while in combat.</p>
<p>I do not think I ever won a battle by outnumbering the opposing army; instead, most of my success came from causing the enemy troops to trip over themselves, often aided by the game's ropy path finding. The sheer scale of the rival forces and the lack of difficulty modes make <em>Theocracy</em> more intimidating than it needs to be, but with effort I was able to defeat both the Iztahuacans and Teotitlans in 30 years in-game and had a close to clear run to the Spanish.</p>
<p>In the end it was not the game's difficulty that felled me, but an unfortunate bug. Upon exceeding 52 saved games from the same campaign <em>Theocracy</em> will start corrupting your save files, a laughable ceiling given how much trial and error is required to progress through the game. Some have reported being able to get past this point by correcting the number overflows in the save file using a hex editor, but I have not managed this feat myself at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Apart from this though <em>Theocracy</em> only froze for me once, although the performance at times left something to be desired. Despite the boast on the back of the box of "an amazing game engine" that can display "up to 50000 units on the screen without any slowdown", the game would still lag even with my hardware exceeding the recommended specifications. This was even worse under Windows 98, with the Linux version running noticeably smoother.</p>
<p>All of these things can make <em>Theocracy</em> feel as if it has been lost to time, much like the Aztecs themselves. There has been some success in getting the game running in a dedicated X session on later versions of Linux, but few games benefit from having access to retro hardware as much as this. I still have unfinished business with <em>Theocracy</em>, and I am not waving the white flag just yet, but for now I am in the mood for something lighter, and much less time consuming.</p>

      <title>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved on Steam Deck is absolutely awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved on Steam Deck, a classic from back in the Xbox 360 days has a version on Steam and it works so beautifully on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This is a true bit of nostalgia hitting for me, as I continue to put hour after hour into various games on Steam Deck, I keep coming back to the classics. Geometry Wars was originally a mini-game in Project Gotham Racing 2 it was later turned into Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved as a standalone title and went onto become one of the most downloaded Xbox Live Arcade games.</p>
<p>Once again thanks to Steam Play Proton, it works out of the box as a Deck Verified title. You only need to go into the settings and put it to the correct resolution — and then dive in for many hours of blasting away various shapes with a good 6 hours easily on the battery life with it at 60FPS. It look simply amazing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r9FcR1i5WnQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ba13fc019c9c035343fb23bdec83ae68.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r9FcR1i5WnQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This to me, really shows how incredibly the Steam Deck is. Not only will it play some of the latest AAA games (although often in lower visuals and 30/40 FPS), you can emulate tons of other systems but also get back into classics like this that you can enjoy wherever you are.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/8400/Geometry_Wars_Retro_Evolved/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Westwood classic RPG &#39;Nox&#39; lives on with the OpenNox game engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Westwood Studios made quite a lot of games like Dune II and the Command &amp; Conquer series but they also made an RPG called Nox, that now lives on with the <a href="https://github.com/noxworld-dev/opennox" target="_blank">OpenNox</a> game engine. OpenNox just recently had a new release, and the project is now open source too under the GPL!</p>
<p>Released originally in the year 2000, Nox was received very well by the gaming press at the time and lives on in the hearts of many gamers. Thankfully now though, OpenNox gives you a fresh way to play it on modern platforms like Linux and Windows. OpenNox is a fully-featured game engine reimplementation too supporting the original features plus plenty of enhancements including: improving modding support, higher resolutions, much better online play and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12232063751655724692gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12232063751655724692gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like other open source reimplementations, it does not include copyrighted assets and so you do need to own a copy of the game to play it which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/nox" target="_blank">buy on GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton and Wine updater ProtonUp-Qt now shows anti-cheat status</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another update to the free and open source app <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> giving you a proper user interface for downloading GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda, Wine-GE and others for Steam Deck and Linux. It works with Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and Lutris.</p>
<p>Version 2.6.5 brings the ability to see the anti-cheat status in the game list you can open. A pretty useful little addition, since a previous version also added showing Steam Deck compatibility too so now you can get it together all in one list. Additionally this update will also show what games using Lutris too in the compatibility info.</p>

      <title>Microsoft chucks GNOME $10,000 from their FOSS Fund</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everyone knows that Microsoft absolutely loves Linux right? Well, that's debatable but hey they did just reach down the back of the sofa and chuck GNOME some cash.</p>
<p>As part of their ongoing <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/foss-fund" target="_blank">Free and Open Source Software Fund</a> (FOSS Fund for short), part of their Microsoft Open Source Programs Office, Microsoft engineers participate in selecting various projects they feel could benefit from a little extra help. No strings attached, no big fancy marketing of Microsoft trying to do something nefarious, just Microsoft workers voting to give out some money to free and open source projects they find interesting.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago it was announced that GNOME was the latest winner of $10,000. Previous winners include systemd, OpenStreetMap, QEMU and various others.</p>
<p>Every month they start a new selection process, which results in a new project getting the $10,000 bonus which is usually paid in 10 monthly installments of $1,000. There's only a few requirements to be considered including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The open source project must be used by Microsoft.</li>
<li>Project is actively prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion.</li>
<li>The project must have an <a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank">OSI-approved open source license</a></li>
<li>Needs to have a way to receive funds that our procurement and legal teams are happy with (<a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a> is great!)</li>
<li>the project cannot be owned by a Microsoft employee</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a side-note, it's quite interesting to see that even Microsoft see the OSI as the go-to for proper open source licenses.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II reimplementation gets big audio improvements and AI speedup</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine reimplementation, fheroes2, has another great new release out continuing to be the absolute best way to play this classic on modern platforms.</p>
<p>The developer emailed in to let us know about some big changes. Firstly, it's had a huge overhaul to the audio code. Not only will it properly resume audio from where it was stopped (like the original game), it will also now update the surrounding sounds on the map on every step on the hero. Plus fixes to some incorrect sounds and rocks in water with seagulls now have their own sound. On top of that, a 3D Audio feature was added for objects on the map to give it a whole new depth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11426023961655719942gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11426023961655719942gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>AI is now smarter (yes, again!) and even faster at calculations than before making the whole game feel smoother and play better.</p>
<p>New Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Introduce music resuming while switching tracks for MP3, FLAC and OGG music formats</li>
<li>Add 3D audio option for objects on Adventure Map</li>
<li>Fix all map lose / win conditions and make AI be aware of them</li>
<li>Add Campaign High Scores</li>
<li>Improve German, Polish, Ukrainian, Romanian translations and add Belarusian, Spanish and Swedish translations</li>
<li>Speed up AI by average 10%</li>
<li>Fix rendering of Red Tower of Sorceress castle</li>
<li>Rework "No interface" option</li>
<li>Over <em><strong>40</strong></em> bugs are fixed since 0.9.15 release</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to download on <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You do also need to grab the data from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_2_gold_edition?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG.com</a> which it requires to run.</p>

      <title>The Cycle: Frontier works nicely on Steam Deck and Linux desktops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Initially an Epic Store exclusive, you can now play The Cycle: Frontier free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/868270/The_Cycle_Frontier/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and thanks to Proton — on Steam Deck and Linux desktops.</p>
<p>An interesting point about this game, is that it uses BattlEye but it appears the developer has it fully online for Linux. You only need to ensure you install the "Proton BattlEye Runtime" in your Steam Library and then it will just work with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">latest Proton 7.0-3 release</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? A mixture of player versus player first-person combat, with it blending in environmental dangers from various creatures and a big storm too. The idea is that you jump in solo or with a crew, loot away and do missions and attempt extraction whenever you want to keep your goods or die trying and lose a bunch. It's a lot of fun actually and while not perfect, the developer seems to have a clear plan to keep improving it and it's already one of the most popular games on Steam.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it on both Steam Deck and my Fedora 36 desktop:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck back to being the global top seller (by revenue) on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a brief stint at number 2 thanks to the popularity of V Rising, the Steam Deck has moved firmly back into place at number 1 on the top sellers list.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> tracking it, we can see that the Steam Deck has been the top seller by revenue for the last 3 weeks. We don't know how many units that is though, since Valve don't allow anyone to see. This means that overall, the Steam Deck has been at least number 1 or number 2 on the global top sellers for around <u>15</u> weeks now.</p>
<p>While we don't know the number, we know it's going to be quite high. When you take into account that V Rising hit over 1.5 million sales, Elden Ring still sits in the top-ten and has sold multiple million and…you get the idea. While the Steam Deck costs a lot more, it still means it has sold quite a lot. So the Steam Deck is very much a <strong>big</strong> success for Valve overall.</p>
<p><em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/07/faster-zombies-to-steam-deck-the-history-of-valve-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Faster Zombies to Steam Deck: The History of Valve and Linux Gaming</a></em></p>
<p>It quickly became my own number 1 way to play games. The convenience of it is just simply amazing. I fully expect it to continue flicking between number 1 and 2 for another year yet, which will depend on what big releases appear on Steam to push it down momentarily.</p>

      <title>Arthurian legend merged with sci-fi horror, The Hand of Merlin is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for another turn-based RPG with some rogue-lite mechanics, with the addition of a pretty strange storyline? The Hand of Merlin is out now with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The Hand of Merlin is a turn-based rogue-lite RPG in which Arthurian legend clashes with dark and foreboding sci-fi horror. This unusual merging of genres introduces a wholly unique sci-fi element to its storytelling. Utilizing both squad-based and turn-based combat, players can employ tactical cunning to use cover, set up ambushes and coordinate attacks with ranged, melee and spell-casting combat to conquer both human and unworldly abhorrent creatures and other enemy characters they encounter on their quest.</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Throughout Early Access we’ve committed a lot of time and energy into community feedback with a series of updates that have really embellished the games features and replayability based upon what the community was telling us, we’re extremely pleased with the results and the work the team has done to make The Hand of Merlin a truly competitive rogue-lite RPG.“ Said Robert Sajko Creative Director at Room C Games.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-hand-of-merlin?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/600610/The_Hand_of_Merlin/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE arrives on Steam — plus it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE has officially landed on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, and the good news is that it works on Linux plus it's Steam Deck Verified. Seems Valve were well aware to get it Deck Verified status right away, looks like we know why <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/proton-70-3-is-out-further-improving-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-3 released recently then</a>!</p>
<p>You know the Steam Deck is getting noticed, and clearly <em>important</em> to the gaming industry, when the Final Fantasy VII series Executive Produce at Square Enix mentions it directly in the 25th Anniversary Celebration video that you can see below. I think the importance of moments like that cannot be overstated. The Steam Deck mention is at about 3:40.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wohQiEysqIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9184c75108971fa4977a83531f04ede1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wohQiEysqIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a big one, and one I was hoping to eventually play personally, I decided to dive in and take a quick look. Since it's Steam Deck Verified, every part of it <em>should</em> work well but that does depend on how thorough the verification system is, for such an expansive game.</p>
<p>Here's a fresh video for you (personal purchase from <a href="http://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="okmu4ra0f1I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8de22a1d2522cd3e38d869c7101eb133.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/okmu4ra0f1I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the Steam page this is what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE contains the following content:<br/>
- FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE full game<br/>
- DLC "FF7R EPISODE INTERmission" (New episode featuring Yuffie Kisaragi)<br/>
- Weapon: Cacstar<br/>
- Armor: Midgar Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Shinra Bangle<br/>
- Armor: Corneo Armlet<br/>
- Accessory: Superstar Belt<br/>
- Accessory: Mako Crystal<br/>
- Accessory: Seraphic Earrings<br/>
- Summon materia: Carbuncle<br/>
- Summon materia: Chocobo Chick<br/>
- Summon materia: Cactuar</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1462040/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REMAKE_INTERGRADE/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now. <em>You save a little extra if you're a Humble Choice sub too.</em></p>
<p>The next game in the series, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, is confirmed for 2024 but will be exclusive to the PS5. Well, for now anyway, eventually it's likely to come to Steam just like other PlayStation games have been. Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII Reunion, a remake of Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 for PSP, is also confirmed to be coming to Steam "this Winter".</p>
<p>Oh and if you missed it, we're even getting Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817070/Marvels_SpiderMan_Remastered/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in August. So hopefully Proton will be ready for that too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An absolute gem of a game this and now perhaps a good time to go back and spend some proper time with it, as the rather large The Sunken Sea update is out now.</p>
<p>Blending elements and a feel of the likes of Minecraft, Terraria and more it's a great underground exploration and crafting game that's currently in Early Access. It continues to do well after selling 500K in two weeks.</p>
<p>The new biome can be accessed once you've defeated the first three bosses, which brings down the wall that separates the sections of the game. There's also the sub-biome Forlorn Metropolis, a new boss, a new side-boss, 5 new enemies, a fishing merchant, boats, a new workbench type, portals you can craft for teleporting around, 10 new weapons including a bow, new food and fish types and lots more. Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wrQNpT6QNQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22c933b365cc37743f1ced94584f366d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wrQNpT6QNQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking forward to digging more into this one. Works great on desktop Linux and Steam Deck with the Native Linux build that's Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Epic Online Services gets free cross-play tooling that will support Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games just announced a <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-online-services-release-free-pc-crossplay-tools?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank">big upgrade</a> to Epic Online Services, which will now include a full toolkit to enable developers to do cross-play.</p>
<p>Currently, the initial release of the new tools in the EOS SDK supports "PC" (they mean Windows), but they fully plan to support Linux and macOS as well. They already support Epic and Steam directly with more stores coming and consoles / mobile support coming later. EOS includes a special overlay (like the Steam Overlay) that brings together Steam and Epic friends and all the integration into a single list.</p>
<p>For game developers, this sounds thoroughly useful.</p>
<p>What it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>All friends, one place.</strong> Steam and Epic Games Store friends merge into one overlay allowing players to see all friends in a single list.</li>
<li>Integrated game invites. In-game, players can search and send invites to friends across Steam and the Epic Games Store, making connecting and playing together easy.</li>
<li><strong>Account linking.</strong> Onboarding without emails or password prompts. With just a few clicks, Steam players can jump into a game while an Epic Games account is created under the hood for their Steam account.</li>
<li><strong>Update-free improvements.</strong> When games are installed, the crossplay features are distributed via a self-updating in-game overlay. Players can enjoy new features and improvements without needing to update anything themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Plug-and-play SDK.</strong> Each Epic Online Services toolset is self-contained, so developers can mix and match the services they want to implement, incorporate the things they want, and leave the rest. Crossplay tools are no different.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully people will use this over Vivox, which still doesn't support Linux and can be quite problematic with Proton too. Even if you don't particularly like the Epic Games Store, what they offer with Epic Online Services seems pretty great.</p>

      <title>Starship Troopers: Terran Command on Steam Deck and Linux — a quick guide</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Terran Command [<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>] just released from The Artistocrats and Slitherine Ltd. but getting it on running on Linux desktop or Steam Deck requires a few steps. Video steps at the bottom if you prefer that.</p>
<p>Technically, on a Linux desktop it works out of the box with Proton but the videos don't play. For both Steam Deck and Linux you will need the community made GE-Proton. To grab GE-Proton you can use <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, which I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">a previous tutorial on</a>. No doubt an official Proton update will come to help but this will get you going right now.</p>
<p>Once you have ProtonUp-Qt and then use it to download GE-Proton, set the game to use GE-Proton in the Compatibility menu in the Properties (restart Steam for it to show up). On Desktop:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9570155051655404500gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16786283601655404553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once done you will need to add this as a launch option otherwise while the videos play they don't look right at all:</p>
<p><code>WINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>To do the launch option, it's in the Properties menu of your game on Steam. On Desktop simply right click -&gt; Properties and then enter it in:</p>

<p>And on Steam Deck. Pick the game in your Library, go to the Cog icon on the right and go to Properties and enter it in:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4403364001655404353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An extra fix needed for the <u>Steam Deck</u> specifically, is to have the launcher close when you hit play. Otherwise you just get a black screen! Find the "Launcher.exe.config" file in your installed folder, open it with a text editor and line 76 will have this:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="false"</code></p>
<p>Change it to:</p>
<p><code>add key="CloseAfterStart" value="true"</code></p>
<p>Now it will work properly on Steam Deck too. Another case of a random launcher being a nuisance.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>An immersive storyline campaign featuring unique missions, characters and a lot of Starship Troopers flavor.</li>
<li>Dozens of unique unit types, each with their own special abilities.</li>
<li>Terrain elevation, True Line of Sight &amp; True Line of Fire provide deep tactical gameplay.</li>
<li>Capture and hold vital radio stations, construct base defenses to repel Arachnid attacks and deploy technology buildings to unlock new weaponry.</li>
<li>Heroics, explosions, gore, and Bugs. Lots of Bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the game, so far it seems reasonably good. I love the attempt to capture to cheesiness from the original movie. We don't talk about the two sequels.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starship-troopers-terran-command?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202130/Starship_Troopers_Terran_Command/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dudes! Beat &#39;em up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to get punched with nostalgia and eat some pizza? Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge is officially out now along with Native Linux support and it's looking good on desktop and a Steam Deck too. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge features groundbreaking gameplay rooted in timeless classic brawling mechanics, brought to you by the beat ’em up experts at Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4) and Tribute Games. Bash your way through gorgeous pixel art environments and slay tons of hellacious enemies with your favorite Turtle, each with his own skills and moves - making each run unique! Choose a fighter, use radical combos to defeat your opponents and experience intense combats loaded with breathtaking action and outrageous ninja abilities. Stay sharp as you face off against Shredder and his faithful Foot Clan alone, or grab your best buds and play with up to 6 players simultaneously!"</p>
<p>This is basically a massive homage to classic beat 'em ups, TMNT, old cartoons and retro gaming all in one and I firmly welcome it. It's absolutely gorgeous but wow it will make your thumbs ache. That intro video as well, wow, what memories from my childhood! Launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ozKsDzumb0c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d95df53e619596267131012c5405d57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ozKsDzumb0c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features Include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconic 80s inspired retro Turtles brawling action on modern platforms </li>
<li>Six player local &amp; online co-op, featuring April O’Neil and Casey Jones’ playable debut in a TMNT beat-em-up</li>
<li>Attributes, moves and animations tailored to each fighter, channeling their personality and granting a unique edge in battle</li>
<li>Gorgeous pixel renders of signature locales like Dimension X, Coney Island and more</li>
<li>Absolutely bangin’ OST composed by Tee Lopes featuring cultural icons Ghostface Killah and Raekwon</li>
<li>Expertly crafted platform brawler gameplay from the teams who brought you <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> and <em>Panzer Paladin</em></li>
<li>Bodacious replayability from the challenge to master all seven characters with gameplay that makes each run feel totally radical</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it's a beat 'em up, there's quite a lot of moves to learn. As you first get into the game, there's 21 animated in-game slides of various moves to learn. Naturally you can't be expected to learn them all right away but a good bit of button-bashing is often all your need to make your way through and enjoy these types of games. Thankfully, you can access to move list from the pause menu at any point.</p>
<p>Want to see how great it is on Steam Deck? Check it out below:</p>
