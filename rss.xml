      <title>Valve made it even easier to see who played on Steam Deck in user reviews</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steam-now-shows-who-played-mostly-on-steam-deck-in-user-reviews/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Just recently I reported</a> on Valve adding a new feature to Steam user reviews, showing off who played mostly on Steam Deck and now they've made this even easier.</p>
<p>Being able to see who mostly played on Steam Deck is great, as both an additional advert for the Steam Deck and to help potential buyers see if a particular game is worth picking up. My suggestion in the previous article was that "Valve just need to add a filter to show only Steam Deck reviews" and you'll never guess what — they did exactly that.</p>
<p>Now when you scroll down to user reviews on Steam and look inside the Playtime hover-menu, there's a specific option to show those who played mostly on Steam Deck (this is for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ELDEN RING</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/313404311724503080gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>That way if you're playing primarily on Steam Deck, you can choose to see only those types of reviews if you want to.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the previous update that added the Steam Deck icon to reviews allows you to hover over the icon to see how many hours detected were played on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve no longer a secret - store page is up and we can finally talk about it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deadlock, perhaps the <em>worst</em> kept secret from Valve, has now been <em>softly</em> revealed as the latest game from the maker of Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Portal and Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7194375701724500622gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7194375701724500622gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even before it was officially announced, it managed to pull in over 44,000 concurrent players during their secret (but not very) invite-only play-testing. We know this thanks to public data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which tracks everything on Steam, and Deadlock itself has been on there for quite some time before being announced.</p>
<p>Technically, Valve haven't <em>really</em> announced it yet. They made a store page, which is incredibly light on details, a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/deadlock-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch</a> category, and they have posted in their official Discord to note people can now talk publicly about it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="We are lifting the rules for public conversation about Deadlock to allow for things like streaming, community websites and discussions.  Nothing else is changing with our state of development. We are remaining invite-only and continue to be in an early development stage with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13742207061724499268gol1.png"/></p>
<p><em>Since it's still invite-only, you'll have to find someone who has access.</em></p>
<p>Previously, the game would give you a warning when you first load in, asking you clearly not to share details publicly, which some (hi <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a>) decided to ignore. This has now been replaced with a simple reminder that it's in early development and feedback is welcome.</p>
<p>So <em>what</em> is it? Well, that’s a little complicated to answer. But, I did have access pretty early thanks to an invite so my best attempt at a simple explanation: it takes the lanes, towers and AI creeps gameplay from Dota 2 and turns it into a third-person hero shooter with rails in the air you can jump on to travel across the map quickly. It’s definitely peculiar and much like Dota 2, it’s easy enough to get into but really takes a good while to learn properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10909323371724500620gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10909323371724500620gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With its two 6 on 6 teams, each team fights across defined lanes in the map that have guardians at specific points you need to destroy. You push through each lane with the help of your teammates and your AI creeps. Gradually, you push the enemy team back by taking down different types of guardians to eventually make it into the enemy base. Inside the enemy base you take down their Patron, which is like a multi-stage boss battle, while also trying not to die from the enemy team madly firing off every single ability they have at you.</p>
<p>You’re not forced into any particular lane though, you can run or rail across the map and go wherever you like. It’s a team game after all, but leaving a lane empty is of course not a good idea. The rail system definitely adds a nice spin to it, letting you quickly zip across the map from your base. You can get a fast speed-boost from it too, but once used it goes into a cooldown. Additionally, the rails for you only work in your territory, so once you push past an enemy guardian, your team's active rail length will expand.</p>
<p>It has a pretty fun character movement system too where you can dash, double-jump, mantle over things and slide too. So it's reasonably fast paced, especially during combat between players when you're all jumping around trying to avoid all the abilities going off.</p>
<p>There’s quite a number of characters already, all with their own set of abilities, much like Dota 2 or any of the various hero shooters out there. So learning it can be quite overwhelming initially, as you not only need to learn your abilities, but how to deal with whatever characters the opposing team picks. Thankfully, a good few of the characters are super-simple to play as.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16027965131724499688gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16027965131724499688gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just the characters though, you also need to keep upgrading as you go through a match and learn what works best for each character. And here's where it's once again like Dota 2. You have to earn a currency, souls, and then run along to a shop to buy up character upgrades. Thankfully, there's a suggested build system you can follow and anyone can make one and publish it for you to follow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10215610311724500862gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10215610311724500862gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18823123341724502223gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18823123341724502223gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve seem to be learning a clear lesson from the failure of Artifact here, building it up gradually with a growing community and tweaking it constantly based on player feedback. The secrecy around it, along with the invite system, has attracted a lot of attention and even though it's been leaked <em>constantly</em>, this plays quite well for free advertising for Valve.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens with it when Valve open it up fully. Will it have the staying power of other popular Valve games? Will it end up eating away at the numbers of CS2, Dota 2, TF2 and others? Who knows. It's a weird one, but it can be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Currently, there's no Native Linux version, but I can confirm it works really nicely on Desktop with Proton. I have yet to try it on Steam Deck but will soon.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a global resolution override in latest Beta, plus more desktop Steam fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a couple more Steam Beta Client releases recently for both Steam Deck and Desktop so here's all you need to know.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> side, you may be pleased to see that Valve has now added a global game resolution override feature to the display settings page. Available in Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Advanced, here you can set the maximum resolution allowed to be used by games. This feature technically isn't new, since it was available per-game already, but having it global is great for those who play a lot docked and want everything to be available at a higher resolution.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6847346651724499864gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6847346651724499864gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>While over on <strong>Steam Desktop</strong> a lot of the changes are the same, but there's a couple of differences.

      <title>Wine 9.16 released with more Wayland work and an initial Driver Store implementation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-9.16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine 9.16</a> development release is now available for this compatibility layer to run Windows apps and games on Linux. Here's all that's changed. Reminder: Wine is a huge part of what makes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> able to do its thing so you can play lots of games on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial Driver Store implementation.</li>
<li>Pbuffer support in the Wayland driver.</li>
<li>More prototype objects in MSHTML.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those curious about this Driver Store looking it up on Microsoft's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> they explain it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting with Windows Vista, the Driver Store is a trusted collection of inbox and third-party <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-packages" rel="noopener" target="_blank">driver packages</a>. The operating system maintains this collection in a secure location on the local hard disk. Only the driver packages in the Driver Store can be installed on a device.</p>
<p>When a driver package is copied to the Driver Store, all of its files are copied. This includes the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/overview-of-inf-files" rel="noopener" target="_blank">INF file</a> and all files that are referenced by the INF file. All files that are in the driver package are considered critical to the device installation. The INF file must reference all of the required files for device installation so that they are present in the Driver Store. If the INF file references a file that is not included in the driver package, the driver package is not copied to the store.</p>
<p>The process of copying a driver package to the Driver Store is called <em>staging</em>. A driver package must be <em>staged</em> to the Driver Store before the package can be used to install any devices. As a result, driver staging and device installation are separate operations.</p>
<p>A driver package is staged to the Driver Store by being verified and validated.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver with Linux kernel 6.10 causing kernel oops</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA is currently investigating a bug where their drivers are crashing on modern kernels (6.10+). This appears to happen across drivers 550, 555 and even the latest 560.</p>
<p>From the troubleshooting data that can be found on the NVIDIA forums and the crashes I'm facing myself, this seems to be a regression that started with Linux kernel 6.10 and it affects users when suspension mechanism is triggered or some application is processing 3D. It affects both the closed and open NVIDIA drivers.</p>
<p>This happened on my computer recently, and it is really annoying. Example log:</p>

      <title>Dragon Age: The Veilguard devs talk up their PC features, optimisations and Steam Deck verification</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BioWare and Electronic Arts are gearing up for the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard on October 31st and they've revealed a whole bunch of details about the PC release.</p>
<p>We already saw before that it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-steam-deck-verified-well-ahead-of-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">became Steam Deck Verified</a>, clearly showing plenty of early testing has been done there. So it should be looking good on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> thanks to that too.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/6302310962453571761" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam post</a> the developers mentioned how PCs made up "40% of our platform testing effort, with over 200,000 hours of performance and compatibility testing", so with that in mind, I'm expecting some pretty good things from this since they "created a dedicated team to focus on PC". Then again, you would generally expect that sort of thing from a big game getting a PC release. And, as already confirmed before, no EA App is needed - so Steam Deck / Linux players won't have to deal with launcher breakage constantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9192046611724335396gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The good news continues with the controls and UI being nicely tweaked for keyboard / mouse and controller, with seamless transitions between control types. They even implemented character class-specific keybinds, so you can customize per character which sounds interesting.</p>
<p>And they gave a nice big list of all the settings available:</p>

<p>I'm curious to see how well this one runs, especially on Steam Deck where the Verified rating at times still has games dropping below 30FPS. I really do hope this is nicely optimized.</p>

      <title>Genki reveal a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer is in the works</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Genki are returning to their racing roots with a brand new Tokyo Xtreme Racer in the works, due out for release sometime in 2025. The first series title in 18 years, no doubt fans of the classic Genki racers will be happy about this, especially as it's coming to Steam too so you'll be able to play it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck / Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Their teaser was brief and didn't really show anything:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sEhzyVcUCCM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/199d51036535b9ad8aae0df6b25a0afd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sEhzyVcUCCM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their Steam page was also light on any actual details too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Tokyo Xtreme Racer" is a racing game set in a sealed-off future Tokyo, where you compete for the fastest speed in your customized cars on the highways that weave through the city, aiming to reach the top.<br/>
<br/>
Drive real cars on meticulously recreated courses, compete against powerful rivals,<br/>
slip through other cars, and engage in spirit-wracking battles.<br/>
This is a series with unparalleled appeal.<br/>
<br/>
A new title, "Tokyo Xtreme Racer" now in development<br/>
please look forward to the release of more information.</p>

      <title>Steam now shows who played mostly on Steam Deck in user reviews</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 22/08/24 17:40 UTC</strong>: Valve has now actually <a href="https://x.com/OnDeck/status/1826673475119186082" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> this change.</p>
<hr/>
<p>While I can't find anywhere that Valve actually announced this, they've done another tweak to the user review system on Steam to show who primarily played on Steam Deck. This follows on from the recent user review update that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-attempts-to-deal-with-jokes-memes-and-ascii-art-reviews-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attempted to deal with jokes, memes and ASCII art</a>.</p>
<p>Just another way for Valve to advertise their Steam Deck in a neat way, and importantly for potential buyers to see who is <em>really</em> playing on Steam Deck. It's a good way to gauge if a game is truly worth a purchase for you, if you're also primarily a Steam Decker.</p>
<p>When you look over various user reviews on Steam, you might now spot a Steam Deck icon, the same one that was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/steam-will-now-show-you-who-is-playing-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">added to the friends list recently</a> to show who is currently online on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As some examples here's one from the excellent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Selaco</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14668991371724327903gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And another from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DAVE THE DIVER</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/266177871724328096gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/266177871724328096gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This might even push more Steam Deck players to make a review, just to show off how many hours they've put into a game. Which can then help push even more game sales, and perhaps more Steam Deck sales too.</p>
<p>Now Valve just need to add a filter to show only Steam Deck reviews, and it should work quite nicely.</p>

      <title>D.O.T. Defence looks like a fun spin on the RTS genre</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>D.O.T. Defence from Rattleaxe Games plans to launch in 2025 and looks like it will put a nice unique spin on RTS games, with matches you play in short bursts designed for single-player and local multiplayer. Another unique game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>!</p>
<p>More about it: "Welcome to D.O.T. Defence, a simplified yet deeply strategic RTS experience that seamlessly blends accessibility with tactical depth. We offer a simplified economy system, massive automated battles with light command, and a fun simplified upgrade system. Play in short bursts as matches last between 5-10minutes!</p>
<p>The only objective is to protect your HQ and destroy the enemies! Crafted by developers passionate about the genre, this game delivers a nostalgic experience reminiscent of their childhoods."</p>
<p>Check out the teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4iwfeI2oR4g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/920adaccb4c4e3d640565e23f42b2c8a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4iwfeI2oR4g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's all about capturing little square regions across the map to expand, and defend, so you can push further towards the enemy HQ. You end up with what they call Turret Mayhem, as you defend against hordes of enemies trying to capture your territory with various types of turrets to use. Split across a Wave Defense mode and a more traditional RTS experience in the Skirmish mode it sounds like it could be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It will support 1v1, 2v2 and free-for-all battles with local multiplayer and battles against AI.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124850/DOT_Defence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Aether Collector is a mysterious point and click adventure set inside an anomaly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for sci-fi fans, Aether Collector is a mysterious point and click adventure set inside an anomaly. Releasing later this year with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>More about it: "Step into the shoes of Samantha, a new hire at A-VOID Corporation's Outpost X, tasked with mining mysterious Aether from the air in the abandoned Quandary Valley. Navigate a world where reality bends and corporate interests clash with the unknown."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HsXKgSDTsPc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9953b21bd4606f4f8d387111fd1656e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HsXKgSDTsPc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore an eerie, abandoned town and surrounding forest.</li>
<li>Control a drone to harvest Aether and unlock spectral echoes.</li>
<li>Uncover dark secrets and face moral dilemmas.</li>
<li>Encounter strange phenomena and potential threats.</li>
<li>Silent protagonist in a richly atmospheric setting.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer said it blends together elements of existential horror with corporate satire and should set your back around 5 hours of adventuring.</p>
<p>However, I know plenty of you aren't keen on AI, and it does use AI in the game. Their statement on it: "The voices are generated using ElevenLabs and many of images are painted over and modified AI generations.". There will no doubt be a lot more games coming out using AI like this in some way.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m quite excited for the Starship Troopers: Extermination single-player</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starship Troopers: Extermination is already a fun game, but the initial Early Access release was short-lived due to a lack of content. Over time, Offworld have really built it up and the new upcoming single-player mode has me really excited. <em>I have a real sweet spot for Starship Troopers, as one of my favourite sci-fi movies.</em></p>
<p>There's been a lot of performance updates over the last year with DLSS and FSR3 also being added. Weak points were introduced to bugs to aim for; new planets; a new carnage system so the maps will fill up with bug bodies instead of them vanishing, that all have collisions too, creating some interesting interactions; different types of ammo and lots more.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer featuring Casper Van Dien from the original sci-fi classic movie:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q-z4hGP89YM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e18c149b1781a669ad2bb7cb5b96db2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q-z4hGP89YM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also a new developer diary that goes over the upcoming massive tanker bug addition, appearing just as it did in the 1997 classic movie. Also mentioned is another new planet coming, the icy planet Boreas, where you'll face various mutated bugs.</p>
<p>On top of that there's some new details on the single-player mode, which sees you undertake a multitude of missions that vary in scope and objectives. Mainly, they're designed to prepare you for the 16-player online mode, with more missions planned after the October 11th launch out of Early Access.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kRpzrSa0ibI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fc1c6d90dadfcfd64197c35f5a87314f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kRpzrSa0ibI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully at the full release it will have more players, as it's good fun. The biggest problem with it is actually getting into a game, as you're forced to matchmake with seemingly no ability just to start a game by yourself and let others come in later.</p>
<p>It's currently Unsupported on Steam Deck, but does run on Desktop Linux with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Celebrating 6 years since Valve announced Steam Play Proton for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today marks 6 years since Valve decided to change everything, especially for Linux fans, with the announcement of Steam Play Proton. Thanks to it, the Steam Deck and Desktop Linux gaming have continued to thrive. <em>Want a Proton beginner's guide? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Got you covered at this link</a>.</em></p>
<p>Heck, the Steam Deck <em>never</em> would have been a thing without Proton. Could you imagine it? Trying to market a Linux handheld without the vast majority of games people want to play? It was also only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/5-years-later-valve-finally-gives-windows-compatibility-tool-proton-a-logo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in February this year</a> that Valve actually decided to give it a logo too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17719696571724266234gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Proton's official logo</em></p>
<p>Thanks to all the work put into Proton from Valve developers, contractors and everyone who contributes to <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine</a> development that Proton is based upon, we have a ridiculous amount of games where you can just click the Play button and forget about everything else in Steam.</p>
<p>Going by the official Valve Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, there's been 66 releases of Proton during this time, and that's not counting all the interim updates to Proton Experimental and Proton Hotfix for quick game-specific fixes. The Proton changelog has seen 388 changes, although some will be text corrections, that's again showing just how much goes into it. It's an incredible amount of work when you think about just how many games are on Steam, and developers really love to do some <em>weird</em> stuff that Valve often has to work around. And let's not forget the likes of <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeWeavers</a>, who employ people to work on Wine and Proton.</p>
<p><em>As for the current state of Desktop Linux and Steam Deck gaming overall…</em></p>
<p>Looking over the current numbers on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, the community website where anyone can report how games work: there's 22,002 games reported to work by at least one person, 13,297 by at least two people and 9,751 that has three or more reports.</p>
<p>Going by Valve's own Steam Deck Verified system there's 5,297 rated Verified and 10,646 rated Playable.</p>
<p>Both ProtonDB and Valve's own ratings are only a small slice of Steam though, which has over 100,000 according to the Game tag on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. There's only so many games Valve can test officially and that people can report to ProtonDB, so there's likely thousands of games not reported by anyone that will just work out of the box with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311193491724267345gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10311193491724267345gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - HELLDIVERS 2 on Linux</em></p>
<p>It's pretty amazing that we can play the likes of HELLDIVERS 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Black Myth: Wukong, Grand Theft Auto V, Cyberpunk 2077, Fallout 4, Balatro, ELDEN RING, Hades II, Dead by Daylight, No Man's Sky and so many more at the click of a button in Steam now.</p>
<p>Now we just need more anti-cheat support, including from developers who already use anti-cheat that is supported to actually enable it. This is really the last major hurdle.</p>
<p>So here we are again, happy birthday to Proton, 6 years strong enabling gaming on Linux and Steam Deck to be an incredible thing.</p>

      <title>Humble is doing a big Resident Evil Bundle again that&#39;s worth a look</title>

      <title>Microsoft breaks some Linux dual-boots in a recent Windows update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you dual-boot Windows and Linux? Well, a recent Windows update seems to have been a bit messy and may have broken the ability to boot into Linux. Causing an alarming message to display of "Something has gone seriously wrong".</p>
<p>The update in question is in relation to <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-2601" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2022-2601</a>, and as the numbers there suggests, it's an issue from way back in 2022 that Microsoft decided just last week to go and patch up <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-2601" rel="noopener" target="_blank">themselves</a>. From the CVE:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A buffer overflow was found in grub_font_construct_glyph(). A malicious crafted pf2 font can lead to an overflow when calculating the max_glyph_size value, allocating a smaller than needed buffer for the glyph, this further leads to a buffer overflow and a heap based out-of-bounds write. An attacker may use this vulnerability to circumvent the secure boot mechanism.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn't supposed to affect you if you do have Linux installed, as per Microsoft's own info they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To address this security issue, Windows will apply a Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) update to block vulnerable Linux boot loaders that could have an impact on Windows security. The SBAT value is not applied to dual-boot systems that boot both Windows and Linux and should not affect these systems. You might find that older Linux distribution ISOs will not boot. If this occurs, work with your Linux vendor to get an update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, that seems to have still caused problems for those that <em>do</em> dual-boot. Oops. There's been <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1523438/verifying-shim-sbat-data-failed-security-policy-violation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quite</a> a <a href="https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=427297" rel="noopener" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="https://forum.zorin.com/t/verifying-shim-sbat-data-failed-security-policy-violation/40257" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a> of people <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1euuha4/please_help_error_message_verifying_shim_sbat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unable</a> to <a href="https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/issues/2947" rel="noopener" target="_blank">boot</a> into their Linux distributions as a result of this update. A potential solution can be found in an Ubuntu <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/sbat-revocations-boot-process/34996" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discourse post</a> from 2023 for a previous issue.</p>
<p>Microsoft haven't yet said anything about it that I can find, and their <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/august-13-2024-security-update-kb5041160-3e8026f2-bb4c-4c1c-9855-d41e1b5b1bd9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update page</a> notes "Microsoft is not currently aware of any issues with this update", so <em>clearly</em> that needs an update.</p>

      <title>A new demo for physics-based sandbox A Webbing Journey shows you what it&#39;s like to be a Spider</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A physics-based sandbox game where you play as a cute little spider, A Webbing Journey has a really fun idea and the latest demo is quite impressive. Immerse yourself in a cozy and relaxing environment as you help your human roommates keep their home tidy by performing oversized chores with creativity and lots of silk.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells has its final update out now with The End is Near</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Six years after the main release, Dead Cells has seen its final update, packed full of content to give it a good send off. Easily one of the best action-platformers around blending in metroidvania and rogue-lite elements, and continues to be one of my favourites.</p>
<p>The End is Near gives you new monsters, weapons, mutations, biome effects, an expanded curse mechanic, over 40 new head skins, around 20 new legendary affixes, more accessibility options and the list goes on. A lot of the new additions are based on the Curse mechanic, giving you access to Cursed Biomes if your run is at Boss Cell level 2 or higher so all this stuff won't just spawn randomly in your game and they're optional. If you decide to risk going into a Cursed Biome you can end up with some pretty nice rewards for your time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ey694m9TEUU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2963529b74be20be6dba567842feb7fa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ey694m9TEUU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those interested these are the new accessibility options:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added two new sets of control icons and an option to select them. You can select either "Legacy" (current icons), "New" (a new, cleaner set) or "Big" (accessibiliy focused, easier to read).</li>
<li>Changed the Daily Challenge's boss arrow opacity, for better visibility.</li>
<li>Added new input options for the "going through platform" action.</li>
<li>Added options to change the controller triggers' deadzone.</li>
<li>Reworked the Auto-hit assist mode option. It will no longer force the use of a melee weapon in the first slot.</li>
<li>Added an option to add a background to most texts in the game. The background's color and opacity can be adjusted.</li>
<li>The left stick can now be used to scroll through item descriptions in the pause menu.</li>
<li>Added options to fully invert the player and camera movement.</li>
<li>Added a bunch of options to tweak the camera's behavior. The influence of the player's movement, combat, or points of interest can be customized.</li>
<li>Split the "controller sticks deadzone" into two options, one for each stick.</li>
<li>Added an outline option for spikes.</li>
<li>Added a button to center the minimap on the player.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Star Labs recently revealed the StarBook 7 a 14-inch beauty</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in the market for new hardware, perhaps the new Star Labs StarBook 7 might be what you should be looking at. Their 7th generation has a number of nice upgrades and changes compared to what came before.</p>
<p>Naturally, it comes properly tested with full Linux support. With a choice between many different Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Manjaro, MX Linux, Zorin and even Windows 11 if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/453349721724239458gol1.png"/></p>
<p>You can grab it with either the 1GHz 4-core Intel Processor N200 (Intel UHD Graphics) or the 1.40GHz 16-core Intel Core Ultra 7 Processor 165H (Intel Arc graphics). Both models come with a 14-inch (diagonal) LED-backlit matte display with IPS technology (16:9 3840x2160). You also get 512GB Gen3 PCIe SSD as standard, 8GB of 3200MHz DDR4 memory, Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX210, Bluetooth 5.3, a 65-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery they claim has up to 14 hours battery life and plenty of ports available:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Left</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HDMI</li>
<li>USB Type A</li>
<li>Ultra 7:</li>
<li>2x Thunderbolt 4.0 with Power Delivery 3.0</li>
<li>N200:</li>
<li>2x USB Type C with Power Delivery 3.0</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Right</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Micro SD Memory Card Reader</li>
<li>USB 3.0</li>
<li>USB 2.0</li>
<li>3.5mm Combination Jack</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also have it with coreboot and firmware updates easily via LVFS.</p>
<p>Nice to see a UK hardware vendor doing well, as we don't have too many of them, a lot of Linux hardware is often pretty centered around the USA.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://starlabs.systems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Star Labs website</a>. Pricing starts at £597 right now during pre-production for early-bird savings, but after it will go up to £753.</p>

      <title>shapez 2 is a big hit with over 150,000 copies sold in less than a week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At least for some smaller teams, things are looking pretty good, with shapez 2 from tobspr Games only launching into Early Access on August 15th and it's sold really well. Read <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/shapez-2-is-an-absurdly-great-and-accessible-factory-building-game-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my early thoughts in my previous article</a>.</p>
<p>Their press team, Game Drive, announced that it managed to sell "over 150,000 copies during its first weekend" which is pretty incredible. And it managed to hit a peak player count of 18,806, putting it easily in the top 100 most played games on Steam.</p>
<p>Considering the first game sold more than 650,000 units, it's perhaps not a big surprise to see a massively expanded sequel do so well.</p>
<p>Tobias Springer, CEO of Tobspr Games said, “We are thrilled and taken aback by the success of shapez 2 over its launch weekend and are excited to see so many people jumping in to give it a go. Rest assured that we are listening to all feedback from our players and working to make the game even more satisfying and enjoyable during Early Access.”</p>

      <title>Valve bans keyboard automation in Counter-Strike 2 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some keyboards have special features like Razer's Snap Tap and Wooting's SOCD, that can give an unfair advantage in online games, and so Valve have put their foot down and entirely banned such tricks in Counter-Strike 2.</p>
<p>Valve didn't name any hardware makers directly, because of course they wouldn't - they don't want to get in trouble, but it's easy to find out who it's aimed at. Snap Tap, or Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions (SOCD), in super-simple terms is a way to have two keys (like A/D for character strafing) not cause you to come to an abrupt stop when you hold both down, instead allowing you to instantly change directions while keeping your accuracy (see Razer's <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/technology/snap-tap-mode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explainer</a>). In fact, Wooting themselves even said "SOCD is basically cheating" in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-Hgo9k_0v4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> to showcase the feature.</p>
<p>Now, Valve decided enough is enough and it's actually a skill to get it right with your fancy fingers and so they've banned any kind of similar automation.</p>
<p>Here's what Valve said in the Counter-Strike 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/6500469346429600836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Counter-Strike is constantly evolving. From art, to maps, to inventive plays, and even player input, the CS community shapes the game.</p>
<p>Scripting and automating player commands has always been contentious, but over the years some forms of scripting (e.g., jump-throws) have gained acceptance, as they enable plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible. In fact, jump-throws became such an important part of the game that we've done the work to make them reliable without any special scripting or binds (i.e., by jumping and quickly throwing a grenade).</p>
<p>Developing one's coordination and reaction time has always been key to mastering Counter-Strike.</p>
<p>Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we've decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn't acceptable in Counter-Strike.</p>
<p>We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially--exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.</p>
<p>To prevent accidental infractions, in-game binds that include more than one movement and/or attack actions will no longer work (e.g., null-binds and jump-throw binds).</p>
<p>If you have a keyboard that includes an input-automation feature (e.g., "Snap Tap Mode"), be sure to disable the feature before you join a match in order to avoid any interruption to your matches.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII arrives February 11, 2025 - Gameplay reveal trailer live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Gameplay reveal trailer has been released for Sid Meier's Civilization VII and we have a release date of February 11th, 2025. Some other good news is there will be no extra launcher this time too (and it was recently removed from the previous game), although they are requiring a 2K account for online play.</p>
<p>Check out the first gameplay below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kK_JrrP9m2U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e11196832bbe950cc97a4bb7df59d8c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's available to pre-order starting from £59.99 / 69,99€ / $69.99 and more for the other editions of the game. The Deluxe and Founders edition give a bunch of extras, along with Advanced Access to get into the game on February 5th.</p>
<p>You can also check out their longer showcase:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tc3_EO6Bj2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/493ae3f99eb507d34aa568ebb01a1561.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tc3_EO6Bj2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their previous press releases very clearly mentioned Linux support and the pre-order on Steam has the SteamOS (Linux) icon too, so as far as I know, it will have Linux support again but it's not been stated who is doing it if it will be Firaxis Games themselves, Aspyr Media again or another team. The Linux system requirements are just noted as "TDB" (Windows and macOS are the same). <strong>Update 21/08/24 9:32 UTC</strong>: Their press release sent out later once again confirmed very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>[…]</small> it will be available on PlayStation®5 (PS5®), PlayStation®4 (PS4®), Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo™ Switch, PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, and Mac and <strong>Linux</strong> via Steam</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 hits Early Access on November 15</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know lots of action-RPG fans will be excited for this one. Path of Exile 2 is now set to release into Early Access on November 15th. Hopefully it will work well, if they kept up with their Vulkan support it would make it a lot easier to run through <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of SnowRunner, despite how terrible I am at it, always getting completely stuck no matter what I do and RoadCraft takes things in a different direction. Instead of just transporting goods from one location to another, you're in charge of rebuilding after natural disasters with various forms of heavy machinery.</p>

<p>“We are thrilled to embark on a new journey with Saber Interactive and announce <em>RoadCraft </em>today at the Opening Night Live 2024,” said John Bert, Managing Director at Focus Entertainment. “Saber’s experience combined with our expertise in the genre will pave the way for the success of this new franchise and allow players to discover a deep construction simulation experience.”</p>
<p>"Saber continues to explore ways to innovate using our industry-leading off-road simulation technology," said Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive. "We are constantly in search of new and fun types of gameplay experiences that complement our best-selling titles, such as <em>SnowRunner </em>and <em>MudRunner</em>. <em>RoadCraft </em>is our first foray into heavy equipment simulation.

      <title>Kyle Crane returns in Dying Light: The Beast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Techland are bringing back the original protagonist in Dying Light: The Beast, with you once again jumping into the shoes of Kyle Crane.</p>
<p>You are Kyle Crane, the man whose selflessness during the initial virus outbreak saved many from a fate worse than death. After more than a decade in captivity, you find yourself in a world that’s changed, and not for the better. Now, you’ll need to use the survival skills that kept you alive all those years ago to save even more innocent lives.</p>
<p>Voice actor Roger Craig Smith is returning for Kyle Crane too! Here's what they said: "Stepping back into Kyle Crane's shoes feels like a reunion with an old friend," Smith said. "And even though he’s gone through a terrible time, there’s still plenty of legendary hero left in him.”</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c50gFkG91jc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a869999707184903985e867e08b5d490.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c50gFkG91jc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This was actually supposed to be a DLC for Dying Light 2 but Techland said "after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience". If you own the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, you'll get it free.</p>
<p>Sounds like it will be quite unique in the series too with you having transformation abilities: "They caged you like an animal. Years of brutal experimentation took its toll, but the zombie DNA and yours are now intertwined so that you are able to unleash a beast-like power. It flows through your veins. No one can take it from you. Use it. And you’ll discover it’s not just a curse.".</p>
<p>No release date yet, we'll find out more later this year. Plenty of time for Valve to ensure <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> is in a good state to have it work at release. <em>And time for me to actually finish Dying Light 2…</em></p>

      <title>Borderlands 4 is coming in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearbox and 2K today announced Borderlands 4 is real and it's going to release sometime in 2025 although we don't know many details yet. Hopefully it will work okay with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>After the absolute disaster that was the Borderlands movie, no doubt fans are itching for something less terrible to blast through. The Steam store page doesn't exactly give much away just noting the obvious: "See if you have what it takes to go down in history as a legendary Vault Hunter as you search for secret alien treasure, blasting everything in sight."</p>
<p>See the new teaser trailer below:</p>

      <title>Starground blends together factory building automation with dungeon crawling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build a factory, get it automated and go on an adventure? Sure why not! Starground will give you exactly that alone or with friends. While it completely failed to get anywhere on Kickstarter, the developer didn't give up and it's now in Early Access on Steam with Native Linux support.</p>
<p><em>It's another game built with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>!</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Starground is a top-down automation dungeon crawler combo. Alternate between gathering and refining resources on your home planet, and venturing across space to fight through action roguelite-inspired dungeons. How you split your time is entirely up to you! There's no right way to play the game, and any path will progress the story."</p>

Invite your friends to work towards common goals, or divide and conquer each part of the game. If multiplayer isn't your thing though, you can play alone in single player too!</li>
<li>AUTOMATION - Develop and maximize an island of resources through automation. Work your way through a research tree filled with all sorts of unique machines and solutions to your logistical needs. Start humble by mining resources by hand and smelting manually, but soon build up to a formidable factory that can tackle anything you can throw at it.</li>
<li>DUNGEONS - If you're not into automation, or need to wait for your factory, then venture to other places in the solar system to explore and crawl your way through a variety of dungeons. Battle enemies, avoid obstacles, kill bosses, and reap the rewards of your effort. Take resources from dungeons back to your factory, or use rare loot to make yourself stronger and craft modular weapons. Make a spear, dual-bladed sword, or maybe a gun on a stick. The choice is yours.</li>
</ul>

      <title>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire looks like Steamboat Willie as a FPS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, originally just known as MOUSE, certainly aren't shying away from their retro Disney inspiration here. With Steamboat Willie now in the public domain, we can bet there will be more that use classic Mickey Mouse.</p>
<p>You still have quite a while to wait on it though, since it's not going to release until 2025. Reminds me in a few ways of what <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/bye-sweet-carole-blends-horror-with-what-looks-like-classic-disney-movies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bye Sweet Carole is doing</a> with the classic Disney style.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19543006671724174956gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it: "MOUSE: P.I. For Hire, a gritty and noir-fueled FPS shooter that draws inspiration from classic cartoons of the 1930s.</p>
<p>MOUSE: P.I. For Hire boasts a unique visual style inspired by the charm of 1930s rubber hose animation, transporting players to a nostalgic era of early cartoons. Assume the role of a private detective navigating a noir city teeming with gangs, mobs, and characters from the dark side. Unravel a quest for justice in a noir city mired in chaos, corruption, and vibrant energy, utilizing a diverse arsenal of weapons, power-ups, and explosives to thwart the takeover by corrupt politicians. The game's playful weaponry and distinctive health display, coupled with enemies behaving like cartoon characters, add a lighthearted twist to traditional FPS gameplay."</p>
<p>A brand new trailer was just shown off too, take a look below:</p>

<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416450/MOUSE_PI_For_Hire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>Elevator Down claims to be Papers, Please meets The Good Place</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Announced today is Elevator Down, a game the developer claims is like Papers, Please blended with The Good Place. They told me via email "The game will be released with 100% support on both Linux and the Steam Deck".</p>
<p>Coming from Greek indie studio eNVy softworks, Elevator Down is a a satirical bureaucratic simulation game where you're the newest recruit in the Afterlife's least glamorous department: Life Evaluation. Talk to Souls, check their documents, reference Holy Texts and decide if they're going Up or Down. Follow the Rules or trust your own moral compass and see where your choices take you - hopefully not the express elevator to hell.…</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BHXDTJgeeVU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f348f16012cc7ace81e8c34f89b8ec6e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BHXDTJgeeVU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paperwork Purgatory: </strong>Tackle mountains of forms, holy texts and absurdly specific guidelines to determine where each Soul belongs. Of course, you can always wing it and hope for the best… </li>
<li><strong>Divine Dilemmas: </strong>Come face to face with Souls begging you not to send them Down. What is more important, the Rules or Justice? Have you entered your Villain Era and are now sending everyone Down? </li>
<li><strong>Soul Parade:</strong> Meet an eclectic mix of characters from every corner of the Afterlife, each with their own sob stories and supernatural quirks. Who knows? Maybe amongst them you might find the love of your [after]life!</li>
<li><strong>Eternal Endings: </strong>Every choice counts, with multiple possible outcomes that determine your own Afterlife fate. Mess up too bad and maybe even the entire World could be at stake! No pressure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2866290/Elevator_Down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam now</a> for release in Q1 2025.</p>

      <title>Descent 3 open source project gets a first release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After getting open sourced back in April and now run as a community project, the Descent 3 open source engine has a first release available. You do need a copy of the game to run it which you can get from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/descent_3_expansion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/273590/Descent_3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>This open source release also includes the "1.5" patch written by Kevin Bentley and Jeff Slutter several years ago and brought to a stable condition by the Descent community.</p>
<p>So what's actually in this new 1.5 release? They said in the release notes that it "fills in the gaps left in the never-released 1.5 patch of the game, and makes it more accessible and convenient to run on modern devices". Their main focus was to get it running properly on modern CPUs and improve the developer experience. Thanks to the work "Descent 3 now runs on 64-bit Linux, Windows and MacOS using SDL2, on AMD64 as well as ARM64 CPUs" with 32bit support dropped.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5183365391724173270gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Also now available is a <a href="https://github.com/DescentDevelopers/Descent3/discussions/531" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> towards the next release which includes plans for a graphics renderer rewrite to use more modern OpenGL, support for higher screen resolutions, localization support improvements and more.</p>
<p>Will be fun to see this classic see a new life!</p>

      <title>Canonical bring more Steam Snap improvements, also hiring more Desktop Software Engineers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical developers continue working towards Ubuntu 24.10, the next release of the popular Linux distribution, and thankfully more fixes are coming for the Steam Snap package.</p>
<p>Mentioned in an <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-desktop-s-24-10-dev-cycle-part-4-august-update/47217" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> in the Ubuntu Discourse forum, Oliver Smith who is the Interim Engineering Director for Ubuntu Desktop, talked about issues with Snap + NVIDIA + Steam. The team has worked on a "more permissive AppArmor profile" for the Steam Snap package to "grant broader permissions to the snap" and that this "looks to resolve a majority of outstanding game compatibility issues that were not present in the Steam deb".</p>
<p>So hopefully, this will mean the Steam Snap package, that Canonical promoted from experimental to stable, will actually be properly usable soon.</p>
<p>It was also mentioned how they found issues with the NVIDIA 550 driver, which have been fixed. Thankfully that's coming sooner rather than later with a newer version of snapd that will arrive before Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS. Additionally there's some better testing in place now for future driver updates.</p>
<p>Thanks to all this they "expect a significant improvement in the quality of compatibility of the Steam snap".</p>
<p>Also, if you're looking for a job, Canonical are again hiring for more <a href="https://canonical.com/careers/all?filter=Engineering" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Desktop Software Engineers</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS is due out on August 29th.</em></p>

      <title>Check out the fancy new trailer for Beyond All Reason a really great free and open source RTS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beyond All Reason is quietly building up to be one of the best real-time strategy (RTS) games around. It's free, open source and it has a fancy new trailer.</p>
<p>Technically, it's nowhere near finished as a game, they call it "Alpha+" but it's extremely playable and is a huge amount of fun to send massive armies across the map. I've been playing it for quite some time now and really enjoy their attention to the details.</p>
<p>A lot of history to this one too going all the way back to the 1997 classic Total Annihilation. Beyond All Reason originally used the <a href="https://springrts.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SpringRTS</a> (Spring Engine) game engine, which itself started off life as a 3D game engine for classic Total Annihilation. Beyond All Reason is also a fork of Balanced Annihilation, a mod for SpringRTS. Nowadays it runs on <a href="https://beyond-all-reason.github.io/spring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recoil</a>, a "hard fork of Spring".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally. After over a year of waiting, FINAL FANTASY XVI is now confirmed to be releasing on PC on September 17. If you want to see how well it will work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Desktop Linux or Steam Deck, there's a demo available right now too.</p>

Before long, Clive will be caught up in a great tragedy and swear revenge on the Dark Eikon Ifrit, a mysterious entity that brings calamity in its wake.</p>

      <title>Linux system performance optimizer GameMode v1.8.2 out now fixing hybrid CPU core pinning</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Started off by porting studio Feral Interactive, the Linux system performance optimization tool GameMode <a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode/releases/tag/1.8.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">v1.8.2</a> is out now.</p>
<p>More about it: GameMode is a daemon/lib combo for Linux that allows games to request a set of optimisations be temporarily applied to the host OS and/or a game process. GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is now host to a range of optimisation features and configurations.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main changes from this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix idle inhibitor closing bus connection too early (<a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode/pull/466" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#466</a>).</li>
<li>Fix hybrid CPU core pinning (<a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode/pull/455" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#455</a>).</li>
<li>Fix unreadable process maps in gamemodelist (<a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode/pull/463" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#463</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed crash if dbus is not accesible (<a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode/pull/458" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#458</a>).</li>
<li>Various bugfixes and improvements to documentation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">What can GameMode actually do? According to the <a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> optimizations you can use include changes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU governor.</li>
<li>I/O priority.</li>
<li>Process niceness.</li>
<li>Kernel scheduler (<code class="inline-code">SCHED_ISO</code>).</li>
<li>Screensaver inhibiting.</li>

      <title>Get ready to collect some Rabbits in Usagi Shima: Bunny Island</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Usagi Shima: Bunny Island is a game I've been following for quite some time, as it looks adorable (and as a Rabbit owner I couldn't resist) and it finally has a Steam page. Currently available on mobile platforms, it was built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> so hopefully they won't have too much trouble with a PC release, which will come with Linux support too.</p>
<p>A nice relaxing casual game for those of you who prefer the more chilled side of gaming. As the developer said: "It is heavily inspired by cute, soothing games like Neko Atsume and Animal Crossing. The game’s namesake and setting draws inspiration from Ōkunoshima (大久野島), a real island in Japan that has a lot of bunny inhabitants!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gkRf3wuNpro"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aa17a1020be442c6724055e0cb2e35b9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gkRf3wuNpro" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover and collect 30+ rabbits with unique looks and features!</li>
<li>Collect 100+ items to decorate with, some even interactive!</li>
<li>Pet, feed, brush, and play hide and seek with the bunnies to build friendship.</li>
<li>Dress up your bunnies with adorable hats!</li>
<li>Receive keepsakes from bunnies you’ve become best friends with, and even invite them to stay on your island.</li>
<li>Take snapshots to build an adorable photo album and even make the captured photos into device wallpapers.</li>
<li>Hand-drawn and traditionally animated art style.</li>
<li>Synced with real-time, experience the island ambience that matches your time of day.</li>
<li>Cozy idle gameplay with no time limits, no stress, peaceful and soothing to play at your own pace!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The PC release likely isn't until 2025, so you've got a while to wait yet. Worth the wait hopefully though, as it's <em>very</em> highly rated on mobile.</p>

      <title>Colony building sim Odd Realm is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Early Access for a few years, Unknown Origin Games have now fully launched their mystical colony sim Odd Realm.</p>
<p>A pretty complex game inspired by the likes of RimWorld and Dwarf Fortress, it's one where you could end up spending days in it. Start off with nothing, and eventually watch as your little pixel people do your bidding and build up a big bustling colony. Dig deep for riches and watch out for some less than friendly neighbours.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer for the 1.0 release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="opFFQLdP-5M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/82ed98142d827172cfc123504e562ce8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/opFFQLdP-5M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the release the developer said: "I started making this little game at the beginning of 2017. I didn't know what I was getting into at the time, but I knew I wanted to make a colony sim set in a strange, little fantasy world. It has been a monumental challenge, and it's because of your constant patience and encouragement that I was able to get to 1.0. Especially over the last several months where players have helped me find bugs in the beta or simply kept me company. So, for that, truly, a genuine thank you to all of you.</p>
<p>And if you are a new player, thank you for playing my game. It means a great deal to me.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't the end. We are just getting cooking! If you've read my previous posts, you know that there's a lot planned for upcoming versions of the game."</p>
<p>The developer confirmed more is coming including another playable race, overworld conquest, deeper history and events, modding support, localization and more content overall.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 races to start your kingdom with, each with unique playstyles.</li>
<li>Unlimited procedurally generated deserts, mountains, tropical islands, and frozen tundras.</li>
<li>Dynamic weather and seasons unique to each biome.</li>
<li>Hundreds of plants, animals, and items.</li>
<li>A research tree with options for each race that unlock new blueprints and rooms.</li>
<li>Outfit individual settlers with tools, weapons, and gear.</li>
<li>Manage your kingdom and view other kingdoms on an expansive world map.</li>
<li>Battle raiders, invading armies, and underground horrors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Odd Realm has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>GOG confirm Resident Evil 2 re-release date for August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news retro game lovers, as <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> have now confirmed that <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 2</a> is due to get its re-release on August 27th. This is coming as part of <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG's classic collection</a> with <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resident Evil 1</a> releasing back on July 26th, with Resident Evil 3 yet to be given a date, </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1EuuJCGWfC8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e8ae98bcef4e4ad6702c78e3506464f6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1EuuJCGWfC8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Like with the first, GOG are ensuring there's a bunch of updates to get it working nicely including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full compatibility with Windows 10 and Windows 11.</li>
<li>6 localizations of the game included (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese).</li>

<li>Improved audio volume and panning.</li>

<li>4th Survivor and Tofu modes enabled from the very beginning.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Linux Desktop and Steam Deck players, you'll need Wine / Proton to play it, but hopefully this will be the best edition of the classic given that impressive sounding list. Getting GOG games on Linux is pretty darn easy with my favourite <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/heroic-games-launcher-v215-has-expanded-gog-support-ea-games-from-epic-store-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher which only just had some big GOG improvements</a> too.</p>

      <title>shapez 2 is an absurdly great and accessible factory-building game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to cut some shapes, and I don't mean on the dance floor. Factory-building sim shapez 2 is out now in Early Access with Linux support. <em>Note: Key provided by GameDriveNL.</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that there's this big swirly hungry vortex, it's desperately hungry for some shapes, and it's your job to pull them all out and send them into the void. How you go about that is your choice, it mostly leaves you to just chill out and have fun building these massive ridiculous sprawling factories across a gigantic map.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15528492201723827823gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15528492201723827823gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stacking circles on top of squares, and cutting squares into tiny squares.</em></p>
<p>shapez 2 has done something truly quite exceptional here. Not only has improved on the idea of the first game in pretty much every possible way, it's done so while adding deeper gameplay mechanics and moved it from 2D to full 3D. I'm honestly astonished at every part of it. Not only does it run really well, but it looks quite pretty too. Seeing all sorts of shapes flowing across the map is quite mesmerising.</p>
<p>The way everything just flows is impressive, and how it eases you into it carefully but quite quickly you soon get to grips with the mechanics. That's also thanks to the very clear interface, clearly a lot of attention has gone into all the little things with shapez 2. Plenty of clear and easily explained details from the in-game guide for any time you lost too.</p>
<p>Not only is it now in 3D, but it's multi-layered too, so you'll be building conveyor belts on top of other belts, dropping things on top of each other. But even there, the controls and UI are really super-simple to understand and it just makes it so satisfying to play. I will admit there was a brief bit of confusion there, but again due to how clear the UI and style of the game is, it's not frustrating, and there's no punishments, you just delete a few belts and re-do it quickly and easily.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SFoml48FR2M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/be3417b8476aac2e78935fe3a3aa1d65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SFoml48FR2M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once you really get going, giving you a chance to sit back and what all the moving pieces while you progress through the next shape quest, it feels like watching a fancy Rube Goldberg machine, like being a child again watching marbles just fall through various things to eventually drop into something.</p>
<p>It takes the most basic elements of Factorio, Satisfactory and other similar titles and really distils it into the purest form of factory building. One that's great for the more casual audience, but just as engrossing for those who love the chaos that can come from others, it just has a bit of everything but with no pesky aliens to worry about coming along and wrecking your perfect designs.</p>
<p>Current features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Layer 3D Factories:</strong> Design and optimize your factories in a whole new dimension.</li>
<li><strong>Trains: </strong>Connect distant stations with a network of space trains.</li>
<li><strong>Research System:</strong> Unlock buildings, mechanics &amp; upgrades in the all-new tech tree.</li>
<li><strong>New Shape Mechanics: </strong>Discover new shapes types with unique properties and logic.</li>
<li><strong>Blueprint Library: </strong>Save, load, export and share factory design blueprints with anyone.</li>
<li><strong>All-new Visuals: </strong>Build factories and stations in a stunning immersive space environment.</li>
<li><strong>Fluids: </strong>Use different types of liquids to process shapes or boost production.</li>
<li><strong>Animated Open Buildings: </strong>See what's happening inside buildings in your factory.</li>
<li><strong>Easy editing: </strong>Cutting, cloning, rotating and destroying sections of your factory has never been so intuitive.</li>
<li><strong>Undo/Redo: </strong>Gain the ability to undo/redo unwanted operations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With the Native Linux version tested, I've not encountered any problems. It's silky smooth, looks good, performs well and no graphical issues noted. Probably one of the best launches (especially for Early Access) that I've seen for some time. There's a lot to like about this one that I can truly see myself spending numerous hours in.</p>
<p>From the press release: Tobias Springer, founder of tobspr Games, said “We’re very excited and proud to have finally launched shapez 2 into Early Access. This game has been a labor of love so we couldn’t be happier with what we have managed to deliver to our players at Early Access launch. The game is already in a fantastic state but as we move forward, we are going to continue to develop it by listening to our community and implementing features that will make it even better for both our fans and those new to the factory building genre. We’re hugely thankful for the support we have received so far and look forward to continuing building shapez 2 into an even more satisfying strategy experience”.</p>
<p>No surprise to see before publishing the article, a quick check on Steam shows an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating. One I truly think is 100% deserves here.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors gets free content in The Darkasso update, online co-op still in development </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The game that started it all and has been cloned repeatedly, Vampire Survivors has another free update out with The Darkasso update. After some truly cryptic and confusing teasers, the developers have now properly announced it.</p>
<p>Non-spoilery version of what's in the update::</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>9 new EXTRA achievements</li>
<li>1 new challenge stage</li>
<li>1 new relic</li>
<li>2 new special character skins</li>
<li>5 new Arcanas</li>
<li>🦇🦇🦇</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And they have another ridiculous trailer to go along with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZY-SoV-A39s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c0d76a08e1c88ad4356540befe8606d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZY-SoV-A39s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For those waiting on the online co-op support, they said it's still progressing well but too early to give details. As for other things to come, they're still being quite secretive there, other than saying "we have put one on hold, substituted another one, two are still ongoing, and finally we have greenlit 2 of them" with more details coming in 2025 on whatever it is.</p>
<p>They also joked how they basically throw darts on their roadmap on what to pick:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2388482051723821064gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2388482051723821064gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other bug fixes and improvements from patch 1.11 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Obtaining the Yellow Sign also allows to see if a treasure chest has the potential to contain an evolution (Silver Chests)<br/>
- Carréllo projectiles won't be destroyed anymore when they hit the top or bottom edge of the screen<br/>
- GoldFingers are now pulled into Mad Groove, unless spawned directly on the map (e.g. Astral Stair ones are ignored)<br/>

- Various fixes to Arcana selection and draft screens<br/>
- Various fixes to cursor navigation when playing co-op<br/>

- [Moonspell] Nightsword and Muramasa deal bonus damage depending on Greed<br/>

      <title>Get ready to paint the world in tracks with Super Loco World from the Farlanders creator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of Farlanders, Andriy Bychkovskyi, has revealed their next game with Super Loco World, a train building management and automation sim. With a soft casual style it looks quite inviting, but that definitely seems like it hides the complexities of it. For anyone who loves traffic management sims, railroad tycoon-styled games, this may be one for you.</p>
<p>Unlike some other games, the trains won't magically be able to turn around. So here, you really have the challenge of not only getting trains from station to station across a dynamic world, but you need to ensure they can actually get back the other way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5761523191723815009gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5761523191723815009gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1696140041723815011gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1696140041723815011gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that, there's a lot of management and automation at play here. You need to set all their speeds, manage the junctions, rail signals and much more. The developer mentioned how you're free to experiment with it as the game "encourages creativity and does not penalize you for rebuilding railroads or infrastructure".</p>
<p>As you build up your networks the world evolves with you with expanding villages that grow into small town and eventually bigger. Trains actually consume fuel here too, so you'll need stations for that, along with the money to keep it all ticking over. However, as a nice little accessibility feature, fuel cost can be turned off.</p>
<p>Each time is fresh too with the game world and resource distribution being randomly generated.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L0KZyRC55ng"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d17a02b4b4b8e908732ce0f75ac7ee3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L0KZyRC55ng" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer told me over email it will have full Native Linux support. Sounds like a nice one to keep an eye on. Looks really quite charming.</p>

      <title>These new Factorio enemies coming in Factorio: Space Age look horrifying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Factorio is a game about building and automating, but it's also all about defending from vicious aliens and the new lot coming in Factorio: Space Age look like the stuff of nightmares.</p>
<p>The developers have been showing off some of the new planets coming with the expansion that's due in October, and one planet they've been highlighting recently is <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-413" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gleba</a>. Originally known internally as the "biological planet", it looks a whole lot more alive than other planets. In fact, it looks really gross and vibrant and I can't wait to explore and cover it with belts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11590479021723811934gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11590479021723811934gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12491440531723811936gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12491440531723811936gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-424" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest developer diary</a>, the team showed off some of the horrors that will await you on planet Gleba. And uh, you're going to need some firepower to deal with them. Based on "distant relatives of starfish or seastars", you'll be facing off against small and rather large 5-legged Pentapods.</p>
<p>Since Factorio will have multiple planets in the expansion, the developers are doing some interesting balancing work on the enemies here. As you might face them late in the game when you're fully equipped, or you might go in a bit under-prepared depending on where you expand. Thankfully, these new beasties won't seek you out right away to devour you, instead mainly focusing on protecting their nests or nearby allies. As the developer said they are "fairly passive" but "If you do fight them and win then they will evolve".</p>
<p>Have a look at them below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NVzNYhgsecU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e218e8469ffacc5016672ff038669182.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NVzNYhgsecU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Factorio has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Chilled castle doodling game Tiny Glade releases September 23 and the demo is back</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Glade is a wonderful idea, letting you just chilled out and doodle castles with their fantastic tools and it's now set to launch on September 23. It's also one of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most wishlisted</a> games on Steam, after the demo clearly hooked a lot of people in.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/6124418777150844821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced</a> on Steam as part of the Wholesome Games Festival, the demo is back up again and will be until it releases so you can get a taste of it again. It also has full Native Linux support. The demo was also updated with "small birdies, trapdoors, ability to move freehand walls, color lanterns, and many other tweaks across the smörgåsbord" so you may want to re-try it anyway.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CdWpq2efN8Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3320c22e3b2f4c041ffa8fcb1f88e0c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CdWpq2efN8Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tiny Glade is a relaxing free-form building game. Tap into the joy of making something pretty with no management, no combat, or wrong answers - just kick back, doodle some castles, and turn forgotten meadows into lovable dioramas.</p>
<p>Explore gridless building chemistry, and watch the game carefully assemble every brick, pebble and plank. Draw a path through a wall? An arch pops up! Widen the arch? Pillars line up. Lower the wall? Arches turn into fences and gates.</p>
<p>There are no wrong answers or failure states. You can change your mind at any time, and whatever you make will look cozy out of the box.</p>

      <title>Free classic RTS OpenRA mod &#39;Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms&#39; has a huge overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love your classic RTS games, especially those from Westwood like Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert, you need to play the <a href="https://www.openra.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> mod Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms. <em>This standalone game mod for the open source OpenRA bundles in so much it's crazy.</em></p>
<p>Going over the changelog, it's quite ridiculous the amount that's included in this update. There's new artwork and visual effects, various new units across each faction, new structures, new gameplay mechanics and the list goes on.</p>
<p>One of the major additions is a change to the ranking system and upgrades. The Soviet side has an entirely new ranking system with more depth, while the Allied and Scrin factions now feature mutually exclusive upgrade paths, offering greater variety and strategic choices in the high-tech endgame. These enhancements will provide fresh tactical options and new ways to customize your forces.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13709213001723806588gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13709213001723806588gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged releases September 19</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to go on an adventure? Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged from Revolution Software Ltd is ready to release on September 19. A complete remaster of the original, first in the series, it comes complete with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>This is thanks to their previous Kickstarter campaign where the developer raised £618,626 in funds.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Point and click offers a simple interface from which captivating, challenging gameplay emerges,” says Charles Cecil, founder and CEO of Revolution Software. “But the user experience has remained unchanged since the ‘90s when Broken Sword redefined the genre. Our research suggested that gamers now prefer a more contemporary experience. Broken Sword has a hugely passionate fan base, which runs over three generations. With these graphic and user experience enhancements, we look forward to hearing from fans once the game crosses over, once again, to a fourth generation who love narrative-driven games.”</p>

      <title>Hunt: Showdown 1896 broke on Linux / Steam Deck, here&#39;s the quick fix for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 17/08/24, 9:00 UTC</strong>: Proton Hotfix was updated with the needed fix to get it working. Valve has set this by default for it so you should uncheck any forced compatibility options you have set. Nice to see Valve react so quickly once again.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown had a huge update and rebranded to Hunt: Showdown 1896, but the update came with breakage on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Valve have been really quick at times when this sort of thing happens to bigger games. And once again, Valve to the rescue. Use this fix at your own risk though, as it can cause other issues, it will also affect any other games you currently have set to Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>For the fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Proton Experimental in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go into Properties -&gt; Betas.</li>
<li>Select the "bleeding-edge latest and untested dxvk, vkd3d-proton and wine changes; backup your prefixes before using" (not the 8.0 version!).</li>
<li>Then ensure Proton Experimental has updated.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19425189781723801884gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19425189781723801884gol1.png"/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>After that, find Hunt: Showdown 1896 in your Steam Library.</li>
<li>Go into Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton Experimental.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20752440071723801978gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20752440071723801978gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>After that, you'll be good to go. No doubt a fresh normal version of Proton Experimental will come soon so that first part eventually won't be needed.</p>
<p>What's new in the game? Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Map – Mammon's Gulch, a whole new biome set in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado.</li>
<li>New Wild Target – the Hellborn is Hunt's newest Wild Target who uses an onslaught of fiery attacks. Once downed, the Hellborn will grant a Bounty Token with no Banish time.</li>
<li>Scorched Earth – a new Live Event giving players brand-new rewards to earn.</li>
<li>New CRYEINGINE 5.11 integration – ushering in upgraded visuals, audio, performance, and more.</li>
<li>New UI - overhauled to improve navigation, with plenty more updates to come.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's the trailer for the new update:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="16vBsmpcxh4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d7e8b8499d36f5460941ceba538b761.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/16vBsmpcxh4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Valve released Windows drivers for Steam Deck OLED but no official support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it is not in any way officially supported by Valve, they have now released Windows drivers for the newer Steam Deck OLED model.</p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck ships with SteamOS (Linux) out of the box, and all of Valve's work goes into that, you're basically on your own if you choose to put Windows on the Steam Deck OLED. As per the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support page</a>, they note very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are providing these resources as is and are unfortunately unable to offer 'Windows on Deck' support. If you get stuck and need a way back to the default Steam Deck OS, please follow <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">these recovery instructions</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>This is the same status for the original Steam Deck LCD model.</em></p>
<p>If you do wish to do so, you'll need to first update to SteamOS 3.6.9+ (currently in Beta/Preview), which includes the latest firmware. The drivers for Windows also need a <em>manual</em> download for each one including: APU, Audio, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth drivers. Currently though, the audio drivers only enable audio via headphones or Bluetooth, work for the speakers is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Dual-booting is also still not supported either but that is being worked on still but there's no timeline for it.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about Windows due to other stores and launchers, perhaps first look into the likes of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/heroic-games-launcher-v215-has-expanded-gog-support-ea-games-from-epic-store-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/nonsteamlaunchers-decky-loader-plugin-for-steam-deck-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a>.</p>

      <title>Stellaris Cosmic Storms expansion will launch September 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Might be time for another run in Stellaris with the Cosmic Storms announced today to release on September 10th. Developed in collaboration with Behaviour Rotterdam, it's set to expand space weather in a big way.</p>
<p>Not only have they totally overhauled the original Space Storm into an entire system of features, but there's also a new weather map mode for forecasting these storms and predicting their motion, with technologies and buildings to attract, repel, or with an Ascension Perk, even create storms.</p>
<p>While some storm may be bad, not everything will be, some may reveal buried treasures for you or leave planets with new intriguing effects. Check out the release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2VfVkAHidAY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c35fc6ea4a4d230488df7413e988886.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2VfVkAHidAY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you get with the DLC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NEW STORMS</strong></p>
<p>This expansion adds 8 types of Cosmic Storms (Electric, Particle, Gravity, Magnetic, Radiant, Stardust, Shroud and Nexus) that replace the existing Space Storms, spawning randomly on the map. They travel the galaxy at various speeds, growing and shrinking with time.</p>
<p><strong>STORM CHASER ORIGIN</strong></p>
<p>The Storm Chasers are an empire made of people that seek to push themselves beyond their own limits. They believe enlightenment is found in engaging with the greatest force the universe has to offer: the Cosmic Storms.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>3 NEW CIVICS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Astrometeorology</li>
<li>Storm Devotion</li>
<li>Environmental Architects</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2 PRECURSOR NARRATIVES</strong></p>
<p>Discover the stories of the Ancients, vanished masters of the storms: Weather Manipulators and the adAkkaria Convention of Benevolence. The completion of these narratives will unlock a new relic for each.</p>
<p>On top of that, <em>Cosmic Storms</em> adds technologies dedicated to storms, Galactic Community Resolutions, Anomalies, Arc Sites, and Weather Forecast Map Mode. It also adds a new Galactic Weather Control ascension perk, that makes it possible to create cosmic storms with science ships.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can pre-purchase for €12.99 / $12.99 / £10.99 or buy it as part of Stellaris: Season 08 - Expansion Pass.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers Decky Loader plugin for Steam Deck released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making it perhaps easier than ever to get more stores and launchers onto your Steam Deck, the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a> plugin for Decky Loader is now available. It's been in testing for a while, but now it's available in the main Decky Loader store.</p>
<p>It supports installing and setting up Amazon Games Launcher, Battle.net, EA App, Epic Games, GOG Galaxy, Humble Games Collection, IndieGala, itch.io, Rockstar Games, Ubisoft Connect and various others.</p>
<p>You'll need to <em>first</em> install <a href="https://decky.xyz/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>, which is incredibly simple now. Just hit the download on the official site in Desktop Mode, then double-click it to run it from your Downloads folder and follow the plain on-screen instructions. Once done, you can just boot back into Gaming Mode and install NonSteamLaunchers right from the Decky Loader store.</p>
<p>Finding it in the Decky Loader store:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6431428211723732190gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6431428211723732190gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Once installed, it gives you a few different options:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130586111723732191gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19130586111723732191gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Picking to install the Epic Games Store as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14611314171723732192gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14611314171723732192gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176184961723732192gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15176184961723732192gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And finally, there it is all installed for me with a nice shortcut in the Non-Steam part of your Steam Library:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14065529931723732290gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14065529931723732290gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a lot of different stores and launchers, so this really can just help simplify the process. There's other methods of course like the Heroic Games Store for Epic, GOG and Amazon Prime Games but NonSteamLaunchers uses the official launchers run through Proton.</p>
<p>You'll see this addition from <a href="http://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases/tag/v3.9.3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers v3.9.3</a> which also includes a few other enhancements.</p>

<p>Looks like the Godot team went all-out for the Godot Engine 4.3 release, bringing this royalty-free open source game engine into a bright future.</p>
<p>Their new <a href="https://godotengine.org/releases/4.3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release page</a> is certainly more interesting than before! Instead of paragraphs of text, they more clearly show off all the new stuff included (a bit more like how Blender do their release pages). This is probably the most truly professional I've seen Godot seem.</p>
<p>Some really impressive features added in this release too!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14115793751723729579gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14115793751723729579gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Godot 4.3, messing with the <a href="https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2755" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Voxel Game Demo</a>.</p>
<p>Some highlights of the new features includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New audio resources to make complex, layered music and transitions.</li>
<li>2D physics interpolation.</li>
<li>An overhauled visual shader editor.</li>
<li>General multi-threading improvements.</li>
<li>More flexible layers for TileMaps.</li>
<li>New skeletal animation import options.</li>
<li>Improved pixel art stability.</li>
<li>Big improvement to Godot's parallax system.</li>
<li>Project Manager design improvements.</li>
<li>Depth-based fog now possible.</li>
<li>Direct3D 12 support.</li>
<li>A Compositor effects API to let users hook into the built in Godot rendering.</li>
<li>More Wayland improvements on Linux but still opt-in.</li>
<li>2D content renders less blurry in XR.</li>
<li>Slimmer GDScript project exports with Binary tokenization.</li>
<li>+ lots more. Seriously there's loads.</li>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress adds Dwarf Babies, an upgraded Adventure Mode and more but macOS cancelled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's plenty of good news in the latest Dwarf Fortress update, unless you're a macOS gamer that is. A fresh Beta update is out now.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/4237410439220288178" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam the developers noted you'll no longer be confused whether red-clothed adult dwarves are actually children, since there's now actually baby sprites for dwarves! Oh, the game should also look a fair bit prettier with lots of new fruit, flower and leaf pictures for the "over 180 different plant and tree species". There's also a quest log and information screen for Adventure Mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16607664611723727521gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16607664611723727521gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main addition highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quest log and information screen in adventure mode.</li>
<li>Child and baby pictures for dwarves.</li>
<li>Many new fruit, flower, leaf pictures.</li>
<li>Updated dwarf clothing images.</li>
<li>Made good/bad thoughts about tombs work.</li>
<li>Fixed error with experiment portrait mandibles.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're on macOS though, it's been cancelled "for the time being" as it doesn't make enough sense for them to dedicate time to when there's so much of the game still needing work elsewhere. Feels a bit odd to be on the other side of the fence for once, as that's what usually happens to Linux but Dwarf Fortress has Native Linux support already.</p>
<p>They've also said despite the success, they won't be hiring more programmers to speed it up. They're sticking to "Tarn’s vision, no matter how long it takes, rather than trying to optimize for speed" and they see it as a lifetime project, one that will be updated steadily "forever" but slowly. Just like playing the game itself, the development of it is not for the impatient.</p>

      <title>Until Dawn remake arrives on PC October 4, requires PSN account</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those interested in the Until Dawn remake from Ballistic Moon and PlayStation Publishing LLC, it's set to arrive on October 4th.</p>
<p>Much like other recent Sony releases on PC though, it will require a PlayStation Network account. The PlayStation Overlay <em>hasn't</em> been mentioned though which is why Ghost of Tsushima's online mode doesn't work for us, so it <em>should</em> run with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> on Desktop Linux and potentially Steam Deck if you can pull the graphics down enough. I think it's safe to say all Sony PC releases will require a PSN account going forward.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bIkuM5y0Bjw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a3b39373a20fd95ccccde57aca84e69e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bIkuM5y0Bjw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers also shared various details on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/14/until-dawn-rebuilt-and-enhanced-for-ps5-and-pc-launches-october-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation blog</a> about what's new like overhauled visuals with Unreal Engine 5, new camera controls, a reworked prologue, new collectables, more customizable settings and new settings for accessibility and much more.</p>
<p>I always wanted to try it, so I think I'll have to give this one a go.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Mesa 24.2.0 released with a new shader cache implementation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 24.2.0 is out now bringing with it the usual advancements for open source OpenGL and Vulkan graphics drivers on Linux.</p>
<p>As usual, the Mesa developers suggest that those wanting stability stay with the previous version, or at least wait for Mesa 24.2.1 which is due around August 28th.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main additions are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering_local_read on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_legacy_vertex_attributes on lavapipe, ANV, Turnip and RADV</li>
<li>VK_MESA_image_alignment_control on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_shader_replicated_composites on ANV, dozen, hasvk, lavapipe, nvk, RADV, and Turnip</li>
<li>VK_KHR_maintenance5 on v3dv</li>
<li>VK_KHR_maintenance7 on RADV</li>
<li>VK_EXT_depth_clamp_zero_one on v3dv</li>
<li>GL_ARB_depth_clamp on v3d</li>
<li>Defaulting to a new shader cache implementation, reducing filesystem overhead.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Along with a lot of bug fixes too across various drivers including issues solved for Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Dota 2, Counter-Strike 2, Worms Revolution, Asterix &amp; Obelix XXL: Romastered, Fallout 3, Blender, Starfield, Total War: Warhammer 3, Enshrouded and others.</p>
<p>Plenty of improvements also landed for NVK which should work a fair amount better as of this release.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/24.2.0.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all the details.</p>

      <title>Valve attempts to deal with jokes, memes and ASCII art reviews on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm sure you've all seen some of the more playful user reviews on Steam, but they're not exactly helpful for figuring out if you want to buy a game and so Valve have a new "Helpfulness System" they're testing.</p>
<p>Valve said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4326355263805583415" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> of the new Beta that this new system will not impact the actual review scores, just change the ordering of what reviews are actually shown. As Valve explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>User reviews that are identified as being unhelpful for potential customers, such as one-word reviews, reviews comprised of ASCII art, or reviews that are primarily playful memes and in-jokes, will be sorted behind other reviews on the game’s store page. That doesn't mean players won't ever see these humorous, but unhelpful posts, but it hopefully means that they’ll see them less frequently when trying to learn about a game. If you enjoy seeing these sorts of reviews when browsing the store, there's an option on the store page to include them when browsing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How do Valve determine which to show? They said they use a mixture of techniques, including user reports and the Steam moderation team looking directly at reviews, along with some "machine learning algorithms". They found that a lot of the unhelpful reviews were easy enough to spot but it's all a work in progress. And of course, considering the amount of user reviews on Steam, this could take a while to get through.</p>
<p>For example, looking at Persona 3 Reload without (first picture) and with the new system activated (second picture) and yeah…the results of this new system are pretty clear:</p>

      <title>Two Point Museum announced from the devs of Two Point Hospital / Two Point Campus</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Studios are back with another quirky building and management sim. Following up on the successful releases of Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus the next in the series is Two Point Museum.</p>
<p>Sounds like quite a fun one this. It's not just the usual building and management but with expeditions you get to send your experts on too. There's also a new world-map system to allow you to venture far and wide to undiscovered areas in your quest to find unusual relics in various styles and rarity types to decorate your museum.</p>
<p>As you unearth strange exhibits, the endless star scoring system encourages you to tweak the layout of your museum depending on what you discover. You’ll need to revisit your old collections, showcase your new finds and change your strategy as you push your mega-museum towards becoming Two Point County’s star attraction.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iGmUKTszyRU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71968abfcc3c8b3a53d66cee7cdc4ef9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iGmUKTszyRU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From what I've seen it will have Native Linux support once again.</p>

<p>Mudborne is a bit more fantasy-styled than APICO with you being able to use the genetic keys of the new species you create you can unlock the paths between the waking and dreaming worlds. Sounds pretty wild.</p>
<p>The game begins with you awakening from hibernation to find your pond abandoned and empty. Through a combination of crafting mini-games, menu management and puzzle solving, experiment with genetics to breed new frogs and recover what was lost.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZHzhR7RGf1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7048ab16a2122311a87b3cd3629e81e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZHzhR7RGf1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For this game, the developer has now moved on from Game Maker too, instead going with <a href="https://love2d.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LÖVE</a>, a free and open-source cross-platform framework. Speaking to the developer, ellraiser, it sounds like they're really enjoying their time using LÖVE and of course it works much nicer on Linux too with ellraiser telling me it has "been a breath of fresh air all round".</p>
<p>So you might want to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2355150/Mudborne/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hop over to the Steam page</a> and try out the new demo.</p>

      <title>Valve upgrades Steam Families and Game Recording in the latest Steam Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Beta Client has been released for Desktop and Steam Deck, with a few fixes and upgrades and the change for Steam Families is especially nice.</p>
<p>If you have enabled the specific "Parental Controls" option for a child in your Steam Families available in the Family Management section on Steam, you can now have much easier control over exactly what they can play with an easy right-click menu on games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19816144751723644032gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19816144751723644032gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5956825141723644032gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5956825141723644032gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Great to see Valve continue to make Steam Families much more useful than before.</p>

</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for disabling game recording on a per-game basis.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare bug that could result in the client failing to start due to invalid symlinks in ~/.steam</li>

      <title>Valve confirm plan to get Steam Deck&#39;s SteamOS on the ROG Ally and more handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've known for a long time that Valve planned to get the newer SteamOS that's on the Steam Deck out for more systems, but they've been a bit quiet on it. Now, they've confirmed it's still the plan for the likes of the ROG Ally and other systems.</p>
<p>Just recently I pointed out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/steamos-369-beta-for-steam-deck-curiously-mentions-the-asus-rog-ally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">curious mention of the ROG Ally</a> in a recent SteamOS update note. A lot of other sites caught onto this as well, and so <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a> actually got word from Valve on what the update note meant and got a reply from Valve designer Lawrence Yang to mention: "The note about ROG Ally keys is related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS." </p>
<p>Additionally Yang noted they're "making steady progress" but it's not ready yet. On top of that Steam Deck OLED drivers for Windows are also being prepared and dual-boot is still planned to come at some point too.</p>
<p>The thing is, you don't need to wait for SteamOS to get Linux on many different handhelds like the ROG Ally, ROG Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go, and various devices from GPD, AYANEO, OneXPlayer because there's multiple versions of Linux out there designed and supported on those devices already like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/chimeraos-46-2-brings-full-asus-rog-ally-x-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/bazzite-linux-36-out-now-bringing-full-asus-rog-ally-x-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>.</p>
<p>Nice to know Valve are still working on it all, but naturally none of it is a priority, since most of their work is to support their own devices with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED.</p>

      <title>Steam store pages are about to get a lot cleaner, Valve puts an end to game advert spam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit of a win for consumers I think, as some developers were making a right mess of their Steam store pages as Valve have now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4201376568915048836" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> some big changes.</p>
<p>You've probably seen it a good few times: you go to a Steam page, scroll down to get some info on the game, and you're presented with a list of random games from the publisher first that have <em>nothing</em> to do with the game you're wanting to look at. Some publishers really went overboard with this too, essentially publishing a bunch of games to turn them into adverts for other games and it got quite annoying.</p>
<p>In the announcement Valve said new rules will apply to the "About The Game" section, "Short Description" section, "Special Announcement" sections and the "Awards" section that include these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No links to other websites - This means that you cannot use your store page to link to any other website, including social media pages. There are specific link fields provided within your store page editor for linking to common social media platforms or your own website.</li>
<li>No embedded imagery that mimics Steam store UI or buttons - You should not have images or animations that are meant to look like Steam UI such as images that look like wishlist buttons or game capsules or prices.</li>
<li>No images, links, or widgets pointing to other games on Steam - This means that you cannot use your store page description to advertise other products on Steam. If you have related products, you can set up bundles, franchises, or developer homepages.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of this and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/valve-gives-developers-some-big-reasons-to-add-a-demo-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big standalone demo page update</a>, this should also stop all the "free" Prologues that have become much more regular (that are basically demos under a different name) with developers sticking banners on their pages for all their prologues, as now the games and demos can be properly linked together.</p>
<p>On top of that, Valve has adjusted the Steam homepage, to stop all the demos appearing in the New &amp; Trending tab pushing down actual new releases. Instead, there's now a dedicated tab for Trending Free that bundles them all there. A nice change for developers and consumers.</p>

      <title>Ex-Blizzard devs new RTS &#39;Stormgate&#39; out in Early Access, works on Linux but may need a small fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stormgate is a fresh RTS game set in an all-new science fantasy universe, it's hit Early Access today free to play but you may need a little tweak on Linux to run it. Developed by a whole bunch of Ex-Blizzard staffers including people who worked on StarCraft II, Warcraft III as well as C&amp;C: Generals 2 and Wasteland 3, the team certainly knows their stuff.</p>
<p>Quite exciting to see another big RTS enter the market, as someone who absolutely adores these types of games and what I've played of it has been quite promising. Still plenty of rough edges, but that's expected for an unfinished game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lSroUxCsBAQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13b84383fdde036d7f10bde818cda659.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lSroUxCsBAQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The good news is that with Proton 9.0-2, it <em>does</em> work pretty well on Linux (testing done on Kubuntu 24.04). However, there's an issue where you may get <em>stuck</em> on the loading screen when it's checking for Ping. You can overcome this issue with one single terminal command, which as always with suggestions — use at your own risk:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 1000"</code></p>
<p><em>This allows your user to send and receive ICMP echo packets.</em></p>
<p>After that, no issues getting into the game. Performance is pretty <em>reasonable</em> too, again making allowances since it's not finished. Running it on my AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT at 2560x1440 the "Ultra" preset has been giving me a mostly smooth 60FPS+ and largely well over that.</p>
<p>I played a lot of StarCraft and StarCraft II years ago, and playing Stormgate was quite peculiar because it really does feel like StarCraft, although StarCraft with a lower budget. Even some of the unit voice lines sound like an alternate version of some units in StarCraft. This Ex-Blizzard team are certainly doing their best to be StarCraftButNot.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17803597491723576661gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17803597491723576661gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13464492031723576659gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13464492031723576659gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The free to play release does still need you to end up paying eventually though, since it only includes 1v1 ranked matched, 3 player co-op missions (and all heroes in co-op up to level 5) and custom games. If you want all the heroes and the actual campaign, you do <em>need</em> to pay up. For <em>everything</em> it's £50.99 according to Steam in the "Ultimate Early Access Pack".</p>

      <title>Minishoot&#39; Adventures developers rebuilt their UI to get it Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, SoulGame Studio certainly have my attention for their effort on getting Minishoot' Adventures up to Steam Deck Verified. Plus, the game looks really entertaining.</p>
<p>Released back in April 2024, it's a twin-stick bullet hell metroidvania with the adventurous spirit of the first Legend of Zelda. It's gone onto receiving an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from users on Steam so it seems like it's done quite well overall.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iVt4FBVdBJo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8b6bcd3e991d3d1b84716409a33645c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iVt4FBVdBJo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After taking a break from the launch, recently the developers released an update to get it Steam Deck Verified that includes these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We rebuilt all UI components that were poorly readable on SteamDeck. Which makes UI more user friendly and accessible for Steam Deck and PC as well.</li>
<li>We did a final pass on optimization to remove nasty lag spikes and FPS drops. Gameplay on PC is more fluid than ever in epic fights which is especially crucial on SteamDeck.</li>
<li>We changed the Steam API to make sure Achievements would work for MacOs user as well. Sorry about that, you should be able to redeem your Achievements if you have a save file around (if not you can find one in the forums about lost save).</li>
</ul>
Smaller changes :
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where unique keys were carried over to new games</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused lag and freeze after reloading the game several times. (Many thanks to xcvdgb and Zookster on discord)</li>
<li>Added the lowest difficulty chosen on the Save slot so you know which Achievement you are eligible to</li>
<li>Made it easier to skip intro (just press Enter or Escape, or Start on gamepad)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More about it in the developers own words: “We designed a map that would be enticing to discover, similar to a Metroidvania, with lots of connections, shortcuts, secrets, and skills that when unlocked, allow to unfold more paths to explore. All the while facing challenging bullet hell style combat with clean and polished visuals. The ability to drive around the world using a mini spaceship as a living character, allows for fluid navigation overall, making the exploration and backtracking a pleasure instead of a chore.

      <title>Battle Train could end up being my next favourite deck-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's just something satisfying about laying down tracks, and then slamming a train into your enemy. Battle Train is an interesting spin on deck-builders and there's a demo out now. Tested on Kubuntu Linux with Proton 9.0-2, it worked to perfection.</p>
<p>Here the game is set out like a game-show. You're given a deck a cards that includes train tracks, bombs and all sorts and you just have to get your track built up to the opponents outposts on the board. Then the trains can smash into the outposts destroying them and you win. Easier said than done, with all the different cards you get as you can imagine there's plenty of strategy involved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zOACIXgZPp8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/954da3bea08688c1cec9952d3bc46643.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zOACIXgZPp8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duel a wide range of foes, each with their own unique cards and abilities.</li>
<li>Customize your train with your favorite power ups.</li>
<li>Build your deck with an array of cards--both functional and fantastical--to obliterate your opponent.</li>
<li>Win riches and prizes through a myriad of special events.</li>
<li>Experience a hilarious story told by the makers of "3 out of 10", Tower of Guns, and Mothergunship.</li>
</ul>
<p>Really fun demo to try and, and really easy to understand and get into. Definitely worth a go.</p>

      <title>Avoid a giant creepy boat stalking you in your kayak in this retro-horror game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those readers who love the recent wave of retro-horror, Delta Kayak could be another good one to check out with a demo now live. Certainly wins points for some originality and total weirdness here.</p>
<p>A mixture of horror and exploration wrapped up in a retro style. Here you were attacked by a strange being, and your pet vanishes without a trace. Your search ends up leading you to discover the twisted origin of the creature and its creator. You must rescue your pet, Pepa, and return home safe and sound.</p>
<p>The game takes place in a real place, the delta of the Paraná River, Argentina. A labyrinth of rivers and streams with lush vegetation and a culture of community with nature.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a3HxIA0HT4k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/33ae436807ec5962a9321fe0aac9087a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a3HxIA0HT4k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo, lasting between 10 and 15 minutes, shows the beginning of the game, when the character goes out at night in his kayak to run an errand and encounters a half-boat, half-animal creature that constantly stalks him.</p>
<p>Created by Eibriel, who worked in film and television before venturing into video games and uses mainly free and open source tools, such as Godot and Blender. It has Native Linux support and the developer said it will also work on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2632680/Delta_Kayak/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a> and try the demo. The developer plans to launch it before the end of 2024.</p>

      <title>Get a better look at S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl in the Developer Deep Dive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A proper Developer Deep Dive is now available for the delayed S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl and it's looking and sounding really promising.</p>
<p>GSC Game World might actually finally pull me into their world with this one, after I completely bounced off their older games in the series. The release is only a few months away (November 20th) so hopefully the extra time is going to be worth it.</p>
<p>What do we get from this Deep Dive? There's various interviews and behind-the-scenes of the development process, quite a bit of new footage that including the world overview, various locations, gameplay and cut-scenes and there's even a full video walkthrough of one of the story quests.<br/>
<br/>
“We know you might be tired of waiting, and we truly appreciate your patience. These two additional months will give us the chance to fix more “unexpected anomalies” (or simply “bugs”, as you call them). We are always grateful for your ongoing support and understanding - it means the world to us. We’re just as eager as you are to finally release the game and for you to experience it for yourself.” said Yevhen Grygorovych, Game Director at GSC Game World.</p>

      <title>The NoVR mod for Half-Life: Alyx has a big Summer 2024 update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the rumours swirling around a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/valve-working-on-a-new-game-that-could-be-half-life-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Half-Life game coming</a>, this is an excellent time to play the updated NoVR mod for Half-Life: Alyx if you don't own a VR kit. And there's a big Summer 2024 update out now.</p>
<p>Since Half-Life: Alyx was designed for VR, it's still a little odd to try without it, but it's such an important game it deserves to have life outside of VR too.</p>
<p>With this update all the "toner puzzles" are now complete and solvable from start to finish. All Steam Achievements are now obtainable too and there's been a big upgrade to the movement system too so that it should feel smoother and weapons feel better while moving. Plus some other updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map Edits</strong> - players will no longer get caught on objects on the ground like train tracks etc and have proper smooth locomotion through the levels</li>
<li><strong>Viewmodel Changes</strong> - there have been changes to how weapons sway, bob and overall move as you walk and run</li>
<li><strong>Boundary Edits</strong> - players can no longer break level logic and proper edits have been made so players cannot break the map boundaries and other similar issues that could have arised before</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out their update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0f7y7gmUDZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1322d3239c5b1298595f1cdc8f0fdd49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0f7y7gmUDZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More updates are planned for 2024 including support for more mods, new animations, further movement improvements and so on. Perhaps most importantly, they will be getting the Orb Puzzle implementation done too at some point. In case you weren't aware: you can complete the game from start to finish with this mod.</p>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr/news/quakecon-update-summer-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mod DB post</a>. Half-Life: Alyx is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and 66% off until August 19th.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Work on this graphics overhaul has been going on for over a year, with the developer pulling in two new artists to make it happen. Another great thing about this update being live now, is that the "artists are no longer playing catch-up with the content updates" so we can expect to see much quicker updates and larger updates in future once again.</p>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Wibgxke29YY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c4699b6237e3be67758f9edb3deb00e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Wibgxke29YY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>“Remaking 3298 assets has been a great challenge, and the team is super happy with the result. I think anyone who has an affinity for games like Stardew Valley will absolutely adore the new art style of Necesse.” - Bo Michelsen - Artist on Necesse</p>
<p>“From a solo hobby project, to a studio of 8 and now over 1 million people playing my game. It’s been an incredible journey.” - Mads Skovgaard - Creator of Necesse</p>

      <title>Sand in a Box is a fresh modern &#39;falling sand&#39; playground out now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Patryk Zieliński of Tiliasoft just released Sand in a Box in Early Access on Steam, a fresh and new falling sand game with a lot of toys to play with.</p>
<p>Sand in a Box is a falling sand simulator with advanced simulation algorithms designed for modern CPUs. Players can experiment with materials like sand, water, metals, lava, and acid, featuring cellular automata physics, thermal imaging, electrical conductivity, and radioactivity. The game supports modding, allowing the creation of new sets of elements and changes to the rules of the simulation. It fully supports Steam Deck (controller and touchscreen) and desktop Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Looks like a whole lot of fun, check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nDTcTKS66pA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b3e443ba105ac71bfde21e7a224df9df.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nDTcTKS66pA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking to the developer over email they mentioned how it originally started life as an iOS game on the App Store, but it's been gradually improved over the years with many new features.</p>
<p>Asking them how it differs to games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/classic-free-physics-sandbox-game-the-powder-toy-is-now-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Powder Toy</a>, which also had a Steam release recently, they said "Overall I'm just trying to develop unique features and I don't look at the other 'falling sand' games. I'm not aiming to make a better game than "The Powder Toy", just different enough that people would like to play both of them." and highlighted how it has been "designed for Steam Deck from the start".</p>
<p>Speaking about Early Access they said: "Currently Sand in a Box launches in Early Access and I plan to actively develop it over at least few months listening to community feedback. One of the features I would like to add in a near future is multi-track video editor. That allows to record user input over multiple tracks while processing 'falling sand' simulation.</p>
<p>However the main reason of going Early Access route is community feedback. I personally like to work on cellular automata simulations and there are people who can play with them for hours.<br/>
My ultimate goal is to deliver really good experience for those people, solving multiple programming challenges along the way :)".</p>
<p>One thing to note, is that the developer does use some AI. As noted on the store page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Gameplay trailer on storepage uses song made with the help of suno.ai<br/>
Some backgrounds in the game are made with the help of various generative AI tools like Adobe Firefly.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's available with Native <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2225680/Sand_in_a_Box/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>I tried the demo of Super reaKtor and it really fried my brain</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super reaKtor is a unique bullet hell where you absorb various orbs using your laser beam, and while the idea is great it really did annihilate my brain.</p>
<p>The developer, SuperSAZ Studio, just put up a demo on Steam (with Linux support) and this has to be one of the most interesting versions of a bullet hell I've seen for some time. I gave it a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/07/super-reaktor-is-the-most-insane-looking-bullet-hell-ive-seen-in-a-good-while/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brief highlight a month ago</a>, curious with how it would actually feel and now I've had the chance to play, I love it — but wow is it surprisingly difficult to get to grips with.</p>
<p>Here you're not only trying to avoid various things flying around a small map, but you're also trying to absorb all the green orbs flying around, using what can only be described as a laser-infused pong paddle. This laser can be spun around in a 360 degree motion, and you can move it all the way around the map while making it bigger and smaller. It's pretty simple mechanically, but the speed of it plus needing to avoid <em>and</em> collect things makes it really quite a challenge to your brain and fingers to not get destroyed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NELE8h4_Hpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a24cec1f7f6078378c2a507db05635b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NELE8h4_Hpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really clever idea and certainly worth a go. If you love some good tunes and fast retro bullet-hell action, you're probably going to really enjoy it. For arcade high-score chasers, it's a dream.</p>

      <title>Anodyne 2: Return to Dust from Analgesic Productions source code opened up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Analgesic Productions have opened up the full source code for their 2D-3D action-adventure game Anodyne 2: Return to Dust.</p>
<p>This is a <em>Source Available</em> release, not to be confused with true <em>Open Source</em>, since it's using a custom license with certain restrictions. However, it does effectively make the entire game free (if you build it yourself), since it also includes all the assets. This is the same thing the developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/04/analgesic-productions-have-opened-up-the-source-for-their-zelda-lite-anodyne/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did with the first Anodyne game</a> and with <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/even-the-ocean-from-analgesic-productions-has-a-source-code-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Even the Ocean</a> as well.</p>
<p>More about it: "In this hybrid 2D-3D action-adventure game, run, jump, and drive across vast, dreamy 3D landscapes. Shrink into surreal, 2D dungeons inside of characters' bodies. Travel the world, meet strange people, and save the world from the dangerous Nano Dust. Don't miss the follow-up to the classic game 'Anodyne'!"</p>
<p>You can see their video on the source release below and check out their <a href="https://melodicambient.substack.com/p/anodyne-2-goes-open-source" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>

<p>Another great way for game developers to learn from a full and complete game. It's great to see!</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/analgesicproductions/Anodyne-2-Open-Source" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code on GitHub</a>. It also uses Unity, so you'll need that to work with it.</p>

      <title>Minetest 5.9.0 brings performance improvements, a godrays shader and work towards SDL2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest release of Minetest with version 5.9.0 is out now, bringing new features and work towards using SDL2 for this free and open source voxel game engine.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main <a href="https://dev.minetest.net/Changelog#5.8.0_.E2.86.92_5.9.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">highlights</a> of this release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Rendering performance improvements (<em>paradust7</em>, <em>sfan5</em> &amp; <em>x2048</em>).</li>
<li>Added godrays shader (<em>x2048</em>).</li>
<li>New multithreaded Lua mapgen API to improve performance of custom mapgens. (<em>sfan5</em>).</li>
<li>Android: Punch with short tap (<em>grorp</em>).</li>
<li>Work in the background on switching to SDL2 for windowing and input (but not enabled in this release).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While the SDL2 switch is not yet finished, it's going to be a real nice change for Minetest and all the games using it. Since this will give better support for windowing and input. So you'll get proper touch-screen, gamepads and much more like easy full-screen switching too.</p>

      <title>Tango Gameworks (Hi-Fi RUSH) lives again with KRAFTON</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At last, the good kind of industry news, and something worth celebrating. KRAFTON, the publisher of games like PUBG has acquired Tango Gameworks along with the Hi-Fi RUSH IP. Tango Gameworks developed The Evil Within 1 &amp; 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, Hero Dice and Hi-Fi Rush.</p>
<p>The developer will no longer be shut down thanks to this! As confirmed in a <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-strengthens-global-presence-through-strategic-integration-of-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, KRAFTON will be working with Xbox and ZeniMax "to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the Hi-Fi RUSH IP and explore future projects" which sounds great. They also said there will be "no impact on the existing game catalog of The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and the original Hi-Fi RUSH game".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11808532131723462657gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Considering how popular Hi-Fi RUSH is with some excellent reviews (it really is great), this is just wonderful to see.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 46-2 brings full ASUS ROG Ally X support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another update for the handheld and couch gaming Linux distribution ChimeraOS, with version 46-2 out now bringing full ROG Ally X support. Easily one of the best choices to get Linux on your handheld!</p>
<p>This release comes with Linux kernel v6.9.12, Mesa graphics drivers v24.1.5, Gamescope Plus v3.14.24, OpenGamepadUI v0.33.3-1 and InputPlumber v0.34.4-1. Really though the headline feature is full support for the ASUS ROG Ally X, and various improvements around input for multiple different devices!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20041169191723461532gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Here's the full list of <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Release-Notes#chimeraos-46-2-2024-08-10" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added full support for the ROG Ally X.</li>
<li>Improved power saving while suspended for the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X.</li>
<li>Experimental support for emulating the Steam Deck controller has been added to InputPlumber and OpenGamepadUI. There is a known issue that suspending the system while using the emulated Steam Deck controller will cause the system to freeze. Users are encouraged to try this mode and report any additional bugs they find so it can be further improved. You can switch to the new mode using the OpenGampadUI gamepad settings in the Quick Bar.</li>
<li>Touch-pads on the Lenovo Legion Go, OrangePi Neo, and the Steam Deck will now automatically map to a touch-pad device on the selected target device when using the steam-plus or full OpenGamepadUI sessions. Emulated Xbox target devices will spawn a virtual touch-pad and the emulated DS5 and Steam Deck controllers will use their native touch-pads.</li>
<li>Added support for some Xbox Series controllers in Bluetooth mode to InputPlumber. Additional Xbox Bluetooth controllers are planned for the next release.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug in InputPlumber returning from suspend where the back paddles on the ROG Ally and ROG Ally X would no longer function.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug in InputPlumber that could, in some rare cases, cause controls to become unresponsive after a rumble event.</li>
<li>Resolved a bug that caused new installations to fail on devices with the MT7922 WiFi card, such as the Lenovo Legion Go and ROG Ally devices.</li>
<li>Added kernel patch to fix HDMI audio on AMD</li>
<li>Added AyaNeo 2S screen rotation quirk to the kernel.</li>
<li>Mesa fixes from 24.1 series</li>
</ul>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.15 has expanded GOG support, EA games from Epic Store support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big release for the Heroic Games Launcher team has landed, version 2.15.0 is out now with some necessary bug fixes and some big new features to help you get all your games on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Four months on from the last release, this has been in the makings for a while!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3652159831723460711gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3652159831723460711gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for EA games from Epic Games Store</li>
<li>Fixed issues with downloading from Amazon Games</li>
<li>Added (legacy) DRM support for Amazon Games - Devil May Cry 1 is now playable</li>
<li>Discord rich presence overhaul</li>
<li>[Linux] Experimental <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher" rel="noopener" target="_blank">umu-launcher</a> support (disabled by default until 1.x release)</li>
<li>[Linux] Experimental <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/comet" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comet</a> support - enabling GOG achievements and multiplayer</li>
<li>[Linux] It is now possible to install and uninstall DLC for Native Linux games.</li>
<li>[macOS] GPTK (Gaming Port Toolkit) is now available to download from Wine Manager (Works better with Apple Silicon and with macOS Sonoma or higher).</li>
<li>Several other improvements and fixes all around Heroic</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again doing what companies don't, the GOG improvement with Comet is a big one, especially for Linux since it brings us closer to the features available via GOG Galaxy. Once umu is properly ready, that will be another great one so we can get the best possible compatibility when running games via Proton in Heroic so I'm looking forward to seeing that progress.</p>
<p>A quick follow-up release v.2.15.1 was also made to solve some issues:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[FIX] Sideloads with proton without umu by <a href="https://github.com/Etaash-mathamsetty" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@Etaash-mathamsetty</a> in <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/3936" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#3936</a></li>
<li>[Fix] Make <code class="inline-code">GamesDBDataInner</code>'s <code class="inline-code">square_icon</code> optional by <a href="https://github.com/CommandMC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@CommandMC</a> in <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/3933" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#3933</a></li>

      <title>The Elder Scrolls: Arena re-implementation OpenTESArena gets a graphics code overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like this project is coming along nicely, and I do very much love seeing classics get revived with open source game engine re-implementations. OpenTESArena for The Elder Scrolls: Arena has a new release out.</p>
<p>It's still considered "pre-alpha" with proper gameplay to come later, but worth keeping an eye on, because projects like this can end up doing some amazing things (just look at OpenMW for Morrowind!). This is the first release since 2021!</p>
<p>Speaking about the OpenTESArena 0.15.0 release the developer said: "This release overhauls the graphics code to more closely match the look of the original game. The renderer now also uses meshes, shaders, and draw calls normally found in an OpenGL or Vulkan engine.</p>
<p>Overall FPS is below average due to draw calls not being batched yet and the rasterizer being relatively unoptimized (it was very challenging to reliably coax all compilers to output good assembly, so there is still room for improvement). One optimization of interest however is the addition of a voxel quadtree for efficiently testing visibility to the camera."</p>
<p>Check out their showcase video:</p>

      <title>Try the demo for The Protagonish, an adventure game where you don&#39;t control the adventurer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is a bit more on the unique side isn't it? I know we have plenty of classic adventure game fans in the GOL readership, but what about one where you don't actual control the adventurer? Check out The Protagonish.</p>
<p>It has all the usual marks of a classic point and click adventure game, but you're not the main character. Instead, you jump between the villagers, and choose to guide or distract the adventurer from their quest, with puzzles, comedy dialogue choices, and mysteries to uncover. Absolutely love the idea!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MFu972ETz9k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e96b854de5311227f7d71549078691d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MFu972ETz9k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With full voice acting and plenty of colourful characters, backed up by some lovely hand-drawn animations, this is one you should check out.</p>
<p>More: "Explore the beautifully hand-drawn village, and discover the lives and plans of four varied characters in this short game with multiple endings. Through your dialogue choices, be a shopkeeper out for the best deal, a monk who's taken a vow of silence, or a miner who's had a bump on the head and not quite saying what he means. And finally there is the mysterious beastie..."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2994780/The_Protagonish/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">try the demo on Steam</a> right now. It will be available with Native Linux support at release.</p>

      <title>Preserve is a wonderfully chilled and beautiful relaxing nature-building game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love tile-based chilled puzzle games like Dorfromantik, you'll probably really love Preserve. This one is all about repopulating a wasteland to create a vibrant and flourishing ecosystem. <em>Note: key via the developer.</em></p>
<p>Just released into Early Access, it's available now with Native Linux support and from my testing it really does work great. One of the most chilled and relaxing games I've played recently, with a peaceful atmosphere that allows you to almost zone-out with it and as you're placing down all types of tiles to bring the world to life. It doesn't get much calmer than this while playing games.</p>
<p>Very similar in style to the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/relaxing-and-gorgeous-city-builder-dorfromantik-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dorfromantik</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/tiny-atolls-is-a-comfy-and-relaxing-minimalist-city-builder/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tiny Atolls</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/colourful-city-builder-islanders-has-officially-released-for-linux-and-its-really-lovely/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ISLANDERS</a> where you start with nothing and gradually build up a score of points based on what tiles you put down, and building up a combination score from having multiple of the same together. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gWKFzR1oO5U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ecc3dc533df7046f541c5ee74cb0a77.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gWKFzR1oO5U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I especially love the way you expand the world. Instead of you revealing more as you go, you build up points to purchase a new land expansion, which you place around the existing land in a place and position of your choosing, allowing you to really get it how you want it. </p>
<p>That, and the vertical system. Here it's not just placing down tiles, you're gradually building upwards as well with tiles on top of tiles. Eventually, you end up with a ridiculously vibrant world full of different colours and habitats for flora and fauna.</p>
<p>While it is a puzzle game, it's much more on the chilled side, the points system is reasonably easy to keep going with it, so you don't particularly need to worry about it much at all. Although, if you're aiming for a real high score, it will stop and make you think on your tile placements a lot more. So it has a nice balance of ease and challenge overall.</p>
<p>In Early Access the developers plan to continue building it up over the next year to include more biomes (there's three currently) with unique ecosystems, flora, fauna and so on. They also want to add in more puzzles and challenges to deepen the gameplay overall which sounds great. They have a truly wonderful start here, I can't wait to see more from it.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the InfinityFlex a fully foldable Linux laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TUXEDO are flexing their hardware chops here with the InfinityFlex, a fully foldable Linux laptop so you can use it wherever and however you want. <em>No that's not drool on my top, honest.</em></p>
<p>With the ability to fold the screen right down on top of the unit, you can use it as a standard laptop or more like a tablet. Since it has a pressure-sensitive touch display, pairing it up with a pen you can use it for all sorts of artwork projects too. Pretty light as well at only 1.5KG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12097365151723202057gol1.png"/></p>
<p>TUXEDO put some fun work into this one by the sounds of it. They said "soon as the device is used in monitor or tablet mode, the keyboard and touchpad are automatically deactivated to prevent incorrect entries, the screen content is rotated according to the chassis orientation and TUXEDO OS also adapts its UI to touch operation".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>14-inch IPS Touch Display, 1920 x 1200, sRGB color gamut: 100 %, Brightness: 400 nits.</li>
<li>Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211, Bluetooth 5.3.</li>
<li>55 Wh battery.</li>
<li>Intel Core i5-1335U, Intel Iris Xe Graphics.</li>
<li>DDR4-3200 MHz SO-DIMM, 16GB on the base model.</li>
<li>500 GB Samsung 980 (NVMe PCIe 3.0).</li>
</ul>
<p>Looks and sounds like a real nice machine.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityFlex-14-Gen1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TUXEDO store</a>. Available for pre-order with shipping after September 16th.

      <title>Decky Loader plugins should no longer cause bootloops on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Decky Loader developers have announced that their plugin system for Steam Deck should no longer cause bootloops with the latest pre-release build.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">News I covered just recently</a>, users discovered a number of plugins that would cause the Steam Deck to get stuck where the Big Picture Mode just wouldn't appear. Thankfully you could fix it with some manual effort, but that should no longer be needed.</p>
<p>As of "<a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/releases/tag/v3.0.0-pre8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Prerelease v3.0.0-pre8</a>", the developers noted it fixes a "race condition causing crash loops". Additionally, posting in their Discord server, developer "Train" <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960281551428522045/960459928538087424/1271209426803626015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're also taking steps to ensure future issues do not cause breakage to this degree and to notify users of when plugins are delisted or issues with Decky Loader are discovered by us or made known to us by users. Thanks everyone for being patient and contributing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also mentioned in a GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/comment_id=267073" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>[…]</small> To those wondering, we're currently working on an MOTD feature to allow us to better notify users of issues with plugins and we're working on delisting broken plugins.<br/>
As of the most recent pre-release of Decky, v3.0.0-pre7, we now have a screen and logic that catches these loops and stops decky and should allow you to find and remove any of the effected plugins. We also have future plans to ensure plugins are easier to report as broken but we don't have anything concrete in that regard yet. Have a lovely week everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the developer who fixed the issue "AAGaming" also mentioned in a GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/certain-steam-deck-plugins-via-decky-loader-are-causing-bootloops/comment_id=267110" rel="noopener" target="_blank">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've fixed this in the latest prerelease (v3.0.0-pre8), broken plugins shouldn't be able to cause bootloops anymore. It was caused by an extremely hard to find race condition in a new feature of @decky/ui (previously decky-frontend-lib)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So thankfully, you should be pretty safe to use the latest pre-release version again with various plugins on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Decky Loader team certainly have their work cut out for them, given that all of this is community-made with no direct support for plugins from Valve. Hopefully in future Valve might consider some sort of API to help make their job easier.</p>

      <title>Blackjack roguelike adventure Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to break Blackjack? Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers has you battle your way through a seedy tavern filled with gambling addicted townspeople in this Blackjack roguelike adventure.</p>
<p>More about it: Begin your adventure in a tavern that is home to a unique, corrupted version of blackjack you have never played before. You will need to pick up the rules and adapt to them as you progress through the tavern, challenging a colourful cast of blackjack-addicted townspeople. Discover the mystery of who runs this twisted casino as you progress through the tavern to take them down.</p>
<p>Complete with over 300 cards, you won’t just be drawing from a traditional deck to take down greedy opponents. Teeming with a wacky assortment of cards ranging from birthday cards to tarot cards, there’s plenty of unique combinations you can use to outwit their fiendish foes and emerge victorious in this stakes roguelike.</p>

<p>Their PR team didn't reply to my code request on this one, so I've not personally had a proper chance to play with it yet. Looks great though, probably a good one for fans of Balatro.</p>

      <title>DOOM + DOOM II get bundled together with new enhanced versions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today id Software and Bethesda Softworks announced a new bundling of the original DOOM + DOOM II, with a whole bunch of enhancements using Nightdive Studio's KEX engine. A free update for existing owners too.</p>
<p>While we have various source port projects like the fantastic GZDoom, the newer KEX engine versions will at least make them play a lot nicer on modern systems completely out of the box. There's definitely something to be said for convenience.</p>
<p>Plus you get all these extras now too (from the Steam page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Online, cross-platform deathmatch and co-op for up to 16 players.</li>
<li>Community-published mod support with an in-game mod browser.</li>
<li>Choose between the original midi DOOM and DOOM II soundtracks or the modern IDKFA versions by Andrew Hulshult (including brand-new DOOM II recordings).</li>
<li>Improved performance with multithreaded rendering supporting up to 4K resolution.</li>
<li>Now on the KEX engine.</li>
<li>BOOM source compatibility makes it possible for hundreds of community-created mods from the past 25 years to be published in-game.</li>
<li>Accessibility options, such as a modern font to improve legibility, high contrast mode, text-to-speech, speech-to-text multiplayer chat and more.</li>
<li>Translated into 8 new languages: Mexican Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Existing Enhancements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded visuals.</li>
<li>Modern controller support.</li>
<li>Weapon carousel for faster weapon switching.</li>
<li>Improved mouse and keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Local split-screen deathmatch and co-op for up to 4 players.</li>
<li>Featured community mods²'³, including REKKR, Revolution!, Syringe, Double Impact, Arrival, and more! Expect an ever-expanding list of single player mods to be added by the community modders.</li>
<li>60 FPS and native 16:9 support – up to 1080p.</li>
<li>Restored original in-game music using original hardware.</li>
<li>Quick Save/Load support.</li>
<li>DeHacked mod support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-4-xswoPRpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ca62ee6064c61cfc96471bcbdbe9dc21.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-4-xswoPRpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that, a brand new episode was also released named Legacy of Rust. This was made in collaboration by id Software, Nightdive Studios, and MachineGames. Legacy of Rust is the newest episode for DOOM, and the first official episode since DOOM II to feature new demons and weapons. This 16-map Episode is broken up into two 8 map sections: The Vulcan Abyss and Counterfeit Eden.</p>
<p>The online features do need a Bethesda account, just to be clear. Plus, the original DOS versions of DOOM (1993) and DOOM II are still included so it's not like they've just been wiped away, which is good to see for proper preservation. So no need to complain about the classics not needing to be touched, they're still there.</p>

      <title>Sober is a new way to play Roblox on Linux from the Vinegar team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Roblox does still remain blocked on Linux with Wine, as usual the community finds a way. The Vinegar team recently revealed Sober, a currently closed-source specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox.</p>
<p>So if you're really desperate to get Roblox on Linux, Sober seems like the main way right now. Since it uses the Android version, you do need to <em>manually</em> download a Roblox APK which can be done from various mirror websites like <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/roblox-corporation/roblox/roblox-2-636-626-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apkmirror</a>. There's lots of these sites where you can grab an APK, do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>The Vinegar team explain: "Sober crafts a specialized runtime for the Android version of Roblox. Effectively, it bridges the small gap between Android and Linux, allowing for a native unofficial port."</p>
<p>As you can see from my shot below, it works:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1118126851723133013gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1118126851723133013gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently it's available to download as Flatpak, but not from Flathub as they're hosting it themselves.</p>
<p>Like before when playing Roblox in Wine though, it's possible (and probable) it will be blocked eventually. Although, it may end up being a little more difficult with something like this. </p>

      <title>System76 desktop environment COSMIC alpha now available to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have today released the first alpha preview for you to try out COSMIC, their brand new home-grown desktop environment. Built with Rust, it should hopefully feel pretty familiar to most Linux users with a visual style that matches up to their current GNOME-based desktop.</p>
<p>While they're building it for their own Pop!_OS, with a alpha iso for Pop, it's designed to be cross-distro and they even have ways for you to test it out directly on a few other distributions already.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21289625901723132053gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21289625901723132053gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - COSMIC Alpha 1 using automatic tiling for opened windows</em></p>
<p>Their vision for COSMIC: "COSMIC began as our answer to user feedback we’ve received on improving Pop!_OS. The new desktop environment introduces a custom theming system, streamlined Auto-tiling, new core applications including an app store, and provides you more control over your workflow. Written in the Rust programming language, COSMIC is more stable, more secure, and better optimized for performance."</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is the first alpha build, there will likely be many bugs and unfinished features. Going by the press details they sent this is what's currently complete:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Settings pages + applets for daily use for most users
<ul>
<li>Applets provide many settings needs
<ul>
<li>Connecting to bluetooth and wireless networks. Choosing audio input and output devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Highlight COSMIC’s unique features
<ul>
<li>Panel and Dock Customization</li>
<li>Appearance and Themes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OS Interfaces
<ul>
<li>Panels, Launcher, App Library, Greeter, Dialogs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Apps
<ul>
<li>Settings, Files, Text Editor, Store, Terminal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compositor features
<ul>
<li>Auto-Tiling, Snapping (Manual-Tiling), Stacking, and Sticky Windows</li>
<li>Excellent nvidia hybrid graphics support</li>
<li>Fractional scaling</li>
<li>Wayland native with XWayland support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is what's still to be done:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Numerous Settings pages</li>
<li>Frosted effect for OS interfaces</li>
<li>Variable refresh rate</li>
<li>Accessibility</li>
<li>Initial Setup
<ul>
<li>Need to set time manually</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Workspaces features, animations, and refinement</li>
<li>Lots of COSMIC Files work</li>
<li>Bug fixes and refinement</li>
<li>Compositor software rendering
<ul>
<li><strong>Testing in VMs requires hardware acceleration</strong></li>
<li>GNOME Boxes uses software acceleration but it’s pretty smooth</li>
<li>VirtualBox requires enabling VT-x/AMD-V and Enable Nested Paging</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://system76.com/cosmic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the official website</a>.</p>
<p>A promising start to what could be a really interesting Linux desktop environment, although as expected it is on the rough side being in alpha right now you can clearly see where they're going with it. I can imagine this becoming <em>really</em> popular.</p>
<p>When you've tried it be sure to let me know your thoughts in the comments.</p>

      <title>Steel &amp; Blood is a huge upgrade for horde battler Rogue: Genesia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue: Genesia is easily one of the best survivor-like horde games, and it just got even better with the huge Steel &amp; Blood update.</p>
<p>More about it: Walk upon a new world and slay foes endangering it. Rogue : Genesia is an action rogue-lite game, where you fight relentless hordes consisting of hundreds and thousands of monsters, make your build, break the balance, defeat bosses and save one of the many worlds.</p>
<p>The new Steel &amp; Blood update has added in a highly customizable equipment system. Once you've played it for a bit you'll unlock access to it, allowing you to equip various different items much like a traditional RPG. All items you find have their own level and tier, allowing you to keep upgrading and swapping. Items have various modifiers, and you can recycle items to learn them, to allow you to then craft the modifier onto another item. Sounds like a lot of fun for mixing up your runs. There's a lot more like a new world, a new avatar to play as, a new zone variant, various performance improvements and the list goes on and on.</p>

      <title>Balatro hits 2 million sales and a major free gameplay update is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most popular recent releases on Steam that's Steam Deck Verified (and works great on desktop Linux), Balatro has done really well.</p>
<p>More about it: The poker roguelike. Balatro is a hypnotically satisfying deckbuilder where you play illegal poker hands, discover game-changing jokers, and trigger adrenaline-pumping, outrageous combos.</p>
<p>Especially great, considering it's from a solo developer, to hit 2 million sales in a few months is absolutely amazing. Well deserved too, it is a wonderful game. The developer seems really nice too, <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioning</a> recently on X (Twitter) that they've ensured it can't be turned into an actual gambling game:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21224054611723109103gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the outside this might make 0 sense but I hate the thought of Balatro becoming a true gambling game so much that when I recently created my will I stipulated that the Balatro IP may never be sold or licensed to any gambling company/Casino</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for what's to come next? Teased in a post on Steam is the next major update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6204970791723109215gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The first major announcement in this campaign is that there will be a major gameplay update coming to Balatro in 2025. This update will bring new ideas and strategies to the game and will be released across all platforms. And as a token of huge appreciation to the game’s brilliant and passionate community, the update will be completely free.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roots of Pacha from Soda Den has a fresh free update out now in version 1.2, and they're not slowing down with more big free updates planned.</p>
<p>More about it: Be a part of a thriving stone age community. Discover "ideas", domesticate crops, befriend animals, and contribute to the growth of your village. Play with friends in co-op or explore the early days of civilization in single-player.</p>
<p>The 1.2 update brings a huge upgrade to how children work in the game with them now going to school, they will hang out together, develop personalities, discover what future professions they wish to do and more. Children's different combinations of parents, personality quirks, and prospective professions help unearth earnable gifts and distinct dialog.</p>
<p>You also get new skin tones and hair colours to establish more unique villager identities. Invent unknown technologies from new Ideas to provide time-saving tools like the olla watering pot. Tame mammoths, spiders, cave lions, wolves, and more as new mount options — play fetch with them and obtain valuable resources like herbs and meat.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, what's next? Soda Den are promising a "massive update underway with two new regions, fishing in canoes/rafts, camping, ball sport, iron, volcano caves, and more" which sounds really exciting. Although it's not due until next year.</p>
<p>Roots of Pacha has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/roots-of-pacha?partner=gamingonlinux" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245560/Roots_of_Pacha/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.9 Beta for Steam Deck curiously mentions the ASUS ROG Ally</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a pretty important set of bug fixes for the Steam Deck with the new SteamOS 3.6.9 Beta, plus an interesting mention of the ASUS ROG Ally that could point to things to come.</p>
<p>Their release notes mention how they "Added support for extra ROG Ally keys", which could potentially (finally!) point towards a SteamOS release for more devices. However, to temper some expectations here, it's probably more likely it's just Steam Input changes rolled into the SteamOS Beta update before they arrive in the main Steam Client Beta for all platforms (which hasn't seen an update yet). Still, nice to have hope right? Worth also pointing out that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/better-asus-rog-ally-x-support-on-linux-is-coming-with-a-big-kernel-patch/" target="_blank">Better ASUS ROG Ally X support on Linux is coming with a big kernel patch</a>.</p>
<p>Here's all that's from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4361258795952118017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for the update named "Megafixer" (I wonder why they picked that code-name from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/the-jackbox-megapicker-fixed-to-stop-megabreaking-your-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">huh</a>?):</p>
