      <title>System76 teasing new fully AMD powered Pangolin Linux laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 saw your many comments and they're going to deliver. The Pangolin is making a return, powered by all AMD.</p>
<p>Every time they announce something, there's plenty of comments here and across the web asking them for more AMD units and so the Pangolin will deliver with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800U processor and AMD Radeon 680M graphics too. If that's not enough to make you drool it also has a 144Hz display, with compatibility for DDR5 RAM and PCIe 4.0 NVMe storage. They also bumped up the battery to 70Wh with a claim of "up to" 10 hours battery life, but possibly longer.</p>
<p><em>All sounds pretty good!</em></p>

<p>Over email they also mentioned they heard your privacy calls, so it will also have a physical hardware privacy switch to fully disable both the webcam and microphone.</p>
<p>Tech specs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Operating System: Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.</li>

      <title>Google to release a tool to enable Bluetooth on the Stadia Controller</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google is getting ready to shut down Stadia now, their cloud gaming service, but they have some good news for those with the Stadia Controller.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-General/A-Gift-from-the-Stadia-Team-amp-Bluetooth-Controller/m-p/85936/highlight/true#M34875" target="_blank">a post</a> on the Stadia forum, they weirdly put up a new game today called <a href="https://stadia.google.com/game/worm-game" target="_blank">Worm Game</a>. Which it seems you'll be able to play for a few days until Stadia shuts down on January 18. Why the new game? Well, it's what they used to test things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Play the game that came to Stadia before Stadia came to the world. “Worm Game” is a humble title we used to test many of Stadia’s features, starting well before our 2019 public launch, right through 2022. It won’t win Game of the Year, but the Stadia team spent a LOT of time playing it, and we thought we’d share it with you. Thanks for playing, and for everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, more importantly, the Stadia Controller will have the Bluetooth turned on so the controller now won't be useless without a USB wired in. They said "In addition, many of you have expressed the desire to enable Bluetooth on the Stadia controller. We have some good news: next week we'll be releasing a self-serve tool to enable Bluetooth connections on your Stadia Controller. We'll share details next week on how to enable this feature."</p>
<p>I can imagine this tool will be Windows-only but then perhaps it might even work in Wine.</p>
<p>Still a shame that Stadia is vanishing but Google failed it miserably from being incredibly slow to add simple store features (reminds me of Epic Games…), to the ridiculous business model. Back in November 2021, I even wrote an article titled "<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/two-years-on-stadia-seems-to-have-no-direction-left/" target="_blank">Two years on, Stadia seems to have no direction left</a>" and ~10 months later they announced the shut down.</p>
<p><em>At least they refunded everyone though. I have to give credit where it's due for that.</em></p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic sold 2.3 million copies last year and I&#39;m not surprised - it&#39;s awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic is a game about a bunch of Dwarves going mining, and there's lots of creepy-crawlies that want to get in the way. It seems to only be getting more popular as time goes on too.</p>
<p>Playable basically to perfection on Linux with Proton, and works really well on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/548430/view/3640630403132894028" target="_blank">2022 review post</a> on Steam, they mentioned they've now hit over 5.5 million copies sold and 2.3 million of those were actually last year. For a game that launched in 2020, with early access before that — it's mighty impressive actually. Over 500,000 people have put more than 100 hours into the game too (me being one of them), with 113,700 daily active players, they're doing very well.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zeeVEvcSjAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7ffacc6441b97c259e82f5780f30f00c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zeeVEvcSjAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Part of it is how great the community around it is too with a popular Hololive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7h1zllAov8" target="_blank">vtuber</a> taking a look, and a big post on the Deep Rock Galactic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRockGalactic/comments/106hw8p/attention_brothers_and_sisters_we_have_a_very/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> being thoroughly welcoming with a mod stating "PSA: Be accepting and welcoming towards new miners, no matter where they come from. Greenbeards joining the ranks should be celebrated. Spend your energy helping a few greenbeards out instead of being grumpy on the internet. The community is a big part of what keeps Deep Rock Galactic great." (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/space-dwarves-embrace-weeb-invasion-after-popular-vtuber-streams-their-favorite-game/" target="_blank">GamesRadar</a>).</p>
<p>You can see a previous video I did on Steam Deck above, and even multiple livestreams of it running on Steam Deck (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWxn2iMILdM" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu_BXaiI92M" target="_blank">#2</a>). Going back 2 years ago, I took a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izjtsZT11TA" target="_blank">video</a> of the 1.0 release on desktop Linux too.</p>
<p><em>Word on the street is: more Deep Rock livestreams from GamingOnLinux are coming, keep it schtum, and follow along on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">the YouTube</a>.</em></p>
<p>The number #3 cause of death in Deep Rock Galactic is apparently friendly fire too. I'm sure some of the people I play with will blame <em>me</em>, but in my defense you keep running in front of my flames and bullets. It's definitely <em>not</em> my aim…clearly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E0osQdzyFY" target="_blank">I am very good at games</a>.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/deep-rock-galactic?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The next release of 0 A.D. will have experimental Vulkan API support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>0 A.D. is an in-development free and open source RTS, one that's very promising and looks pretty good and the next Alpha version will also feature experimental Vulkan support.</p>
<p>Performance has been a problem for 0 A.D. across many versions, so I'm quite hopeful that this will help towards that. They put up a very brief <a href="https://play0ad.com/the-next-alpha-of-0-a-d-will-feature-an-experimental-vulkan-backend/" target="_blank">announcement</a>, which links to a <a href="https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/104382-vulkan-new-graphics-api/#comments" target="_blank">forum post</a> going into more details. It's currently going through testing, with the developer asking people to give it a run (although you would need to compile it from source) so that they can get Vulkan into a stable state ready for release. However, a Release Candidate should be available sometime soon to make that easier.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting better performance yet though, as they need to work on the multi-threading. Right now they're focused on ensuring it works and doesn't run into driver problems.</p>
<p>See their previous release trailer below:</p>

      <title>New Steam Linux &amp; Steam Deck Beta fixes up a major bug</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently Valve put up a Beta for Steam desktop and Steam Deck, which unfortunately came with a huge bug that people found but a new release fixes it and adds some more fixes too.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9094" target="_blank">bug</a> was quite a big woops, that ended up causing people on Linux and Steam Deck to be unable to open anything after Steam had been open for a short time.</p>
<p>Once again the patch notes are basically the same across <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6763877288727266768" target="_blank">desktop</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5662747178710102497" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing "Maximum number of clients reached" issue</li>
</ul>
<p>Downloads</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Patch Notes button on Downloads page entries</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow onscreen keyboard to be activated while in New Big Picture Mode and Steam window is not focused</li>
<li>Fixed some issues where onscreen keyboard and controller configurator windows could not be reactivated after closing</li>
<li>Fixed issue opting in to some game beta branches</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue w/ Joystick Deadzone visualization not updating</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems they actually realised at least for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-steam-deck-beta-improves-controller-configurator-plus-linux-fixes/" target="_blank">update before this</a>, that they had copy / pasted a feature from desktop to Steam Deck not actually available on Steam Deck. The feature being the new full / partial controller icon being added on game hover in your library, as they actually went back and removed it from the changelog. The one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-beta-update-plus-easy-flatpak-updates-and-more-hdr-teasing/" target="_blank">before that</a> still lists some controller options not actually available on Steam Deck though — would be nice if these things were checked fully before going out in their official changelogs to not confuse users.</p>

      <title>Dino Run DX has the source code opened up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems more developers are warming up to the idea of open source. Pixeljam recently opened up the source code to Dino Run DX.</p>
<p>Currently, the download is only available via their Discord server as per their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/248330/view/3639504956058288978" target="_blank">announcement</a> and there's seemingly no license attached to it yet, so I'm hesitant to say it's fully "open source" until we see what license they actually put it under. They did say on Discord they do plan to put it up on GitHub with a proper license, so I guess we'll see.</p>
<p>From their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're open-sourcing Dino Run DX.</p>
<p>As some of our most dedicated players have discovered, Dino Run DX multiplayer no longer works. The wonderful folks at Xgen Studios, who basically let multiplayer live rent-free for years, had to recently sunset all of their legacy games (like Stick Arena) and the servers that run them. And as you can imagine, Dino Run used those servers.<br/>
<br/>
They DID send us the source code to the server itself, so maybe we can get it up and running again on our end. However, we haven't been able to compile the actual game for years now, since it's legacy flash and that no longer works on any computer that we own.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-EI9RJULhSs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9cce549914ea7ce9ab496dd11d9ebf3e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-EI9RJULhSs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Always sad when games are lost to time, many developer had issues with Flash and Air but there's quite a few ways to get them running now thanks to open source. Perhaps it can be ported over to something like <a href="https://www.openfl.org/" target="_blank">OpenFL</a> to allow it to continue on.</p>

      <title>Hogwarts Legacy to be Steam Deck Verified at launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For Harry Potter fans, the upcoming release of Hogwarts Legacy is fast approaching and it seems they're making sure it works on Steam Deck. Well, that might be a bit of a stretch, they might have just loaded it up to see if it works, but the result to players is the same.</p>
<p>When asked about the status of it on Twitter, the official WB Games Support account <a href="https://twitter.com/WBGamesSupport/status/1613595212982489090" target="_blank">noted</a> "We reached out to the Hogwarts Legacy team for you and were able to confirm that the game WILL be Steam Deck verified on launch. We hope this helps with your decision! Take care." — good news for anyone who plans to pick it up. Being Steam Deck Verified almost always means it will work well on desktop Linux too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BsC-Rl9GYy0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3607ad83144f36a96abe274fc09001b0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BsC-Rl9GYy0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world action RPG set in the world first introduced in the Harry Potter books. Embark on a journey through familiar and new locations as you explore and discover magical beasts, customize your character and craft potions, master spell casting, upgrade talents and become the wizard you want to be.</p>
<p>Experience Hogwarts in the 1800s. Your character is a student who holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart. Make allies, battle Dark wizards, and ultimately decide the fate of the wizarding world. Your legacy is what you make of it. Live the Unwritten.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Available for pre-order on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hogwarts-legacy?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990080/Hogwarts_Legacy/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Something to be aware of though, are all the issues surrounding the Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling. An article on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/01/12/the-hogwarts-legacy-debate-explained/" target="_blank">Forbes</a> goes through some of it and goes into better detail than I can. <em>Comments on it are open, as long as people don’t throw around insults at each other, respectful debate is fine.</em></p>

      <title>Intel reveals the Core i9-13900KS that hits 6Ghz out of the box</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people that love chasing Ghz, Intel has a surprise for you. They revealed the Intel Core i9-13900KS today that hits 6Ghz max turbo out of the box. They claim it's now the world's fastest desktop processor, the first processor in history able to hit 6Ghz out of the box.</p>
<p>It's a "special edition" processor, that will become available on January 12, 2023 priced at $699. Nearly <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/compare.html?productIds=232167,230496" target="_blank">identical</a> to the 13900K except for the obvious bump in speeds across various parts of it like the performance core base frequency going from 3GHz to 3.20GHz, the efficient core base frequency going from 2.20Ghz to 2.40Ghz and the max now being 6Ghz. It's also more power hungry with the base power upped to 150W (up from 125W) but the max turbo requirement is the same 253W.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Up to 6.0 GHz max turbo frequency with Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost – the first CPU in the PC industry to reach 6.0 GHz without overclocking.</li>
<li>Intel® Adaptive Boost Technology for improved gaming performance by opportunistically allowing higher multicore turbo frequencies.</li>
<li>24 cores (eight Performance-cores and 16 Efficient-cores), 32 threads, 150W processor base power, 36MB Intel Smart Cache and a total of 20 PCIe lanes (16 PCIe 5.0 and four PCIe 4.0 lanes).</li>
<li>Up to DDR5 5600 MT/s and DDR4 3200 MT/s support.</li>
<li>Compatible with Z790 and Z690 motherboards, with the latest BIOS recommended for the best gaming and content creation experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The Core i9-13900KS continues our 13th Gen Intel Core desktop processor family excellence, showcasing the new performance heights made possible by our performance hybrid architecture. Extreme gamers and enthusiasts can now push their everyday performance further than ever before with the first desktop processor in the PC industry to provide 6.0 GHz speeds at stock.”</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress too retro? Songs of Syx is worth looking at with another big Beta update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Songs of Syx is a fantasy city-builder that in many ways could be compared with Dwarf Fortress, only with a graphical style that's just a bit more modern. A new Beta release went up recently and it's another big one. It also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access it already has quite a lot of depth to it, and I was <em>incredibly</em> impressed with the first EA release I tried out ,putting a fair amount of hours into it. Honestly it sucked away a lot of my time when it first came out, good to see it continue to add some really good stuff.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15583602961673537927gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15583602961673537927gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what version 63 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing events.</li>
<li>A new Machinery resource for upgrading rooms, along with a machinery workshop for it.</li>
<li>Difficulty settings for random games.</li>
<li>A whole newly added Tourism system.</li>
<li>A serial killer event (oh my!), along with individual crime statistics.</li>
<li>Herbs you can now grow.</li>
<li>Mini-actions for people like giving out free drinks, free money, a day off etc.</li>
<li>Benches, at last people can find a nice spot to sit.</li>
<li>+ Absolutely <u>LOADS</u> more.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">You can see the full update overview from the developer below. It's in Beta that you can opt into on Steam, and should roll out for everyone a few weeks after:</span></p>

      <title>Mega Man-like side-scroller action game Super Alloy Ranger now on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enjoy games similar to Mega Man? Like running and gunning? Super Alloy Ranger looks interesting and they recently put up a Native Linux version too. The update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1944060/view/3640628950032517687" target="_blank">January 5th</a> added support for Linux, macOS, added 50 new achievements, new Steam community items and plenty of optimization too.</p>
<p>"Utilize various movement techniques to conquer the challenging levels; running, jumping, dashing, mid-air dash, wall climbing and double jumps. Use them wisely to track down the wanted criminal; this could be in sunken cities, the freezing Sea of Frost, the endless Abyssal Mines and many more places. Whatever it takes, you will find out the truth and head back with victory!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JQQCPHozbc4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ca6c387ac95bb7475a10eb447060b69.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JQQCPHozbc4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic side-scrolling mode of operation, dodge the bullets while jumping, dashing and climbing to progress with the level.</li>
<li>Many hidden pathways are waiting for you to explore.</li>
<li>Both characters have many weapons and combat styles up for selection.</li>
<li>Challenge gigantic boss enemies in dangerous barrages.</li>
<li>Incorporated the main features of Mega Man and Metal Slug. On top of that corresponding combat mechanism is added to the game!</li>
<li>Fun and exquisite pixel animations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At time of writing it has a Very Positive user rating so it seems like it could be worth your time, although it has mostly flown under the radar with only 110 user reviews on Steam. For gamers who love these retro-fuelled fast-paced run and gun action platformers I must say it does look pretty good!</p>
<p>Find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944060/Super_Alloy_Ranger/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Pokemon-like &#39;Coromon&#39; finally has big FPS problem fixed for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coromon is another attempt to make a Pokemon styled game and while it is a lot of fun, the game had a major frustrating problem on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton that has now been solved.</p>
<p>When covering it initially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/coromon-is-pretty-much-pokemon-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">back in April 2022</a>, I noted how it looked good and ran quite well until the performance would suddenly hard-drop down to 14FPS and just lock itself there. It would do it like clockwork every single time after a while of playing it (around an hour or so) and it was the same on desktop Linux too. The game was Steam Deck Verified by Valve back in April 2022, and stayed Verified the entire time which is another clear example of Deck Verified just <em>not</em> being thorough enough because this issue happened to <em>everyone</em>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, although rather late on it, the developer found the issue and fixed it in an update released in December 2022. So now it actually deserves the Steam Deck Verified rating.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the developer actually went onto Valve's Proton GitHub page to give an <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5828#issuecomment-1328015908" target="_blank">explanation</a> of what the issue was, to help others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developer of Coromon here, we've been investigating this issue for some time now and we're finally able to pinpoint where the issue is coming from. Just dropping our findings here to help someone else perhaps fix the core issue.</p>
<p>The FPS drop starts happening after the <code class="inline-code">BOverlayNeedsPresent()</code> Steam SDK API is called roughly ~130.000 times (~36.5 minutes converted to seconds * 60FPS).<br/>
The <a href="https://github.com/coronalabs/com.coronalabs-plugin.steamworks" target="_blank">steamworks plugin</a> of our engine calls this on every frame to determine whether OpenGL should force a render to ensure the overlay is being updated. We tested decreasing the polling rate to the <code class="inline-code">BOverlayNeedsPresent()</code> to once every 10 frames, this delayed the FPS drop to 6 hours (360 minutes) instead of 36 minutes. This also changed the constant FPS drop into a frame spike every 10 frames, so it seems to me <code class="inline-code">BOverlayNeedsPresent()</code> starts to take a lot of CPU time after it is called over ~130.000 times.</p>
<p>We tested on every available Proton version on Steam, Proton 4.2-9 &amp; Proton 3.16-9 do not have this glitch somehow.</p>
<p>We'll be releasing an update of our game soon where we decrease the polling rate even further to allow sessions of at least 18 hours without the FPS drop, but a better solution would be a fix for <code class="inline-code">BOverlayNeedsPresent()</code> in Proton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So unless you're doing a single run longer than 18 hours (what?!) you're fine now.</em></p>
<p>It's actually pretty great to see a developer explain things like this, I wished more did. It can help Proton developers, and other game developers for future problems.</p>
<p>As usual here's a video with some fresh gameplay and a little discussion for people who prefer videos now:</p>

<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/coromon?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and Steam.</p>

      <title>Steam &amp; Steam Deck Beta improves controller configurator plus Linux fixes (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update at 20:10 UTC</strong>: this Beta seems to have a pretty <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9094" target="_blank">major bug</a>. I would suggest you stay away from it for now otherwise you might find you can't open things on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Valve has released a new Steam Client Beta for both desktop and Steam Deck, with new fixes and some new features too like showing full or partial controller icons when hovering over items.</p>
<p>The changelog is basically the <em>same</em> with different titles across <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3642882655783105850" target="_blank">desktop</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5662747178707105871" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>, with the desktop client having an additional fix for macOS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing download regions no longer requires restarting the Steam client</li>
<li>Show icons for partial and full controller support in Library when a game portrait is focused or hovered</li>
<li>Add a rollup of gifts received in the Quick Access &gt; Notifications area</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller configurator now groups commands if they are attached to the same input</li>
<li>Controller configuration browsing screen can now preview configurations and the selection processes now previews then applies instead of directly selecting the configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>Desktop Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some errors causing the Library not to render properly</li>
<li>Fix the "Start in Big Picture Mode" setting not updating</li>
<li>Center the navigation column in the Big Picture Overlay vertically to match the rest of the main menu</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtual Keyboard</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone keyboard can now be brought up outside of Big Picture Mode</li>
<li>Fixed some issues using the Paste button outside of a web context</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An important detail they seem to have left out though, is that this new full / partial controller icon that appears when you hover over a game in your library is not actually on Steam Deck. It appears to only work on a desktop PC in the New Big Picture Mode (it doesn't even appear on Steam Deck Desktop Mode with New Big Picture either). This is the second time they've noted something not actually there for the Steam Deck, like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-beta-update-plus-easy-flatpak-updates-and-more-hdr-teasing/" target="_blank">last Beta mentioning</a> new controller options for idle turn off time and turn it off when exiting Big Picture. Seems they once again copy and pasted bits of the changelog, without enabling it on Steam Deck directly.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks on Desktop Steam:</p>

      <title>Valve remind people to be careful where you buy a Steam Deck </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the official OnDeck Twitter account from Steam creator Valve posted a PSA (public service announcement), reminding people on being careful where they buy a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1612952676173742081" target="_blank">Twitter</a> they posted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, and happy new year! A quick note that the only official ways to purchase Steam Deck are directly from Steam (in the US, CA, EU, and UK), or from Komodo (JP, KR, TW, and HK). Steam Decks sold via any other websites or retailers are unofficial - please be careful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why are they posting it? Well, they of course haven't mentioned anyone or anything else directly, but it's likely in part due to the store I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/beware-of-scam-steam-deck-and-steam-account-stores/" target="_blank">in an article and video recently</a> that teamed up with accessory brand JSAUX. This store was selling Steam Accounts, Steam Gifts and more that are against Valve's terms and would get people banned from the platform, in addition to always claiming they have a discount on every model of Steam Deck with them being "brand new".</p>
<p><em>My video on that is still blocked on <a href="https://youtu.be/wKZ3k2zutBo" target="_blank">YouTube</a> in the UK for "defamation", a mirror is on <a href="https://tilvids.com/w/sx3oWxzUqQeHDe3pjmfH9k" target="_blank">TILVids</a>.</em></p>
<p>In the UK at least, there's actually nothing wrong with reselling. You buy something, it's yours. The key point is to be careful: if a deal looks too good, it probably is too good to be true. There's also no real reason in the UK or the US to buy one new from somewhere other than Valve.</p>
<p>There are plenty of places Valve are not yet supplying though, which is part of a wider issue. Hopefully this year Valve will announce more regions they will serve officially or through a partner like they do with Komodo for some parts of Asia.</p>

      <title>Check out the new release of Kandria a hand-crafted 2D action game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have to admit, not many platformer-likes catch my attention nowadays but Kandria certainly looks the part. This new Native Linux game just launched from the tiny team at Shirakumo Games, the lead of which is also part of <a href="https://shirakumo.org/" target="_blank">Shirakumo Collective</a> who do some open source software too (including their game engine).</p>
<p>What is it? Kandria is a hand-crafted 2D role-playing action game that resembles a metroidvania. The developers say it has all the platforming puzzle elements of games like Celeste, but also features some slick swordplay found in the likes of NieR:Automata with a sprinkling of a post-apocalyptic world. It also has a lovely soundtrack to it!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="usc0Znm-gbA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12ef5b8629ec446d81840dc50abc9b1c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/usc0Znm-gbA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as The Stranger, a powerful android recently unearthed from the ruins of the old world.</li>
<li>Fight against rogue robots and malcontent humans - you’re faster, stronger, and more resilient. But are you smarter?</li>
<li>When you think you’ve mastered things, prepare yourself for epic boss battles with beasts and machines, which slumber and lurk deep beneath the earth.</li>
<li>Explore vast, open and interconnected levels full of non-linear missions, challenging platforming, and gorgeous pixel art decay - cross the barren surface, or spelunk deep underground.</li>
<li>Meet diverse characters and factions struggling to survive; determine friend from foe, and choose allies wisely as you forge your own future amongst the ruins.</li>
<li>Experience an epic story of mystery, grit and self-determination, all the way to its inevitable end. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see another game that was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shinmera/kandria/description" target="_blank">crowdfunded</a> deliver!</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://shinmera.itch.io/kandria" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1261430/Kandria/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Remember to support the projects you use and appreciate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In light of some recent news surrounding the MSI Afterburner software, it's another reminder that it's quite important for people to directly support projects they use and enjoy. <em>No this isn't me asking you to support my Patreon or anything.</em></p>
<p>While this first bit isn't Linux related, stick with it a moment. On the guru3D forum, the developer on Afterburner <a href="https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/7900xt-power-usage-not-visible.446010/#post-6089040" target="_blank">noted</a> "MSI afterburner project is probably dead" and later <a href="https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/7900xt-power-usage-not-visible.446010/#post-6090142" target="_blank">elaborated</a> "War and politics are the reasons" (Ukraine and Russia) and mentioned "the project is semi abandoned by company during quite a long time already" with MSI apparently not "performing their obligations under Afterburner license agreement" with the developer not being paid for their work. MSI are <a href="https://twitter.com/hms1193/status/1612449753903554560" target="_blank">claiming</a> "product marketing &amp; accounting team are dealing with this problem now" and mentioned the war was causing payment issues.</p>
<p>Regardless of what's <em>really</em> happening it's a stark reminder that a <em>lot</em> of things we use directly and probably take for granted, or things other bigger projects use, are often developed and supported by single people (or only a few people). So if there's something you're using that you want to keep using, and see it keep working, perhaps it's a good time to throw some direct support behind it?</p>
<p>Makes me think about projects like <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> for Linux, the awesome way to get a Vulkan and OpenGL overlay on top of games that lets you monitor things like FPS, temperatures, system load, frame timings, benchmarking and more. MangoHud is even used on the Steam Deck, it's the performance overlay. Valve do sponsor the development on it but imagine if they didn't or just stopped (there's also direct support links on their GitHub).</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12556950641673460308gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12556950641673460308gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>That's MangoHud in the bottom right corner. Just ignore the frame timing spike, Dying Light 2 does not like its photo to be taken, it's a bit camera shy.</em></p>
<p>We also have other great projects like the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>, which has become very popular since the Steam Deck release to help people manage GOG and Epic Games Store on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. It only just recently expanded to handle games from other sources. I could keep on naming various important Linux gaming projects for hours. It's just another relevant easy example.</p>
<p>There's been worse <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/" target="_blank">examples</a> to bring up like the time a developer on the faker.js and colors.js projects decided to stop doing it, and ended up pushing out a malicious update screwing over everyone using it. Why? They <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210704022108/https:/github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/1046" target="_blank">were fed up</a> of "Fortune 500s ( and other smaller sized companies )" using their work without supporting it.</p>
<p>So to sum up this little reminder if you able to: give back to the projects you use and love, don't let them fade away.</p>

      <title>3 Minutes to Midnight devs say it&#39;s going well for full Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>3 Minutes to Midnight is an upcoming comedy adventure game from Scarecrow Studio. It was funded on Kickstarter and their latest <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scarecrowstudio/3-minutes-to-midnight-a-comedy-graphic-adventure/posts/3699700" target="_blank">development update</a> sounds great.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of this one before it's styled much like classic LucasArts point &amp; click adventures but with some twists including puzzles that have many solutions, lots of hidden content, actions that have consequences so your next run may be quite different and much more to make it replayable. Check out their original trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LKoIjDqoJns"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d74bf41b43b192a52cb2e32caab28adf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LKoIjDqoJns" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With their development update out they make it clear it's going well, and they've designed a special automated test that can run through the entire game that they've been repeatedly using to help development move along. While it took time away from the actual game development, they said this AI player has already helped them find "over 60 extremely difficult-to-find game-breaking bugs". So I have high hopes for this to be nicely polished at release.</p>
<p>As for Linux and Steam Deck support directly, they made it clear their Linux testing has showed their Native version working across Fedora, Mint, and Arch and they "have yet to find any unexpected issues". That's an impressive level of support, you don't see many indie developers doing that! It will also have gamepad support, steam cloud saves and when talking about Steam Deck they said "Since SteamOS is a Linux-based operating system, 3 Minutes to Midnight will therefore be fully compatible with Steam Deck.".</p>
<p>You can follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/832500/3_Minutes_to_Midnight__A_Comedy_Graphic_Adventure/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver &#39;NVK&#39; begins to run games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/nvk-is-a-new-open-source-mesa-vulkan-driver-for-nvidia-gpus/" target="_blank">October last year</a> I wrote about the new open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver named NVK, and now it appears to be able to actually run games. Not particularly well though.</p>
<p>This NVK driver is not from NVIDIA but is instead a new Mesa driver but is a serious effort to see if they can get it into a state where it's usable like what the RADV is to AMD hardware.</p>
<p>Posting on their <a href="https://chaos.social/@karolherbst/109666048560595911" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> account, driver developer Karol Herbst showed a screenshot of it now capable of loading up The Talos Principle with a follow-up noting "performance is terrible, but that's hopefully resolved with the GSP work which is still ongoing :)".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16798902601673443366gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16798902601673443366gol1.png"/></a>Image Credit - Karol Herbst</em></p>
<p>Seems like 2023 could be a really fun year for NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux, if this work continues to improve. Given the work involved, it will likely be a good while before performance is actually at a playable stage.</p>

      <title>This new Steam Deck external controller plugin is quite useful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You can use a lot of external controllers with the Steam Deck but the current system to interact with them isn't great. The <a href="https://github.com/alphamercury/ControllerTools" target="_blank">Controller Tools</a> plugin could solve some issues, at least until Valve give this section a little more love.</p>
<p>Giving you currently a quick way to see connection type, charge level and charge status for some controllers in a dedicated menu. It currently supports:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation DualSense.</li>
<li>Playstation DualShock 4.</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S Controller (limited support).</li>
<li>Xbox One Controller (limited support).</li>
</ul>
<p>With plans to expand it with new features like controller light configuration, more controllers based on community requests for them, low-battery in-game alerts and more.</p>
<p>Here's a quick look at it, along with a note on the How Long To Beat plugin too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uUV4DvmZD4k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/607da98fda4ff941fcffb6f2f7a3d66e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uUV4DvmZD4k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You do need Decky Loader for this, see my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/decky-loader-makes-steam-deck-plugins-even-easier-with-new-installer/" target="_blank">previous article and video</a> on it.</p>

      <title>Counterplay Games makes tactical card battler Duelyst completely open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is awesome and something more developers should do with games they shut down. Counterplay Games have made their mix of a collectable card game and a turn-based strategy Duelyst fully open source.</p>
<p>With proper Native support for Linux, macOS and Windows the entire game has been set free for everyone. So people can play free, and use the code and artwork for other games thanks to the Creative Commons Zero license. It seems they plan to eventually turn it into "Duelyst Classic" with a full release but they also note in the video below that other indie teams are already working with their code. A little confusing but likely alluding to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2004320/Duelyst_II/" target="_blank">Duelyst II</a> that's now on Steam from Dream Sloth Games so they likely just got the code access early to do so.</p>
<p>Announced yesterday in a YouTube video announcement you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h3Cuz6d_7x0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2bb438925be538e15114a209443aaf9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h3Cuz6d_7x0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can play it right now too in single-player and multi-player, although it's using their "staging" servers until it's ready for the eventual classic re-release.</p>
<p>Thanks to the entire thing being released like this, Duelyst could end up becoming one of the most professional and popular open source games around. I'll be keeping an eye on this one for you to see when the proper Duelyst Classic releases from this.</p>
<p>Checking it out briefly, on Fedora 37 it worked completely out of the box when downloading the latest release so that's great to see.</p>
<p>All of it can be found on <a href="https://github.com/open-duelyst/duelyst" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and they provide release builds for each platform too.</p>
<p>Here's an overview video with some gameplay:</p>

      <title>Stop mixing magnets with the Steam Deck or face fan and temperature troubles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems people haven't learned from the debacle with the dbrand Project Killswitch case <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/project-killswitch-sales-suspended-as-the-kickstand-messed-with-the-steam-deck-fan/" target="_blank">using magnets</a> that causes problems with certain Steam Deck fan speeds.</p>
<p>Recently, a company sent over a Power Bank to look over and potentially do an article and video on. After spending time with it and being ready to do a video, the company then sent a follow-up email to warn me that it's actually a bit problematic. The issue: the Power Bank uses a magnetic mount to attach it to the Steam Deck, and magnets do not play nicely with the Delta fans (which Valve still use in addition to the Huaying model).</p>
<p>So I made a decision <em>not</em> to cover it in a video (and article review) and instead do a PSA (public service announcement), because no doubt a few people won't check their fan. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BNXGVZTS" target="_blank">This</a> is the item in question, and really: just go for basically any other Power Bank that won't potentially mess with your Steam Deck. Even on the Huaying fans, it could still potentially cause problems. In a lot of cases the Steam Deck already gets pretty high temperatures, adding to that is not going to be a good idea. Why risk it? Don't.</p>
<p>So what Power Bank to actually go for? As long as it has at least 45w delivery through PD 3.0 and a good battery size, you should be fine for actual charging. Just again — don't mess with magnets. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">Deckmate system</a> is a good way to attach things to the back of a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>To companies and people making things for Steam Deck: just stop using magnets. I get it, they're cheaper than designing a locking method but please stop.</p>

      <title>DOSBox Staging adds dual-mouse gaming and ReelMagic support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DOSBox Staging is a favourite of mine to follow that expands on the original DOSBox but with a focus on implementing new features and fixes. A new major update went out in December 2022 with some big additions. <em>It's supposed to be a drop-in replacement for the old original DOSBox.</em></p>
<p>Release 0.80.0 and the follow-up bug-fix 0.80.1 adds in support for ReelMagic, an MPEG playback board and so DOS games that depended on it will now work in DOSBox Staging. However, they suggest only enabling it when needed. Eventually they will also be adding in DMA support too.</p>
<p>They also added in dual-mouse gaming so that multiple physical mice attached can be mapped to emulated mouse interfaces, allowing two-player split-screen gaming like found in The Settlers and The Settlers II amongst other games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10377522201673363107gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10377522201673363107gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - X-Com on Linux with DOSBox Staging</em></p>
<p>On top of that some helper text was added like telling you how the mouse can be captured and released from DOSBox, more settings work properly while a game is running like video resolution, OpenGL shaders, audio devices and others. There's also some additional OpenGL shaders included, plus some bug fixes.</p>

      <title>20 years later the open source Colonization game FreeCol hits 1.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Took a while huh? It's not quite as well-known or as loved as some other free and open source games, but worth pointing out: FreeCol 1.0 is out now. 20 years in the making for this Sid Meier's Colonization remake!</p>
<p>Even though it's technically <em>finished</em>, the team behind it say they plan to continue upgrading the game and FreeCol 2.0 will have many features added towards what they and players imagine "Colonization 2 would have been". Games are never actually truly finished huh?</p>
<p>Some of what's new in the 1.0 release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New nation specific colony graphics.</li>
<li>New forest graphics.</li>
<li>Major changes to the tile goods production so that the actual values matches the original game.</li>
<li>Greatly improved artificial intelligence (AI) for the computer players.</li>
<li>Much better stability (many bug fixes).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They did also have another release towards the middle of last year if you missed it that added in music, animated rivers, improved performance, plenty of art updates and more.<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4296319441673361608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4296319441673361608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>GameCube and Wii emulator Dolphin got a big speed boost for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GameCube and the Wii emulator Dolphin had a <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/12/21/dolphin-progress-report-september-october-november-2022/" target="_blank">progress report</a> posted up in late December, and it's looking really good, especially so with their performance optimization work.</p>
<p>As usual plenty of new features are coming in like support for WiiConnect24, a service for staying connected online but it was terminated by Nintendo (but alternatives like WiiLink and RiiConnect24 exist). Now Dolphin should work nicely with it.</p>
<p>More exciting though is that their team has been doing a lot of work with Vulkan lately including the use of the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/VulkanMemoryAllocator" target="_blank">Vulkan Memory Allocator</a>, which gives them better memory management. Their optimization continued, thanks to the release of the <strong>Steam Deck</strong> where they realised they could do better. One game in particular stuck out with Super Mario Galaxy (Wii) not performing like it should, and they ended up finding something they were doing eating up a lot of CPU time which as it turns out was a <em>regression</em> from two years ago. After sorting that, it was optimized even further and in their simulated Steam Deck testing they showed performance going from 85FPS to 140FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3885826781673356232gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3885826781673356232gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em><a href="https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-spoiler-alert-bbk-s-dolphin-screenshots-thread-56k-warning?pid=285241#pid285241" target="_blank">Image Credit</a> - Dolphin Forum</em></p>
<p>They also made it clear some <em>direct</em> Steam Deck testing showed a clear improvement too with "Super Mario Galaxy (and a little of Super Mario Galaxy 2)" performing now "at full speed and 2x Internal Resolution without any noticeable slowdown".</p>
<p>Overall, sounds like a nice performance win for all users but especially those on Steam Deck. On desktop though they said they saw Super Mario Galaxy games get an improvement of about "30%" even when running at "4x Internal Resolution" but not everything has a big jump, some games only saw a very small increase.</p>
<p>Lots more in their progress report like a reduction in stuttering with more optimization work going into the Ubershaders system, improvements to their FPS counter, an Android GUI refresh and so on.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader makes Steam Deck plugins even EASIER with new installer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Decky Loader is a project I've covered before multiple times now because it can add a lot to the Steam Deck with plugins, and now it's even easier to use.</p>
<p>Until now, you've always needed to use the command-line terminal app Konsole to install it by pasting in a command to grab it. However from version v2.4.8 onwards that released a few days ago, it now has an easy download that will give you a little UI for installing it, and if you don't have an admin password set it can even do a temporary one while it installs — clever stuff.</p>
<p>Take a quick look in my video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ujP6ZB0-eIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/672addaec553a4ff5c12bff8ffc6f566.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ujP6ZB0-eIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It's amazing how the Steam Deck has built up this big community of hackers around it, making all sorts of useful additions. Like we've seen here with Decky Loader, it all gets easier over time too as more people contribute towards the projects. That's the power of open source in action.</p>

      <title>Valve adding a Steam feature for game transfers between PCs and Steam Decks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something it seems Valve has been working on for a while now, is an easy way to transfer game installs between PCs and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>We've known about it since at least October last year, where the SteamDB founder Pavel Djundik talked about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1585700178480271378" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. However, in a follow-up post on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1611285970325839872" target="_blank">Twitter</a> just recently, Djundik mentioned more work on this has appeared recently with strings appearing that say "This feature allows your PC to transfer game files to and from other PCs or Steam Decks on your local network, reducing your Internet traffic while downloading or updating a game" and also noting that you can "Can limit to own devices, friends, or any user.".</p>
<p>Once actually out it would mean you don't need to re-download on other systems, or use the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4593-5CB7-DC3C-64F0" target="_blank">Steam Backup feature</a> (which doesn't always work right) along with some form of file syncing which I've done multiple guides on for Steam Deck including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heres-how-to-transfer-files-from-your-pc-to-a-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Warpinator</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/syncthing-is-a-great-way-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Syncthing</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/transferring-files-from-pc-to-steam-deck-with-ftp/" target="_blank">Filezilla FTP</a>.</p>
<p>Sounds like an incredibly useful feature for Valve to add to Steam desktop and Steam Deck don't you think? Looking forward to giving that a test when it's available.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 20: The Antediluvian World</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-19-sinsational/" target="_blank">Part 19: SiNsational</a></strong></p>
<p><em>Atlantis: The Underwater City</em> is an animated film released in 2001 directed by Alessandro Bulath and distributed by Sterling Entertainment Group under their UAV brand. The cynic in me suspects the film was only produced to sow market confusion in the hope of cashing in on some of the hype surrounding the release of <em>Atlantis: The Lost Empire </em>that same year<em>,</em> which was a very common practice for budget animation studios during the Disney Renaissance.</p>
<p>Few of those knock off straight to video movies ever got the companion CD-ROM treatment, but it was quite common for legit Disney films to receive them at the time. Sold as interactive storybooks, these took the form of narrated picture books which went over the story from the film while allowing for a certain degree of user agency, typically by allowing a selection of quirky animations to play by clicking around with the mouse.</p>
<p>UAV must have wanted in on this craze as well, and so <em>Atlantis: The Underwater City - Interactive Storybook</em> was born. Even when compared to the source material it is clear that little effort was put into its production, with bare bones animation and crude art direction marring a title marketed as transporting children to a memorable fantasy world. About the only reason to save the software from the bargain bin that it was intended for is the boast of Linux support.</p>
<p>Inside the jewel case the booklet instructs Linux users to mount the CD-ROM, change to the directory, and then launch the Atlantis_for_Linux.sh shell script. This will probe for a number of common Linux web browsers of the time including Mozilla, Konqueror, Galeon, and Netscape, before attempting to launch the browser.html web page located on the root directory of the CD-ROM. A nice effort, but they could have just called the $BROWSER global variable instead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the developers forgot to specify the present working directory, leaving the script to just fall flat on its face. Adding $PWD in the path before invoking browser.html would have made all the difference, a flaw which should have been obvious long before they burned the shell script to the CD-ROM. Thankfully the README.html page does at least include a working link for launching on other computer systems such as Linux and BeOS, so that is something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13165353911672949546gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13165353911672949546gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10779695971672882248gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10779695971672882248gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>The <em>Interactive Storybook</em> functions through the magic of Macromedia Flash, which I installed for use with Mozilla using the flash-plugin-7.0.69-1.rh7.rf.i386.rpm package from freshrpms. This allowed the storybook portion to work, but some of the included minigames proved to have rendering errors, with the Atlantis Bricks and Atlantis Blocks games both being crippled to the point of being unplayable. I suspect this is due to incompatibilities between Flash versions.</p>
<p>Alongside Macromedia Flash the <em>Interactive Storybook</em> also depends on Apple QuickTime for playing the full movie, with it just being a dead link for me on Linux. Of course, there is nothing stopping you from searching the data directory on the CD-ROM for the atlantis.mov file and playing that through your favourite Linux movie player of choice. The README.html page suggests using XAnim but I settled for watching the bitcrushed file through MPlayer instead.</p>
<p>At this point, playing the <em>Interactive Storybook</em> on Linux is not far removed from having no support for the platform at all. While it is nice that they acknowledged that everything they were doing could in theory be done on Linux, very little effort was put into making it be a smooth experience in practice. I am reminded of the demands by some to have more DOSBox wrappers available for Linux on storefronts, when without proper care they could easily wind up being like this.</p>
<p>Having now gone to the trouble of finding and installing Macromedia Flash on Red Hat Linux 7.3 it might be an idea go back and explore some higher quality Flash games and amusements, as there are a number of them that I do have some actual nostalgic attachment towards. For the moment I think I have gotten my fill by messing about with this however, not helped by the fact Macromedia Flash runs a little heavy on Dianoga.</p>
<p>Although it appears to have never been mentioned on their website, the credits reveal that the developer of the <em>Interactive Storybook </em>was none other than BlackHoleSun Software, a familiar name to those in the Linux gaming scene at the time. As one of the first Indie studios to truly embrace cross-platform development, even the mention of BeOS in the README.html page makes a lot more sense now, given who we are dealing with.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Version 0.14 of the Multiplayer voxel RPG Veloren is out now, adding in some fun sounding additions while they work towards giving you more to do. It's still very much a sandbox right now, as a lot of the work going into Veloren is still building up the tech behind the game.</p>
<p>As for what it is and what it aims to be: it's inspired by the likes of Cube World, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft and mixes elements of all together but it's still early days. It's free, open source and supports Linux. Promising, but still needs some more <em>stuff and things</em> for players to actually experience.</p>

      <title>Pixel-art RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent adds neutral settlements and unit stances</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What might seem like a pixel-art Age of Empires on the surface, the RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent is much more than that and they recently released a major update for the game. It's currently in Early Access with this latest update being the second major milestone for the game.</p>
<p>This update was released last month and added into the game neutral settlements, giving you and your opponents more to fight over as gaining control of them will give you various bonuses. Sounds like a fun addition to fight for control of the map and get going early on. Nice to see a bit more depth to it.</p>
<p>You can also set your people across three different stances now including holding ground, being defensive or aggressive. On top of that some of the UI was reworked to be less confusing, enemy AI improvements and various smaller improvements for this RTS gem.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1674820/TFC_The_Fertile_Crescent/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and it has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio recording software v29.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OBS Studio, the very useful and popular recording and livestream software has a new release available with <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/29.0.0" target="_blank">version 29.0</a> out now. As usual there's plenty of features that only currently work on Windows, some that will hopefully come to Linux eventually when OBS have people to work on them.</p>
<p>Some of the new features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the AMD AV1 Encoder for the RX7000 series GPUs on Windows.</li>
<li>Added support for the Intel AV1 Encoder for Arc GPUs on Windows.
<ul>
<li>Note: CQP is available but not fully supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for the Intel HEVC Encoder on Windows.</li>

<li>Added a 3-band equalizer filter.</li>
<li>Added support for native HEVC and ProRes encoders on macOS, including P010 and HDR.</li>
<li>Added support for macOS Desk View.</li>
<li>Added update channels for opting into receiving beta/release-candidate builds to Windows.
<ul>
<li>Work is still underway to get everything ready on the server side, updating via the built-in updater may not be available until later in the OBS 30.0 beta-testing period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Websockets updated to 5.1.0, which has a number of bug fixes, UI improvements, and new stream reconnect events.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15644620271673272338gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15644620271673272338gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>OBS Studio v29.0 capturing a Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Some other improvements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Replay Buffer's memory limit is now set to 75% of installed system RAM rather than fixed to 8GB.</li>
<li>Added media key support in Linux.</li>
<li>Various improvements to NVIDIA Video and Audio filters, including a Mask Refresh slider and support for temporal processing, which provides better quality masking.</li>
<li>Improved Display Capture screen naming &amp; saving on Windows; indexes should now match regardless of Mode, and reconnected displays should show the correct monitor.
<ul>
<li>Note: This does mean existing Display Capture sources will be blank until manually configured, to avoid showing the wrong display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for encryption and authentication for SRT and RIST outputs.</li>
<li>Disabled ScreenCaptureKit Display &amp; App capture on macOS 12 due to various issues; users should either update to macOS 13 or use the existing Screen Capture source.</li>
<li>Removed the automatic numbering on Multiview labels.</li>
<li>Added the ability to mute individual browser docks.</li>
<li>Added the ability to right click and 'Inspect' individual browser docks.</li>
<li>Changed the default Simple Output NVENC preset to P5 for better compatibility &amp; performance.</li>
<li>Added support for higher refresh rates in the Video Capture Device source on Windows.</li>
<li>Added the Apple VT Hardware encoder to the Auto Configuration Wizard.</li>
<li>Improved FFmpeg VA-API enablement by directly using Libva to check device capabilities.</li>
<li>Various minor UX/accessibility tweaks in the UI.</li>
<li>Raised the speed at which dynamic bitrate recovers after a drop.</li>
<li>Audio should now be automatically captured for most capture card brands using the Video Capture Device source on Windows.</li>
<li>Added a slide counter to the Source Toolbar when an Image Slide Show is selected.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On a personal note, I'm hoping this release will fix an audio bug I've been hitting recently where everything is fine for me with game captures looking great and for me sounding good, but the recording has audio that just constantly stutters. It's been a problem for a while, and has made quite a few of my recordings unusable. If you've encountered it and know a fix, do let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>I also seem to have to do a weird little dance with my capture card recently. A first load of OBS never seems to have it working. Sometimes I have to unplug the capture card and plug it back in for OBS to see it properly — it's been getting quite annoying but it could also be Fedora-specific issues with V4L2.</p>

      <title>Developer of No Man&#39;s Sky put up their old Joe Danger playable in your browser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Joe Danger was the first commercial game release from No Man's Sky developer Hello Games, and as part of keeping it alive they've put it up online free to play in your browser.</p>
<p>You get to play with Joe Danger Touch and Infinity with "improved visuals, on Mac/PC/Chrome/Linux, dynamic resolution, mouse and keyboard support" according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1611321944472956928" target="_blank">Twitter</a> announcement.</p>
<p>Last year they revived the classic for the Apple App Store after noting an email they received from the mother of a child with Autism about it who loved it, and so now they're doing the same for PC players and in an expanded tweet they said: "It's sad that many games slowly die, and we've been trying to think of a way to let Joe live on forever, and reach the most people possible. This is hopefully one way of doing that. We owe this and more to him.".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11180323931673270978gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11180323931673270978gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>You can play it online <a href="https://joedangerthegame.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another way developers can keep old games alive is by open sourcing them, especially if they no longer plan to sell them, or even if they do want to continue selling them they can just open up the game code. Hopefully over time more will do that.</p>

      <title>Left 4 Dead from Valve has a prototype leaked online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tis the season of leakage apparently. Seems a prototype of Left 4 Dead 2 has made its way online and you can even try it.</p>
<p>Available on the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/420879" target="_blank">GameBanana</a> modding platform for Counter-Strike: Source, Zombie City was apparently created by either Valve or Turtle Rock Studios and was part of a map sources folder leak that went out and seemingly the starting point of Left 4 Dead going by the name of Terror-Strike.</p>
<p>The modder who uploaded it mentioned they did some tweaks to make it more playable like texture fixes. </p>
<p>While it obviously doesn't compare with the real finished product or the sequel, it's always fun to see what the early prototype versions looked like so we can get a small glimpse behind the development curtain. Some footage on it you can find below:</p>

<p>There sure has been a lot of leaks lately huh like the original <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildEnginePics/status/1610626880297701376" target="_blank">Blood</a>, various <a href="https://twitter.com/IRLskellydude/status/1609562544779272193" target="_blank">Duke Nukem</a> games, <a href="https://twitter.com/juanlurve/status/1609063069208186883" target="_blank">another</a> Duke Nukem, a <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1607185999687303169" target="_blank">Halo 3 Alpha</a> build and more.</p>

      <title>Steam breaks more records with 33 million online, and over 10 million gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve started the year off rather nicely by breaking two of their own records recently with users online and users actually gaming.</p>
<p>They have a new all-time peak for concurrent online users as 33,078,963 and 10,284,568 playing games. This is only the second time we've seen over 10 million people in-game, the first being the day before on January 7th but these numbers from January 8th are the new records as shown by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/graphs/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>.</p>
<p>The current top 5 most played games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.</li>
<li>Dota 2.</li>
<li>Goose Goose Duck.</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS.</li>
<li>Apex Legends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Goose Goose Duck the social deduction game (that takes a look of inspiration <em>directly</em> from Among Us) being a complete newcomer releasing in October last year, and suddenly seeing the player count rise from late November where it went up like a rocket to see a 24 hour peak of 640,324. It being free to play probably helps a lot, and it runs on Linux with Proton.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated and Proton Next (7.0-6) out for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first Proton Experimental update of 2023 from Valve has landed for Linux desktop and Steam Deck, plus Proton Next is live again with the upcoming release of Proton 7.0-6.</p>
<p>Firstly the Proton Experimental update that landed January 6th: a newly playable title with this update is Gungrave G.O.R.E., a third-person action shooter by South-Korean Studio IGGYMOB. It also comes with these additions:</p>

<li>Fix Life is Strange Remastered crashing at the end of chapter 2.</li>
<li>Fix Alt+Tab not working on Gnome 43.</li>
<li>Improve force feedback compatibility for BeamNG and Forza Horizon 5.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bigger one of course is Proton Next. Valve had a Release Candidate for Proton 7.0-6 available in early December 2022, with it now moving to Proton Next. This makes it easier to test, as you can set games to use Proton Next to test, which won't mess with any on the current main Proton release which is 7.0-5.</p>
<p>With Proton Next (7.0-6) these are newly playable:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gotham Knights.</li>
<li>UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection.</li>

<li>Super Arcade Racing.</li>
<li>Crazy Machines 3.</li>
<li>King under the Mountain.</li>
<li>NinNinDays2.</li>
<li>雀姬 (Mahjong ladies).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All the fixes in Proton Next (7.0-6):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Septerra Core hanging on redistributables installation.</li>
<li>Fix Persona 5 Royal crashing when creating game save data.</li>
<li>Fix Vampire Survivors intermittent error message.</li>
<li>Fix Super House of Dead Ninjas, Enemy Mind, and Out There Somewhere frame hitching every few seconds.</li>
<li>Fix Zeepkist freezing when using controller.</li>
<li>Fix Overcooked! All You Can Eat being unable to add a second controller-using player.</li>
<li>Fix Quake III: Arena and Quake III: Team Arena displaying weird texture over the menu.</li>
<li>Fix the new EA launcher displaying a blank window.</li>
<li>Fix Marvel Snap not being able connect to online services.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator crashing during longer flights.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator not displaying live traffic.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator not starting after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Microsoft Flight Simulator crashing when starting next to big cities.</li>
<li>Fix Sackboy: A Big Adventure failing to start the first time it's launched.</li>
<li>Fix Spyro Reignited Trilogy playing intro video in a wrong language.</li>
<li>Fix Jurassic World Evolution 2 bad performance with recent Proton versions.</li>
<li>Fix multiple monitor support in Project Cars 2 and Project Cars 3.</li>
<li>Fix Korean not being rendered correctly in Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIII launcher.</li>
<li>Fix multiple languages not rendering correctly in Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.</li>
<li>Fix Lost Lands: Dark Overlord, Lost Lands: Dark Lord, Lost Lands: Redemption, and Haunted Hotel: Silent Waters Collector's Edition crashing when trying to set a wallpaper.</li>
<li>Fix video playback regression with Chronos: Before the Ashes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the other improvements in Proton Next (7.0-6):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improve video playback with OUTRIDERS and ToGather: Island.</li>
<li>Update wine-mono to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-7.4.0" target="_blank">7.4.0</a>.</li>
<li>Update dxvk-nvapi to <a href="https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/releases/tag/v0.6" target="_blank">v0.6</a>.</li>

      <title>ASUS stick an OLED display into a controller, Dell want to reinvent it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new real controller from ASUS is on the way with the ROG Raikiri Pro that features an OLED display, plus Dell get weird with the Concept Nyx from CES 2023.</p>
<p>Let's start with the real stuff shall we? ASUS have made the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/controllers/rog-raikiri-pro-model/" target="_blank">ROG Raikiri Pro</a>, while it's for Xbox you know how it goes — Linux ends up supporting it anyway (and Steam Input no doubt will too). This has a built-in OLED display for some reason, with customizable animations, status indicators and more. It can also connect via USB-C, 2.4 GHz RF or Bluetooth, multiple buttons on the back and triggers that can have the triggers with short or full range modes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18168874211673020319gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18168874211673020319gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Could be quite interesting? Although all the special extras would no doubt need someone to come up with a way to do it all on Linux too.</p>
<p>Then we have the really weird with the <a href="https://dell.alienwarearena.com/leveling-up-concept-nyx-with-new-controller-concept-and-game-changing-enhancements/" target="_blank">Dell Concept Nyx</a>. It's not actually a real thing, although they have made and shown off some prototypes at CES. This is not really a controller you would use with a normal PC or even on another console, as it's designed to go along with the whole <a href="https://dell.alienwarearena.com/concept-nyx/" target="_blank">Concept Nyx system</a> which is sort-of like a shared server that does everything for multiple people across different screens.</p>
<p>With the Concept Nyx Game Controller they added a finger print sensor to the middle of it, added dual-thumb scroll wheels to the bottom of it, put some paddles on the back and replaced the D-pad with what they call an Omnipad.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2989209361673021098gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2989209361673021098gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4981465201673021111gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4981465201673021111gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the finger print reader, they suggest it's a way for it to quickly read your print and load everything up. Not exactly wild, since finger print readers exist for PC right now but on a controller to quickly get you into something when sharing the same controller with others? Interesting.</p>
<p>Dell also said they're experiment with "haptics and self-adjusting variable resistance thumb sticks" that can be adjusted to your liking, or be specific to each game. The touch pad sounds a little bit more like what we've seen on the Steam Deck, giving you access to a lot more options that can be configured.</p>
<p>The way they talk about it honestly makes it sound like something from a sci-fi film, with it being able to do entirely unique split-screen modes with each side having a different game and more. Sounds like something that in reality, will never become a real product, at least not any time soon.</p>

      <title>Google open sourced CDC File Transfer from the ashes of Stadia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As Google hover over the nuke from orbit button on Stadia, they're at least releasing some of it as open source like CDC File Transfer.</p>
<p>Noted on their <a href="https://github.com/google/cdc-file-transfer" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>, it's a way for syncing and streaming files from Windows to Linux. The question is: why another way to sync files? There's tons of ways that already exist. Well, they explained that too.</p>
<p>Developers could use scp, but they noted it was "impractical" especially with more people working from home as it "always copies full files". So they made cdc_rsync and cdc_stream to help developers who quickly iterate on games. Something that could potentially be useful for developers checking out stuff on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>CDC RSync is designed for syncing files from Windows to Linux but optimized for existing files possibly being on the end machine. They go into detail on why and how it's different to rsync, including showing it performing better for this specific case because of how they split up files into chunks differently at variable sizes. While CDC Stream is for streaming files from Windows to Linux, they say it's "conceptually" similar to sshfs but "optimized for read speed".</p>
<p><em>For anyone interested in trying it out, they provide release builds for Ubuntu.</em></p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors dev poncle outlines 2023 plans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors, probably the most popular game on Steam Deck that keeps being top of the most played list, is set for a busy 2023.</p>
<p>In an overview post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3637250052875666496" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the developer goes on talk about why the big game engine port upgrade didn't happen last year. Part of that was due to the mobile release, with many full clones appearing "with stolen code, assets, data, progression" that forced their hand. They also struggled to find a partner for the release who liked their non-predatory monetization model for it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aS7JqyHdQQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b0d16ad23a843acd6bd4e927d422e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aS7JqyHdQQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One point they mentioned about the new upcoming game engine port, is that they need to develop a little launcher to let you pick what version to load with what options. Steam Deck was mentioned here as a potential challenge, as they naturally want to keep it working nicely. They <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/vampire-survivors-10-coming-october-20th-seems-a-linux-port-is-still-planned/" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a> this is where a proper new Native Linux port will happen too (it has one now although not advertised and not fully supported).</p>
<p><em>Side-note: if they just want a way to switch between the old and new, Steam has a built-in launch option feature for that.</em></p>
<p>Work continues on the port though, with plenty of things still needed to be done in the new version, and support for the existing game built on JavaScript will continue. Eventually they will fully move everything and everyone to the new version though. One of their big problems seems to be physics, where it behaved very differently so they had to start over on some parts of it.</p>
<p>They also plan to make more content DLC, given how the first had such a great reception and they're also working on things not related to Vampire Survivors now too.</p>

      <title>System Shock remake due to release in March</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios have now set a launch window for System Shock, with it planned to release in March. That's if it doesn't see yet another delay.</p>
<p>Shared in an update on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/3699917" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, they said: "After our return from Gamescom we’ve been hesitant to share anything so as not to spoil any remaining surprises we have in store. However, we’ve picked a few last things to share before our quickly approaching launch window of March, 2023.".</p>
<p>Not the first time of course they've announced something, which they touched on and mentioned how the scope and scale of it has changed and with Prime Matter joining them as publisher it's helped them to focus on  "quality-of-life improvements, bug fixing, and localization support" which are the last steps towards the release. They also said they're "incredibly proud" of what they've done.</p>
<p>In the post they also shared a few more small clips and art.</p>
<p>This was the last full proper teaser from 6 months ago:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n2b1zQkYsyM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/88798b17fd085590a77bb652a5f02089.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n2b1zQkYsyM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As far as I can see, they've still been pretty silent about the Native Linux support that was mentioned on the original crowdfunding campaign. A lot has changed since then though. Hopefully it will work okay in Proton if they're no longer doing that.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shock" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/482400/System_Shock/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Batman Rogue City is a fun looking GZDoom fan game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun retro fan game for you! Batman Rogue City released in December for GZDoom and looks like a criminal-kicking good time. As a fan game, it of course has nothing to do with DC Comics but you know what these big companies can be like, they might get itchy fingers over someone using their names and designs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/batman-rogue-city" target="_blank">Mod DB page</a> doesn't really give it much of a description, but a nice touch is a full PDF manual included with the download that expands on the story and more.</p>
<p>It has over 30 villains and their henchmen, 8 action-packed levels, 8 weapons, and you even get to ride in the Batmobile.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PrRY1t1-6u0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70679834975be1daa5c666781c05cd56.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PrRY1t1-6u0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Think I'm going to have fun with this one…</p>
<p>Seems to work fine on Linux, with the Flatpak version of GZDoom and putting the .pk3 file in the right place running this command launched it just fine:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -file /home/liam/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/BatmodRaycastRCv2.pk3</code></p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta update, plus easy Flatpak updates and more HDR teasing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three fun bits for you today including Steam desktop and Steam Deck Beta updates, an easy way to update third-party Flatpaks on Steam Deck in Gaming Mode and another HDR teaser from Valve.</p>
<p>Here's a video overview going over all of it, with the plain details below the video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZhtK92WNJZs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ac462d68323d110bfeecee053d741557.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZhtK92WNJZs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Firstly, the Beta updates for Steam desktop and Steam Deck starting with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449571615797" target="_blank">Steam Deck Client Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed reboot loop when failing to update a broken Steam install</li>
<li>Changed selected launch option reminder to show three times per user instead of continuing to show every time the user returns to the game details.</li>
<li>Fixed issues w/ digital navigation getting stuck on text boxes when using a physical keyboard</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue viewing the hardware survey web page after submitting results</li>
<li>Added option to turn off controllers when exiting BPM</li>
<li>Implemented Steam Controller dongle pairing</li>
<li>Added controller setting dropdown for controller idle turn off timeout</li>
<li>Prevented launch option reminder from appearing on top of other UI while a game is launching</li>
<li>UI Digital Navigation Key Repeats are faster</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the ThrustMaster eSwap PRO Controller Xbox</li>
<li>Fixed long delay at startup when Razer keyboards are connected</li>
<li>Show controller settings in app properties game for non-Steam games</li>
<li>Fixed crash with games that use "Windows Gaming Input"</li>
<li>Gyro Calibration Rework: Calibration Calculates an anti-drift value as normal, but also records Gyro and Accelerometer noise while stationary, so that Auto Calibration (toggle) is more discerning</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix instances of Steam freezing or crashing in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Fix closing non-steam shortcuts via the overlay when two or more are running.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The desktop Steam Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3653013849007354968" target="_blank">update</a> is largely the same, except for a note about it fixing an issue with "duplicate streaming dialogs appearing on Mac &amp; Linux". However, as shown in my video, the new controller options don't actually show up on Steam Deck, only on desktop PCs.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck owners who have installed third-party software in desktop mode via the Discover app, there's an easy way to get Gaming Mode to run updates for those Flatpak packages using <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> thanks to the Flatpak Updates plugin. How to actually use Decky Loader and the Flatpak Updater plugin is noted in the above video, with the plain instructions on the Decky Loader link. I do love all these plugins — so useful!</p>

<p>Finally, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais gave another teaser on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1611149273894387715/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in regards to HDR support noting: "HDR working on a docked Deck connected to a current-gen LG OLED through HDMI! Again still needs a ton of work but making good progress.", with this shot included:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver v525.78.01 out fixing bugs and supports RTX 4070 Ti</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/198295/en-uk" target="_blank">525.78.01</a> for Linux which includes support for the new RTX 4070 Ti, along with a few select bug fixes. Not that you would want to buy an RTX 4070 Ti, since it's ridiculous for the price.</p>
<p>Apart from supporting the new GPU here's the fixes listed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when using a newer control panel with an older driver.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that prevented the G-SYNC/G-SYNC Compatible Visual Indicator from being displayed when running Vulkan X11 applications.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where usage of VK_KHR_present_id could cause applications to crash with Xid 32 errors.</li>
<li>Fixed excess CPU usage in hybrid graphics configurations where an external display is connected to an NVIDIA discrete GPU and configured as a PRIME Display Offload sink (also known as "Reverse Prime").</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's listed as a stable driver, so you should be fine to upgrade to it. They don't specifically mention the 4070 Ti in the changelog but it's clearly listed in the Supported Products tab on the driver page.</p>
<p><em>Are you looking to get a new GPU soon? If so let me know in the comments what you're going for any why.</em></p>

      <title>PlayStation 3 emulator RPCS3 hits a big milestone with all games now bootable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://rpcs3.net/" target="_blank">RPCS3</a> is a free and open source PlayStation 3 emulator, and they hit a huge milestone for compatibility recently.</p>
<p>While they don't have any recent blog posts, they did take to <a href="https://twitter.com/rpcs3/status/1607123433506177025" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to announce that the "Loadable" category has hit zero games. This means that all games can at least boot up now, although there's still a fair few that will display an image but don't make it past the menus although that list is short too at only 2.56% of the overall library they're tracking. They're also tracking 28.96% noted as only just able to get in-game but have issues preventing them being fully playable (performance, bugs etc).</p>
<p>A long road and emulator development is certainly challenging, great to see it continue on though.</p>
<p>Their latest video from a few months ago showed off MotorStorm Pacific Rift now being playable:</p>

<p>Despite what the likes of Sony, Microsoft, and most notoriously Nintendo think of emulation outside of their own stores (which are often sorely lacking) — it's vital for preservation. </p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress hit nearly half a million sales in December 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress from developer Bay 12 Games and publisher Kitfox Games finally had the Steam release in December 2022, and it seems like it went very well. It's currently sat with an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating from over 15,000 Steam user reviews.</p>
<p>On their official forum where they give out monthly statements, they confirmed in the <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=181050.0" target="_blank">January Report</a> that "the game sold almost half a million copies in December, which is awesome" although they won't have all the specific on it until "mid-February" when all the processing is done.</p>
<p>They do plan to provide a Native Linux version at some point, although it works just fine with Proton right now. They also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3625992251197549466" target="_blank">announced</a> recently that they've hired a second programmer, which is a "historic moment" for the game for someone else to see the code and they're bringing in a long-time member of the DF community for this. In their January Report, they mentioned the newcomer will help towards "bug fixes, ports, and more".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>That's quite a lot to take in and those new desktop X3D have my mouth watering a bit. I only upgraded to a 5800X in the last year, I don't exactly need another upgrade but gosh they sound great. I need a PSU and GPU update next though…</p>
<p><em>Will you be looking to grab any of these? Do let me know in the comments.</em></p>
<p>You can see the full event video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OMxU4BDIm4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7fa64353193f6ade75b6704f39eb167e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OMxU4BDIm4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is also probably a good place to note that AMD have confirmed overheating and thermal throttling issues with their new Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which YouTuber <em>der8auer</em> has been detailing across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Lxydc-3K8" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxaDZ6n2MNo" target="_blank">videos</a>. The issue affects AMD's reference cards, not the ones designed by their partners. The statement AMD released:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are working to determine the root cause of the unexpected throttling experienced by some while using the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics cards made by AMD. Based on our observations to-date, we believe the issue relates to the thermal solution used in the AMD reference design and appears to be present in a limited number of the cards sold. We are committed to solving this issue for impacted cards.</p>

      <title>Indie game character filled platform-battler &#39;Fraymakers&#39; arrives January 18th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a successful Kickstarter back in 2020, Fraymakers is getting set to hit Early Access on January 18th. Developed by McLeodGaming, who also made Super Smash Flash 2, a very popular Smash Bros fangame.</p>
<p>It's going to be launching with 4 playable characters, 20 assists, 5 stages, rollback netcode and their "FrayTools" which will allow people to make extra content for the game like characters, stages and so on for mods. Naturally more will be added officially during Early Access as they plan to have a lot more of everything and they expect it to remain in development for at least two years.</p>
<p>They don't really have an up to date gameplay trailer, although they do have these two from a few months ago that announced certain characters appearing:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hcrdQtIEpgs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce4a2cf36365d18f90d6efa667039ee7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hcrdQtIEpgs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aI5nOiKyI2Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/47b3ee13ea542be1193820e137dfe7e8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aI5nOiKyI2Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to pick up, hard to master</strong> - Fraymakers is designed to be friendly to new players and challenging and expressive for veteran players. You’re going to have a ton of fun whether you want a quick round with your friends or you’re looking to climb the leaderboards.</li>
<li><strong>Rollback Netcode</strong> - If you’ve been part of the fighting game community over the past few years, you know that rollback is the gold standard for fighting game netcode. We’ve prioritized and designed around rollback from the outset of development, meaning that Fraymakers will provide the smoothest possible online experience.</li>
<li><strong>Full Movesets</strong> - With over 80 animations per character, we've skipped nothing! Each character comes complete with every motion and attack you've come to expect from a platform fighter as well as some brand new techniques.</li>
<li><strong>Assists</strong> - Choose from a massive selection of indie characters to unleash an attack, fire a projectile, buff your character, or inflict a special status effect on your foes.</li>
<li><strong>...And Infinite Expandability!</strong> - We designed both the game and our custom content editor to be accessible and powerful. We want the process of creating your own content to be simple and fun. Whether you're a player or a creator, this means that the possibilities are endless.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Beyond All Reason is looking incredible for fans of Total Annihilation / Supreme Commander</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.beyondallreason.info/" target="_blank">Beyond All Reason</a> is an in-development free and open source RTS, based on the <a href="https://springrts.com/" target="_blank">SpringRTS</a> game engine and their latest update showcases just how great it looks.</p>
<p>As a primer: designed for fans of Total Annihilation (1997), Supreme Commander (2007) and Planetary Annihilation (2014). It takes on the legacy of Total Annihilation, being heavily based on Balanced Annihilation (which was originally a total conversion of the Uberhack TA mod) which is a SpringRTS engine game, and the Spring engine started off by just getting Total Annihilation into full 3D so there's a <em>lot</em> of history here. Everything about it has been remade from models to sounds to prevent any copyright issues while retaining the essence of Total Annihilation. Their plan is to <em>eventually</em> release it on Steam.</p>
<p>After a while of silence from the team working on it they've put up a new graphical showcase that includes a brand new lighting system, new textures for one of the factions, improved special effects, an improved ground scarring system to really show the destruction from battles, new death animations for units, a new fog system and the list goes on.

<p>When it finally releases properly, this could end up being one of the greatest free and open source games ever made, it's certainly looking the part and for fans of huge RTS games it's certainly exciting.</p>
<p>After giving it a run today, I have to admit my excitement level of this has just gone through the roof. The level of polish compared to when I last tried it has come along immeasurably. It feels good and it looks pretty incredible too even with a bunch of settings nowhere near the maximum they could be and it runs very smoothly too. You know something is good, when you go to check it works and take a few screenshots and end up going through an entire skirmish battle. The pathfinding still needs some work, with some units just trying to push through others but just — wow.</p>
<p>Some screenshots taken by me today (click them to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14706931672840029gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14706931672840029gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2524979041672839970gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2524979041672839970gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>You can try it right now too with their Alpha+ level downloads (Native Linux support) from either the <a href="https://www.beyondallreason.info/download#How-To-Install" target="_blank">official site</a> or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/info.beyondallreason.bar" target="_blank">Flathub</a>. They're really keeping the classic RTS dream alive here. Don't pass up on this, very playable even though it's not technically release-ready.</p>
<p><strong>Update 05/01/23</strong> - I’ve been enjoying it so much i decided to do a video on it myself on Fedora and a bit in Steam Deck at the end. Have a look:</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the winners of the 2022 Steam Awards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The voting is over and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards" target="_blank">The Steam Awards 2022</a> winners have been announced, so here's a run over each of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Game of the Year: <strong>Elden Ring</strong></li>
<li>VR Games of the Year: <strong>Hitman 3</strong></li>
<li>Labor of Love: <strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></li>
<li>Better with Friends: <strong>Raft</strong></li>
<li>Outstanding Visual Style: <strong>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong></li>
<li>Most Innovative Gameplay: <strong>Stray</strong></li>
<li>Best game you Suck At: <strong>Elden Ring</strong></li>
<li>Best Soundtrack: <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong></li>
<li>Outstanding Story-rich Game: <strong>God of War</strong></li>
<li>Sit back and Relax:<strong> LEGO STAR WARS: The Skywalker Saga</strong></li>
<li>Best game on the go: <strong>Death Stranding Director's Cut</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think of the winners of each category? It's a typical popularity contest, with those that have the biggest names and the most screen-time ending up winning. I definitely don't agree with some of them to be sure, although all the winners are arguably good games anyway.</p>
<p>The one that confuses me is Death Stranding Director's Cut for on the go, as the performance across two different Steam Decks for me is not great. Every BT encounter drops it way below 30, as does open world exploration repeatedly dropping it no matter the settings used.</p>
<p>The Steam Winter Sale 2022 is also still on right now too until January 5, 2023 at 10am PST / 6pm UTC. So you can pick up some of those above with a pretty nice discount.</p>

      <title>Classic 1990s series Catacomb lives on with the CatacombGL source port</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/ArnoAnsems/CatacombGL" target="_blank">CatacombGL</a> is an open source project to run Catacomb 3D (1991), The Catacomb Abyss (1992), The Catacomb Armageddon (1992) and The Catacomb Apocalypse (1993).</p>
<p>Just recently the project had a 0.5.4 Beta release, which is the first to have Native Linux support, along with using the CMake system. It has been tested across Ubuntu, Mint and even on a RaspberryPi.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Main features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Runs native on Windows 7/8/10/11 and Linux.</li>
<li>Hardware accelerated 3D rendering via OpenGL, supporting widescreen resolutions, a customizable field of view and an uncapped frame rate.</li>
<li>Player, projectile and monster movement with floating point precision.</li>
<li>Configurable mouse and keyboard controls.</li>
<li>Supports all four Catacomb 3D games as included in the Catacombs Pack from GOG.com.</li>
<li>Supports The Catacomb Abyss version 1.13 (shareware).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Current limitations as of version 0.5.4:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No support for game controllers.</li>
<li>No backwards compatibility with saved games from the original DOS game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It does require the original games, like a lot of open source game engine re-implementations. You can buy the whole pack legally thanks to <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/catacombs_pack" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4132502901672834103gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Never heard of the series? According to the GOG description: "Catacombs Pack is a fantastic compilation of the classic fantasy FPS series. Step into the shoes of one Pelton Everhail, the greatest of the living wizards. Discover secret, long-forgotten treasure troves as you blast away the walls with your powerful magicks. Explore twisting mazes filled with deadly traps and even deadlier denizens. Face Nemesis and fight for your life and those that depend on you. Enter the Catacombs, if you dare and witness the true roots of the First Person Shooter genre on the PC!"</p>

      <title>Space sci-fi 4x city-builder &#39;Antimatter&#39; gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Antimatter is a crowdfunded upcoming space sci-fi game that mixes together 4x strategy elements with city-building, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure how you would accurately describe this one. The scope of it is just massive and it looks like it's coming together quite nicely. Rather than focusing on graphics, the developer is firmly focusing on the depth of the gameplay. A work of passion from a solo developer that gained only €11,765 on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/geopi/antimatter-a-city-builder-and-4x-game" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> back in 2020.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v211Iv_D2dg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee92f918fcf88b35a580adfcdb63d3e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v211Iv_D2dg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what it will feature includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of systems and planets to explore in a gigantic instantiated galaxy.</li>
<li>A dynamic universe where dozens of factions struggle for power or survival.</li>
<li>Take command of a spaceship, trade, mine, harvest, scavenge, produce and participate in the simulated economy.</li>
<li>Manage an existing city or found a new colony on any planet.</li>
<li>Climb the political ladder of a commercial corporation or a sovereign organisation, or found a new one from scratch.</li>
<li>Interact with AI characters who are living independant and simulated life in the Antimatter universe.</li>
<li>Terraform entire planets by altering their atmospheric compositions.</li>
<li>Fulfil missions for corporations, factions or individuals, or unravel the secrets of this galaxy.</li>
<li>Get involved in the Antimatter Crisis and try to change yourself the course of history.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I just hope the ambition here doesn't end up a little too much for one developer. Even in the trailer it shows off a ridiculous amount of unique things to do in the game. Then again, tiny teams and solo developers have repeatedly managed some incredibly impressive games over the last few years.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1343010/Antimatter/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> and it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>AMD Ray Tracing on Linux gets closer with Mesa enabling specific games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work going into the open source Mesa graphics drivers continues on, with AMD Ray Tracing picking up speed and they're going to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20464" target="_blank">enable</a> Quake II RTX and Doom Eternal support by default now.</p>
<p>Currently you can turn it on manually, but now they're moving to add specific games known to work into a list. These two games are just the start. On the GitLab Merge Request, developer Bas Nieuwenhuizen <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20464#note_1700820" target="_blank">noted</a> in reply to a question on why just these and why not default for all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it is not ready, in particular we're missing Daniel's shader calling work and some more game debugging.<br/>
However, it feels worth it to start enabling some games we know to work, so that people can start playing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work should be available in Mesa 23.0 due later this year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2343847381672832865gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - DOOM Eternal.</em></p>
<p>It's nice to see some more movement on this, as it's been a long time coming for those sticking with the open source Mesa drivers.</p>

      <title>Starbreeze Studios announce PAYDAY 3 for this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Confirmed to be releasing later this year, Starbreeze Studios recently put up a teaser for PAYDAY 3. I'm sure many fans of the previous game will be excited it's back and coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272080/PAYDAY_3/" target="_blank">Steam</a> so even if it's not a Native release it should be easy enough to get going with Proton.</p>
<p>"Step out of retirement back into the life of crime in the shoes of the Payday Gang, the envy of their peers and the nightmare of law-enforcement wherever they go. Several years after the crew’s reign of terror over Washington DC has ended, they assemble once again to deal with the threat that roused them out of early retirement."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ugBDsaEIYog"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7ba97689531a9a82bc9f356c35ebf689.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ugBDsaEIYog" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While they've not announced a date any clearer than "2023", we at least now know it takes place in New York and the developers confirmed it will use Unreal Engine, so the PC release should stay in sync with console versions they're also doing.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti launches January 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Very much as expected, NVIDIA at CES today announced the new NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti to launch on January 5th.</p>
<p>Technically, it's not really a new GPU is it? This is basically what the second model of the RTX 4080 was going to be with 7680 CUDA Cores and 12 GB of GDDR6X, before they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/nvidia-qunlaunchingq-the-rtx-4080-12gb-apparently-4090-ti-cancelled-due-to-melting/" target="_blank">unlaunched it</a>. At least this time it has a better name, and a lower price to match too at $799 / £799.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12171622781672765283gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12171622781672765283gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From what NVIDIA say, it will "max out" a 1440p monitor and it's apparently faster than the RTX 3090 Ti while also using less power. However, keep your pinch of salt at the ready until you see third-party benchmarks as this announcements are always cherry-picking data and NVIDIA don't even go into what settings where used and it's likely also making use of things like DLSS 3.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is what they showed:</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1581245931672765180gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1581245931672765180gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>More on it in their <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-4070-ti/" target="_blank">blog post</a> and the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4070ti/" target="_blank">product page</a>.</p>

      <title>Intel announces 13th Gen mobile processors, plus 65-watt and 35-watt desktop processors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today Intel announced their new lineup on 13th Gen mobile processors including a 24-core beast and additionally some 65-watt and 35-watt desktop processors.</p>
<p>For the mobile processors they're split across three different series from top to bottom: Intel Core H-series focused on the high end, with the Intel Core P-series and U-series focused on thin and light laptops. Below you can see the overview of all the different models that have been announced split across each series, click the images to make them bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19178256401672763505gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19178256401672763505gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/134315291672763507gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/134315291672763507gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14628713201672763507gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14628713201672763507gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13595611291672763508gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13595611291672763508gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They also announced a bunch more desktop processors in 65w and 35w variants completing the lineup for the 13th Gen Intel Core. Below is the overview on each of those. Click the images to make them bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/132342001672763739gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/132342001672763739gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14568012331672763741gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14568012331672763741gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Overall it seems like a pretty solid lineup to compete with what AMD have been cooking up. Nice to see both sides continuing to push out decent processors, and the prices on them seem pretty reasonable too. At $196 for a 10 core CPU (6 P cores, 4 E cores) for the i5-13400F, seems like a good bet for those of you on a budget who don't need an integrated GPU.</p>
<p>Additionally they also announced the Intel Processor N-series aimed at entry-level mainstream uses where you don't need a whole lot of performance. These replace the Intel Pentium and Intel Celeron branding.</p>

      <title>Linux use overtakes macOS on the Stack Overflow Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is a fun statistic, it seems Linux has become a fair bit more popular than macOS on the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-operating-system" target="_blank">Stack Overflow Developer Survey for 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly for the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-popular-technologies-op-sys" target="_blank">2021 data</a>, professional Linux use was at 25.17% and overall Linux use was 25.32%. At the time macOS was at 30.04% for professionals and 25.19% overall. This was from over 80,000 responses.</p>
<p>This year's survey had over 70,000 responses, and the results for 2022 show that 40.23% use Linux for personal use while 39.89% use it as a professional. Personal use for macOS was at 31.07% and professional use at 32.97%.</p>
<p>So it's worth pointing out that while yes Linux use has risen quite a bit above macOS, they also had seemingly less responses on the latest survey. Still interesting enough to highlight though especially with the total responses being a pretty great sample size overall. A fun point here as well though is that the survey also noted that 15% of the respondents use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) personally and 14.34% professionally.</p>
<p>Naturally Windows was on top both years but the gap is getting smaller overall for developers, meanwhile poor old BSD was noted to only have 1.47% personal use and 1.03% professional use.</p>

      <title>Valve dev teases HDR support for Linux Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of people noticed recently than a whole lot of working was going into the <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> project for HDR support, and now a Valve developer has teased trying it out. This has been a long time coming, with work needed to support it across multiple parts of the Linux stack but it's starting to get there now.</p>
<p>For those not aware, Gamescope is a micro-compositor that's used on the Steam Deck to display your games and it can also be used on desktop too. It gives you a whole lot of control over what games are doing, with lots of work from developer Joshua Ashton going in for HDR support.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1610200412854046720" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Linux gaming milestone: with the latest work from Josh Ashton, HDR can now be enabled for real games! Tested it tonight on my AMD desktop with Halo Infinite, Deep Rock Galactic, DEATH STRANDING DC. Very early and will still need some time to bake to be useful to most.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griffais showed these shots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2085823411672742026gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2085823411672742026gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20673519671672742027gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20673519671672742027gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9633386491672742027gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9633386491672742027gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>An increasingly exciting time to be a Linux gaming fan and it looks like 2023 will be the year of HDR. As Griffais said though, there's a lot still to do and this is just the start of it actually working.</p>
<p>On their <a href="https://landofkittens.social/objects/822e33d8-8aad-4977-9f16-33611f27ed1a" target="_blank">Fediverse account</a> developer Joshua Ashton also showed off more of Death Stranding with a HDR Heatmap.</p>

      <title>Latest Steam Survey sees a minor dip for Linux &amp; Steam Deck, still trending nicely overall</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>December 2022 results are in for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> and overall the Linux share is down but the overall trend is still good. Initially the survey results released to some parts that looked off, but Valve seems to have now corrected it.</p>
<p>For December 2022 the Linux share was 1.38%, next to macOS at 2.48% and Windows at 96.15%.</p>
<p>From our own <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> you can see the current trend, which still puts the overall Linux share remaining at a multi-year high but just down from the peak last month. Unless something drastic changes, we're still trending towards possibly seeing 2% by the middle of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19203672791672740605gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19203672791672740605gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Valve are at least finally showing more distributions in their dedicated Linux list, when filtering it over to their Linux page you will now see all these shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 24.07% -1.70%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 11.12% +0.23%<img src="https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.16% -0.21%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.48% +0.66%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.40% -0.32%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.83% +0.12%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21 64 bit 3.67% -0.23%<img src="https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Other 35.28% +1.47%</li>
</ul>
<p>Going by the combined stats, the Steam Deck GPU shows up at 0.33% overall on Steam, so we can still tell that the vast majority of people on Steam Deck are sticking with SteamOS too.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 19: SiNsational</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-18-run-away-and-join-the-circus/" target="_blank">Part 18: Run Away and Join the Circus</a></strong></p>
<p>Given the the company's current focus, the name Hyperion Entertainment seems an odd fit for the modern maintainer of AmigaOS, betraying its earlier status as an Amiga focused video game porting house. Attracted by the apparent success of Loki Software, Hyperion Entertainment also decided to expand into the Linux market, porting three games to the platform. One of their ports, that of <em>SiN</em>, to this day remains from them an elusive Linux exclusive.</p>
<p>Being given only a limited physical release in Europe, the Linux version of <em>SiN</em> is almost impossible to find today, so I would like to thank Nickolas Grigoriadis for supplying me with a copy. First developed by Ritual Entertainment for release in 1998 <em>SiN</em> is an ambitious if adolescent first person shooter with pretensions towards being an immersive sim, with level design that allows for a number of branching paths and a great degree of interactivity.</p>
<p>Adolescent applying to both the content of <em>SiN</em>, with its ridiculous comic book plot carried by the bosom of its femme fatale antagonist, and to how well baked the final product is. Notorious for its bugs <em>SiN</em> can also just feel a bit of a mess, being a headache for completionists with its multiple conflicting objectives. <em>SiN</em> plays more as an overwrought <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> than something like <em>Deus Ex</em>, perhaps unsurprising given the input from the likes of Richard Grey and Charlie Wiederhold.</p>
<p>When the ingredients are fully cooked the game can be compelling, but you have to take the rough with the smooth. This also applies to the quality of the Linux port, with it being mercurial to get working. When I first installed the SiN demo on Red Hat Linux 7.3 it refused to recognize my libGL.so library, but in the year or so since it started working without a hitch. This carried over to when I installed the full version, but I still have no firm idea as to what changed.</p>
<p>SiN also has the most obnoxious retail key and disc checks of any Linux game I have encountered, with it just kicking you to the desktop with an stderr message when starting a new game if the CD-ROM is not mounted. Given how often the game crashed this did not fill me with confidence. In addition, I found that audio clips would cut each other off and would at times be distorted, with the worst offender for this being at the end of the optional "Missile Silo" level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9322435051670625057gol6.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9322435051670625057gol6.jpg"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11576918371670625283gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11576918371670625283gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>How much these problems had to do with the Linux port or the nature of <em>SiN</em> itself remains unclear, although I suspect it to be a combination of both. I found myself stuck for a time in that same level as it is the only instance in the whole campaign where the unadvertised inventory screen, accessible with the F11 key, is required in order to progress. <em>SiN</em> develops a habit of putting hurdles in your way, as an even more significant roadblock would arise from my going off the beaten path.</p>
<p>Since I had opted to destroy all the pumps in the optional "Geothermal Plant" level, this breaks the scripting when you are forced to go through the "Biomass Reclamation Center" later in the game, causing Darwin Chamber 3 in "Area 57" not to be accessible. Thankfully a fan patch exists to fix this specific issue, as otherwise I would have been forced to cheat, or load up a previous save and use the alternative path through the "Hidden Docks" instead.</p>
<p>This was followed by the next level "Xenomorphic Laboratory" producing broken save files, but once I got past this things proceeded fine up until the penultimate "Munt Phoenix" level. Here the scripting broke again, with the enemies standing stock still instead of attacking me, and mission critical items not spawning in. This I could resolve by just restarting the level, letting me go on to defeat the final boss, although the final MPEG cutscene aborted after a few seconds.</p>
<p>Performance wise Windows 98 averaged 40.7 FPS compared to 33.1 FPS under Linux using High settings, with both versions benefiting from turning Tessellation and Dynamic Lighting off. Doing so brought the Linux average up to 37.3 FPS, although this was still dwarfed by the 51.2 FPS seen on Windows 98 with the same settings. Windows benefits too by having access to the more polished <em>Wages of Sin</em> mission pack, which sadly was never ported over to Linux.</p>
<p>SiN would also later be adapted into an animated film, the inverse of what gave us the software I am to cover next. Plenty of games released for Linux could be considered adolescent or even childish, but software designed with actual children in mind can be few and far between, at least in the commercial or retail space. Time for some family friendly entertainment, even if I do come away from the experience questioning the sincerity of the publisher's intentions.</p>

      <title>What I want to see in 2023 for Linux, Gaming, Steam Deck and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The end of a year is a good time to sit, think and reflect on what a year it has been and what we hope 2023 will bring so here's some of what I want and what I think could happen.</p>
<p>I actually wrote a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">wishlist for the Steam Deck back in October</a>, and funnily enough pretty much every single point there is still valid right now. Some points have had minor work but most of it hasn't been touched. I hope Valve are reading, because all of those points are what I regularly see people moan and gripe about too.</p>
<p>What else though for the wider picture?</p>
<p>- <strong>Neon Prime</strong>. Come on Valve, we need a new game from you. A proper one, not another (while very cool) Aperture Desk Job. We had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/" target="_blank">trademark registration for Neon Prime</a> and leaker / data miner Tyler McVicker thinks it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/neon-prime-from-valve-is-reportedly-a-third-person-shooter-close-to-release/" target="_blank">close to release</a>. What the heck is it? I'm overly keen to find out. With good cross-platform support across Linux desktop, Steam Deck and Windows it could be an easy hit if it's a good multiplayer game like it's expected to be.</p>
<p>- For publishers to actually stop forcing <strong>Launchers</strong> on us. Don't make me beg. Have you ever met someone who said "heck yeah, the EA App!" or "oh lovely, the 2K launcher" in any kind of serious way? No you haven't — no one has. They almost always add <em>nothing</em> of value, break things constantly (not just on Linux / Steam Deck) and they're just a great big nuisance. I would like for them to just go away, forever. Throw them in the bin. Get them in the sea, just far away from me.</p>
<p>- <strong>Valve Deckard</strong>. We know from a lot of details going out, that Valve seem to be working <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/looks-like-valve-are-gearing-up-for-a-new-vr-headset/" target="_blank">on a new VR HMD</a>, one that should be both portable and able to connect up to a PC. It will likely run Linux for the portable mode, hence all their work on Linux (not just for Steam Deck). Gimme. Seriously. The Valve Index is great, but it's also overly bulky and really Valve haven't actually done all that much with it, especially on the Linux side where they've seemingly <em>ignored</em> Index support for some time now and the experience is less than stellar. I have high hopes that the Deckard will be a big improvement in many ways.</p>
<p>- <strong>Steam Deck Refresh</strong>. Look, the Steam Deck is fantastic overall but it could be better. It's not time yet for a Steam Deck 2, Valve said it themselves that they want to keep the main internals (CPU/GPU) the same to have a good point for developers and gamers but they want to focus on the screen and battery life. So do it. Towards the end of 2023, I would be surprised if we didn't have a confirmation that a nice refresh was on the way for this. The battery life being the biggest gripe people seem to talk about would hopefully get wiped off the table. Having it a bit lighter somehow would be another great bit to focus on, to prevent that hand / wrist strain from longer sessions. I hope Valve keep focusing on improving the Steam Deck, and not entertain the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-steam-deck-really-doesnt-need-exclusives/" target="_blank">ridiculous idea of exclusive games</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>Half-Life 3, Portal 3</strong>. I can dream can't I? Half-Life: Alyx was a true return to form for Valve games, and one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had but I want more! I need to find out what happens after [redacted]. Portal 3 would also be another great one, with the first two being some of my favourite puzzles games and even their own writers <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/erik-wolpaw-to-valve-on-portal-3-we-should-just-do-it/" target="_blank">want to do a third</a>.</p>
<p>- <strong>SteamOS 3</strong> public release. Perhaps another big turning point for Linux and Linux Gaming as a whole? I get comments asking me for info on this daily (no I really don't know). The Steam Deck has turned a great many heads to just how powerful and good Linux can be as a platform, and now it seems many more people want to try it but they're waiting for SteamOS 3 to be released. While I think people would be better off sticking to a proper desktop Linux distribution (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-best-linux-distribution-for-gaming-in-2023/" target="_blank">like Ubuntu</a>), SteamOS 3 on desktop could actually be quite interesting to see, and with it then being available to more hardware vendors, we could see a true explosion in gaming devices shipping with Linux. 2022 was the year of Linux Gaming thanks to the Steam Deck, perhaps 2023 will truly be the year of Linux on the desktop?</p>
<p>- More <strong>Linux Hardware Releases</strong>. The Steam Deck is great but we need <u>more</u>, and not just from Valve. More hardware shipping with Linux on it out of the box and properly supported. I've said time and time again, this is what we <em>need</em> to push Linux forward. You can have the best distributions around, the slickest desktop environments, it can truly send Windows packing but it's largely useless if it's not out there in the face of the masses on hardware. It needs to be an oven ready deal; people just need to get it and turn it on.</p>
<p>- For <strong>Linux to break 3%</strong> on the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey. I don't actually think this one is too big of an ask. It's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">trending towards</a> 2% by the middle of 2023, thanks to the Steam Deck shipping with SteamOS.</p>
<p>- <strong>Anti-cheat woes</strong>. We already have <em>Easy Anti-Cheat</em> and <em>BattlEye</em> supporting Linux and Proton (and so Steam Deck too), so it's largely down to game developers to hook up support and many just haven't bothered to do so. There's issues developers and publishers need to think on of course, like opening up a multiplayer game to more platforms that could <em>potentially</em> bring in more cheaters. Both Linux desktop and Steam Deck are a growing market (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/novembers-steam-survey-shows-another-uptick-for-linux-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">#2</a>) of players, that I truly hope the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-deck-now-shipping-across-asia-plus-a-new-steam-deck-stable-client-update/" target="_blank">Steam Deck's expansion into Asia</a> becomes a turning point on this so that it can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>- More open source from <strong>NVIDIA</strong>. In 2022 we had quite a surprise, with NVIDIA <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">opening up their kernel modules</a> and it would be great to see even more like this. They've made a good start and I hope to see them keep pushing. NVIDIA proprietary drivers are a constant nuisance and source of many annoyances for me over the past few years. I would already be on an AMD GPU by now, if <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1603073266364579842" target="_blank">OverclockersUK didn't oversell</a> at the 7900 XTX launch.</p>
<p>- <strong>GOG Galaxy</strong> and <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> on Linux — officially. Yeah yeah, Steam is great and all but options are better for consumers as a whole. Wine / Proton development has helped firmly bridge the gap of getting games working on Linux, now we need the other stores to follow along but this is the biggest ask, much more of a dream than any of the previous.</p>

      <title>Beware of scam Steam Deck and Steam Account stores (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It came to my attention recently that there's a website out there selling different models of the Steam Deck, at a discount, along with Steam Accounts. Don't fall for the trap like accessory maker <a href="https://jsaux.com/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> did.</p>
<p>This SteamDeck.info (it's not a link on purpose) website popped up on my feeds recently, and it was raising some clear red flags. Made even worse today, because accessory maker JSAUX partnered up with this "company" to authorise them to sell JSAUX products. JSAUX clearly not doing any basic background checks here before announcing anything.</p>
<p>Quite a number of issues appear even on a very basic 2 minute check of this Steam Deck and Steam game store. For starters, it's only existed since October. They sell Steam Accounts with games and Steam Gifts (where you need to add them as a friend on Steam) — both of which are expressly forbidden by Valve and can get you completely banned on Steam. It comes across as an official company store using the Steam Deck name (trademarked by Valve) but there's no company number, their registered address is incomplete pointing to a luxury apartment complex, they have a discount on the Steam Deck that Valve don't even have, they listed out of stock "Limited Edition" models (no such thing exists) and so on. How do they do it? If you read carefully, they claim they buy it all with their own Steam account — I don't think I need to explain how bad this is.</p>
<p>More in the video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wKZ3k2zutBo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d12ccf64e60e20ed16732dc398828353.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wKZ3k2zutBo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You might think this is obvious and no PSA (public service announcement) is needed, but other consoles can be easily purchased officially online from a great many places. It's easy to see why some might fall for this, especially with even a very small discount to entice people in. There's nothing wrong with reselling if it's clear, but everything else is incredibly shady.</p>
<p><strong>Update 31/12/2022</strong>: the steamdeck . info store sent a defamation complaint to YouTube, so my video on it is currently blocked in the UK (mirrored on <a href="https://tilvids.com/w/sx3oWxzUqQeHDe3pjmfH9k" target="_blank">TILVids</a>). I am currently fighting to get it restored. They've also begun wiping any trace of some of the more dubious things they were selling on the store like Steam Accounts as they're trying to hide it.</p>
<p><strong>Update 02/01/2023</strong>: YouTube denied the request to have it put back, so my video is staying blocked in the UK. The story on this store only gets weirder too and more suspect. In an email to me, the store claimed they purchased Steam Decks with local Gift Cards but on their own Reddit account they linked to screenshots (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2901008893" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2901008952" target="_blank">#2</a>) of their Steam purchase history showing they actually buy a bunch of USD gifts. According to <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/78E3-7431-1E88-AD59" target="_blank">Valve's</a> own details, accounts are supposed to be locked to the local currency. </p>

      <title>Some of the best Steam Deck games in 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's my own take on a top list of games to check out for <strong>Steam Deck</strong> that were released in some form in 2022, or had a <em>major</em> update to improve them.</p>
<p>These lists are highly subjective of course, and I'm not going to throw in anything I haven't actually personally played just because it's a "big" game. These are my picks, games I know work well and are enjoyable and I think you should absolutely pick them all up and play them through.</p>
<p><em>Consider this my 2022 year-ending list of Steam Deck essentials!</em></p>
<h3><strong>Brotato</strong></h3>
<p>You know the drill with Vampire Survivor-likes by now I'm sure, this surge of horde games is never ending but Brotato has many things that make it just fantastic. I can't sing its praises enough it's even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/my-game-of-the-year-2022-is-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">my own personal GOTY</a>. Technically it hasn't "released" but it's in Early Access and fully playable. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Brotato is a top-down arena shooter roguelite where you play a potato wielding up to 6 weapons at a time to fight off hordes of aliens. Choose from a variety of traits and items to create unique builds and survive until help arrives."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="727NFQkdMBU?rel=0&amp;start=0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf4ed8ef1d3451cd2081130c14178320.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/727NFQkdMBU?rel=0&amp;start=0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Chained Echoes</strong></h3>
<p>Only just beaten by my love of Brotato is the retro-inspired RPG Chained Echoes, which is close to perfection when it comes to these sorts of games. Blending together a world where dragons are as common as piloted mechanical suits. This is a great one to cosy up with on a cold night. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ir0Rr_64S6A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/953adbf2cb4354ea895526b008e42584.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ir0Rr_64S6A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Spider-Man Remastered &amp; Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong></h3>
<p>Two for one here. Both of them being some of the best Marvel super hero action you can find on any platform. I cannot overstate just how much fun it is swinging around, and beating up some bad guys like this in an open world while levelling up and unlocking new abilities. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/marvels-spiderman-remastered?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Spider-Man Remastered Humble Link</a> - <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/marvels-spiderman-miles-morales?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Spider-Man: Miles Morales Humble Link</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iV1eLjqn1lE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f584a37fb48812cbd8698fe1abf16903.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iV1eLjqn1lE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O4rYKT-hqt0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c5df9f18a3a4fc449aa1c813161c3b1f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O4rYKT-hqt0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h3>
<p>Not released during 2022 but it did have quite a massive update, one that helped performance on Steam Deck quite dramatically too with the inclusion of AMD FSR 2.1 that has a much clearer picture quality than the previous versions of FSR. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wvuDVGMPQNk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0f6152dd1ebf46b81bae8f7d13ad55b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wvuDVGMPQNk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Crysis Remastered Series</strong></h3>
<p>Ah but can it run Crysis? Yes, all three of them in fact. Gain a powerful super-suit and deal with an alien invasion. Starting off on an island, moving onto a world ravaged by climate disasters and then a transformed New York City.</p>
<p>Still one of the best shooter series to play through, and the performance on Steam Deck is a genuine surprise. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/28590/_Crysis_Remastered_Trilogy/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Boneraiser Minions</strong></h3>
<p>I got a little bit obsessed with this one when first discovering it. Much like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and others, it has that easy to get into feel that helps the hours just vanish in what feels like an instant. Technically not released since it's in Early Access but you get the idea. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1944570/Boneraiser_Minions/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Amass an army of deamonic undead to fight endless waves of heroes intent to end your boneraising ways! In this gothic-horror auto-battle roguelite, use the bones of slain heroes to raise your minions, collect powerful relics and spells, and unlock meta upgrades, all to survive King Gigald's crusade!"</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Stray</strong></h3>
<p>Kitty! *ahem*, look it's a game about running around as a Cat where you can knock stuff off of things, scratch things and I'm sure for many of you the description doesn't need to go further than that. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Lost, alone and separated from family, a stray cat must untangle an ancient mystery to escape a long-forgotten cybercity and find their way home."</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE</strong></h3>
<p>Another previously exclusive PlayStation title. A remake of an absolute classic, with some truly gorgeous looking scenes and intense action. I can see why many of my friends were ranting and raving about it when it initially released, and it's a really surprising experience on Steam Deck, especially given the level of details in the graphics too. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Cloud Strife, an ex-SOLDIER operative, descends on the mako-powered city of Midgar. The world of the timeless classic FINAL FANTASY VII is reborn, using cutting-edge graphics technology, a new battle system and an additional adventure featuring Yuffie Kisaragi."</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>ELDEN RING</strong></h3>
<p>It's tough as hell and will keep you going for some time, with a world that needs you to do some very careful exploration. Die, die again, and again and — just me? Okay, I'm terrible at it, but the world and the creature design really is quite something. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/elden-ring?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Rise, Tarnished, and be guided by grace to brandish the power of the Elden Ring and become an Elden Lord in the Lands Between."</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>UNCHARTED™: Legacy of Thieves Collection</strong></h3>
<p>Sony repeatedly smashing it through 2022 with multiple releases, who can forget UNCHARTED? <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Play as Nathan Drake and Chloe Frazer in their own standalone adventures as they confront their pasts and forge their own legacies. This game includes the critically acclaimed single-player stories from both UNCHARTED 4: A Thief’s End and UNCHARTED: The Lost Legacy."</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>No Man's Sky</strong></h3>
<p>I am a space-nerd. If it's sci-fi and space involved, I'm there. No Man's Sky started off life pretty poorly but it's a good example of a developer who really loves their work, and wants to do right. It's repeatedly had HUGE updates, completely changing parts of the game to be bigger and better and they just haven't stopped. They also made multiple Steam Deck improvements directly. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/no-mans-sky?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Inspired by the adventure and imagination that we love from classic science-fiction, No Man's Sky presents you with a galaxy to explore, filled with unique planets and lifeforms, and constant danger and action."</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>High On Life</strong></h3>
<p>Probably one of if not the single funniest game I played all year. The comedy of it is an acquired taste, you need to appreciate the voices of Justin Roiland, along with the incredibly crass dark humour of it as it really doesn't hold back on anything. <u>A big warning though</u>: no cloud saves, that almost stopped me including it because it's frankly ridiculous for a game release in 2022 not to have Steam Cloud saving but I enjoyed it too much not to include it. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/high-on-life?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Humanity is being threatened by an alien cartel who wants to use them as drugs. It’s up to you to rescue and partner with charismatic, talking guns, take down Garmantuous and his gang, and save the world!"</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Deep Rock Galactic</strong></h3>
<p>Another not released in 2022, but it had some pretty <u>huge</u> upgrades and for such an intense game, it can work very nicely on the Steam Deck and it's easily one of the <em>best</em> co-op shooters <em>ever</em> made. A game I will never get tired of playing with the GamingOnLinux community. With every mission giving a different map, aliens coming out of the god damn walls and plenty of laughs to be had. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/deep-rock-galactic?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>.</p>
<p>"Deep Rock Galactic is a 1-4 player co-op FPS featuring badass space Dwarves, 100% destructible environments, procedurally-generated caves, and endless hordes of alien monsters. Work together as a team to dig, explore, and fight your way through a massive cave system filled with hordes of deadly enemies and valuable resources. You will need to rely on your teammates if you want to survive the most hostile cave systems in the galaxy!"</p>

<hr/>
<p>I'm going to give <strong>Death Stranding Director's Cut</strong> (<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/death-stranding-directors-cut?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store Link</a>) an honourable mention too. If I didn't encounter weird frame-drops during BT encounters and exploring the open world (causing me to play it via Remote Play instead), it would be <em>very</em> high up on the list. Plenty of people seem to play it fine though, it's weird how for some games even on the same hardware they perform differently.</p>
<p>I'm also going to give the upgraded <strong>Selaco</strong> demo (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" target="_blank">Steam Link</a>) an honourable upcoming game mention, because it deserves to be mentioned whenever I possibly can. I have a feeling it could be very high up on my GOTY list for 2023. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck OS update fixes factory reset, Forza Horizon 5 OS update in Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released two small updates to the Steam Deck OS (SteamOS) and here's what's new and improved.</p>
<p>Firstly, they've released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449543514487" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4.4</a> which fixes an issue where a factory reset could cause the device to get stuck in an update loop. That's a bit of a woops, quite a huge one really, since that's supposed to be one of the last resorts to fix problems on Steam Deck.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449543530901" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4.5</a> is also now in Preview, which includes the above change and also fixes a focus issue with Forza Horizon 5. That was originally in 3.4.3 Preview, but re-released as 3.4.5 when 3.4.4 went out above for the emergency factory reset fix, so clearly they're not yet ready for the Forza Horizon 5 issue fix to be in stable (I assume because the fix might affect other games and needs more testing time).</p>
<p>Valve had quite a few problems with the roll-out of SteamOS 3.4, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steamos-34-is-out-now-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">was a pretty big update</a>, like SD Cards moving location with no real notice and HDMI / DisplayPort audio issues so hopefully they will take on some lessons from the release to make SteamOS 3.5 a bit smoother. </p>
<p>I did have a weird one recently with sleep / wake. One of my Steam Decks would wake up by itself, and it happened multiple times in a row. Had to fully shut it down for a while to make it stop doing it — annoying, and I'm <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/1/3727323242811082424/" target="_blank">not alone</a> with this bug. It somewhat reminds me of my PlayStation 4, which repeatedly woke up and spat discs out in the middle of the night, until I physically ripped out the eject button after Sony failed to fix the problem.</p>

      <title>I&#39;m now officially converted to the RGB LED religion and OpenRGB is amazing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this wasn't what you were expecting to read was it? After years laughing about people who go over the top with RGB lighting in their PCs I am now a convert.</p>
<p>I've never really been into the hardware customization side of PCs but I think that's about to change. All it took was a good PC case I wanted to do more with and now I want to see how far I can push things. I want people to walk into my office and be blinded by the power of my PC. <em>Something like that anyway.</em></p>
<p>You see, recently I picked up the <a href="https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/torrent/torrent/black-tg-dark-tint/" target="_blank">Fractal Design Torrent</a> PC case, and I did a successful transplant. The operation was a complete success, although touch and go for a moment with a few bits of sweat and some tears, IT LIVES! Two annoyances though: the first being the spacing between where you connect up the SSDs and the mass of wires coming down the back from the front panel, and needing some completely flat SATA power connectors for the HDDs (I have a lot of drives).</p>
<p>It truly is an absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> case, a recommendation from the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a> and I couldn't be happier with the result.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16004977651672246039gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16004977651672246039gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now I have a nice case, and the inside looks pretty tidy with glass panels to see into both sides of the machine — I thought "why stop there?". So, doing something I never thought I would, I shopped around for some colourful additions to place inside the case. </p>
<p>I ended up going for the <a href="https://specluxs.com/collections/pc-strip-lights/products/led-argb-pc-strip-lights" target="_blank">Addressable Speclux LED Strip Light</a>. Cheap and cheerful for my intro into the world of RGB lighting. A great decision too as it turns out, because even though it's cheap and I only have two strips, I'm just a little bit more in love with my PC now. Thanks to this, my rather dull office has been lit up and I can suddenly see why people like RGB LEDs so much (and just RGB lighting in general), because it really does give you a little extra spark of happiness and that should never be underestimated. </p>
<p>Thanks to my motherboard having a connector for RGB lights, I plugged it in there and stuck the strips into my case and when powering on my case came to life. I'm all excited about it for another reason though, a fun bit of open source software called <a href="https://openrgb.org/" target="_blank">OpenRGB</a>. Regular readers have probably seen it, because I've written about it a few times now but never really used it properly myself — until now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18537085491672246602gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18537085491672246602gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>With OpenRGB you can control the lighting on many different devices, and it works very nicely. My surprise here again though is that directly from my Linux desktop with OpenRGB, I can change each individual LED to a different colour, set up profiles, effects and more. Gosh, I love open source developers doing amazing stuff like this.</p>
<p>So now I have a good case, and it looks awesome. Bring on the rainbow.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12572794611672246940gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12572794611672246940gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p><em>I can happily recommend both the case and the lights.</em></p>
<p>I wonder what else I can do to make it even more ridiculous. What do you suggest? Have you set up your gaming rig with some cool lighting? Let me know all your thoughts in the comments. Show me your rig.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 7,000 games either Verified or Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Closing in nicely on the big 10K, the Steam Deck gaming handheld from Valve has hit over 7,000 games noted to be Playable or Verified. The figure was hit a few days ago.</p>
<p>As things stand at time of writing the numbers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 2,709</li>
<li>Playable - 4,409</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2,469</li>
</ul>
<p>Numbers taken from <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which also includes unlisted titles that had their store page and purchasing removed from Steam, but players will still have in their library and be able to play.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that these are only what has been tested. The real number of playable games is much much higher. Valve don't limit what you can install; that's entirely up to you. Deck Verified is simply a case of "these were actually tested somehow".</p>
<p>While Valve's Deck Verified system isn't perfect, and I have my own gripes with it, the vast majority of games do actually have the correct rating and it's a good measure to go on.</p>
<p>Some of the notable games that became either Playable or Verified during December include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a></li>

<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1210320/Potion_Craft_Alchemist_Simulator/" target="_blank">Potion Craft: Alchemist Simulator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of really great games keep getting released on Steam, the hardest part is actually picking something to play and clearly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-steam-deck-really-doesnt-need-exclusives/" target="_blank">we don't need exclusives</a>.</p>

      <title>The Steam Deck really doesn&#39;t need exclusives</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now and then the exclusive game discussion pops up, because someone thinks it would be a good idea to lock games to a platform. Here we go again.</p>
<p>This time the culprit is PCGamesN in <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-deck/needs-exclusives" target="_blank">an article</a> titled "The Steam Deck is missing an important element – exclusives". Respectfully, I thoroughly disagree and think exclusive games are ludicrous and anti-consumer due to the very nature of them being exclusionary.</p>
<p>While their article touches on an important bit: games taking better advantage of the Steam Deck uniqueness directly, and personally I do think developers should spend a little more time ensuring gamepad support is top-quality at release, along with text and UI scaling at a minimum — exclusives are just <u>bad</u> and I don't want them on Steam Deck. Valve developers clearly <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1607837890981302277" target="_blank">feel similarly</a>.</p>
<p>Here's my full reply on the subject:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iEl36P7Wn6o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa304391b010cb816d2507470e74b3d8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iEl36P7Wn6o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>If you can't currently watch the video above here's the gist of it:</em></p>
<p>The Steam Deck is built on an open platform, with tons of open source and Valve pays a ton of open source developers. It’s not locked to anything, has a full desktop mode and you can install stuff from other stores. Heck you can even throw Windows on it if you really want to.</p>
<p>The only reason for exclusives is to pull people away from other platforms and try to lock them in, exclusives are anti-consumer. Look at what Epic games do, it’s to pull people directly away from Steam. Sony does it with their exclusives to pull people away from Xbox, Microsoft is going to do it with Bethesda and Activision Blizzard to pull people away from PlayStation and you get the idea.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck presents some of the best elements of a PC as a platform being so open, in handheld form. Why the hell would we want to bring over some of the worst parts of traditional consoles to it?</p>
<p>Exclusives aren’t good for gamers, by their very nature they’re exclusionary. No one should want them or celebrate them. Games are a form of art, we should want <em>more</em> people to be able to appreciate them. Oh, you don’t have a Steam Deck or can’t afford one? Well that’s a shame you can’t play exclusive game X or Y ya a <em>loser</em>. Can you imagine that? Oh I can, fanboys can be really terrible and I don’t want to hear that about it.</p>
<p>What we should do is <strong>celebrate</strong> things like Microsoft, Sony and more being on Steam and putting previously exclusive games up for more people that way, not the opposite.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is doing well too. We know from a good while ago it hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">over a million</a> shipped, and that’s well before the expansion into Asia. It doesn’t need exclusives. It already has a decent amount of power at an affordable price, along with a well established company backing it. Reviews are still flowing in from all angles across web articles and YouTube of more people getting it and singing its praises.</p>
<p>I can’t help but laugh in a way. Valve presents an open platform, and some come along and want something locked to it. Seems so senseless. It feels like console fanboy zealot level thinking.</p>
<p>Even crazier still is what the Steam Deck represents: an extension of the PC platform. Why would we want a Steam Deck exclusive game? Part of the point is a portable library that you can swap between your PC and your Steam Deck for. It kills such a wonderful part of what makes it great. While that aspect of it is not something everyone will make use of as not everyone has a gaming PC, it is a selling point still and a good one, it would ruin a whole lot of goodwill I imagine for Valve too. Even their little example game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902490/Aperture_Desk_Job/" target="_blank">Aperture Desk Job</a> works outside of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>So no, the Steam Deck doesn’t need exclusives or any special games. I’ll disagree until the end of time with anyone trying to get others to entertain such an absurd idea.</p>
<p>What it <strong>does</strong> need is different: A little more attention from developers would be welcome for the uniqueness it offers but let’s not go down the exclusive road. Ensuring gamepad controls on PC work properly at release, testing on smaller screen sizes and resolutions for text clarity, along with text and UI scaling controls at minimum is what we should want and what reviewers need to look at — the kinds of things that make a game go from rough to great on Steam Deck and improve them for everyone on PC too regardless of Linux or Windows there. I’ve lost count of the amount of times I found text on a PC game too small with no way to scale it up, it’s worse again for the Steam Deck. I want to see a lot more attention there.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck and the open nature of it helped me fall in love with gaming all over again. I have games from Steam, Epic, GOG, emulators, cloud gaming and more on mine. Let’s not try and break apart the very foundation it’s been built upon.</p>
<p><em>Anyway that’s what I think, what do you think?</em></p>

      <title>Xbox Game Studios talk more of their titles on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/3090835/view/3644006649705636592" target="_blank">third time</a>, Xbox Game Studios have talked up about their games on the Steam Deck and what compatibility to expect for it.</p>
<p>It's nice to see, especially for people who aren't constantly following Steam Deck compatibility news for publishers to do their own little round-up like this. The Steam Winter Sale is ongoing too, so perhaps you'll see something you might like to grab during the sale.</p>
<p>Here's what they listed along with the current discounts:</p>
<p><strong>Deck Verified</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/" target="_blank">DOOM Eternal</a> - 75% off</li>

</ul>
<p>Something I will point out though, that other news sites seem to get confused on: this is <u>not</u> Xbox Game Studios noting any kind of official support for Steam Deck. The compatibility reports are run by Valve, and most developers don't actually make any changes for Steam Deck with the majority of games running through the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> compatibility layer.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a>, the very useful installer app to get different compatibility layers on Steam Deck and Linux desktop, has version 2.7.7 up adding in new tools. This is one of those applications that just keeps on getting better all the time, something to keep in the toolbox ready for when you need it.</p>
<p>It allows you to install the likes of GE-Proton, Wine-GE, Luxtorpeda and much more inside Steam, Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and so on.</p>
<p>Version 2.7.7 adds in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the <a href="https://github.com/cyrv6737/NorthstarProton" target="_blank">NorthstarProton</a> compatibility tool.</li>

      <title>Bots Are Stupid is an ultra-precise programming-platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for a challenge and love programming? Well it seems that Bots Are Stupid might be a good fit for you. An ultra-precise platformer where you don't directly control things — what could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>The developer said to think of it a bit like Mario Maker meets coding. I must admit, it sounds pretty fun. With 40 challenging ready-made levels, plus the ability to make and share your own levels to twist the brains of others. It's not just a case of making them move around, you also have to deal with grappling hooks, speed boosters and all sorts of obstacles that will crush your little bots into tiny pieces.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cwvtE_-uYBk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63470fca35c7137d2db251cdafefbac7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cwvtE_-uYBk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 40 uniquely challenging platformer levels.</li>
<li>Endless challenges and puzzles thanks to the game’s inbuilt level editor and level sharing.</li>
<li>Levels feature additional mechanics such as grappling hook, speed boosters, conveyor belts and more.</li>
<li>The bots follow your orders to the letter, no matter how stupid they are.</li>
<li>Infinite supply of bots!</li>
</ul>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1578160/Bots_Are_Stupid/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with Native Linux support and there's even a demo.</p>

      <title>Steam Replay gives you an overview of your 2022 gaming habits</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/" target="_blank">Steam Replay</a> is Valve's new highlight page going over a bunch of fun stats about your gaming year, something made popular by the likes of Spotify Wrapped and similar events from numerous other places.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7195598241672076962gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It's actually quite a fun bit of info and you can set your own page public to send it to others too. I'm not going to because mine is a little embarrassing in some ways. It gives you a look over how many new games you played, what platforms your played on, the games you put the most time into, the biggest genres you played, how much time you used keyboard + mouse or gamepad, your top VR games, your longest gaming streak and so on. So you can find out fun details like 9% of your total playtime being in Deep Rock Galactic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3101348871672076754gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Steam Replay takes data between January 1st and December 14th 2022, and does <em>not</em> include any offline mode play, which explains why some of mine are a lot lower than I expected. I put myself in offline mode a lot, otherwise I end up getting spammed with messages a bit <em>too</em> much about new games.</p>
<p>The page certainly needs some work to view on the desktop though, it's clearly a mobile-first design and looks a little bit too massive on desktop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18612200281672076308gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I'm actually surprised my plain "Linux" (desktop) time was still so big, then again it probably shouldn't surprise me since I test a lot of games for GamingOnLinux directly across my desktop and Steam Deck. Plus I use Remote Play too so there's that.</p>
<p>You even get a nice collage of all the games you played too. No surprise to see Vampire Survivors in my top list there, that game was very difficult to put down after initially getting into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17698610581672077400gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Feel free to share yours in the comments.</p>
<p>Valve also sent out a press email about it and made another silly trailer:</p>

      <title>Happy Holidays &amp; Merry Christmas from GamingOnLinux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some of you might have noticed over December our little friendly Penguin logo gained a fancy hat to keep warm, it's that time of the year again.</p>
<p>Time for GamingOnLinux to slow right down to a crawl, so that I can get some personal time off too. So don't be alarmed if you see <em>nothing</em> or just very few here and there (outside of bigger stuff — if any) for a week+ or so, as we all deserve a little time off for the holidays right? Time to blow off some steam and get refreshed ready for another year of news and exciting developments for Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck, gaming, industry news, open source and everything else that is covered here.</p>
<p>2022 has been quite a year hasn't it? This has probably been the most interesting and busiest year by every measure on record. Mostly thanks to all the work Valve is doing in Proton (and related projects), Steam Deck and SteamOS which benefits everyone trying to game on Linux. You can see my end of year <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">article on the Steam Deck over here</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/my-game-of-the-year-2022-is-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">read about my GOTY here</a>.</p>
<p>For GamingOnLinux, it's been a <em>huge</em> year too with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">YouTube Channel</a> hitting close to 30K followers now. I'm genuinely shocked at how that has just <em>rocketed</em> <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18027455831671795578gol1.png" target="_blank">upwards</a> in subscribers and continues at a nice pace. Be sure to also follow along on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, or for <em>just</em> the news without my extra spicy takes and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux/109559833585150695" target="_blank">glorious memes</a> there's the main <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/article_rss.php" target="_blank">RSS feed</a> (and every article tag also has a feed too!).</p>
<p>Just a reminder, that I would appreciate any and all support you can give and you can find out all the ways how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" target="_blank">on the Support Us page</a>.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas and I hope you all have a wonderful New Year. Here's to a fun 2023! <em>Now where did I put that Steam Deck…?</em></p>

      <title>Intel working on new Xe graphics driver for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice little bonus before the holidays, Intel have <a href="https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/112188/" target="_blank">made public</a> work on their brand new Xe driver for the future of Intel graphics on Linux. Found via Collabora developer Jason Ekstrand on <a href="https://toot.io/@gfxstrand@mastodon.gamedev.place/109561465470881471" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, who previously started off this work, this is quite exciting.</p>
<p>The idea is to have a fresh set of code that doesn't have to deal with the legacy the current i915 driver does, which supports a lot of older chips. The Xe driver support starts from Tiger Lake, which was the first with Intel Xe, and the code is already at a stage where it can actually be used. Going by what they said it is built to support multiple platforms with initial support in Mesa for Iris and ANV (the OpenGL and Vulkan drivers).</p>
<p>In the Mesa <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20418" target="_blank">merge request</a> draft, they also mentioned it's good enough already for running GNOME plus some OpenGL and Vulkan games but plenty of issues are expected and it's not optimized yet.</p>
<p>Their plan is to keep working on it, and merge it into Mesa in smaller parts but their main draft for the whole thing will stay up as it goes to allow for easier testing.</p>
<p>Looks like 2023 and beyond for Intel drivers on Linux is going to be quite exciting. Hopefully they will keep putting out new Xe cards too, so that we can have more competition in the GPU space.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sail Forth looks like a wonderful ocean adventure on the more chilled side of things (in a way), and if it's anything like the earlier versions I tried a while back, it would be an easy recommendation. Has quite a mixture of things from peaceful exploration and building up a fleet to various combat encounters too. </p>
<p>More about it: "After waking in the middle of the ocean with no memories, tie together debris to create a makeshift sailboat and figure out what the heck happened. Master semi-realistic wind sailing physics to chart unknown waters, welcome aboard stat-enhancing crewmates, and grow your flimsy dingy into a fully-fledged fleet throughout a charming heartfelt journey to save the world. Discover island environments and challenge landlubbers to a variety of mini games including boat racing, target shooting, card games, fishing, or photo collecting."</p>

      <title>JSAUX now selling a transparent Steam Deck backplate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 27/12/22</strong>: they've <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1606648199598727170" target="_blank">removed</a> the logo from it now — good! They said shipping is delayed now though for 1 week.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Chinese accessory brand JSAUX have officially put up their <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/transparent-back-plate-for-steam-deck-pc0106" target="_blank">transparent backplate</a> for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I know a fair few people love the whole retro transparent tech style, I sure do, reminds me of my original Game Boy Pocket that was transparent so perhaps a late Christmas present for someone? JSAUX say it comes equipped with  thermal grease and a heat dissipation aluminium sheet they claim "enhances the heat dissipation performance through their joint action". Along with the backplate they also have back buttons to go along with it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11983314711671727015gol1.png"/></p>
<p>I actually like it a lot, wouldn't mind one myself but I have bad memories of snapping my SD Card when forgetting to take it out after taking off a back cover quite some time ago. I just know I would forget to remove it again.</p>
<p>When I previously talked to JSAUX about doing this after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/jsaux-teasing-a-clear-back-plate-for-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">their original teaser</a>, and mentioning to them that Valve's Steam Deck shell designs were under a non-commercial license, they made it clear they did not have permission and were trying to get in touch with Valve. They didn't update me on if they did ever hear from Valve on it and now they're selling it so either they have permission or they're doing it anyway. Or, they simply didn't use any design work from Valve at all, and made it entirely themselves.</p>
<p><em>I also have various <a href="https://youtu.be/IEgra6esLsc" target="_blank">privacy issues</a> with JSAUX, which remain unsolved and JSAUX denied all allegations. After pointing out other issues and being notified that Shopify (who they use for their orders) were investigating them — JSAUX simply stopped replying to me.</em></p>

      <title>Proton 7.0-6 now in testing for Steam Deck &amp; Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's one missed from a week ago, Valve are testing another update to the stable version of Proton with Proton 7.0-6 needing some more eyes on it for testing. I don't imagine it to be released soon, given it's about to be holiday time.</p>
<p>To test it out, you need to opt into a Beta on Proton 7.0-5. You can do that by searching for Proton in Steam, and selecting it from the Betas section in the Properties. You can give feedback on the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6385" target="_blank">GitHub post</a>, they're after issues only present in this build compared with the current version.</p>
<p>As usual, here's a quick run over what to expect from it:</p>

      <title>Gorgeous 3D adventure platformer New Super Lucky&#39;s Tale is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>New Super Lucky's Tale appears to be one that somewhat flew under the radar. Originally released in 2020, it looks quite wonderful and after an update it became Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Back in early December, the developer noted they made an "updated controller user interface for Steam Deck" and then a few days ago it was bumped up to Deck Verified — nice. It goes to show that even just a little attention from a developer can get a game into a really nice state for the Steam Deck.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-tVULwjePHw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f7248d14c3352f0023327eec8fc24c1b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-tVULwjePHw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's actually a complete total revamp of their earlier game Super Lucky's Tale from 2018, with both games having a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Featuring a huge variety of gameplay, from expansive 3D hubs, to story-based adventure levels, 2D side-scrolling challenges, rewarding mini-games, mind-bending puzzles, and thrilling boss battles.</li>
<li>Thousands of collectibles to gather, tons of rewarding secrets to discover, a cast of memorable characters, and an entire wardrobe of costumes for the stylish adventurer.</li>
<li>Designed to delight and challenge players of all ages and skill levels.</li>
<li>A complete re-imagining of the original Super Lucky's Tale, featuring redesigned and new levels, a fully rotatable camera, tighter movement control, and major overhauls to nearly every other aspect, including the story, cinematics, music, and more.</li>
<li>Jump, burrow, and tail swipe your way to victory in this love letter to classic 3D platformers!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer clearly loves the Steam Deck too, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1038300/view/5949849119402458142" target="_blank">mentioning</a> on Steam "We've been glued to our Steam Deck ever since it arrived a couple months ago and wholeheartedly recommend it.".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1038300/New_Super_Luckys_Tale/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>X-Plane 12 from Laminar Research is a realistic and powerful flight simulator with real-world physics, accurate aircraft systems / behaviour and an immersive simulation of the world.</p>
<p>It was previously in Early Access but the release is out now proper. Seems it still has a little way to go with winning people over, as it has a Mostly Positive rating on Steam so far with many noting it's not quite at the level of X-Plane 11 yet but no doubt in time it will become nicely polished so people can properly appreciate all the fancy new bits.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in X-Plane 12 includes:</p>
<p><strong>New Engine Features in X-Plane 12</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Volumetric 3D Clouds</li>
<li>Physics-Based Photometric Lighting Model</li>
<li>Worldwide 3D Water</li>
<li>Rewritten AI-Air Traffic Control System</li>
<li>Global 3D Forests</li>
<li>Seasonal Textures and Weather Effects</li>
<li>Revamped Real Weather Data</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Aircraft in X-Plane 12</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Airbus A330</li>
<li>Cessna Citation X</li>
<li>Lancair Evolution</li>
<li>Cirrus SR22</li>
<li>Piper PA-18 Super Cub</li>
<li>Van's RV-10</li>
<li>F-14 Tomcat</li>
<li>Robinson R22 (plus a floats version)</li>
</ul>
<p>Trailer of the new version is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N05KBMKuXXU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2414b410862b2b34f06d6fb3b39f31f1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N05KBMKuXXU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to share X-Plane 12 with the world after years of hard work to take our flight simulator to the next level. Preparing this release has involved re-writing almost every aspect of the application to implement first-principles physics and rendering in the tireless pursuit of ultimate realism“ said Thomson Meeks – Director of Operations.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2014780/XPlane_12/" target="_blank">Steam</a> or directly on their <a href="https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/buy-it/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Valve also didn’t mention it but KDE Connect is now also included for easy file syncing.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It was released with some issues with SD Cards, as the mount point (folder) changed, which would break a lot of non-Steam stuff and shortcuts so they've <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1605710534199988225" target="_blank">rolled that back</a> as a very quick 3.4.1 update too. That change wasn't well communicated by Valve, so glad to see it rolled back promptly. Additionally 3.4.2 rolled out to fix an issue with HDMI/DisplayPort audio going to sleep after being idle on external displays.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: Valve also released a Stable Steam Deck Client <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3646258449520586132" target="_blank">update</a> with the following:</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.1 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Smelling fresh and ready to invite you in, <a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a> 21.1 is officially out now so here's what's new and improved. I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/linux-mint-21-1-now-in-beta-with-full-flatpak-support/" target="_blank">covered the Beta release</a> and so of course not a whole lot apart from some bug fixes has happened since then. Now is the time to jump in though, as it's better than ever.</p>
<p>Built on top of Ubuntu 22.04 you get everything that has, minus Snaps. There's Cinnamon 5.6, Linux kernel 5.15 and it will receive security updates until 2027. It's sporting a bit of a new look too, with plenty of style changes including the removal of unneeded items from the desktop, more vibrant colouring for accents, a change to Aqua by default so say goodbye to Linux Mint being green out of the box and a new mouse pointer theme.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8085205001671652292gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8085205001671652292gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As a reminder on some of what's new:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driver Manager no longer needd a password to launch, plus improved offline support and fixes for NVIDIA.</li>
<li>Full Flatpak integration in the Update Manager.</li>
<li>More places needing a password prompt were removed that don't need administrative permissions.</li>
<li>Right click on desktop now has a Display Settings option.</li>
<li>A refreshed interface for the Software Manager, that makes it easier to tell the difference between Flatpak and normal packages. Plus you can switch between them if an app has both.</li>
<li>A Verify ISO tool was added.</li>
<li>Other visual changes include a seperator next to the Mint Menu button, a corner bar applet on the far right of the panel inspired by Windows 10, selecting an item in the file manager Nemo only highlights the name now and not the icon as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more on what's new see their <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_vera_cinnamon_whatsnew.php" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>Whisker Squadron: Survivor blends Vampire Survivors with a Star Fox-like shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new on-rails survival rogue-lite shooter? Sign me up. Whisker Squadron: Survivor is from the same team as Race the Sun, and the first in the Whisker Squadron series. There's also a demo right now.</p>
<p>The actual Whisker Squadron game is still coming, but this is less about story and a smaller tighter game for fans of the survival genre that wish to keep on going as long as they can, while upgrading into a unique build. Think of it like a mashup between the classic Star Fox and Vampire Survivors. </p>
<p>With my love of anything resembling Vampire Survivors, and some very fond memories of Star Fox 64 I nearly dropped my Steam Deck in excitement to try this one. It feels really good, looks really good and it seems to work perfectly out of the box both on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Here's a little Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OgqLLTvIoeA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e214ef70e399f5494463f9af19a9a66a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OgqLLTvIoeA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I discovered this thanks to my own excitement over the other Whisker Squadron game they're making, since I personally pledged to their Kickstarter some time ago where they announced this game before the Steam page went up.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140100/Whisker_Squadron_Survivor/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. The demo has a Native Linux version and so will the full release planned for 2023.</p>

      <title>GameMaker makes a few more open source moves with extensions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, I have to admit I am surprised that the takeover of YoYo Games (who develop GameMaker) by Opera has been largely positive with them making more moves towards open source.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/yoyo-games-open-source-the-gamemaker-html5-runtime/" target="_blank">Back in November</a>, they open sourced the HTML5 runtime for GameMaker, which was quite a nice step for developers building web games. They also made big improvements to their Linux support <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gamemaker-on-linux-gets-big-improvements-and-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">back in April</a>.</p>
<p>Now they're back again<a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/open-source-extensions" target="_blank"> with a fresh announcement</a>, as they're open sourcing a whole bunch of extensions and they have more on the way. It's still baby steps in terms of the <em>overall</em> project being open but still a lot better than certain other companies. Some of what they've opened up includes the Google H5 Games Ads extension, Steamworks, Epic Online Services, Microsoft GDK, Google Play Services, GOG, Firebase, WebView, GameJolt etc and they have plans to do more.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages they list with them being open source include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>It lets you look behind the curtain, and understand how the code you’re using works. This allows you to use a library in a more efficient manner as you understand its inner workings.</li>
<li>The team at GameMaker is always working to improve extensions. In addition to that, having access to the source allows you to make your own fixes and updates to an extension.</li>
<li>You can build your own version of an extension with custom changes to suit your project’s needs. Later, you can submit these changes as pull requests, so other developers can benefit from your work.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>A bunch of them were actually open sourced earlier this year pretty quietly on their <a href="https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php?threads/open-sourcing-extensions.98439/" target="_blank">forum</a>, with the full announcement only being made today.</p>
<p>Hopefully this trend over at YoYo Games will continue, and eventually we might see the GameMaker editor as open source too. They're clearly becoming more friendly to the idea of open source so I wouldn't rule it out. It's a very popular game engine for developers and would be amazing to see happen.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck shipping update for Asia notes a few issues but plenty get it this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve and Komodo have given an <a href="https://komodo.jp/news/steamdeck-shipment-update-dec21.html" target="_blank">update</a> on the shipping of the Steam Deck through Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>It seems quite a lot of people will get their Steam Deck in those areas this year, with the announcement noting that anyone there who reserved a Steam Deck before December 1st will get them by the end of the year. They said that all pre-December 1st reservations they expect to have shipped across Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan by December 26th.</p>
<p>The odd one out here is South Korea, where it was mentioned that "unanticipated transport and customs issues" held things up and caused delays, but they've already solved the issues and so shipments there will resume on December 26th, with all South Korean reservations expected to be shipped by December 30th.</p>
<p>On top of that, it seems they messed up the reservation queue at some point, with Steam Decks going out in an incorrect order. Once again, they say this issue has been solved and now they should be going out again based on the reservation date.</p>
<p>Sounds like it has once again been a success though, as they mentioned the "overwhelming interest in Steam Deck". So we really are about to get a big surge of people gaming on Linux with Steam Deck. Exciting.</p>

      <title>Retro fuelled FPS &#39;Selaco&#39; has easily one of the best demos I&#39;ve ever played</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco, an upcoming GZDoom-based shooter from Altered Orbit Studios has been featured before and I'm bringing it back again here because of the huge upgrade to the demo. It's simply fantastic.</p>
<p>This first-person shooter features some pretty incredible looking work and it's still hard to believe this is at all GZDoom under the hood. So much going on all the time, with lots of things to interact with. Taking inspiration from F.E.A.R. for the set pieces and clever AI, along with a healthy dose of Quake and Doom with plenty of modern tricks thrown in. The original demo was already awesome but this update just really showcases what a great game I believe it will be at release.</p>
<p>Some of the updates in the demo includes: Steam Deck support, Gamepad support, lots of Quality of Life improvements, big changes to the level design, a new particle system for smoother performance, a new gore system, improvements to the Vulkan renderer, improved AI and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/3616983854462063568" target="_blank">much more</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a video of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Rc0g5AXP93k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d25fdcfc6b33b8ef8f5622cb1ff4244b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Rc0g5AXP93k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you love shooters, even if not usually on the retro-styled side of things, go give it a run.</p>
<p>Find it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>My game of the year 2022 is the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You think I'm joking? I'm not. Okay, okay. It's <em>not</em> a game but I'll get to that in a moment. The Steam Deck has transformed everything about gaming for me.</p>
<p>At the risk of people pointing out how I'm repeating myself, and how I've likely said all this before in various places: yes I probably have but I'm going to bore you with it again because I can.</p>
<p>The freedom the Steam Deck affords is just a constant reminder of how I <em>hate</em> being sat at my desk for most of the day, the feeling of being shackled to it sets in quite quickly if I start up a game on my actual desktop PC now. I would much rather unhook my Steam Deck from the charger, and go be a potato on the sofa with it. There's just something about the feeling of being that much more connected to the gaming experience too when you have it all there in your hands. I'm certain I'm not alone in that feeling either.</p>

<p><em>Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">had a great year with it too</a> and I'm ridiculously excited for what 2023 brings.</em></p>
<p>What's my actual game of the year for 2022 though? Well, this might surprise and even shock you but it's Vampire Su…just kidding. It's actually <em>not</em> the very good Vampire Survivors. While it has sucked away many hours from me, and again it is very good, it's not my game of the year.</p>
<p>Despite many good games released across this year, and a lot of high profile releases too, I ended up being sucked in by something small. The majority of my time actually gaming now being on a Steam Deck either handheld or docked in various rooms, can easily be part of the why on this too.</p>
<p>My GOTY for 2022 is: <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">Brotato</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Similar in many ways to Vampire Survivors, but I honestly like Brotato so much more. Brotato is a frantic top-down arena shooter roguelite set in a small arena (although certain characters can change the arena size). You pick a character from a growing list, each with their own pros and cons, and run around as a potato shooting at everything else that moves. </p>
<p>When you level up you choose from various power-ups and pick from multiple weapon types that you also get to upgrade. It becomes absolute madness once you get a good few waves into it and that's also what I love about it, the timed waves let you know clearly how long you've got left until you get a breather again. Your characters changing visually based on your weapons is a thoroughly nice touch too, some of them really make me laugh.</p>
<p>Here's a previous video I did on it:</p>

<p><em>Love it. Madness.</em></p>
<p>Over to you: what's your GOTY 2022?</p>

Moments later, you're sent flying, violently thrown through the air by the force of a massive explosion, right into a sinister, global intrigue. The coveted contents of that briefcase? A fiercely guarded manuscript penned by a clandestine medieval order - the Knights Templar. Reveal the truth behind a secret conspiracy and save the world from the Templars' evil plan." — Broken Sword: Director's Cut.</p>

      <title>Star Wars Dark Forces lives on again with The Force Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A dedicated Star Wars fan and code hacker has created something awesome: <a href="https://theforceengine.github.io/" target="_blank">The Force Engine</a>. A brand new free and open source modern game engine for Star Wars Dark Forces.</p>
<p>Their plan for it was to rebuild the old Jedi Engine for modern systems, so people don't have to keep using things like DOSBox, plus add in plenty of modern enhancements just to make it feel that little bit nicer. There's many open source projects like it for other games and now after 3 years of development The Force Engine 1.0 is out. Before getting too excited, the Native Linux version is due later.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sn179mQOeBw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3cdc51d2fa28ec612ae92a8e2b86ff1f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sn179mQOeBw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Dark Forces support, including mods. Outlaws support is coming in version 2.0.</li>
<li>Mod Loader - simply place your mods in the Mods/ directory as zip files or directories.</li>
<li>High Resolution and Widescreen support - when using 320x200 you get the original software renderer. TFE also includes a floating-point software renderer which supports widescreen, including ultrawide, and much higher resolutions.</li>
<li>GPU Renderer with perspective correct pitch - play at much higher resolutions with improved performance.</li>
<li>Extended Limits - TFE, by default, will support much higher limits than the original game which removes most of the HOM (Hall of Mirrors) issues in advanced mods.</li>
<li>Full input binding, mouse sensitivity adjustment, and controller support. Note, however, that menus currently require the mouse.</li>
<li>Optional Quality of Life improvements, such as full mouselook, aiming reticle, improved Boba Fett AI, autorun, and more.</li>
<li>A new save system that works seamlessly with the exiting checkpoint and lives system. You can ignore it entirely, use it just as an exit save so you don't have to play long user levels in one sitting, or full save and load with quicksaves like Doom or Duke Nukem 3D.</li>
<li>Optional and quality of life features, even mouselook, can be disabled if you want the original experience. Play in 320x200, turn the mouse mode (Input menu) to Menus only or horizontal, and enable the Classic (software) renderer - and it will look and play just like DOS, but with a higher framerate and without needing to adjust cycles in DosBox.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vulkan Video 1.0 released with the Vulkan 1.3.238 spec update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group has <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-decode" target="_blank">announced</a> that Vulkan Video is done and ready, the 1.0 release is out with the Vulkan 1.3.238 spec update and no longer considered provisional.</p>
<p>It's been a while coming, with the provisional extensions going out back in April 2021. It's used for proper hardware-accelerated video compression and decompression using the Vulkan API and could be quite exciting for lots of different uses. Sure would be great if game developers went for it, instead of using various proprietary video tech.</p>
<p>The release today includes the finalised extensions after gathering industry feedback and provides functionality to provide fully accelerated H.264 and H.265 decode.</p>
<p>More codecs are coming though, this is just the start. The announcement mentioned they will release more extensions to provide additional codecs and accelerated encode as well as decode.</p>
<p>These extensions are final:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_queue</a>: common APIs for all video coding operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_queue</a>: common APIs for all video decode operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h264.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_h264</a>: H.264 decode-specific capabilities and parameters (promoted from EXT to KHR in this final release).</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h265.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_h265</a>: H.265 decode-specific capabilities and parameters (promoted from EXT to KHR in this final release).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas these are still provisional:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_encode_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_encode_queue</a>: common APIs for all video encode operations.</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_video_encode_h264.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_video_encode_h264</a>: H.264 encode-specific capabilities and parameters.</li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_video_encode_h265.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_video_encode_h265</a>: H.265 encode-specific capabilities and parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/events/vulkanised-2023" target="_blank">Vulkanised 2023</a> event (February 7-9 in Munich), they will also do a presentation and live demo on Vulkan Video.</p>
