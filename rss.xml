      <title>DayZ Badlands expansion announced with the biggest map yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bohemia Interactive have today revealed the DayZ Badlands expansion for their very popular open-world survival game.</p>
<p>The game has BattlEye anti-cheat, which has been enabled for Linux systems for quite a while now. It's listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">curated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>. With an enormous size of 267 km², DayZ Badlands introduces the largest official map in the game's history. Set west of Chernarus and bordering Takistan’s frontier, the terrain offers a desolate blend of cracked soil, sand-swept plains, and mountainous divides. Here, every inch of land tells a story of failed invasions, abandoned cities, and the silence that followed decades of war.</p>
<p>Check out the teaser below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2oad7AX7gWM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/efd8f4b85196ec5f9dc0c6ae6bd6b22d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2oad7AX7gWM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Key features of DayZ Badlands include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Terrain</strong>: Explore the fully inland Nasdara province.</li>
<li><strong>Desert Environment</strong>: Endure droughts, manage hydration, and survive a harsh arid spring climate.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict-Scarred World</strong>: Traverse dense towns, abandoned ruins, oil fields, and infrastructure left behind by war.</li>
<li><strong>Region-Specific Content</strong>: Encounter infected variants adapted to the desert and loot new items, cosmetics, and firearms tailored to the region.</li>
<li><strong>Player-Driven Storytelling</strong>: Form factions, uncover forgotten secrets, and decide what rises from the ashes of conflict.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>DayZ Badlands is a while away with it launching sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>I've seen scattered reports of it being broken recently on Linux from the v1.28 update, but I couldn't reproduce the problem. On Kubuntu 25.04 playing on official servers the game runs flawlessly with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>

      <title>Pricing announced for the Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld with Manjaro Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/orange-pi-neo-gaming-handheld-to-come-with-manjaro-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced back in February 2024</a>, we're still waiting on a release date for the Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld with Manjaro Linux but now we have prices.</p>
<p>It's been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/orangepi-neo-gaming-handheld-with-manjaro-linux-delayed-until-q3-2025-with-no-exact-date/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delayed a fair bit</a> and still sounds like it's a few months away from a proper release, but now we have a clearer idea of pricing. There will also be multiple models of it, not just for different processors but different storage and RAM sizing too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12029068081751030250gol1.png"/></p>
<p>As posted by Manjaro Linux head Philip Müller on their <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-orangepi-neo-01/156450/108?u=liamd" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a> a few days ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base Model 7840u 16GB RAM / 512GB will be 450 $ or 3699 CNY.</li>
<li>Base Model 8840u 32GB RAM / 512GB will be 550 $ or 4499 CNY.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also shared a small image to note there will be these variants:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2755462631751029898gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>It's coming in quite late compared with the competition but that pricing seems pretty reasonable for the specifications, and with thumbpads as well that a lot of other handhelds don't have.</p>
<p>The official website still hasn't been updated with any additional details, including the different editions, that will likely come closer to the actual release. As of the last update these are still the main specifications, apart from the additional processor and storage options noted above:</p>

      <title>Two Point Museum&#39;s first DLC announced with Fantasy Finds coming in July</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Point Museum from SEGA and Two Point Studios is set to expand with the Fantasy Finds DLC coming on July 17th. The game has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>In Fantasy Finds, you will be able to venture deep into the world of medieval fantasy with an new special fantasy expedition map. Awaiting players is a treasure trove of 40 exhibits to discover, such as the Teanie Kettle, Novel Wardrobe and my favourite the Flying Carpet. Plus, Fantasy Finds brings 3 new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GRgEvhYj1L0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/93a67c791aa4b28e475adf2c024c9522.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GRgEvhYj1L0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fantasy Finds offers museum curators a new exclusive fantasy expedition map to explore with an enormous treasure trove of 40 exhibits to discover, such as the Teanie Kettle, Novel Wardrobe and Flying Carpet. These magical artefacts aren’t just for show either, as they will provide positive blessings for guests when well maintained… but watch out, those who don’t look after these intriguing curios will find they curse guests instead!</p>
<p>To discover these new magical exhibits on your expeditions, you’ll need to hire Fantasy Experts from Barbarian, Wizard, Rogue or Bard classes, each of whom possess their own stats. Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack? Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut. Whatever the obstacle, Fantasy Finds will challenge you to hire a varied party of fantasy experts with their own strengths and talents to ensure you successfully return home from expeditions with new magical exhibits.</p>
<p>That’s not all, as Fantasy Finds will also weave its fantasy magic throughout your museum with three new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors and you’ll even see your expedition helicopter joining in the fun, thanks to a fresh paint job ensuring it fits the medieval fantasy mood. You can even buff your museum staff with Mythical Gear exhibits which can be equipped or put on display, providing bonuses such as protection on nearby exhibits or even job security to fend off being fired.</p>
<p>Fantasy Finds follows on from the free MIA Items And Exhibits Update, as Two Point Museum goes from strength to strength and continues to offer a wealth of fresh content for its players.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is currently 20% off during the Steam Summer Sale 2025.</p>

      <title>Apocalypse Express has some frantic train combat out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Apocalypse Express brings exciting real-time post-apocalyptic train defence to Early Access and I'm looking forward to more of it. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>It's an action management roguelike, with you picking various locations on a map and then proceeding to different destinations across the tracks, each with their own risks and rewards. It's a frantic race for survival with you running up and down your train, manning and repairing various modules that you expand and upgrade over time while pushing further across the wasteland.</p>
<p>The basic gameplay actually reminded me of the 2012 classic FTL: Faster Than Light from Subset Games, a game I was horribly hooked on. Apocalypse Express definitely gives off that same kind of feeling only with it being fully real-time and you directly controlling a single person. As you travel, various bandits will roll up along side you and start firing, so it's your job to keep the train moving and protected.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18896585181751021747gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18896585181751021747gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It starts off pretty quickly and doesn't slow down, with it getting progressively more difficult with the different types of enemies you'll face. The upgrade system is great though, giving you a chance to add all sorts to your train from entirely new weapons and armour to general upgrades to how everything works.</p>
<p>What makes it so frantic is the repair system. Modules will get destroyed during a run making them inoperable, and you have to at times do a little mini-game to begin the repair, on top of the time it then takes to get them repaired. Things like pressing buttons in a certain combination, or tapping a button when an arrow moves around a circle to a specific spot. All while enemies are still firing at you, and then a turn signal comes up so you need to run to a lever to change tracks.</p>
<p>Here they have is a fantastic base for expansion. That was the point of the initial release, they said "What we've been doing is setting a strong foundation for all of our game systems. This allows us to create content much faster and iterate on existing features and mechanics easier". They have plans to add in more biomes to travel through each with their own unique enemies, bosses and hazards. Along with new modules, local co-op and more.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like a game that would truly become a whole lot better with co-op, might even feel a bit like Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime when they add it. But even so if they just expanded the content and kept it solo - it would still be a huge amount of fun.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lo-I3ZXFaqQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/81f5b545c1b1202b7b850b9092c47f00.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lo-I3ZXFaqQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Played on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu) it works perfectly with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. Not a great fit for handhelds like Steam Deck just yet but they've said they're working towards features like properly controller support for Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>First-person dungeon-crawler Monomyth gets better Steam Deck and gamepad support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new first-person dungeon-crawling RPG? Perhaps it's time to check out Monomyth. The devs just updated it with better Steam Deck and gamepad support.</p>
<p>The games features a vast, interconnected game environment. Wander from the highest towers to the lowest caverns, find secret chambers, uncover hidden passageways and explore a multitude of differently themed areas. This is backed up by a highly interactive environment filled with items, puzzles, monsters and various peaceful inhabitants. An interesting dialogue feature too that has a keyword-based system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2lYEomHdwZk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8473aa04e2a347f4f7e50bcf7333b58f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2lYEomHdwZk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the latest update "EA2.0.1a" the developer mentioned it has lots of improvements for Steam Deck compatibility, including "significant enhancements to gamepad controls". Changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* Fixed unresponsive/unfocused buttons in menu navigation via gamepad</p>
<p>* Added three minor sub-area soundtracks</p>
<p>* Adjusted the gamepad layout preset (Steam Deck)</p>
<p>* Adjusted the main menu for 16:10 screens</p>
<p>* Fixed a bug in gamepad controls that would re-open containers after taking all items from them</p>
<p>* Added gamepad controls overview</p>
<p>* Added gamepad/keyboard glyphs to tutorial texts</p>
<p>* Right-clicking textboxes will no longer open a context menu</p>
<p>* Fixed gamepad freeze on exit prompt</p>
<p>* Fixed item dropping bug on looting container</p>
<p>* Added tooltips</p>
<p>The game should be fully playable with a gamepad/Steam Deck now. The only missing features are an automatic virtual keyboard for textboxes (you can open one manually through the Steam button on your Steam Deck) and a few special grips for things like opening the journal.</p>

      <title>Painkiller reboot confirmed for launch on October 9</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Painkiller reboot from Anshar Studios and 3D Realms is now confirmed for release on October 9 with a new trailer.</p>
<p>They're still calling it a "modern reimagining", with it looking nothing like the older games with its focus now on co-op play, it's Painkiller only in name really that they say "pays homage to the classic series". While it has full offline solo play, there's naturally been a lot of tweaks for co-op but grumbles aside it does look pretty good actually.</p>
<p>Split across two editions it's available now to pre-order. The standard edition is €39.99/£34.99 that includes a skin pack for pre-orders and a Deluxe Edition for €49.99/£44.99 that also includes a season pass with three planned post-launch DLC.</p>

      <title>Blending a comedy visual novel with pachinko, Jump the Track adds Linux and macOS support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jump the Track has a great visual style and a fun looking blend of a comedy visual novel with pachinko, and now it has Linux and macOS support. It originally released on May 28th, with the additional platforms support arriving June 26th.</p>
<p>From developer Seed by Seed that previously created Baladins and Pile Up! Box by Box. In this absurd adventure, you play Sam, a young dreamer struggling in the gig economy. Sam struggles with inner turmoil and conflicting emotions. You have the power to guide fate—roll the ball and see where the story takes you!</p>
<p>The developers said they also "made a full pass of rework on Steam Deck Compatibility, and it should run much smoother now". Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You're in trouble, gotta find a way out</strong><br/>
Meet Sam, a slacker with no ambitions whose life suddenly takes an absurd turn into a hectic and dangerous adventure that defies all odds!<br/>
<br/>
It’s a matter of life or death, can Sam find a way out?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Let the ball guide your way</strong><br/>
Jump the Track is the vibrant fusion of a visual novel and a pinball physics game.<br/>
<br/>
Sam struggles with inner turmoil and conflicting emotions. You have the power to guide fate—roll the ball and see where the story takes you!<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Embrace your emotions and rise up against the power</strong><br/>
How the hell are we supposed to live our lives working multiple shitty jobs at once to make ends meet while a few can live in luxury? And they are the ones threatening us with violence? Nothing can go wrong, right? <br/>
On the journey to save his life, you'll have to encourage Sam to make decisions. Will you stand up against the power or lay low to stay in your security zone?</p>

      <title>Vulkan API developers try to address some developer frustrations with a new extension</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vulkan has been out for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2016/02/vulkan-10-specification-and-sdk-have-been-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">around 9 years now</a>, and The Khronos Group continue tweaking it for developers to remove frustrations. It's probably the most important thing to ever happen for Linux gaming as a whole, with it being the reason we have so many games performing so well inside of Proton.</p>
<p>No graphics API is ever going to be perfect though and Khronos have been listening to developers. They said  "One of the most frequent developer frustrations has been the complexity of managing image layouts" and they've formally announced the "<a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts</a>" extension today which should help deal with the synchronization model.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More from the blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s been over a decade since Vulkan’s synchronization model was first designed. At the time, the graphics development community strongly favored explicit control over synchronization, and the Vulkan Working Group responded with an API that prioritized performance on the hardware of that era, delivering maximum flexibility and control to application developers.</p>
<p>In hindsight—and perhaps unsurprisingly—synchronization has turned out to be one of Vulkan’s most challenging aspects, tripping up both new and seasoned developers. The synchronization model is complex enough that many applications struggle to issue synchronization commands that are efficient <a href="https://www.lunarg.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Guide-to-Vulkan-Synchronization-Validation-FINAL-01-18-2024.pdf#page=5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">or even correct</a>. The <code class="inline-code"><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/latest/man/html/VK_KHR_synchronization2.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">VK_KHR_synchronization2</a></code> extension introduced several incremental improvements while largely preserving the foundational principles of Vulkan 1.0’s original approach.</p>
<p>Since then, modern GPUs have evolved significantly, including how they handle synchronization, making many of Vulkan’s original design constraints increasingly outdated. Recognizing this, the Vulkan Working Group is now actively working to streamline synchronization, aiming to improve usability and make high-performance graphics development more accessible. The newly released <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts</code> extension is a major milestone on that path.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to Linux support, NVIDIA put up a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta</a> driver on June 8th that added support for the extension. For the open source Mesa RADV AMD driver support for it was <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/35424" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merged</a> in two weeks ago, and I haven't seen any yet for Intel. </p>
<p>Read the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/so-long-image-layouts-simplifying-vulkan-synchronisation" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full technical blog post</a> for more.</p>
<p>Nice to see this graphics API continue to evolve, and in some ways get simpler for developers. Good news for the overall health of Vulkan and Linux gaming as a whole.</p>

      <title>10 years after release Dying Light: Retouched is a nice upgrade for the Techland zombie game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dying Light (the original) is still one of the best open-world zombie games around, and now perhaps just even better with the Dying Light: Retouched update. This is <em>not</em> a remaster, as Techland have been very firm on what to call it - they say it's just <em>enhancing</em> the existing game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights of which are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Graphics &amp; Performance: Enjoy increased and upscaled texture quality, a new “Ultra” 8k shadow quality level, improved physics based rendering on metallic surfaces and water, and extended LOD ranges. The Retouched Update is about squeezing out even more from the Dying Light you already love. It’s not a complete overhaul or remaster.</li>
<li>Improved Audio Experience: Immerse yourself deeper with a remastered soundtrack by Paweł Błaszczak, the original composer, who meticulously recreated the retro-tape sound by recording on actual tape. Expect new tracks and ambient themes throughout the game, and improved hit reaction audio for even more visceral combat feedback.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1867880161750944506gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1867880161750944506gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Dying Light (Native) on Kubuntu Linux</em></p>
<p>I've checked, and it appears the Native Linux version of this 10 year old game still runs right out of the box, and it was updated too which is nice to see. You'll still get better performance with Proton though.</p>
<p>As for why it took so long the developers mentioned how working with 10+ year old technology resulted in a "massive amount of manual work". Part of that was keeping it stable, while also not increasing any system requirements to make sure it continues working as it did before. With Krzysztof Knefel, Lead 3D Artist, mentioning "I basically walked through the entire map, looking for assets to be improved. And all of those had to be changed manually by our artists".</p>
<p>Dying Light 2: Stay Human also received a "Summer Update" fixing various problems, adding in a Balatro crossover DLC and there will be various new activities over the next few weeks.</p>

      <title>It took a while but the excellent co-op horror game R.E.P.O. just got a major content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Museum Update is the first major update to R.E.P.O since it entered Early Access in February.</p>
<p>I've had a serious blast playing this one with the smaller version of me, it's probably one of the funniest co-op horror games around and it works perfectly on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. No <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat nuisances</a> either, it just works, click and play.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for <em>players</em>, but fortunately for the <em>developer</em>, it was a <em>lot</em> more popular than they expected. This is what caused a big part of the delay for updating it. Anyway, The Museum Update is here now, check out the update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JU6OjKaxgrA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5725adaef1959fffc339e33e0211fdf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JU6OjKaxgrA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3241660/view/544486109101430167" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> includes a whole lot of tweaks and bug fixes to make it smoother, along with adding all this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A whole new level, Museum of Human Art!</li>
<li>Server List and Random Matchmaking!</li>
<li>Region Picker - Choose your server region, or keep automatic selection as before!</li>
<li>Moon Phases - Shifts every 5 levels, raising difficulty and adding effects like Overcharge. Only a few moons are available for now, with more planned! View active moons in the escape menu.</li>
<li>Overcharge - Only active in later moon phases. Grabbing an enemy builds Overcharge. When the meter is full you get blasted back! Stronger enemies generate more Overcharge. If multiple players grab the same enemy, the Overcharge is greatly reduced.</li>
<li>Kick - Remove players from a lobby or during a level, preventing them from rejoining.</li>
<li>Lobby Passwords - Private lobbies can now be password protected for security!</li>
<li>Steam - Click player heads in lobby or icons next to mic sliders to open their Steam profile!</li>
<li>Steam - Players now appear in your "recently played with" list after playing together.</li>
<li>Toggle Mute - Press "B" to quickly mute or unmute your microphone. Can be configured in settings.</li>
<li>New battery UI - Every stock on the battery now represents one use.</li>

<p>Humble Bundle have announced their monthly selection of games in <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership/home" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Choice</a> is getting a price increase. Seems like this will affect nearly all subscribers across different regions, even if you had the "Classic Plan" that has the lower price, it's appears to also be increasing.</p>

<p><em>*The figures for some months in some regions didn't change but did rise for annual subs.</em></p>
<p>There's a lot of complaints about it that I've seen across social media, with many not happy about the increase.</p>
<p>Thinking on it from a point of view as someone who doesn't currently subscribe (but I have done in the past), the pricing still seems <em>reasonable</em> to me. In the UK, that's £11.49 to get 8 games every month which is pretty good. When you think about things like Microsoft's Game Pass, there you don't get to keep anything but here you can build up a whole collection and the games are <em>yours</em> even after you cancel.</p>
<p>Still, any increase is not a great feeling for consumers. Especially with the price of so many other things going up. I'm certainly not blind to that (my own water bill just <em>doubled</em> for example).</p>
<p>But, we also have to think about the business side of it. Even before this price rise, when you look at the split between Humble Bundle and then to the individual developers - it's not exactly a lot (and that's before other cuts like taxes and so on). However, that does also depend on the scale of subscribers, those numbers will add up fast if there's a lot but Humble never give out subscriber numbers.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Mecha BREAK now Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the release of Mecha BREAK on July 1st, Valve have checked it over and given it a rating for Steam Deck and SteamOS. The release time depends on timezones though, seems like for the UK it will release at 4AM UTC on July 2nd.</p>
<p>This is an interesting one though, since it uses Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anti-cheat causes all sorts of problems</a> for Linux platforms, and Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE) especially is a nuisance since it appears to only allow Steam Deck / SteamOS devices, and blocks normal Desktop Linux distributions. This is something <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/anti-cheat-stops-mecha-break-running-on-desktop-linux-but-works-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I specifically noted here on GamingOnLinux in my previous article</a> when testing the game during the demo.</p>
<p>Valve rated it today as Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z2MJY08p_ZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf89622cf2bf36429511ddd3ea251936.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z2MJY08p_ZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully at some point we'll see less of this platform-specific enabling of anti-cheat for Linux. Especially because it doesn't exactly make any sense, it's no more secure on SteamOS compared with normal desktop Linux. Anyone can unlock the SteamOS filesystem do anything in Desktop Mode, it's a false sense of security. Thankfully, there's very few games that actually use Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE), with <a href="https://steamdb.info/tech/AntiCheat/AntiCheatExpert/?displayOnly=Game&amp;sort=online_desc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> listing a total of 20 games.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>

But its pathogenic nature and relentless spread threaten to consume Earth's last habitable spaces. In just decades, Corite is projected to engulf the globe.

<p>Resist. Adapt. Escape. Or follow Corite's call and forge a new path.</p>

      <title>Chroma Blasters is a challenging music-driven twin-stick arcade shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love music and twin-stick shooter high-score challenges? Chroma Blasters is one you need to try, and there's a demo available. Like a lot of smaller indie games on Steam, it released to no fanfare and doesn't even have a single Steam user review just yet. </p>
<p>More about it: "Chroma Blasters is a solo developed top-down twin-stick arcade shooter where enemy waves are shaped by music. With over 120 music tracks (25 in the Demo) and a fast, reactive color-matching gameplay, every track becomes a new battlefield."</p>
<p>Imagine a visual style not too far from the likes of Geometry Wars but it's all about colour matching. Different buttons fire off different colours and you have to match that to the enemy. It's a thorough challenge, and with some good tunes across a few different genres it's a pretty nice arcade high-score chaser.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Dm0b20rNWSo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4b652b1522d4a6a6446fa57e5eb8ccf0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Dm0b20rNWSo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Defend your position.</li>
<li>Switch colors fast.</li>
<li>Prioritize threats.</li>
<li>Survive and score high.</li>
<li>Over 120 sound-driven levels - Every track is a new challenge.</li>
<li>5 genre styles (Electronic, Rock, Synth, Metal, Vocal).</li>
<li>Built for precision with responsive twin-stick controls (Steam Deck ready).</li>
<li>Simple controls - (Both sticks to shoot, hold bumpers/riggers to switch colors).</li>
<li>Color-matching &amp; distance based scoring that rewards mastery.</li>
<li>40 Achievements (full game) &amp; per-track local high scores to chase.</li>
</ul>

      <title>KDE devs disable potentially seizure inducing Plasma effect as accessibility work continues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE developers are working towards making the Plasma desktop environment more accessible, with an essential tweak to the defaults. As it turns out, there's a desktop effect that might cause seizures — uh oh.</p>
<p>Coming as part of the Plasma 6.4.1 update, writing on their blog developer Nate Graham <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2025/06/25/a-slight-ux-change-in-plasma-6-4-1/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The "highlight window" effect for Task Manager thumbnails <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/merge_requests/3077" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">is now off by default</a>. This is the effect that makes other windows fade out when you hover over a window’s thumbnail.</p>
<p>Why did we turn it off? Because we discovered that with certain window arrangements and mouse movements, the current implementation could potentially cause full-screen flickering at greater than 3 Hz, which is potentially capable of triggering seizures in sensitive people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small change to the defaults but sounds like a necessary one, until the actual problem can be solved. Going by the bug report, another developer <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/merge_requests/3077#note_1244861" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they would be looking into improving it.</p>
<p>This is part of KDE's accessibility push as they work towards <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/disability/union-equality-strategy-rights-persons-disabilities-2021-2030/european-accessibility-act_en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EU Directive 2019/882</a> compliance, which they're currently tracking <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/issues/149" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">various tasks</a> that need to be sorted with a few already ticked off. Some of the work already done includes sorting out UI and documentation text contrast, an audit for UI elements that disappear automatically over time, and ensuring anything that handles audio has volume controls.</p>
<p>Nice to see more of a focus on accessibility. This EU directive is also one of the reasons we've seen <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-beta-brings-new-accessibility-options-for-steam-big-picture-mode/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve also add more accessibility options to Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-adds-accessibility-features-to-store-pages-and-filters-for-searching/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accessibility feature notices on store pages</a>.</p>

      <title>Number Machine is an open-ended factory and automation game with math mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fans of automation puzzle games and titles from Zachtronics might like Number Machine, an open-ended factory and automation game with math mechanics. Coming in 2026 from developer ARIELEK, who previously made <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/please-fix-the-road-is-a-gorgeous-upcoming-puzzle-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Please Fix The Road</a>.</p>
<p>The developer was directly inspired by Opus Magnum and Infinifactory for this one where you design build, and optimize factories that automatically assemble and deliver complex numerical structures.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ruu0f5G9VDk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3dd3fbe3c153ea3486063f232e51a049.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ruu0f5G9VDk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Build fully autonomous factories on a hexagonal grid using specialized machines. Move, combine, split, destroy, and modify numbered orbs with math to form the required structures with specific shapes and values. Use conveyors, pushers, lasers, magnetism, rotators, and much more to create an efficient system. Optimize for size and speed to climb the leaderboards... but be wary: one small oversight and your entire design can fail!"</p>
<p>Has a nice style to it as well, very clean and inviting. The developer mentioned how all "animations are seamless, with a single continuous camera movement from start to finish".</p>
<p>It will release with full Linux and Steam Deck support. There's no demo yet but the developer told me they do plan to launch a demo before the release.</p>

      <title>Stalker 2 version 1.5 actually sorts out the A-Life AI system, and modding support is here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally, only about 7 months after the release, Stalker 2 actually now has the A-Life AI system hooked up properly.</p>
<p>There were a lot of complaints about the AI system in Stalker 2 at release, and I noted plenty of weirdness <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-works-on-linux-desktop-with-proton-but-poorly-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the original GamingOnLinux article on it</a>. For good reason - a lot of what was expected just didn't seem to be in the game. Well, now it seems it <em>actually</em> is.</p>
<p>Amongst another big lot of general fixes, the changelog notes the A-Life system actually has been hooked up to simulate all characters, not just those in your current view and so everyone will continue progressing towards their goals in the background. With all the changes, it sounds like a good time to just entirely start over. This might very well be the game as it should have released.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19624325531750857941gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19624325531750857941gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stalker 2 on Kubuntu Linux</em></p>
<p>Some of the main changes in Stalker 2 version 1.5:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A-Life changes
	<ul>
<li>Life in the Zone is now simulated for all characters, not just those in the player's view.</li>
<li>Characters continue to live their lives and pursue their goals in the Zone until they meet their end.</li>
<li>The player can meet the same stalkers after some time.</li>
<li>Players may encounter more A-Life characters resting or interacting in various locations, adding to the world’s immersion.</li>
<li>Characters will no longer respawn directly in front of the player. When the player clears the mutants' lair, for example, those mutants won't simply reappear moments later.</li>
<li>A-Life Director will no longer respawn characters at the edge of visualisation. Instead, respawn moved further away from the player, while maintaining the Zone's population.</li>
<li>Visualisation range is slightly increased. Characters now appear in visualisation range with relevant animations and equipped weapons. This reduces the "pop-in" effect and contributes to a more seamless character visualisation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new anomaly: Water Electric Tornado.</li>
<li>Added Three-Line Rifle weapon.</li>
<li>Added new handgun Kora.</li>
<li>Added the new feature: looting of mutant parts.</li>
<li>Added displaying of available artifact slots for armours in the Upgrade tab.</li>
<li>Added unlockable "Fix all" button in the technician's upgrade menu, to repair all equipped gear.</li>
<li>Added reload renewal feature for all of the weapons.</li>
<li>The player stash window is increased in size.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when the "Take all" button becomes inactive after putting any item to the loot window.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Another big addition is the introduction of official modding support with the Zone Kit, along with support for Steam Workshop and mod.io integration.</p>
<p>Testing the update today, I seem to have come across a similar issue as I found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/splitgate-2-now-works-on-desktop-linux-with-the-anti-cheat-updated/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Splitgate 2</a>, where mouse movement just didn't seem to work at all but keyboard input was fine. I had to do some odd combination of alt+tab, shift+tab to bring up the Steam Overlay and then it just eventually grabbed the mouse. Quite annoying.</p>

      <title>Palworld - Tides of Terraria crossover update is out with fishing, new islands, a new Pal trust mechanic and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A huge update for Palworld has arrived with the Tides of Terraria crossover. It's a lot more than just adding bits of Terraria though. There's plenty of Terraria inspired content though including a new dungeon, 6 new weapons and 7 new armour pieces from it.</p>
<p>Sounds like they've really been busy to expand this popular monster catching survival game, while still battling Nintendo. This update only continues to make it even more unique with lots of new game mechanics added in. First up, check out the new update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cIfw_RUnjR8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/06a1e6de45689ff57cd6c2dc316acdde.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cIfw_RUnjR8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">The major new game mechanics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fishing - Craft a rod and have at it.</li>
<li>Salvaging - Ride on water Pals and collect supplies at sea.</li>
<li>Missions - Find an accept missions.</li>
<li>Pal Trust - Build up trust with your Pals the more you use them and get a stats boost.</li>
<li>You can now rest with your pals.</li>
<li>Treasure Maps.</li>
<li>Easy Bulk Storage You can easily store all materials in any chest around your base.</li>
<li>Enemies now build bases just like players.</li>
<li>A new single-player arena challenge mode.</li>
<li>+ lots and lots more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Absolutely massive update. I really cannot wait to check all this out, and I know the smaller version of me is equally excited. And, thanks to Proton, we can easily play together on Linux.</p>

      <title>Broken Arrow devs confirm their anti-cheat will not block Linux, SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Broken Arrow recently released on Steam, promising to provide a fresh large-scale real-time modern warfare tactics game.</p>
<p>One issue though for gamers on Linux and SteamOS based systems, is that it has anti-cheat. It's not the usual sort either, it's their own home-grown "Broken Arrow Anti-Cheat System". Given that anti-cheat is often an issue for Linux gaming, I've been waiting on an official answer about this.</p>
<p>Yesterday they replied to note that the "anti-cheat shouldn't pose an issue for Proton compatibility since it doesn't work at a kernel level". So that's some good news. However, they also say "Proton hasn't been tested or officially supported by the dev team" so that's something to keep in mind. No intentional blocking, but not directly supported (which is the case for most games with anti-cheat). It's now listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>As a huge fan of RTS games, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try this one. The developers sent a key and happily I can see that it does indeed work out of the box with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14946189101750849078gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14946189101750849078gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Broken Arrow is split across a campaign, skirmish battles, and the PvP online play which is a huge focus on it and likely what most people will be buying it for. The campaign, really, serves as just a nice intro to all the systems. Seems it's initially quite popular too with it settling on over 30,000 concurrent players for peak times regularly.</p>
<p>This is not an RTS on the level of base-builders like the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/tempest-rising-is-truly-an-rts-worth-your-time-for-c-c-fans/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tempest Rising</a>, the scale and style of it is much more like the Steel Division and Wargame series. I found those other similar games a bit <em>too</em> overloading on the details and controls though, so it was surprising to see just how easy Broken Arrow is to get into.</p>
<p>Here you get a certain amount of credits tick in that allows you to deploy units, that will appear from set locations and as you progress you'll get more credits to bring in various reinforcements. So it's not a game to spam units, everything needs a purpose on the battlefield, and so you have to be fully-focused on your planning and watching the map closely for where the fire is coming from.</p>
<p>As accessible as it is to initially get into there's a lot you need to learn to be effective in it, and that will take quite some time. Not just because of the vast amount of different units but how to make use of all of them across the map objectives, and how to properly react to the enemies you face as you get obliterated over and over. It's a fun challenge though, one I've enjoyed jumping into online matches to see if my latest tactical idea will work (spoiler: it never does).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7678020981750849081gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7678020981750849081gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This is why the campaign is pretty much <em>essential</em> to play first. There's so many constant moving parts, that you need a little guiding hand to walk you through what the heck you're supposed to do. With all the different types of weapons and fire modes, different armour types and so on — it's a game built for war nerds. Even with the masses of options, it still feels like a game where even my slow brain can actually become somewhat okay at it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D4VdJ0aoqX8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e8f636c740577937dc7f8a8ca9abd3b2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D4VdJ0aoqX8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here all the different types of units have specific key roles too, it's not just about who has the bigger army. You'll need a specific set of units to overcome certain obstacles, it's all about the planning. Which is where the army customization comes in too. There's hundreds of units and thousands of possible combinations, so you can mix and match to try out different styles.</p>
<p>They had a few missteps at release, like missing Skirmish options for 1v1 and 2vs2 vs AI but thankfully they've solved it quickly and enabled it. Why didn't they have it to begin with? They said it was a design choice, as the current maps were not designed for less than 3 players per team but they're going to continue working on that along with AI improvements.</p>
<p>So far I've been having a really good time with it. The performance on my system has been reasonable. Playing at 2560x1440 with my Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT on the Medium preset during the large-scale warfare has been smoothly over 80FPS. For an RTS like this on a huge map I'm happy with how it performs.</p>
<p>Great to see what's another big release (and an RTS too!) working so well on Linux at release.</p>

      <title>Ridiculous Harry Potter-like wizard game Secret Agent Wizard Boy gets a huge upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate really rolls off the tongue doesn't it. The Harry Potter inspired game with ridiculous physics and comedy had a big upgrade.</p>
<p>The Groundwork Update has rolled out for it adding in some huge changes for the game. There's now the first batch of Spy Missions, giving you a variety of tasks to complete. Some of them are pretty silly, with the devs leaning more into the comedy side of the game. The missions are optional but they will give you a Spy Emblem.</p>
<p>Spy Emblems are another big addition which allow you to upgrade your wizard however you like. You can equip various skills like extra health, more jumps, fall damage reduction, eat anything, flatten like a pancake and so on. You only have a limited amount to equip at once, so it's all about changing based on the situation with the developer saying "These will be especially fun next content update". The Spy Embleds can also be found throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13886625201750846616gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13886625201750846616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also now a proper inventory system, a new Spy Lair location to chill in that acts as a spawn point along with a machine to change your upgrades. On top of that they remade the the HUD so there's a lot of UI changes as they're now trying to polish the game. Additionally key rebinds are in and the gamepad experience should be better.</p>
<p>A lot more is to come with the content in this update "only about half of what we've been working on".</p>
<p>It's Steam Deck Playable, SteamOS Compatible and works fine on Desktop Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. It has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam.</p>

      <title>Mann vs. Machine is getting an upgrade in Team Fortress 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced via an official Team Fortress 2 blog post that the Mann vs. Machine mode is getting upgraded and they've called for help.</p>
<p>What is it? Mann vs. Machine is a co-op game mode for Team Fortress 2 that puts you and five friends against hordes of robots. You face the waves and then get to upgrade abilities and weapons between them. For the new update Valve are hoping to pull in some new maps from the community, with the update being split into two parts with the first around August 27th and the second for Halloween.</p>

<p>Writing in a <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=247188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the official TF2 website Valve said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thirteen years ago, we launched Mann vs. Machine, a chilling cautionary tale where an artificial consciousness tried to take all our jobs. You didn't know it back then, but that was actually a literary device called "speculative" fiction, where writers (us) accurately predict the future (the present), but then hide it so as not to cause widespread panic.</p>
<p>In an effort to keep panic levels low, and apropos of nothing, we'd like to tell you a story: Once upon a time, a Mann vs. Machine mode in a video game was getting a much-needed update. And so a brave blog post writer (us again) asked the community to submit Mann vs. Machine maps and missions in time for that update. (For the sake of this panic-reducing speculative fantasy, let's put the fictional deadline at Wednesday, August 27th).</p>
<p>If that was the entire story, you'd already be at a low panic level but vaguely concerned about a looming dystopian future (mission accomplished). But as is traditional in the genre of speculative blog fiction, there's more! The king of the fictional land where this all happened (ancient Greece), decreed on stone tablets that even though the update was dropping right around the ancient Greek candy-harvest festival of Halloween, the maps did not need to all be Halloween-themed (first tablet) and in fact shouldn't be (second tablet).</p>
<p>"Though some of them COULD be," the king carved into a third tablet, held in the stone hands of a statue... of PRIMATE GEORGE WASHINGTON? No! It's just regular George Washington in a dystopian future past where our sculptors are NOT AS GOOD AS IN ANCIENT GREECE! What an ending! (The end.)</p>
<p>Is this tale a simple flight of gripping, well-written fancy? (No.) Or a chilling glimpse into a future that could arrive as soon as, again, Wednesday, August 27th with a second part arriving right before Halloween? (Yes, see paragraph one.)</p>

      <title>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster is Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Linux gamers! System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster has been rated as Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible ahead of release.</p>
<p>In their testing Valve noted it does "not default to external Bluetooth/USB controllers" so you may need to manually swap in the Quick Access Menu. Other than that, you should be good to go when it arrives June 26th.</p>
<p>More about it: "It’s the year 2114 and as you awake from cryo sleep on the FTL ship Von Braun, you are unable to remember who or where you are… and something has gone terribly wrong. Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship. SHODAN, a rogue AI bent on the destruction of mankind has taken over and it's up to you to stop her."</p>

<p>Like most Nightdive Studios remasters, it will come with a whole bunch of added extras. Helping to keep the classic running nicely on modern systems, and hopefully pull in a whole new audience for it. Like me, I never could get into the original but perhaps now I will.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cross-Play Co-Op multiplayer.</li>
<li>Choose from 3 branches of the Military: O.S.A, Marines or Navy and experiment with different play styles.</li>
<li>Up to 144FPS performance with ultra-widescreen support.</li>
<li>Enhanced Characters, Weapon Models and Animations.</li>
<li>Additional Mod Support.</li>
<li>Optimized Controller support.</li>
<li>Quality of Life Improvements.</li>
<li>50 Achievements to unlock.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Bazzite would shut down if Fedora goes ahead with removing 32-bit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More to think on for the Fedora Linux change proposal to drop 32-bit support - as the popular Bazzite would have to shut down. Note: read the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/fedora-linux-devs-discuss-dropping-32-bit-packages-potentially-bad-news-for-steam-gamers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous GamingOnLinux article first</a> to get up to speed on what's going on.</p>
<p>As a major update on all this the creator of Bazzite, Kyle Gospodnetich, jumped into the official Fedora Forum to give some of their thoughts and they didn't hold back on what it would mean for Bazzite. A distribution that has become increasingly popular for handhelds with their gaming focus.</p>
<p>Gospodnetich stated it pretty clearly a <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f44-change-proposal-drop-i686-support-system-wide/156324/78" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as I’d like this change to happen, it’s too soon. This change would kill off projects like Bazzite entirely right as Fedora is starting to make major headway in the gaming space. Neal Gompa already pointed out basic use cases that would be broken even if someone built the packages Steam itself needs to function.</p>
<p>It’s also causing irreparable damage to Fedora from a PR standpoint. I have been inundated all day with people sharing news articles and being genuinely concerned Steam is gong to stop working on their Fedora/Bazzite machines. I would argue not only should this change be rejected, the proposal should be rescinded to limit further damage to Fedora as a project.</p>
<p>Perhaps open a separate one to talk about changing build architecture to build <em>fewer</em> 32-bit packages?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when pushed further Gospodnetich <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f44-change-proposal-drop-i686-support-system-wide/156324/93" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> it again, plainly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m speaking as it’s founder, if this change is actually made as it is written the best option for us is to just go ahead and disband the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>For people repeatedly saying to just use the Flatpak of Steam, that wouldn't work either for the use case of projects like Bazzite and how most of their users actually use the project to be like SteamOS, where it boots into a special gamescope session for Steam Big Picture Mode - it just wouldn't work with it.</p>
<p>Right now, I don't believe the proposal will go through as-is for Fedora 44, it's simply too soon.</p>
<p>The ideal scenario would be for Valve to be convinced to bring the Steam client on Linux to 64-bit, which would solve a lot of problems for everyone. It's not all about Steam though it would also cause issues for OBS Studio game capturing, FEX for Fedora's x86 emulation on aarch64 and more.</p>
<p>Realistically though, as I pointed out in the initial article covering it on GamingOnLinux, Fedora's user share on Steam is low to the point Valve likely won't care until more distros do it which will delay it even further.</p>

      <title>Merging the worlds of Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead and TF2 - Fortress Connected is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The total mash-up mod Fortress Connected has been announced for a Steam release where the worlds of Half-Life 2, Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2 collide.</p>
<p>If it sounds a bit familiar you might be thinking of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/putting-team-fortress-2-inside-half-life-2-lambda-fortress-is-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lambda Fortress that's also coming to Steam</a> which GamingOnLinux covered previously. In fact, Fortress Connected is built on top of it and so they're doing a very similar thing. However, Fortress Connected clearly has much bigger goals with more games and modes supported.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Stress-testing toolkit OCCT arrives on Steam with Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you wish to stress-test your Linux PC or your Steam Deck, it's now easier than ever thanks to OCCT. It released on Steam today with Native Linux support and a special optimized version for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Steam version is free but it has "optional non-recurrent purchase for users who want to unlock additional features or support development". Their team has also confirmed that an SSD test is planned and on the way but no exact date on that other than hopefully sometime this "Summer".</p>
<p>OCCT has tests for your CPU, GPU, RAM, PSU and more. It provides you with a special stability certificate for you, perfect for showcasing that new build.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QfwJ7LRJDyg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cb87769e0e39eb5d2e43fa8fd578f6b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QfwJ7LRJDyg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Wonderful to see more tools like this arrive officially on Linux. Seems like it runs quite nicely on my Desktop (Kubuntu Linux) and my Steam Deck LCD. This is going to be really useful next time I build a new system or change an existing setup.</p>
<p>Here's how it would look doing it a test on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux devs discuss dropping 32-bit packages - potentially bad news for Steam gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We may potentially be in for some big changes in Fedora 44, with plans in place being discussed to drop 32-bit multilib / i686 packages.</p>
<p>I hope they remember what happened when Canonical <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/canonical-planning-to-drop-32bit-support-with-ubuntu-1910-onward/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">planned the same for Ubuntu</a>, when Valve jumped in to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/valve-looking-to-drop-support-for-ubuntu-1910-and-up-due-to-canonicals-32bit-decision/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">note they would no longer recommend Ubuntu</a> and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/06/canonical-are-now-saying-ubuntus-32bit-is-not-being-entirely-dropped-32bit-libraries-will-be-frozen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Canonical backtracked on it</a>. Linux distro developers may not like it, but Steam is huge and requires 32-bit to work properly for the client and for Proton / Wine.</p>
<p>This is only a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Drop_i686_support" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">proposed change</a> for Fedora 44 onwards, it has <em>not</em> yet been approved. They're having a vote on the <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f44-change-proposal-drop-i686-support-system-wide/156324" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Fedora Forum </a>where the change is being discussed. Even if it's approved, Steam wouldn't be the only problem, there's no doubt various other apps, tools and games that would break with such a huge change. At least with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/wine-9-0-brings-much-improved-windows-app-and-game-compatibility-to-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine 9.0 release</a>, WoW64 saw a huge improvement for running 32bit games on a full 64bit system.</p>
<p>The Fedora developers do at least note in the proposal that Wine and Steam are part of the dependencies on this, so they are thinking it through and aware of the issues.</p>
<p>Changes like this <em>might</em> push Valve to move a little quicker to adapt Steam to full 64bit, but I wouldn't expect anything ready any time soon. Especially when you look at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/linux-user-share-hits-a-multi-year-high-on-steam-for-may-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's own stats</a> where Fedora doesn't even register in the top 11 distributions used on Steam. Although, we don't know what distros make up the 7% for the Steam Flatpak - but that's not supported by Valve anyway.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 12:52 UTC -</strong> in <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f44-change-proposal-drop-i686-support-system-wide/156324/14" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">response</a> to some replies on their forum, the developer who proposed the change made it clear that eventually it will have to happen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is why it’s a <em>proposal</em>, and why I filed it more than 6 months earlier than strictly required.</p>
<p>But just to clarify - we will need to drop support for 32-bit x86 at <em>some</em> point. It’s dead, and more and more software just doesn’t support being built and / or run in 32-bit environments at all.</p>
<p>Yes, some things will stop working. But I hope that we can provide solutions and / or workarounds for most use cases.</p>
<p>And it’s better to start planning for the removal of i686 packages <em>now</em> than when (insert foundational package here - for example, CPython) stops supporting 32-bit architectures and we need to scramble to adapt.</p>

      <title>REMATCH is the perfect competitive game for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I've been after a competitive game for a while for the Steam Deck and it certainly looks like REMATCH fits the bill.</p>
<p>The problem with a lot of online competitive games is the anti-cheat situation for Linux / SteamOS systems. A lot of developers intentionally do not enable to Easy Anti-Cheat or BattlEye support for various reasons. Add to that various other forms of anti-cheat like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ea-rebrand-and-refresh-their-anti-cheat-into-ea-javelin-anticheat-still-blocks-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA Javelin Anticheat</a> that doesn't support Linux at all, it's a huge problem.</p>
<p>We've had a few games that removed support in the last couple years like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ea-respawn-now-block-apex-legends-from-running-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apex Legends</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA Online</a> and various other EA titles too. So finding a competitive game is not exactly easy for Steam Deck fans. It's part of the reason we have our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">own curated anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14726296201750766119gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14726296201750766119gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Which is why I am <em>so happy</em> about REMATCH as I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/rematch-is-out-now-and-works-great-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered at release</a>. It works beautifully on Desktop Linux, and when I want to go chill in bed or on the sofa, I can play the exact same game in my hands (or docked to my TV). Now that I've put even more hours into it, I can safely say REMATCH has become the Steam Deck competitive play champion for me.</p>
<p>The performance is good enough to crank up some of the graphical settings too. I've been playing hours and hours of it on my Steam Deck OLED on the Medium preset, locked to 45FPS and there hasn't been an issue. Battery life is of course something to think about too but not an issue with the Steam Deck OLED seeing about two and a half hours - that's a lot of matches.</p>
<p>Here's the thing - I'm not even a Football fan! I don't support a team, I don't watch it or play it elsewhere. REMATCH is just that good as a game to play if you love being a bit competitive and love a challenge.</p>
<p>While the game <em>does</em> have <em>issues</em>, Sloclap are working on it and have already released multiple patches since the initial release. Still, there's some quite <em>annoying</em> bugs with it. I don't think they quite expected it to be as popular as it is, with it hitting a 92,841 all-time peak and 82,936 concurrent in the last 24 hours. Some of the bugs I've encountered include a vanishing ball, lobbies that don't seem to connect properly and more. Still, the gameplay is ace most of the time.</p>
<p>My biggest annoyance is probably the camera locking. I really want it to have a proper ball-camera locked to it, without having to adjust any other settings. They do plan to add actual rebinds for gamepads in a future update, so that will make it all the more sweeter. For now, I just have to be quick on the thumbstick.</p>
<p>The developer has put up a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534353549843235107" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of their current priorities which seems good, they know exactly what they have to do. Given that they're a smaller team though, don't expect bigger fixes and new content to come rapidly.</p>
<p>If you love competitive games, have a Steam Deck (or Desktop Linux, or another system with SteamOS) and have been struggling to find something, REMATCH is firmly one you need to get.</p>
<p>REMATCH could easily end up as my game of the year at this rate.</p>

      <title>The criminally overlooked turn-based roguelike shoot-em-up Glass Cannon just got a lot bigger</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It should be criminal for a game as good as Glass Cannon to see so few players and Steam reviews, because it's simply awesome.</p>
<p>A game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/glass-cannon-is-my-next-indie-obsession-a-chill-turn-based-shoot-em-up-roguelike-with-wild-weapon-combos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I highlighted back in early May</a> as the idea of it really suckered me right in. It's a chilled-out turn-based shoot-em-up roguelike with wild weapon combos with a certain Balatro flair for the style of the interface. There's nothing else like it I've played before and I keep coming back to it for another run, it was firmly worth the paltry £4.29 I paid for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/121675281750761141gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/121675281750761141gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The Cannons Update arrived Sunday adding in a whole lot of extra content including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>6 new cannons.</li>
<li>A brand new Plus (+) shaped arena.</li>
<li>The Atom challenge.</li>
<li>Weapon PIcker instead of Weapon Wheel.</li>
<li>New revive mechanic.</li>
<li>Reworked difficulties for the Electron and Quark challenges.</li>
<li>Quality of life improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing it is missing is controller support, although it works okay on Steam Deck with Steam Input. Most of my time has been on Desktop Linux with it due to this though. Good news there, is that the developer said they do plan to hook up controller support next month!</p>
<p>They're also planning to add in 10 more cannons, 2 more maps and 3 whole new challenge modes to the game. It's really going to keep pulling me back in.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LTWk9NP8USI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c16d5cd41f02271afee2f867769885f3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LTWk9NP8USI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You absolutely need to try this game, it's wonderful. It has a lot of great ideas and puts such a fun spin on a shoot-em-up. I absolutely love the way you change your build through the game, with various different types of weapons and per-weapon upgrade slots.</p>
<p>Really challenging too, which is part of what keeps you wanting more of it to find the best build that works for you. Not just the weapon builds though, it's the enemy layouts that make it quite puzzling to beat each level.</p>

      <title>Time-stopping Pac-Man like survivor game Maze Mice gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Maze Mice is getting ready to leave Early Access - that was fast. A major update for this survivor game that blends time-stopping Pac-Man features is out now.<em> From the same developer as Luck be a Landlord.</em></p>
<p>Blending all the features you know and love from the likes of Vampire Survivors, as you run through a maze in Pac-Man like fashion but time only moves when you do. It's a clever game idea and one of the most unique spins on the genre as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10806706951750761287gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The Garden Update arrived on June 20th adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added another unlockable maze (on top of another from the previous update).</li>
<li>Added 3 more unlockable upgrades.</li>
<li>Added an auto-pick button (it appears when the upgrade pool is limited to 2 or less upgrades).</li>
<li>Added Steam trading cards and community items.</li>
<li>Added a music track for the boss fight.</li>
<li>Added a longest game stat.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like the developer hasn't managed to make much from it, as they're not sure if it will receive many post-launch updates. As they noted in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3385370/view/518589674441148930" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> post "After exiting Early Access, Maze Mice might receive some more content updates, but it is not incredibly likely as the game is still very far from making back what it cost to have it made".</p>
<p>The current plan is to leave Early Access on July 11th with The Dream Update that will bring another unlockable maze that has a changing layout which sounds fun.</p>

      <title>Billiards roguelike Drop Pockets arrives in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Combining the classic game of Billiards with various news rules and roguelike features, Drop Pockets is set to arrive on August 8th. Developer Children of Madness has a demo up for it on the Steam page, and it has Native Linux support.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="okkeMNWv5J8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c4889679c7289dca89578fcb2ad8b47f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/okkeMNWv5J8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Billiards like never before</strong> - There's a lot more to Drop Pockets than just pool balls. From hockey pucks to the planet Jupiter, each ball has the power to carry your run or stop it dead in its tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Sharks in the water</strong> - Pool Sharks wait at the end of every round, ready to cut your run short by applying new rules to the table. By changing physics, adding obstacles, or just flooding the table with balls, these bosses demand your best.</p>
<p><strong>Trinkets and baubles</strong> - Rack up your points and get rich quick with items and upgrades. Combine dozens of Chalks, Racks, and Cues for many potential builds and ride your highs to success in Drop Pockets!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now the Linux demo is an empty download on Desktop, as the developer has set it for Linux <em>and</em> Steam Deck. An annoying issue Valve should really solve. A well-meaning feature for special Steam Deck packages, but confuses developers. If developers set Steam Deck on a content depot package on Steam (even if Linux is ticked too) it results in it being <em>only</em> available for Steam Deck. I've let the developer know.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck OLED back in stock in the US / Canada</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some supply chain issues that put both the Steam Deck OLED models out of stock for the US and Canada, they're now back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/supply-chain-issues-are-making-the-steam-deck-oled-go-out-of-stock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earlier in June</a> I highlighted the problem where Valve noted they were adapting to "recent supply chain constraints" (Trump's tariff issues). Valve did say they expected stock to come back by the end of Summer, and it seems they were able to sort the situation pretty clearly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15752647091750752220gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Seems it didn't really affect the global sales positions of the Steam Deck much with it being 5th globally between the 10th and 17th while it was out of stock for US / Canada. Naturally, it did drop in the US going from 5th to 11th during that same week. I fully expect it to bounce back over this next week for the US.</p>
<p>Even with all the other handhelds the price for the OLED models is amazing value for what you get in terms of features, performance and overall support.</p>
<p>You can pick one up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>.</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening hits over 1 million sales making it Funcom&#39;s fastest selling game, end-game changes coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for MMO fans on Linux platforms, Dune: Awakening is clearly here to stay as it's Funcom's fastest selling game to date. Really nice to see it doing well since the developer actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">enabled the anti-cheat</a> for Linux platforms including SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/dune-awakening-is-out-now-and-works-well-on-linux-desktop-but-rough-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see my initial review of the game</a>.</em></p>
<p>In a press release they noted over one million players have joined in making it "Funcom’s fastest-selling game ever", to put some perspective on it their other game Conan Exiles took a whole year to hit that. In this case though, they're backed up by the modern Dune movies.</p>
<p>The game has repeatedly smashed player counts too. It hit a peak of 189,333 online 3 days ago, putting it repeatedly in the top 10 most played games on Steam.</p>
<p>With the news they shared an infographic showing off that over 60,000 players died to a sandstorm and over 800,000 deaths were to the great worm (quite a few of those being mine). Over 120,000 guilds have been formed too. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1570442731750694390gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1570442731750694390gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It hasn't been without issues though, some of which the developer has been quick to patch, like players stomping on others in their Ornithopter which became quite a problem. Funcom have now disabled vehicle damage to prevent such issues happening. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546738448831087161" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent message</a> from the Creative Director of Dune: Awakening also touches on PvE and PvP, noting they never want to "force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in". The problem is that the current Deep Desert end-game is firmly PvP focused, so solo players and small teams just get obliterated constantly by bigger guilds and teams waiting for them to cross their path. So with that, their new plan is to adjust it to add some areas of the Deep Desert as PvE but a lot of it is still firmly PvP focused.</p>
<p>Since the Deep Desert gets reset weekly they said it will allow them to "iterate and experiment with different layouts and setups". If something doesn't work, they can change it for the next week, without touching the other parts of the game.</p>
<p>On top of that more end-game activities and more PvE content are planned for both free updates and paid DLC.</p>
<p>I'm still pumping hours into it, mostly solo, and I'm still thoroughly enjoying it. I appreciate that I can do a quick few minutes to pick up batteries to protect my base for multiple weeks at a time. It's an MMO, so there is a definite grind to it, but it's far less punishing than others.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Civilization VII version 1.2.2 has now rolled out after a delay, bringing with it some advanced features and modding support with the Steam Workshop.</p>
<p>Hopefully this update might actually begin to turn things around, with it still having an overall Mixed rating and a Mostly Negative recent rating from Steam players. Only time will tell though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13365333481750692918gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>KDE Plasma will continue having an X11 session, as Kubuntu switches to Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE developers confirm Plasma will continue having a maintained X11 session, and now we know Kubuntu will be Wayland by default.</p>
<p>On the KDE side, developer Nate Graham wrote a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2025/06/21/about-plasmas-x11-session/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> to note that "Plasma's X11 session continues to be maintained". Graham said this means:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We’ll make sure Plasma continues to compile and deploy on X11.</li>
<li>Bug reports about the Plasma X11 session being horribly broken (for example, you can’t log in) will be fixed.</li>
<li>Very bad X11-specific regressions will probably be fixed eventually.</li>
<li>Less-bad X11-specific bugs will probably not be fixed unless <a href="https://ev.kde.org/consultants/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">someone pays for it</a>.</li>
<li>X11-specific features will definitely not be implemented unless <a href="https://ev.kde.org/consultants/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">someone pays for it</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the future is still very clearly Wayland-focused. There's no timeline for when Plasma will drop X11 support as it's still years away, but it will happen eventually. There's still a number of <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland_Known_Significant_Issues" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant issues</a> they're working through.</p>
<p>KDE's own stats show that "73% of Plasma 6 users who have turned on telemetry are using the Wayland session". Again, this is why telemetry is useful, it can show developers where they need to actually focus, it's not the bad word many seem to think it is.</p>
<p>As for Kubuntu, as confirmed by developer Rik Mills <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-25-10-drops-support-for-gnome-on-xorg/62538/27" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">in reply</a> to a user question about shipping a Wayland-only session (cheers, <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2025/06/kubuntu-25-10-drops-x11-session" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OMGUbuntu</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, we have recently split the plasma sessions out into 2 separate packages, <strong>plasma-session-wayland</strong> and <strong>plasma-session-x11</strong>. At the moment we intend to ship the wayland one by default on the ISO and installs, while users who still want an X11 session will be free to install the X11 one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not surprising, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/ubuntu-25-10-goes-all-in-with-wayland-dropping-support-for-gnome-on-xorg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubuntu proper firmly moving to Wayland</a>.</p>

      <title>Challenging inventory management auto-battler Backpack Battles 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Backpack Battles is a PvP inventory management auto-battler from developer PlayWithFurcifer, which just hit the big 1.0 release.</p>
<p>The idea of it might seem initially a little <em>odd</em>. How can sorting a backpack be <em>fun</em>? But it <em>will</em> surprise you. The mechanics of sorting through all the items, acquiring new items and making sure everything is in the right place to overpower opponents during the automatic battles is great to watch. Over time certain items can combine to become more powerful, and it's just joy to see your current build blast through round after round as you totally annihilate opponents.</p>
<p>With the release there's two entirely new characters that are quite different. Here's how the developer explained them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Mage</strong> is a bit more complex than the previous classes, with a focus on interesting patterns and buff management.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like even more puzzling you can choose the Puzzlebox, to place tetrimino-shaped bags. They have a ton of cool Mage-y stuff like wands, spell scrolls, spell books etc, but you best discover them for yourself ;)</p>
<p>The <strong>Adventurer</strong> is themed around variety and variance. Her main loadout, the Bag of Giving, works a bit like a combination of Rainbow Badge and Present: It lets you access other classes’ items and generate them randomly. It’s pretty wild, and we hope you will love it as much as we do!<br/>
<br/>
There is of course a more tame alternative with her other loadout, which focuses more on tying neutral items together with Twine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a new trailer too you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1H0NcstTlKo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/28d92e32b3c95961f5dfd0e6bbe20c64.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1H0NcstTlKo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support, it's Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible and there's a demo available. Currently it has a Very Positive rating on Steam. It's a very accessible game that you can relax with. I really love it.</p>
<p>Good to see another full release made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> as well!

      <title>In the arcade Football game GOAL3, nature is very much your enemy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is not your normal Football game. GOAL3 puts you in various dangerous arenas, where mother nature is out to get you. It released into Early Accesson June 17th, and Friday June 20th a Native Linux build was added. The developer said they're still working to ensure full compatibility across Linux / Steam Deck so improvements are ongoing there. </p>
<p>Play Football across pitches with lightning, freezing rain, tornadoes, geysers, giant lasers and more. Sounds like it could be quite funny, with an inviting colourful style.</p>
<p>Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YL3D9-Xr9tY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/157ca6c6422cc36877a502bfad4d7913.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YL3D9-Xr9tY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>During Early Access the developer plans to add in more achievements, improved controller support, co-op play and more.</p>
<p>Once they add in co-op it could be another great game to play on the couch during your next party night, or just with a friend. You guys have friends right? Anyway, there's full AI matches in it right now for you to try out the chaos in the demo or the Early Access release that's available.</p>

      <title>Diablo 2-inspired auto-battler Skull Horde gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From developer 8BitSkull, their latest game Skull Horde now has a demo available to test ahead of the release later this year. 8BitSkull previously made <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/bore-blasters-will-be-your-next-fixation-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BORE BLASTERS</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/void-scrappers-blends-vampire-survivors-mechanics-with-a-space-shoot-em-up/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Void Scrappers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/fates-of-ort-is-an-rpg-where-time-stops-until-you-move-its-absolutely-great-and-its-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fates of Ort</a>. Just like their previous games it has full Native Linux support and will support the Steam Deck directly too.</p>
<p>In Skull Horde, you're a flying skull necromancer on a quest for revenge, commanding a loyal army of undead to do your bidding. In roguelike runs that take approximately 20 minutes to complete, charge through procedurally generated dungeons, unlocking powerful perks and strategically purchasing new units to build your squad. The demo contains one full run in a specific biome, with no meta progression. Much more will be in the full game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g7xEcIPxSr0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf1034cf9be996eaff19591b1d78023e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g7xEcIPxSr0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Body? No Problem!: </strong>Stunt on the haters (your own body) as one of multiple playable characters with unique special abilities, including the option of being a floating skull.</li>
<li><strong>Super Soldier Squad: </strong>Turn your army into the finest assortment of expendable minions that money can buy, combining loot found in the dungeons to gain great advantages, and merging multiple units to make them stronger.</li>
<li><strong>Procedurally Generated Dungeons: </strong>No two dungeons are alike and each level features a variety of enemy types, ensuring that builds must be tinkered and tweaked to overcome their attacks. Unique challenges that reward new unlocks and content will also keep you on your skele-toes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Steam page only has a Windows icon for the demo, but there is a demo for Linux and macOS too. I see this issue now all the time, developers keep missing fully showing their demos for some reason. I've heard Steam admin is a bit of a nightmare due to how many options it has everywhere.</p>

      <title>SteamOS, Steam Deck and Steam Desktop had multiple updates over the weekend - here&#39;s what</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve clearly haven't heard of the dangers of pushing things out on a weekend, as we had multiple updates for SteamOS, Steam Deck and Steam Desktop.</p>
<p>While I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/small-steamos-update-for-legion-go-s-and-faster-steam-startup-time-if-you-have-lots-on-non-steam-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cover one update from Friday</a> that added fixes for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-gets-a-new-steam-deck-like-performance-monitor-now-in-beta-replacing-the-fps-counter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the new performance monitor</a>, they pushed out another bunch much later that day (late evening my time). All the changes below are on Beta for Desktop and Beta / Preview for SteamOS.</p>
<p>For Desktop Steam the additional changes for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545612548924244347" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Friday</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545612548924244384" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Saturday</a> combined are:</p>
<blockquote><strong>In-Game Overlay</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added support for a hot-key to use in-game to toggle Performance Monitor, this will toggle between Off and whatever corner you last had set. Default is none, if you want to use a hot-key you must set one.</li>
<li>Added support for top-center and bottom-center positioning of Performance Overlay.</li>
<li>Fixed an overlay UI restart when trying to type via IME for users in old 32bit games.</li>
<li>Fixed an overlay UI restart when switching detail modes between showing GPU utilization and just showing FPS on some older AMD GPU systems.</li>
<li>Allow Performance Monitor contrast/saturation slider to have more impact on graph line colors, these are never fully desaturated to keep readable at low levels despite being 1px lines.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed unlabeled or incorrectly labelled UI elements in several locations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Shortcuts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash related to the controller configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where shortcuts could fail to load until client restart.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's just for Desktop but then there were multiple more updates for SteamOS and Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.7.11 Beta: A Type of Dolphin <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529849950216913236" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Screen Reader</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slider announcements not being interruptible.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the screen reader would not work after a reboot.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And the Steam Deck Client changes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529849950216913230" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Friday</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529849950216913263" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Saturday</a>:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Screen Reader would not read anything when activated for the first time.</li>
<li>Fixed unlabelled or incorrectly labelled UI elements in several locations.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Shortcuts</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash with the controller configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where shortcuts could fail to load until client restart.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed templates not showing up in the template tab of the choose binding dialog for Legion Go S devices.</li>

      <title>Mario Kart 64 gets a fan-made PC port</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hosted by Harbour Masters who also provide ports for other Nintendo classics, the PC port of Mario Kart 64 is now available to test. Completely unofficial of course just like the ports of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/fan-made-pc-port-of-star-fox-64-gets-a-linux-version-in-a-big-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Star Fox 64</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/pc-port-of-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-ship-of-harkinian-gets-a-huge-randomizer-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/2-ship-2-harkinian-another-unofficial-pc-port-of-zelda-majoras-mask-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zelda: Majora's Mask</a>.</p>
<p>Named SpaghettiKart, it does <em>not</em> include any copyrighted assets. You are required to provide a supported copy of the game that you own, so hopefully this will continue to keep it away from Nintendo lawyers. It adds in support for Windows and Linux, a Harbour Masters themed track, higher resolutions and rendering distance, an editor to import tracks from Blender and more. It's still a work in progress, so some issues are to be expected.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what the modding community comes up for it, and for what game they're going to be porting to PC next.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can find it on their <a href="https://github.com/HarbourMasters/SpaghettiKart" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It has an AppImage download for Linux. <em>There doesn't seem to be an actual license attached to the code just yet.</em></p>

      <title>CarX Street added Easy Anti-Cheat and fixed it for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CarX Street released in 2024 and just recently added Easy Anti-Cheat, which broke it on Linux / Steam Deck but now they've enabled it. Nice to see we won't be left with another broken game.</p>
<p>EAC came with the 1.7 update released last week, then two days later a smaller update was published to fix the anti-cheat on Linux systems along with a few other bug fixes. So it's now listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Street racing, high speeds, and adrenaline-pumping action… All of this is waiting for you in Sunset City. Get behind the wheel of a variety of cars, enjoy extensive tuning options, and feel like a real king of the road. You'll become part of StreetNET. It is a unique network for underground racers. Earn respect among network members, rise to the elite, and build the car collection of your dreams. An open-world racing game from the creators of CarX Drift Racing Online."</p>

      <title>Net.Attack() is a very unique take on survivor-like roguelikes with programming your abilities</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Net.Attack() takes the basic idea of the action from Vampire Survivors and other survivor-likes but, it gets you to program your abilities with code blocks. <em>Disclosure: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>I already <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/net-attack-is-like-vampire-survivors-but-you-program-unique-attacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tested out the demo previously</a> but now it's available in Early Access and I've played a <em>lot</em> more.</p>
<p>It's not just the block coding and stitching them together to create attacks that makes it unique, it's also the level setup too. You have a small arena to run around in, where you need to hack into little CPUs to grab some money. After you've done them all, you can then proceed deeper and it will get progressively more difficult. This loop is very satisfying.</p>
<p>The result is something very unique, managing to carve out a place in a very crowded genre with more games releasing in it all the time. You don't need to be any sort of coding wizard to appreciate it either, it's all very clean and accessible with you dropping blocks around and then just hooking them up and each is explained clearly. What you can make with it is at times quite funny, because you can cause all sorts of crazy attack loops to just annihilate everything in your path.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j8w_vZVnddg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f067f6a7c1ee3c344961daab5d83e14d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j8w_vZVnddg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More so than any other roguelike survivor-like, it truly rewards your constant experimentation thanks to the block node coding system. The way you can chain attacks together is something really special. It's not just that attacks will come from you, but your nodes can also have enemies hit by particular attacks activate other attacks, so you end up causing big chain-reactions. It really begins to feel more like an automation sim when you get further in, as you constantly move around these nodes to optimize your attacks. Absolutely brilliant fusion of ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks to that system, I don't think I could ever see myself getting bored of this — ever. There's a decent amount of different types of attacks already, and when you get other characters that tweak all the behaviours it only gets more depth.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11517242811750420820gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11517242811750420820gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>But you have to also add to that the traditional level-up system from collecting XP orbs here too, which allow you to buff up various character statistics too. So you will be not only crafting your attack patterns, but also upgrading your overall build as you go too. Completing a level will also then allow you to pick a Premium Node, to add special extras into your little programming area.</p>
<p>Net.Attack() really can get challenging too, especially if you're trying to grab every single CPU node for money on each level, as you only have a limited amount of time before a firewall activates and brings in a Battle Royale styled bubble to reduce the safe area.</p>
<p>One mark against it right now is that it has no gamepad support, which I find pretty odd. This type of game fits perfectly with a gamepad and I'm really surprised it released without that ready. It would be another match made in heaven for the Steam Deck and anyone who prefers a gamepad but until that's in you may want to wait.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7842930821750420036gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7842930821750420036gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Aside from the above, playing it on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu) with mouse / keyboard has been truly fantastic. There's nothing quite like it.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program your own attacks</strong>: A user-friendly interface allows you to easily construct and refine powerful algorithms, making the art of coding both fun and accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Survive waves of enemies</strong>: Engage in fast-paced, top-down action where each round pushes your strategic limits.</li>
<li><strong>Endless possibilities</strong>: The game constantly evolves with new challenges that test your problem-solving skills and creativity.</li>
<li><strong>Rich content</strong>: Huge variety of unlockables, including new nodes, characters and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really love the idea and I'm thoroughly excited to see what content is added in during Early Access. I want to program the most ridiculous attacks that I can. Plays perfectly with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. Early Access is currently planned to last 6 months to add in more characters, more code block nodes for attacks, more challenges and so on.</p>
<p>A must-buy for survivor-like fans, and for anyone who likes top-down action with repeatable runs that allows you to craft your attack patterns into something crazy.</p>

<p>That's a really nice amount of fixes.</p>
<p>You can provide feedback on the official <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8830" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Proton GitHub post</a>. They're interested in issues that occur with Proton 10.0-2 that did <em>not</em> happen specifically with Proton 10.0-1.</p>
<p>How to get it? In your Steam Library on a Linux system just search for Proton 10. You'll need to opt into the Beta on Proton 10 and select the release-candidate build for it. I know it may be a little confusing, it's a release candidate on a Beta but that's how it will show until Proton 10 is properly released.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17287691831750418031gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Then you can <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">individually swap games to it for some testing</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully soon we'll see the full Proton 10 release!</p>

      <title>Burn your cards and do forbidden rituals in the deck-builder Burn With Me</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Burn With Me is a narrative deck-builder like no other, where permanently burning your cards is one of the main game mechanics.</p>
<p>You follow the lives of occult university students who discover ancient rites and invocations with the help of their passionate Teacher. Face their personal trials, summon new creatures, synergize them, and burn to uncover the depths of obsession.</p>
<p>If that sounds a little familiar, you would be right. It was originally created during the Ludum Dare 55 game jam<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/burn-with-me-is-a-deck-builder-where-you-burn-your-cards-to-win/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> that I previously covered</a>. But now, it's coming back with a new style and expanded gameplay for the Steam release and has a brand new trailer to show it off too.</p>
<p>Check it out in the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1flLBOHe2zo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22b073e9e4dc88d2afa2c590f5e6efdb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1flLBOHe2zo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing on Steam about the fresh announcement the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2954010/view/543360749096927301?snr=1_5_9_" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After we've made the successful Ludum Dare prototype of Burn With Me, we knew that full release was just a matter of time. Unfortunately, when core team is just a couple of people, it's hard to make several games at once. So, we decided to first finish Robot Detour. It was fun!</p>
<p>After that — small break, and in January we started working on resurrecting Burn With Me. 5 months later we are here: with new crazy look, new crazy ideas for the game, and surprisingly even a story! With characters!</p>
<p>We'll see where this adventure will lead us, and we don't want to spoil too much yet, but this is a wild ride, and we are enjoyng every second working on this game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something that's really cool about this one is the fusion of handcrafted art and real-life videos, which really makes the style come alive.</p>

      <title>Narrative retro FPS DERELIKT looks awesome with inspiration from Alien Resurrection and System Shock</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I absolutely need this. DERELIKT from developer Visuwyg releases in 2026 and it's everything I wanted in a retro styled FPS.</p>
<p>A narrative retro FPS inspired by Alien Resurrection, Doom 3 and System Shock 2, with a dash of lovecraftian cosmic horror. What's not to love about that? With the slick PS1 style with full motion CGI cut-scenes, this could have fit right in with the classics. Looks like it would have scared the pants off of me back then.</p>
<p>More about it: "Explore the dark hallways of Von Neuman Outpost, an expansive research station grafted onto an anomalous derelict asteroid in orbit around Saturn. Meet over a dozen unique NPCs, manage your inventory, solve oldschool puzzles and fight against eldritch abominations!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3R84sP5gNrY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/da591bcb8e50174895bebee02b48c094.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3R84sP5gNrY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>That trailer has me insanely excited for this one. Could be an instant classic right there.</p>
<p>Highlights (from the Steam page):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arguably the most faithful and beautiful recreation of PS1 aesthetics on the market.</li>
<li>Over a dozen NPCs to meet and talk to in a robust dialogue system.</li>
<li>An array of classic and outlandish weapons.</li>
<li>Oldschool puzzles in the style of classics like Silent Hill or Resident Evil.</li>
<li>Unique glyph upgrade system.</li>
<li>12 levels in and around a dark space outpost with subtle "Metroidvania" progression.</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Castlebound from Ogre Pixel now has a demo available to try on Steam, so you can defend your moving castle in this cute looking action roguelike. The developer previously made Hidden in my Paradise, A Tiny Sticker Tale and Lonesome Village.</p>
<p>While the demo banner on Steam only has a Windows icon, there are demos for Linux and macOS too. I've seen this issue a lot recently, developer seem to be missing a checkbox somewhere to properly advertise the demo for all the platforms they put up.</p>
<p>There's also a new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nnLDi7myvvU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e5c79b38add9afe8e7bc056ac69cbbd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nnLDi7myvvU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Sent to a new school, dark comedy Kindergarten 3 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If the craziness from Kindergarten and Kindergarten 2 wasn't enough, there's now a third helping with Kindergarten 3 out now.</p>
<p>The first game released in 2017, the second in 2019 and finally you get to experience Wednesday at a new school full of mystery, violence and there's green goo pouring out of the wall - that can't be good. These poor kids, they've been through a lot huh?</p>
<p>More: "Welcome to Kindergarten 3! It's now Wednesday and the kids have been sent to yet another new school filled with mystery and violence. Green goo is seeping out of every corner. The principal and other kids have gone missing. The teacher speaks only in rhyming songs and there's a gator in the pond. Typical kindergarten things. It's up to you to help everyone and figure out what's going on."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>New Places!</h4>
<ul>
<li>A school yard with a gator in the pond!</li>
<li>A classroom with a stage for performing Ms. Lovelett's plays!</li>
<li>A library filled with books and all of the bad children who got study hall!</li>
<li>A nurse's office filled with various medications and equipment children shouldn't play with!</li>
<li>A playground with a really cool slide!</li>
<li>And other places you might find in a school!</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Assignments</h4>
<ul>
<li>Help Ms. Lovelett put on plays!</li>
<li>Infiltrate the school air duct system with Carla!</li>
<li>Assist the janitor in removing the gator from the pond!</li>
<li>Help Davey stop the janitor from doing that!</li>
<li>Break windows!</li>
<li>Break faces!</li>
<li>Join a support group!</li>
<li>Just get through the day!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first two were pretty nuts and this looks like more of the same, which is a great thing. It's getting a positive reception from Steam players too.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s 29 games to claim from Prime Gaming for Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Here's the most up to date list for late June 2025 for Prime Gaming, an easy way to add more games to your library across Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck. The initial list for June was quite short but they've recently added some extra titles.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now. If a game is Steam Deck Playable / Verified it will be SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heroic-launcher-for-epic-gog-amazon-games-on-linux-steamos-v2-17-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>
<p><em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>Serial Cleaner: Blood &amp; Confetti DLC released and it&#39;s a challenge</title>
      <author>Dennis_Payne</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Serial Cleaner DLC Blood and Confetti is officially out now bringing more content to the 2D action-stealth game.</p>
<p>The game has you cleaning up crime scenes so the cops don't have any evidence. It's a great with a Native Linux version. I had completed all the main missions back a while ago and I decided to finish all the movie missions before the new DLC.</p>
<p>After the DLC dropped, I picked it up and started the game. I <em>didn't</em> see <em>any</em> new missions. Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't help. Looking at YouTube videos showed a new intro and new menu option.</p>
<p>Then when enabling Proton compatibility, I installed the Windows version of the game. Behold the new intro and menu. I can't play any of the old missions or movie missions since my save file didn't have my progress. I tried copying the Linux save file to the Windows location but that didn't work. The old save files files seem to have been compressed while the new ones are simply json.</p>
<p>Looking on the forums, I discovered I wouldn't have fared any better if I had played the Windows version originally. Seems Windows players lost all their progress because the updated game couldn't read the old saves. They did add in a hack that if you get the Mommy's Little Boy achievement it unlocks all the missions. As the save files are json you could just edit the files as well.</p>
<p>Why did this happen? The DLC was delayed from it's initial release date. The developer admitted that after 8 years only two of the original developers remained. They had to relearn the code and also upgraded it to new version of Unity. The sequel game didn't support Linux so I suspect the team member(s) who implemented Linux support left. On <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/522210/discussions/0/819205933831882152/#c599655877779189380" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> they said "It's not coming in the near future. We want to do it, but have no solid plan at this moment" about an updated Linux version with DLC support. So for now, you'll need Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6865052511750408996gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6865052511750408996gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The DLC is only three maps and doesn't add any new mechanics but I've enjoyed it. I love returning to games with new levels even if nothing else changes. If you are not that type of person, you should look at the sequel game instead called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337920/Serial_Cleaners/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Serial Cleaners</a>. I haven't gotten very far in the sequel but I have already seen several new features and have been enjoying it too.</p>

      <title>Hack into an unethical superstructure in s.p.l.i.t from the dev of Buckshot Roulette</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You have to hand it to indie devs, they sure do keep coming up with weird and wonderful looking games. The next game from the developer of the popular Buckshot Roulette is called s.p.l.i.t and it sounds rather strange.</p>
<p>What is it? A short psychological horror game that thrusts players into the dark, cloying world of cyber-crime as they attempt to hack and gain root access to an unethical superstructure. The game continues with the dystopian, low-fi tech visual identity from Buckshot Roulette, that does make me wonder if perhaps it's part of the same universe.</p>
<p>The focus of it is on terminal hacking with various commands to interface with this facility, while you chat with other technicians to plan and execute a devastating malware attack.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, this story won't be told for decades. Will you hold up your end?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bKO3UzOTBsA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12a787aa3b4502841410ee03440ab7c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bKO3UzOTBsA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>First person gameplay with diegetic &amp; immersive UI.</li>
<li>An IRC chat where you gain intel, and learn more about the facility.</li>
<li>A terminal where you run software, navigate directories, and execute commands.</li>
<li>Detailed command prompt hacking puzzles with an emphasis on traditional inputs.</li>
<li>Original soundtrack.</li>
</ul>

      <title>AMD tease new gaming chips that combine &#34;Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds&#34; and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have begun teasing some next-gen chips, following on from the announcements of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/rog-xbox-ally-handhelds-announced-the-first-real-steam-deck-competition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, and Microsoft talking about next-gen console plans.</p>
<p>For the next Xbox, it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sounds like</a> it's going to be a lot more like an actual PC with it supporting multiple stores. That's going to be a big change for a traditional console. Especially with Microsoft again talking about handhelds, so the Steam Deck really does have true future competition now (as long as the prices are good).</p>
<p>But now, perhaps even more exciting, is AMD's latest video talking about it and talking about future plans. In the video AMD's CEO Lisa Su mentions "Moving forward, AMD will go beyond building custom chips for Xbox consoles to designing a full roadmap of gaming optimised chips. Combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs and the cloud. And we're doing it all with backwards compatibility so gamers can access their favourite titles across platforms". And then of course AI is mentioned too, because you can't do anything without AI now being a thing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kprpRvsOua0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/768df7e773c0a73fae130cf4ec6772f5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kprpRvsOua0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm pretty interested to see what next-gen APUs they can come up with, especially if they manage to make more like the Steam Deck chip that still does well at lower TDP. Just thinking about the possible power of a Steam Deck 2 has me terribly excited.</p>
<p>The next few years are going to be crazy.</p>

      <title>REMATCH is out now and works great on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REMATCH is a new competitive Football game from Sloclap, that really is just like Rocket League with feet.</p>
<p>Yes I <em>know</em>, that's what <em>actual</em> Football is, but it's the mechanics of it that make it very close to the feel of Rocket League. Not just because of the smaller teams (3v3, 4v4 and 5v5), but also about you controlling a dedicated individual. It's a game that's as much about the individual as it is about the whole team. Although, there's clearly plenty of players that think it's a solo sport with hogging the ball as much as possible but that's expected for a game like this.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jQ_GJQQmMMo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d9f7cadd5c1d16a4d2146f9e020be7f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jQ_GJQQmMMo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Compared with the initial Beta, it's nice to see a full intro tutorial in the game now to actually teach you some of the basic controls. It's done really nicely with a little mini-story told through a few short cut-scenes too. Feels very fitting for the game and doesn't take long to keep you away from the main action of online play.</p>
<p>There are some issues with it overall though and not Linux specific. There's a number of niggling issues, and some clear server lag at times. But hey, practically every multiplayer game launches with at least some server problems, it's a complicated thing to get it right when you don't entirely know how many people are going to be jumping in. I'll give them a fair little allowance on that for now.</p>
<h4>Desktop Linux</h4>
<p>My testing has been with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> and it has been really damn good fun. The anti-cheat (Easy Anti-Cheat) is enabled and so there's no issues playing it online. The only bit that didn't seem to work is the Steam Overlay while playing. You're definitely going to want a controller for this one, and it works great with my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-is-a-top-premium-feeling-controller/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">8BitDo Ultimate 2</a>.</p>
<p>As for performance though, it's been good. On Ultra details at 2560x1440, it's been smoothly over 100FPS constantly on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with my Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12528863141750341422gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12528863141750341422gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/88235981750341423gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/88235981750341423gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<h4>Steam Deck</h4>
<p>For Steam Deck it ran okay during the Beta, enough to get it to easily stick to 30FPS and a bit higher. Valve note with the Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible rating it has some small text and may need you to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard if needed. Valve also note launcher issues, but there <em>isn't</em> a launcher, as it boots directly into the game so there's really no fuss there.</p>
<p>As for Steam Deck performance now it's out. It's actually even <em>better</em>! On Low details on the Steam Deck LCD it will easily stick right up to 60FPS during 3v3 matches. However, the bigger 5v5 matches do bring the performance down, but we're still talking around 50FPS.</p>
<p>I'm really happy with it. Text sizing also seems <em>fine</em>. I really think this could be bumped up to Steam Deck Verified if the on-screen keyboard is made automatic (which I've yet to need).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15324531951750343208gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15324531951750343208gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1014384901750343238gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1014384901750343238gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>With that in mind on Steam Deck you could easily bump up some visuals and lock the FPS down a bit lower. It's nice to have options.</p>
<p>That feeling you get when you score at the last second, or catch your first ball as the goalkeeper. Phew, I missed that feeling after burning out on Rocket League some time ago (around the time it left Steam). I have a feeling this is firmly going to be my next main game. I mean that too and I'm not fluffing anything up here, this was a personal purchase as the developer and publisher did not reply to any of my emails before release.</p>
<p>I had a real laugh in it earlier today, where a player was just doing little tricks and dribbling the ball stupidly in front of their goal. I ran up, only needed a gentle tap to grab the ball and — score 1 for me. Perhaps showing off in front of your goal is not the best idea. And then it wasn't long after where I missed a shot, but an opposing player was sliding in and accidentally pushed it into the goal for me on the rebound off the wall. Love it.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing REMATCH continue to grow. It does a lot right so I'm hopeful they keep up this early momentum they've built.</p>
<p>Really happy to see a new competitive game coming out working on Linux, SteamOS and Steam Deck right out of the gate like this. Too many games have their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat blocking Linux</a> but not here. Especially great since this is clearly going to be popular, with it shooting up the charts on Steam.</p>

      <title>GOG now ask for donations when you buy games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is one way to help fund a store. GOG have added an extra box when you go to checkout to get you to donate.</p>
<p>I noticed it today when going to pick up <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_trek_armada" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Star Trek: Armada</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_trek_armada_ii" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Star Trek: Armada II</a> since I have such fond memories of playing them and they're discounted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/gog-summer-sale-2025-is-live-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GOG Summer Sale</a>. Looking over the checkout process before hitting buy, I noticed a whole new box talking about the GOG Preservation Program asking for more money.</p>
<p>GOG say that "Any additional amount you add to this order helps to fund fixes, ports, and DRM-free releases", but realistically if you do decide to give them extra, they can do whatever they want with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9625681571750335216gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9625681571750335216gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20198104001750335217gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20198104001750335217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This doesn't <em>just</em> appear for older games, it's been added to the entire checkout process. I tested with other modern games too in my cart and it's now always there.</p>
<p>GOG has never exactly been too profitable, to the point that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in late 2021</a> they announced some changes due to the losses. Going by their 2024 financial report for the full year, GOG only hit 0.6% net profitability which is down from 4.4% in 2023. For Q1 2025 it's currently at 0.8%. So clearly they still have a lot of work to do there but they are boosted by the owned franchises of the CD PROJEKT group including The Witcher and Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>Their recent expansion of updating older games is part of that work, like the whole GOG Preservation Program that recently added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/gog-preservation-program-expands-with-devil-may-cry-hd-collection-devil-may-cry-4-and-more-classics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Devil May Cry HD Collection, Devil May Cry 4 and more classics</a>. They've also been a bit too slow to modernise like with only just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/gog-begin-rolling-out-dynamic-bundle-pricing-to-complete-your-collections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently introducing dynamic bundle pricing</a>, something that should have been there a long time ago.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what GOG fans think to them now asking for extra money during checkout.</p>

      <title>Soulstone Survivors hits 1.0 bringing crazy blinding action with a huge skill tree</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soulstone Survivors 1.0 is out now and it's one of the best survivor-like RPG action rogue-lites available. It has Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible.</p>
<p>During Early Access it sold over a million and it has a Very Positive user rating from over 20,000 reviews. So in the survivor-like bullet heaven / bullet hell (whatever we're calling it today) genre it's clearly one of the best. I'll back that up too, I've played a lot of hours of this one and it really is good.</p>
<p>Blindingly good you might say. And I don't just mean because of the masses of visual effects, some of which at times are perhaps a little overwhelming on the senses. But the overall pace of the action is ridiculous too. If you love a game where you get to just absolutely annihilate everything on the screen constantly, it's definitely one for you.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_9i8pLpFO-U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3b56467eb074758a586fdfa27e3220dd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_9i8pLpFO-U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new intro the game has is a nice little taster into the world too. Many in this genre just throw you into it abruptly, so it's great to see more expand on the world they've actually built for it.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>22 Playable Characters: </strong>Unlock and experiment with 22 playable Void Hunters, each with their own forgeable weapons and unique attacks! Two new characters have been introduced at launch: the mech-driving Machinist and the fan-requested Samurai.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash Chaos: </strong>Choose from hundreds of devastating skills and attacks as you level up, creating countless lethal combinations that make you an unstoppable force. Infinitely stack buffs and advantages to create your ultimate builds.</li>
<li><strong>Hear their Calls: </strong>Experience, for the first time, a full voiceover for Void Hunter characters, enhancing their distinct personalities as they take on the hordes of the Void.</li>
<li><strong>Become a God: </strong>Invest in permanent upgrades, with a full skill tree for each character, until you unlock the Ascension forms: temporary god-like powers that lay waste to the battlefield.</li>
<li><strong>Conquer the Void King: </strong>Newly revealed for launch - face the all-consuming, all-powerful Void King and end the nightmare of the Great Void once and for all (until you start a new run)</li>
<li><strong>Increase the Risk, Reap the Rewards:</strong> Ramp up the difficulty with a variety of curses and game modes, granting even more soulstones and other materials to make your Void Hunters increasingly deadly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Native Linux release does has one major issue I observed. It will quit when focus is lost (like alt+tab). However, I was able to solve it by putting it into windowed mode, then back to fullscreen. It's been reported already, so <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2066020/discussions/1/603028826378765732/#c603033577383268325" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">I've given the dev</a> a log file and more info to help. Aside from that initial issue it works great. Proton is also an option to work around issues.</p>
<p>Overall, the game makes you feel like a ridiculously overpowered god even at the start. The amount of enemies that you're smashing through is crazy.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"We started work on Soulstone Survivors almost three years ago as a side project, while still working our full time jobs, and at the time the two of us had no idea where the game would go!" said Allan Smith, game director and founder of Game Smithing. "We quit our jobs and over time grew our team to the 12 people we are today, and 16 major updates later – with countless fixes and improvements, and a game ten times larger than we ever hoped – we still love working on the game. </p>
<p>"From the start, and through every step along the way, the community helped guide and shape the future of the game and we are extremely proud of the game we've developed together. We can't wait to deliver some more surprises with our 1.0 update, both to old and new players on Steam, Playstation, Xbox, GOG and Epic Game Store."</p>
<p>Steve Escalante, CEO and co-founder of Digital Bandidos, added: "This is a great moment for the Bandidos team: our first full launch of a great new game. It's been great working in partnership with the team at Game Smithing again and we're so pleased we could help bring Soulstone Survivors to an even bigger audience following its success in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Gears of War: Reloaded is officially Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded from The Coalition and Xbox Game Studios is now officially Steam Deck Verified and SteamOS Compatible ahead of release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/gears-of-war-reloaded-first-beta-weekend-starts-tomorrow-with-steamos-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earlier in June I reported</a> how the developers stated that there would be no restrictions on the game for the Beta, with Steam Deck and SteamOS directly mentioned. Now it's even more official with Valve testing it and giving it the stamp of approval before it's even released.</p>
<p>Great to see, as even with the Easy Anti-Cheat it means you'll be able to play (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat can be a real problem</a>) but once again, Xbox Game Studios are keeping the doors open where others developers choose not to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7529318511750327430gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I truly cannot wait to play through it. I thoroughly enjoyed the original back in…no that can't be right, 2006? Wow, that makes me feel a bit older than usual.</p>
<p>Anyway, for the compatibility the only note is that it might not default to external gamepads on Steam Deck, so you may need to swap it over in the Steam Deck UI.</p>
<p>More details of what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4><strong>THE DEFINITIVE RELEASE</strong></h4>

      <title>Godot 4.5 beta 1 brings Wayland improvements, shader baking, rendering improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot 4.5 is going to be an excellent release of the free, open source and cross-platform game engine with a first Beta needing testing. Easily my favourite game engine, with so much effort put in to bring major advancements for game devs.</p>
<p>For platforms there's much improved Wayland support on Linux with sub-windows now hooked up. They still need to finish in-editor game window embedding, and then Wayland and X11 will have feature parity. On Windows developers can now edit the metadata of binaries without resorting to a third-party tool. So devs can set the icon, product name and so on out of the box. Nice. On macOS, embedding the game window is now supported too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7512585241750326453gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Godot 4.5, testing the third-person shooter demo" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7512585241750326453gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Godot 4.5, testing the third-person shooter demo</em></p>
<p>One major addition is support for stencil shaders, which has been nearly two years in the making. The developers say it will "allow our users to perform entirely new techniques with the power of depth". They've also added in new rendering improvements including ambient specular occlusion, SMAA and bent normal maps. <em>Future Godot games are going to look a lot prettier.</em></p>
<p>Shader baking also sounds like a good addition. Giving developers the option to bake shaders at project export time, resulting in faster loading times for games.</p>
<p>There's loads more to it like improved accessibility with the integration of AccessKit, providing screenreader support. There's various other UI improvements too.</p>
<p>In Beta 2 they should also be moving over to SDL 3 as Godot's gamepad input driver, instead of continuing to roll their own which has an increasing amount of issues. Quite a big change overall, so they've made a feature freeze exception to have that pulled in for the next Beta release. Exciting!</p>

      <title>Steam Beta brings new accessibility options for Steam Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve updated the main Desktop Steam Beta, to bring new accessibility options for Steam Big Picture mode and other improvements. Nice to see after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steam-adds-accessibility-features-to-store-pages-and-filters-for-searching/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adding accessibility features to store pages recently</a>.</p>
<p>The focus is on Big Picture Mode since Valve say it "has the best support for screen readers as well as being better suited for keyboard-driven navigation" in regards to accessibility. The update is in Beta for Steam Big Picture and for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/steamos-3-7-10-beta-brings-a-steam-deck-oled-wifi-fix-new-accessibility-options-and-more-work-for-other-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest SteamOS 3.7.10 Beta</a>.</p>
<p>More is to come with this just being the first set of features planned. Current features include: UI scaling, a high contrast mode and reduced motion on all systems. But SteamOS additionally has screen reader support and colour filter settings now as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1432869891750322105gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1432869891750322105gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Big Picture Mode on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu)</em></p>
<p>Valve are now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/discussions/3/591774445091232350/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">taking on feedback</a> from users who need more accessibility features too.</p>
<p>The other changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In-Game Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed CPU numbers in new Performance Monitor not working for some users on Windows.</li>
<li>Adjusted spacing for FPS Min/Max values in new Performance Monitor.</li>
<li>Fixed regression causing potential crash when using an IME for input in the in-game overlay in this beta.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing some client update checks to fail. Users with clients that erroneously report the client is up to date can trigger a client update by force quitting and restarting Steam.</li>
<li>To force quit, right-click the Steam icon in the dock, hold the Option key, then click the Force Quit entry.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Please don’t bug me I’m trying to Cast n Chill</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cast n Chill is a relaxing fishing sim with some absolutely gorgeous pixel artwork, and you're going to need to take it away from me. <em>Disclosure: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Another absolutely wonderful bit of casual gaming here with no timers. Just you, your trusty pup, your boat and a fishing rod. There's around 50 different species to catch with an upgrade system that results in a satisfying little loop of catching, selling and upgrading. You can do everything yourself but there's also an idle mode where you can leave it for a while and see what happens.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K3GXrkqLUtk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c49b701c5432f10280f39fcd85a5ac1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K3GXrkqLUtk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's the upgrade loop that really reeled me into this one. I wanted a better rod, a better lure, then a better boat and so on. And then add to that the individual upgrades for each, there's plenty to keep you fishing. The actual fishing is a minor challenge too, some of them <em>really</em> don't want to be caught. Getting bigger and bigger catches is satisfying though, every time it flashes up to note you beat your previous best - love it.</p>
<p>As relaxing as it is, naturally a game of this sort also comes with some frustration. When you're just not catching what you want, or anything for a while because they really are fighting. But it keeps you going, it makes you want to throw just one more line out to see if you can grab a legendary variety.</p>
<p>The environments in it really are quite stunning. Wombat Brawler are certainly talented at pixel art. I can't wait to see more, and more is on the way as a few more locations are coming to the game sometime in September. The developer has said they're also looking into co-op, weather and more. But right now without all the extras, it's still sweet.</p>
<p><em>You even get to pick what pup you want at the start.</em></p>
<p>Works perfectly on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>. Thoroughly charming. If you love laid-back casual games it's good.</p>

      <title>Comic-page roguelike shooter Fury Unleashed gets an essential Linux fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fury Unleashed is a 2020 fast-paced roguelike shooter where you run through comic pages, and now the Linux version works properly again.</p>
<p>Unfortuntely, it was another game hit by the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-glibc-2-41-update-has-been-causing-problems-for-linux-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">glibc 2.41 update that caused numerous problems</a> for Native Linux games and various other apps. There's workarounds but it's still a bit of a nuisance and needs developers to ideally update their game (and FMOD, for Unity apps).</p>
<p>Writing in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/465200/discussions/0/595150691478069428/#c595152144826394994" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on their Steam forum, the developers noted they've released a new build that should (and it does) solve it. Great news considering it's a Steam Deck Verified title that was checked on the Native Linux version, so it will continue working smoothly however you're gaming on Linux.</p>

      <title>In the side-scroller automation game Sandustry every single pixel is a simulated resource</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sandustry seems a bit like the excellent Noita but a factory sim. Here every pixel is a simulated resource to use. Seems like a world I will happily get lost in for hours.</p>
<p>Just recently it's been announced that Lantto Games have teamed up with Hooded Horse as publisher. I also completely missed the game until now too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lJG0-b9WpBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/627f66d5e4074726f72a058f837220b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lJG0-b9WpBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From individual grains of sand and flakes of snow to seeds, spores, and chips of ice, every pixel in Sandustry is a physical entity with its own properties. Discover countless chemical and physical reactions and exploit them to develop your production chains, building a pixel-perfect factory to optimize every step, or embracing chaotic webworks of conveyor belts and lifts as long as they get the job done – but be warned, sand is coarse, rough, and it gets everywhere, which introduces a new layer of complexity. The resources in Sandustry react to each other and the world around them – ice melts into water when heated, which turns to steam and rises if brought to a boil (only to come back down as rain if you let it reach the skies). Sand absorbs water around it, slowly depleting limited reservoirs, while stockpiles of slag can be burned and further processed to produce vital resources.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about the new partnership the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Partnering with a publisher means I can finally focus 100% on making the game without worrying about all the indirect tasks that currently eat up a lot of time. I’ll retain full creative freedom while having a team to support me with everything else.</p>
<p>I can’t think of a better home for Sandustry, and I’m stoked to start revealing future plans for the game, including details on playtests and release dates. I know you’re all eager to get your hands on it, but I’m still shaking the sand to make sure it lives up to everything you deserve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going by the Steam page, it will have Linux support.</p>

      <title>Steam gets a new Steam Deck-like Performance Monitor now in Beta replacing the FPS counter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another Steam Client Beta update and this time, they're giving Desktop gamers a whole new Performance Monitor HUD. It's replacing the FPS counter, giving you a feature that's much more like the Performance Overlay found on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You have to opt into the Steam Beta Client to access it. Settings -&gt; Interface -&gt; Client Beta Participation. Then it's available via Settings -&gt; In Game, scroll down and find the Performance Monitor settings and detail level options.</p>
<p>It adds the ability to show an overlay on top of games with details like FPS, CPU info, GPU info, RAM. Here's how it would look on Windows with a shot I took earlier to test:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5946199641750233693gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5946199641750233693gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Performance Monitor on Windows (top left)</em></p>
<p>You can adjust the text contrast and the background opacity, I had them at max to easily show it. </p>
<p>The catch for Linux gamers? Currently, the focus is on Windows with Linux missing most of the options.</p>
<p>Not a big deal right now, since we have <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> that does the job very nicely until Valve work in proper Linux support on this new feature. On Linux you only get the "FPS Single Value" and "FPS Detail &amp; Graph" options.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16080338621750233076gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16080338621750233076gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Steam Performance Monitor on Linux (top left)</em></p>
<p>Better Linux support for it is planned, as they said in the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This FAQ focuses on the full set of metrics initially available on Windows PCs, but much of it will apply to other supported operating systems and while some metrics are not supported on other operating systems additional support is planned for later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really nice to see Valve do this. Having it on Steam Deck is so useful and when rolled out fully, it will give more people access to such a great feature without needing external software.</p>
<p>A bit small at higher resolutions though, so hopefully they add in some HUD scaling options for better accessibility with this new feature.</p>
<p>Other changes in this Steam Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved detection of FlyDigi Vader series controllers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved audio resilience to variable network conditions</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Beta finally enables Proton on Linux fully, making Linux gaming simpler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At some point recently, Valve updated the Steam Beta Client with a change to the way Proton is enabled making Linux gaming easier. <em>Quick note for newbies: Proton is a compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux systems available on Steam.</em></p>
<p>For some context here: originally, Proton had an option to enable / disable it globally. That was removed with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-game-recording-has-officially-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Game Recording update last year</a>. That made sense, because people kept somehow turning it entirely off and now it's required by Steam.</p>
<p>Currently, there's <em>still</em> an option in the stable Steam Client that you need to <em>manually</em> check to enable Steam Play (Proton) for "all other titles". This is something of a leftover from when Proton was initially revealed, and only worked for a specific set of games on Valve's whitelist. It now covers what Valve set by default for Steam Deck and SteamOS verification.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1856373141750201114gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>What's changed is that at some point in the recent Steam Beta releases, is that "for all other titles" option is gone. I've scrolled back through changelogs and not seen it mentioned. So now, Proton is just enabled properly in full by default in the Steam Beta like shown in the below shot.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13190839541750201245gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This is a good (and needed) change that I'm happy to see. There's often confusion when people try to run Windows games on Linux and end up with no install button because Proton isn't turned on for <em>all</em> titles. The below will soon be a thing of the past:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8165610001750201664gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>To be clear, this is not setting Proton on every game by default, it does not override Native Linux games. It's just making Proton <em>available</em> by default.</p>
<p>It's just one more little nuisance niggle removed, to get people playing games on Linux even faster</p>

      <title>NVIDIA drivers 575.64 and 570.169 released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have today released two new stable GPU drivers for Linux systems, here's what's changed in each version.</p>
<p>The first is the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/247731/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">570.169</a> driver, part of their "Recommended/Certified" branch which is slower to update and add in new features. It's what goes through their full quality testing. This includes two fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel use-after-free on pre-Turing GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause 32-bit x86 applications running on recent builds of glibc to crash on dlopen().</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/248665/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">575.64</a> driver, part of their New Feature Branch branch giving you new features earlier. Which includes three fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause blank rendering on some single-buffered GLX applications when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause a kernel use-after-free on pre-Turing GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause 32-bit x86 applications running on recent builds of glibc to crash on dlopen().</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither are tagged as a Beta driver, so you should be good to update your systems.</p>

      <title>Multiple security issues in the X.Org X server and Xwayland disclosed, new versions released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: 18/06/2025 - 16:00 UTC</strong> — xorg-server-21.1.18 and xwayland-24.1.8 are now getting released, to fix an additional issue related to #2 in the list below.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Developer Olivier Fourdan announced multiple security issues in the X.Org X server and Xwayland, with new versions being released.</p>
<p>The updated versions are xorg-server 21.1.17 and xwayland 24.1.7 that were released today to sort out the issues. Hopefully Linux distributions that ship these packages will be getting updates out quickly, keep an eye on your update manager application.</p>
<p>Here's the list of issues below that were disclosed along with the explanation from the mailing list announcement.</p>
<p>1) CVE-2025-49175: Out-of-bounds access in X Rendering extension (Animated cursors)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The X Rendering extension allows creating animated cursors providing a list of cursors.</p>
<p>By default, the Xserver assumes at least one cursor is provided while a client may actually pass no cursor at all, which causes an out-of-bound read creating the animated cursor and a crash of the Xserver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2) CVE-2025-49176: Integer overflow in Big Requests Extension</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Big Requests extension allows requests larger than the 16-bit length limit.</p>
<p>It uses integers for the request length and checks for the size not to exceed the maxBigRequestSize limit, but does so after translating the length to integer by multiplying the given size in bytes by 4.</p>
<p>In doing so, it might overflow the integer size limit before actually checking for the overflow, defeating the purpose of the test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3) CVE-2025-49177: Data leak in XFIXES Extension 6 (XFixesSetClientDisconnectMode)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The handler of XFixesSetClientDisconnectMode does not check the client request length.</p>
<p>A client could send a shorter request and read data from a former request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4) CVE-2025-49178: Unprocessed client request via bytes to ignore</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When reading requests from the clients, the input buffer might be shared and used between different clients.</p>
<p>If a given client sends a full request with non-zero bytes to ignore, the bytes to ignore may still be non-zero even though the request is full, in which case the buffer could be shared with another client who's request will not be processed because of those bytes to ignore, leading to a possible hang of the other client request.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>5) CVE-2025-49179: Integer overflow in X Record extension</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RecordSanityCheckRegisterClients() function in the X Record extension implementation of the Xserver checks for the request length, but does not check for integer overflow.</p>
<p>A client might send a very large value for either the number of clients or the number of protocol ranges that will cause an integer overflow in the request length computation, defeating the check for request length.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6) CVE-2025-49180: Integer overflow in RandR extension (RRChangeProviderProperty)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A client might send a request causing an integer overflow when computing the total size to allocate in RRChangeProviderProperty().</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Run a post-apocalyptic food truck in Wasteland Bites and serve weird meals to strange creatures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wasteland Bites is an upcoming questionable cooking sim set in the post-apocalypse. It looks thoroughly weird and I want it now. Coming from CosmicDev, who previously released the also very weird FPS Cosmic Call.</p>
<p>With visuals that look like they would fit on the PS1 or N64, it's looks like a treat for people who love that era and for players who want their games to be that extra bit bizarre. Here you're on the clock until midnight, serving up increasingly strange meals to even stranger looking customers. You have to balance cooking with staying alive by "dodging horrors, managing your nerves, and trying not to completely lose your mind".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gcIUu3gLE6Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20e7ea7c7ce18b2e7fc2e5eeb3d75ec1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gcIUu3gLE6Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>"YOU GOT FOOD? I GOT MOUTH."</h5>
<p>Hungry weirdos are lining up, and it’s your job to feed them. Toast, bowls, shish kebabs—raw or cooked, rotten or radioactive—you’ll serve them all, no matter how freaky their faces or their appetites.</p>
<p>It’s all part of the gig. Keep your truck moving, survive each stop, and maybe—just maybe—you’ll make it to that legendary non-irradiated beach on the horizon...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Survival cooking gameplay with a pressure-based stress system.</li>
<li>Unpredictable customers with weird requests and weirder appearances.</li>
<li>A variety of wasteland locations with their own dangers and monsters.</li>
<li>Tense, atmospheric gameplay with a darkly humorous tone.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's due out in October.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.4 brings improvements for accessibility, colour rendering, tablet support and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Plasma 6.4 has arrived bringing lots of modern enhancements to my favourite Linux desktop environment, and what's used on SteamOS / Steam Deck Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>One of the major new additions is per-workspace tiling options. Tiling is a great feature to keep all your windows tidy and being able to quickly swap workspaces and have different tiling sounds great. So on one workspace you could have two windows snapped together side by side, on another you could have one in each corner and so on - you get the idea.</p>
<p>Another accessibility upgrade for the Wayland session is the inclusion of keyboard numpad keys to move the mouse pointer, three-finger touchpad pinch to zoom in / out, improved keyboard navigation throughout Plasma, improved screen reader usability and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2268064551750160629gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2268064551750160629gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - KDE Plasma 6.4</p>
<p>There's been some subtle theme changes as well, all in the name of making things more readable with tweaks to the contrast between the foreground and background elements. On top of that the Info Centre energy page and the menu editor have been overhauled, and there's a new Animations settings page putting them all in one place.</p>
<p>For users of drawing tablets, configuring them should be easier now too with improvements to buttons and calibration settings. Plasma also now supports "relative mode", making the stylus act more like a mouse so you can continue using it outside of making art.</p>
<p>As for colour options, there's a new HDR calibration wizard in Plasma 6.4. There's a whole lot more like new Wayland protocol support, as usual I'm just cherry-picking stuff that sounded cool.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.4.0/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release page for more</a>.</p>

      <title>Nautical Survival is an overlooked naval-based roguelite auto-shooter gem</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Look away now if you value your free time, as Nautical Survival is an absolute gem that will throw your free hours overboard. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/terratech-legion-could-be-the-best-survivor-like-ever-with-vehicle-building/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I mentioned recently</a> how I was on a bit of a quest to play every survivor-like I could find, and a reader emailed in about Nautical Survival. One I somehow missed, so I decided to rectify that situation.<em> I wish I didn't, because it has completely reeled my in.</em></p>
<p>Most of these games inspired by the mechanics made popular in Vampire Survivors do something a bit unique, and I'm pleased to see again that Nautical Survival is another such game. All the basics are here that you know and love like collecting XP to level up and picking new abilities but it's the overall presentation and game mechanics in Nautical Survival that help set it apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8388111531750160278gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8388111531750160278gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For starters, most of the map you get is hidden in a shroud of mystery. You start off in a little boat by a lighthouse, which gives you a certain amount of vision around you. Go outside its light, and it gets more difficult as the light of your boat isn't very big which makes it quite intense as you can't see what's coming (unless you find an upgrade or two to help).</p>
<p>Enemy fish come in waves too, so you do get a brief bit to catch your breath. So it's more on the lines of Brotato in that way. However, it's all real-time. You need to travel between specific bits of land to access different shops, with your travel time taking away your rest between waves. Having to actually travel between these locations is another nice little change to the formula and allows you to open up a shop whenever you want too.</p>
<p>There's some other major features that really make it interesting. The weapon, upgrade, cargo and crew systems are the big ones. Here you collect yellow coins from killed fish, which eventually level you up to allow you to pick between a few different buffs like damage, steering, range and more. All pretty standard but, you also have a cargo system. You start off with limited cargo slots to fill with either weapons, crew members or packages. After each wave is completed, you then also get to promote a crew member which adds in their own special bonuses so there's a lot of ways to change your run each time/</p>
<p>It's a constant toss-up between filling up on more crew or more weapons and all the upgrades that you can do with each of them individually. Even more so, because you can add more cargo space to further make your boat insanely powered. There's also a little mini-delivery game in there, with packages taking up one of those precious cargo bays but delivering gives you a nice coin bonus to further upgrade what you already have.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vQjI5mDYT40"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e77e5981fd3196e73f11cf99917336e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vQjI5mDYT40" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's also certain weather effects to worry about too, like storm clouds that will zap you if you go under them. I really hope to see more from that side of the game added.</p>
<p>It's currently in Early Access and so I won't be giving it a full formal review just yet. But I think you can gather from my initial post here, that I already like it quite a lot. I can't wait to see what else is added to it. Definitely worth picking up if you enjoy short runs and trying out lots of different combinations with fun gameplay systems.</p>
<p>Despite it being an auto-shooter survivor-like, it also feels so weirdly chilled. Great atmosphere.</p>

      <title>POLDERS is a &#34;quintessentially Dutch&#34; city builder inspired by Townscaper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reclaim the land from the sea in POLDERS, what the developer says is a "quintessentially Dutch" city builder inspired by Townscaper.</p>
<p>With the sandbox environment you create the very land buildings will stand on. The dev said it's inspired also by "centuries of Dutch ingenuity" with you building a system of walls to then pump out the water using windmills. The Townscaper inspiration is more about the casual flow of it, with streets and buildings and the general layout in POLDERS all looking quite crooked and imperfect. </p>
<p>Buildings do have a purpose, it's not just about creating and expanding. You need to get resources, deal with transport, build up an income to grow you production chains with more products and the list goes on. From the way it's described and the visuals, it looks like it's going to be a good one.</p>

      <title>Borderlands 4 now up for pre-order with some post-launch content revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite the talk of Borderlands 4 potentially being $80, the pre-orders are up and the standard edition comes in at £59.99 / $69.99. That's still $10 / £10 more than Borderlands 3 was at release, but with the spiralling cost of these huge games (and the big salaries for the people at the top) it's not really a surprise to see the price is higher than before.</p>
<p>However there is an even higher priced Deluxe Edition for $99.99 / £89.99 and a Super Deluxe Edition for $129.99 / £119.99 which is going into <em>madness</em> territory but they come with post-launch DLC packs included and other assorted cosmetics.</p>
<p>Seems the higher prices are very much here to stay for the bigger AAA lot. Now that Microsoft and Nintendo are bumping prices up, others will see fit to follow along.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/361135121750157019gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For post-launch content they mentioned a mixture of free and paid additions coming including "paid DLC can include two new Vault Hunters, all-new regions of Kairos, new story missions, side missions, challenges, enemies, and more. Full details will be revealed at a later date".</p>
<p>More about the game is going to be revealed during Borderlands Fan Fest on June 21, including a new story trailer. The game is set for release on September 12th. I should also note it has two different forms of DRM included with both Denuvo and Symbiote.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“I’ve been blown away by how high the team at Gearbox have raised the bar for Borderlands 4,” said David Ismailer, President of 2K. “The development team crafted a premium AAA adventure that evolves the series’ gameplay and storytelling in new ways, while delivering on the quintessential Borderlands looter-shooter experience fans know and love.”</p>
<p>"Borderlands 4 is the most excited the team and I have ever been to launch a Borderlands game," said Gearbox founder and President Randy Pitchford. "Borderlands 4 is the best entry point for new players while also being a heartfelt love letter to fans of the original games."</p>
<p>Will you be buying it at release? Pre-ordering? Waiting for a sale? Skipping it entirely?</p>

      <title>Spray Paint Simulator is the opposite of Power Wash Simulator and just as satisfying</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Spray Paint Simulator is basically the opposite of Power Wash Simulator, instead of cleaning up you're making a slight mess - with paint. <em>Disclosure: key provided for me.</em></p>
<p>I am a huge fan of these laid-back casual sims, so checking out Spray Paint Simulator was a no-brainer for me. Life is stressful enough, so games need to have a wide variety of genres for everyone to get into. Although, it does still make me chuckle a fair bit that these work simulators are so popular. I could be painting my office (I should be) but instead, I'm painting things in a video game. At least if I make a mess here it's not going to be a problem…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5739752491750153745gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5739752491750153745gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As much as the idea of doing job games makes me laugh, it's anything but funny. It's ridiculously relaxing watching it all come together, and it's such an easy game to get into. With a warm and welcoming atmosphere, easy to understand controls and a simple tutorial while on the first small job painting a car that does enough to get you going.</p>
<p>There's hardly any setup of why you're doing it to speak of though, the story side of it is pretty bare. You're thrown a bit of cash to start a business and away you go. That's about it. In a way, it's nice it doesn't add needless padding forcing you through a story to just get painting, after all how much story does a game about painting like this need? But the way it dumps you into it is a bit <em>too</em> abrupt.</p>
<p>The gameplay makes up for that though. They have a <em>wonderful</em> idea here and I really enjoy the gameplay loop overall.</p>
<p>Each job begins in exactly the same way. You start off buying tape and paper to cover every bit you're not painting from the shop, then place them on the floor, to then add them actually into your inventory. That extra step there feels like it could have been cut away though. The actual masking is also incredibly basic, just click and it's there. I really do wish they expanded that side of it, making it more of a manual process as it just would have helped fill it out. That said, the masking and taping is a little bit <em>tedious</em> on some levels with multiple paint colours, with so many little bits needing covering.</p>
<p>When it comes to the painting though, that's where the real fun begins. It's so insanely satisfying seeing your paint layer up on whatever it is you happen to be covering. Much like Power Wash Simulator, I could happily spend hours and days playing through it, painting more and more and just forgetting all of life's little troubles. Once every bit is 100% done, it's then time to remove all the coverings and replace fittings you removed and job done.</p>
<p>I think the game length is pretty reasonable too. It doesn't overstay its welcome at about 15-20 hours but, the problem is the lack of overall content with it. The game is more limited than I was expecting with the amount of levels on offer. While you can jump into completed levels in free-play to mess around, that's just not the same. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0GVAf5pT0QQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/69dba868d4b398c06829d942a0bf503c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0GVAf5pT0QQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The locations are nice though, with all of them getting you to paint something very different which requires the use of many different types of tools, each come with there own little challenges when using them. The variety it has in that way is definitely good. Again though, just not enough of it.</p>
<p>It's quite an accessible game too. Not only are the controls really easy but there's no time limits to the game, so you can just go at your own pace. Leaving a job and coming back later is possible too, no punishments for saving and quitting. I especially like how you can unlink camera controls from the mouse to send it to the paint sprayer, so you get to fine-tune exactly where you're pointing. That, and you just click and it sprays continuously, no need to hold down the mouse button.</p>
<p>As you go through it you'll unlock some more tools too like a step ladder, a bigger paint sprayer nozzle and more. All of which become necessary as you get into the later levels with bigger objects to wrap and paint. Just a small gentle bit of tailored progression with nothing to really worry about here. </p>
<p>Quite appreciate the feature that highlights bits you haven't painted too. At a single button press, areas will flash white that need to be done. Some of those bits hide away quite well too, with a few of the jobs taking a while to get all those little nooks and crannies. You'll be making use of this button often, as you scratch your head thinking "it looks great, how have I missed 1% on it?!". That feature does almost feel like you're cheating though because it just completely spoon-feeds what you need to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6489200461750153746gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6489200461750153746gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Overall it's a nice entry into the casual job sim with some truly enjoyable painting mechanics but it's lacking in total content. North Star Video Games is mainly just two people and their first game as a studio, so they've done well considering and I think it's priced appropriately for what you get. I enjoyed it but I want more locations - which is not exactly a bad thing, it's good. Just needs more of it.</p>
<p>It's a testament to the great idea and painting mechanics that I repeatedly told myself, "I'm going to take a break now", and yet I carried on painting for a while longer.</p>
<p>The game works great on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. No technical issues at all.</p>

      <title>ACTION GAME MAKER confirm plans for Linux support for the editor and game exports</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ACTION GAME MAKER is the brand new release from Gotcha Gotcha Games, who are known for the RPG Maker series and it's good news for Linux fans.</p>
<p>This new game creation toolkit was built on top of Godot and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/action-game-maker-devs-exploring-linux-support-for-the-editor-and-exports/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously they talked about looking into Linux support</a>. In the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2987180/view/509583211988255594" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Producer Letter</a> about the release, they've confirmed some future plans for it which includes full Linux support now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Update Plans</strong></p>
<p>Currently, we are in development of the following changes for future updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update to Godot 4.4</li>
<li>This will update the base version of Godot used in ACTION GAME MAKER.</li>
<li>Editor Support for Linux<br/>
	We received many requests for official Linux, so we’re happy to finally make that a reality!</li>
<li>New Export Platform: Linux</li>
<li>New Export Platform: Android</li>
<li>With these changes, we will be able to support even more platforms for our users.</li>
<li>Create Actions and Conditions using GDScript</li>
<li>By allowing users to create their own Actions and Conditions, the Visual Script system will become highly customizable and more flexible.</li>
<li>“Light” Object Type for Bullets<br/>
	In order to allow for higher Object counts for developers that need them, we will be implementing a special simplified Bullet Object type based on Godot’s Area2D or Node2D, which will greatly improve performance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see. The more tools we have for game developers the better the overall platform health will be. Especially since this is quite an accessible game engine, using a special node-based approach built on top of Godot. It's based on the visual scripting they made for Pixel Game Maker MV but with many improvements. They say "No knowledge of programming is needed" as you simply connect up Actions to see it all come together.</p>

      <title>Minecraft (Java) is going through quite an overhaul for the upcoming Vibrant Visuals update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang have given an update on the upcoming Vibrant Visuals update, that brings many visual enhancements to Minecraft. The update is initially rolling out for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition but work is ongoing for the Java version.</p>
<p>What's it going to add in? Various visual enhancements like new lighting, fog, shadows that move with the sun, enhanced water rendering with reflections and much more. A fair amount of the changes are a little subtle but all added together, Minecraft will look a lot more modern and fancy.</p>
<p>In a news post for Minecraft Java the developers at Mojang have said how they're "rebuilding the code in a way that will not only support visual updates like Vibrant Visuals, but future enhancements, too – without sacrificing stability or performance". This includes "separating our gameplay code from our rendering code and bringing the latter up to date with more modern approaches to rendering".</p>
<p>Once that is completed their plan is to add in a "modern rendering pipeline that will give us a strong foundation to build upon, making visual changes and performance improvements easier in the future – for us, and modders too". They're taking their time to ensure it's done properly and to ensure it works across all supported devices and systems including "Windows, Mac, Linux" which they said they "know that is going to be a challenge"</p>
<p>So we're still a while away from seeing it in Minecraft Java but they're on it.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods is under new ownership</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Robin "Dark0ne" Scott has announced that Nexus Mods is going through a change with new owners.</p>
<p>Scott had been running Nexus Mods since its inception in 2001, with the site taking up their "entire adult life". Running such a big thing by yourself can certainly take a toll (I can certainly understand that), although Nexus Mods nowadays is much more than just Scott with a whole team behind it.</p>
<p>In the post they mentioned how "The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole".</p>
<p>Why now? They never found someone who "gets" the modding community, until now. After going through "months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching, I am thrilled to say that I truly believe I have found the exact right people for the task" and so "the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands".</p>
<p>Scott mentioned how this isn't some "corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal" but them "doing something I probably should’ve done years ago: taking care of myself".</p>
<p>They mentioned that not a lot will actually change (famous last words) as they've "already been stepping back bit by bit" with the team taking on more but what's changing now "is simply the formality of it, making sure the right people are in place to guide Nexus Mods into the next era".</p>
<p>Hopefully it will be a <em>smooth</em> transition and that the new owners know what they're doing. It doesn't sound like some big company took it over, with just two individuals noted in the post as the new owners. However, it's not entirely clear who they actually are apart from their profiles linked on Nexus.</p>
<p>Still a bit worrying though, with Nexus being pretty much the go-to for modding. It wouldn't take a lot for that dreaded enshittification to start creeping in if the new owners start wanting more money out of it.</p>
<p>See more in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the news post</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update: 17/06/25 12:59 UTC</strong> - we now at least know who actually acquired it. They're a company called <a href="https://wearechosen.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Chosen</a>, with a flashy website that doesn't really tell you what they actually do, apart from acquiring sites like Nexus Mods.</p>
<p>One of the owners has been answering questions in the comments on the original post. As for why Chosen was not mentioned, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This post wasn’t about Chosen — it was about Robin and the legacy he built over 24 years. We’re the new owners and ultimate decision-makers at Nexus Mods. We’ll share more about ourselves when we’ve earned that right. For now, we’re focused on listening, learning, and making modding even easier, and yes, you’ll see us around in the community being active.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also say mods will remain free, previous lifetime subs aren't going anywhere and that they're "not changing the core model" with no "aggressive monetization".</p>
<p>Really though, if you want trust, you have to be open and honest and not seemingly try to hide who you are when acquiring something so well known.</p>

      <title>BALL x PIT is a delicious challenge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BALL x PIT was a recent announcement from Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital that took only a few minutes to completely hook me in. The demo available during Steam Next Fest worked to perfection with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>It's a challenging brick-breaking game that pulls in the basic element ball element from Arkanoid / Breakout with a roguelite spin, that also adds in a small base-building feature along with progression systems similar to Vampire Survivors and other survivor-like games. The result is something truly delicious that I can guarantee when it releases I'm going to lose a lot of hours to it. There's something ridiculously satisfying about breaking through all those enemy blocks when you've really powered up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10408223641750079119gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The story is that Ballbylon has fallen. Some meteoric event caused its annihilation, and now they're just a deep dark pit left. So now you're seeking treasure, diving ever deeper into the put across various locations.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional Breakout, things are always moving. You can move your character in any direction, with enemy blocks constantly scrolling down vertically at you. It's your just to throw all your balls at them to hit them, catch them on the rebound and then throw them again. As you kill enemies you collect XP orbs to level up, and then pick a power-up to make your balls even stronger.</p>
<p>After each run you get to build up a tiny little base, and send people out to collect resources from it, to allow you to build more. During a run you'll also find blueprints to unlock more types of buildings too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GEK4dEOAQCc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7774e93fe64821a83b0c04cbee6800b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GEK4dEOAQCc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's quite brilliant. Tough though, it took me longer than it should have to start making proper progress in it. The speed enemies come down is quite rapid and so it's easy to get overwhelmed. The key is that even when an XP orb is right next to an enemy — grab it. There's enough time to zip in, grab the XP orb and back away before they actually attack. Once you get that down and start gaining level-ups quicker, it becomes easier when you're slowly starting to get overpowered. Easier said than done, when enemies start firing ranged attacks too, you're constantly zipping sideways to get around it all while you try to keep enemies away from the bottom. </p>
<p>BALL x PIT has hooked me into needing one more run constantly.</p>

      <title>Klei Entertainment announced Away Team, a new Oxygen Not Included adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Klei Entertainment have revealed Away Team, a new adventure set in the world of the popular base-builder Oxygen Not Included but it's a little different.</p>
<p>Here you control a <em>single</em> Duplicant (a colonist clone basically), in a world where every tile is simulated. So in that way it's a bit more like the action roguelite Noita but blended with Oxygen Not Included's building systems turning it into a survival adventure. It looks really charming and I cannot wait to get my hands on this one.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mistakenly shipped off on a research rocket, you find yourself in a strange new world where you must take control of the simulation to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>The world reacts to your every action. Harness chemical reactions, fine-grained temperature simulation and convection, liquids that evaporate, and more.</p>
<p>You will need to design and construct solutions to process, refine and build your way out of this ordeal in order to survive and complete your mission imperatives.</p>
<p>Oh, and maybe a little oxygen is included.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>No idea if it will have Native Linux support, full platforms haven't been announced for it yet.</p>

      <title>REMATCH gets rated Steam Deck and SteamOS playable ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REMATCH is basically Rocket League but actual Football, it's probably going to be quite popular and will be playable on Steam Deck / SteamOS.</p>
<p>One thing I was worried about was the anti-cheat (Easy Anti-Cheat) but it appears that will be enabled for Linux platforms at release. I did email both the publisher and developer previously multiple times, to talk about the anti-cheat situation and neither replied to GamingOnLinux. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/rematch-is-working-well-on-linux-steam-deck-in-the-beta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous Beta worked well</a> and it's listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>As of today, Valve have officially tested and published their ratings for it to show it's Steam Deck Playable and SteamOS Compatible. Valve note that the launcher may require touchscreen, you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard and some text may be a bit too small on Steam Deck. All issues that <em>should</em> be easily solved by the developer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EFMw23F-KbA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2448948162c80f1261086ef1efdb3431.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EFMw23F-KbA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Teamwork, strategy and skill are at the core of Rematch. Set against a variety of virtual backdrops, Rematch brings forth the core essence of what it means to play football from the perspective of the player on the field.</p>
<p>The gameplay is designed for nonstop competitive play - there are no fouls, offsides or VAR. Control one player on the field for an intense showdown of 5v5, or choose from a variety of quickplay modes, evolving tactics and decisions to fit the moment-to-moment needs of the match. </p>
<p>Just like the beautiful game in real life, precision is everything. </p>

      <title>Sony remove purchase restrictions for multiple major PC games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony finally seeing some sense. They've removed the purchase restrictions on multiple major PlayStation PC releases.</p>
<p>It has been quite a messy situation, starting off from HELLDIVERS 2, which was supposed to force a PlayStation Network login. However, the release had lots of server issues and so they relaxed the rule while it was all getting sorted. Eventually they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/helldivers-2-will-soon-actually-require-a-playstation-network-account/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">planned to force it</a> but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/sony-gives-up-on-forcing-playstation-network-for-helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gave up on that</a> due to public outcry.</p>
<p>Back in January, Sony <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/playstation-network-requirement-on-pc-will-now-be-optional-with-in-game-rewards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">finally relented</a> on the forced PlayStation Network requirement for their PC ports. That started with the release of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 for PC, instead offering some in-game benefits if you chose to link up your accounts.</p>
<p>Now they've removed many country restrictions from <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/833972/history/?changeid=29554938" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1219787/history/?changeid=29555142" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1219797/history/?changeid=29555257" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/137730/history/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">HELLDIVERS 2</a>. However, they have added Russia as a restriction now. <em>Some Deluxe Edition upgrades still have restrictions on them at time of writing.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1975343921750067278gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - HELLDIVERS 2</em></p>
<p>Why now then? Well, look at Stellar Blade. The developer <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=275&amp;page=1&amp;code=news" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> it's sold over 1 million on PC within three days and doesn't force any accounts on you.</p>
<p>If you give more people the ability to buy them, games will sell more. <em>Who could have predicted this?</em></p>

      <title>ScummVM announces support for Another World (Out of This World)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The ScummVM team have announced that Another World (also known as Out of This World) is now supported by the open source project.</p>
<p>Lovely to see, keeping another absolute classic alive for modern platforms. While we do have the upgraded Another World – 20th Anniversary Edition, it's still nice to see the <em>originals</em> kept alive. Sounds like ScummVM may eventually support that version too.</p>
<p>From their news post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A young physics professor named Lester conducts a particle experiment. Suddenly, something goes wrong, lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life in this strange place. Luckily, he'll find help along the way..</p>
<p>The ScummVM Team is pleased to announce full support for <em>Out of this World</em> (aka <em>Another World</em>). This is particularly noteworthy, since the original version of this engine was briefly added to ScummVM over twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Help us test the game by grabbing a <a href="https://scummvm.org/downloads/#daily" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">daily build</a>. Read through our <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Release_Testing#Testing_Guidelines" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">testing guidelines</a>. Currently, only the original DOS and Windows 3.1 versions are supported, though with sounds effects only, and not the music. Also, unfortunately, the Anniversary Editions are not yet supported. Additionally, like the original, you can't save your game, but you can use the 'c' key to open an area select dialog to enter a code to resume where you left off. And please take some <a href="https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/Screenshots" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">screenshots</a> along the way.</p>
<p>Lester's fate is in your hands. You'll deal with dangerous fauna, bloodthirsty aliens, and fiendish puzzles as you flee for your life.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator has a Native Linux version again, devs still recommend Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pine Studio have put the Native Linux version of Escape Simulator back up, but they're still recommending you use Proton. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/escape-simulator-drops-the-linux-build-to-focus-on-supporting-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in late May</a> I wrote about how they completely removed the Linux version, noting that they were seeing too many issues with it with Proton being more reliable for them.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1435790/view/505077615531394446" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> they've now updated it to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We just released a new update that brings back the native Linux build (v35497).<br/>
We're still waiting for Steam to approve our Proton version of the game and after that we'll default to that version of the game. We strongly recommend Steam Deck/Linux players use Proton (specifically the Proton Hotfix version), as it offers better stability and performance for most setups.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems they didn't fully think it through. For one, the Native Linux version is what Valve picked for it to be Steam Deck Verified, resulting in install failures since the update. When they say they're waiting for Valve to "approve our Proton version", they actually mean they're waiting for Valve to re-do the Steam Deck verification.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18367594021750065662gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally, I'll put my own note here that a developer recommending Proton Hotfix is a <em>bad</em> call, since that's only meant for very specific titles and isn't updated often. When it is updated for the next time a major release needs it, the changes between the two versions will be pretty big which could then cause other problems. </p>
<p>Regardless of any Native versus Proton arguments, I certainly don't blame a developer wanting to provide the best possible experience, but I <em>do</em> think entirely removing a version people paid for is not the way to go about it. What it does is highlight a flaw in how Valve handle Proton, giving developers directly no choice on if it's default or not. If developers were able to officially tag Proton as supported and default, it would certainly help.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II open source game engine fheroes2 version 1.1.9 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear fans and players of the fheroes2 project! One more month has passed, and the team has delivered a new version of the <strong>fheroes2</strong> engine - <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.9" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">1.1.9</a>! This version contains some very interesting additions which we are happy to share.</p>
<p>This release brings the ability for map makers to <strong><em>set the ownership</em></strong> of many objects such as Mines, Lighthouses, Sawmills, and Alchemist Labs. This feature isn't present in the original game but, without breaking any gameplay, it gives a lot of flexibility to create much more engaging maps.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17141571471750064792gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The team <strong><em>improved</em></strong> spell animations and adjusted the Scouting area to match the original game. Many rendering issues in battles and on the Adventure Map were also fixed for a better gameplay experience.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10539932511750064811gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>We also spent time improving the overall <strong><em>performance</em></strong> of the engine. All animations have become slightly more stable (mostly invisible to the human eye), we significantly reduced the computations during text rendering for multiple languages, and sped up some operations in the Editor. Such changes are especially noticeable on lower-end devices, which we aim to support as long as possible.</p>
<p>The Editor was released more than a year ago, and many players have created various maps for the fheroes2 engine. Starting from this release, we will continuously include more and more maps in the fheroes2 bundle. This release adds <strong><em>2 new maps</em></strong>: 7 Deserts and Eruption.</p>
<p>As a bonus for the players, we added 2 brand-new objects to the game: the <strong><em>Barrel</em></strong> and the <strong><em>Black Cat</em></strong>! Yes, you read it correctly — the <strong>Black Cat</strong>, which is an interactive action object, along with the Barrel. We think you should be the one to interact with these objects to find out what they do.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2936738971750064865gol1.gif"/></p>
<p>Additionally, the team updated several translations, improved the AI behavior including search for the Ultimate Artifact, and closed more than <strong><em>30 issues</em></strong> since the last release.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support, and we hope you enjoy the game!</p>

      <title>Wine 10.10 brings more Media Foundation work, Mono and Unicode updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 10.10 is the latest development release of the Windows compatibility layer, which is a big part of Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>For this release the main highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 10.1.0.</li>
<li>OSMesa library no longer needed.</li>
<li>More support for generating Windows Runtime metadata in WIDL.</li>
<li>Locale data updated to Unicode CLDR 47.</li>
<li>P010 format support in Media Foundation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug fixes are noted for Rise of Nations, Braid, Steam, Horizon Chase, F.E.A.R, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly, Eador. Masters of the Broken World, StarCraft Remastered, The Fidelio Incident, Vampyr and more.</p>
<p>For Wine Mono 10.1.0 these are the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The builtin FNA now uses SDL3. This shouldn't have any noticeable impact, but it does change how rendering backends are selected. FNA3D now has three options for backend: <code class="inline-code">FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER=OpenGL</code>, <code class="inline-code">FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER=D3D11</code>, and <code class="inline-code">FNA3D_FORCE_DRIVER=SDLGPU</code>. The SDL_GPU backend can be controlled with <code class="inline-code">SDL_GPU_DRIVER=vulkan</code> or <code class="inline-code">SDL_GPU_DRIVER=direct3d12</code>. The default under most circumstances should be SDL_GPU with Vulkan.</li>
<li>Added a stub <code class="inline-code">msbuild.exe</code>. (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57020" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wine bug 17020</a>)</li>
<li>Added support for "Recycle Bin" to the VB.NET class libraries. (needed by DayZ tools)</li>
<li>Updates from Framework Mono:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed handling of IPv6 addresses in the Host header in System.Net.</li>
<li>Fixed build with cmake 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upstream updates
	<ul>
<li>FNA updated to 25.04</li>
<li>llvm-mingw updated to 20250417</li>
<li>SDL updated to 3.2.10</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck and SteamOS hit 20,000 playable games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's rating system for Steam Deck and SteamOS seems to have sped up recently, with 20,000 games now rated at least playable. Previously they hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-steamos-hits-19000-games-rated-verified-and-playable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">19,000 in May</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-deck-hits-18000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">18,000 in March</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-deck-hits-17000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">17,000 in November 2024</a>.</p>
<p>If a game is at least Playable on Steam Deck, it will also be compatible with SteamOS. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/valve-announce-steamos-compatibility-ratings-an-extension-of-steam-deck-verified-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ratings for SteamOS are a bit different</a> to how it's done on Steam Deck with less being checked. The main point for the SteamOS rating is that the game will actually load up and be playable, but performance and features will depend on the specific device you have SteamOS on. Compared with Steam Deck where performance is <em>supposed</em> to be checked along with full controller support, resolution and more.</p>
<p><strong>Games that were recently rated <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified include:</strong></p>

<p>There have been issues with the ratings in the past. Overall though, the rating is just to show you what should be playable. People have pretty wildly different feelings on what is "playable" though. It's not a perfect system but even on traditional consoles games slip through that don't work well. Hopefully Valve will continue tweaking their tests over time to make them as accurate as possible.</p>
<p>Given the unique nature of Steam for Linux systems like Steam Deck / SteamOS, this is only counting games that have actually been tested. Many more will be playable.</p>

      <title>FBC: Firebreak from Remedy gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FBC: Firebreak from Remedy Entertainment arrives June 17 and it has been Steam Deck Verified ready to play on the go. Thanks to their work on it the game will be SteamOS playable on other devices too.</p>
<p>The rating isn't actually listed on the Steam page at time of writing, but the official account on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/remedygames.com/post/3lripdbngph2e" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> has confirmed they've received the Verified rating (developers get notice before the notice is published on store pages).</p>
<p>A new video has also been released to show case it running directly on a Steam Deck OLED that you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IgSQhXRX4R8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5e65e13eeb7bbf620b43a97e243956cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IgSQhXRX4R8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
