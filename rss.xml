      <title>D7VK v1.1 is out with experimental Direct3D 6 support via Vulkan for Windows games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The D7VK project for providing Direct3D 7 support on Linux with Wine / Proton has expanded in the version 1.1 release to add experimental Direct3D 6 support.</p>
<p>Like how DXVK started with the developer wanting to play NieR: Automata (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/09/an-interview-with-the-developer-of-dxvk-part-of-what-makes-valves-steam-play-tick/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see my original interview</a>), the D7VK developer wanted to play Sacrifice and Disciples II on top of DXVK and so they started D7VK to get them working well.</p>
<p>In the now updated readme file in for the 1.1 release the GitHub the developer explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wait, what? There's a D6VK in my D7VK! How did it get there?</strong></p>
<p>After looking over the D3D6 SDK documentation, it turned out to be somewhat approachable, so I have implemented it. Support for D3D7 still remains the main goal of the project, but support for D3D6 will also be provided, as an experimental addition. From a features and general compatibility standpoint, expect it to fare somewhat worse than D3D7, because, as I've said before: the further we stray from D3D8/9, the further we stray from the divine.</p>
<p><strong>Why not spin off a D6VK or rename the project?</strong></p>
<p>All APIs prior to D3D8 fall under the cursed umbrella of DDraw, so it makes absolutely no sense to split things up. As for any renaming, that won't happen, since the project's main focus remains unchanged.</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean you'll add support for D3D5 and D3D3 at some point?</strong></p>
<p>No. But we fully support D3D4 already, heh. Jokes aside, I have looked over earlier API documentation as well, and I can confidently say that while D3D6 is still reasonably similar to D3D9, earlier APIs employ a much, much cruder rendering pipeline that simply isn't worth mapping onto DXVK's D3D9 backend. It also makes very little sense to consider it, especially given its complexity, since there's very little hardware acceleration to speak of before D3D6 (and even in D3D6, if we're to be honest).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3158456161767367033gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3158456161767367033gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other changes from the 1.1 release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a workaround for <em>Sacrifice</em> which enables the game to properly use 32-bit color / z-buffer depth. This is a known problem/limitation of the game, which tries to use D32 for depth and falls back to 16-bit if it is unavailable (D32 has always been generally unsupported, and <strong>is</strong> unsupported universally on modern drivers). The workaround vastly improves distant geometry rendering.</li>
<li>Added support for strided primitive rendering, thanks to <a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/CkNoSFeRaTU" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@CkNoSFeRaTU</a>, which means <em>Sacred</em> is now playable.</li>
<li>Worked around missing/swapped mip maps in <em>Star Trek: DS9: The Fallen</em> (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk/pull/58" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#58</a>), thanks to <a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/esdrastarsis" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@esdrastarsis</a>.</li>
<li>Added a workaround for <em>Conquest: Frontier Wars</em>, which enables the use of D7VK for in-game rendering, assuming 3D acceleration and the desired resolution are set up beforehand. The game relies on highly cursed DDraw interoperability to work, so getting anything out of it is nothing short of a miracle.</li>
<li>Fixed swapped mip maps in Gothic/Gothic 2 (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk/issues/56" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#56</a>).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Epilogue reveal the SN Operator to play real SNES cartridges on various platforms</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like Epilogue did with the GB Operator for playing actual Game Boy cartridges, they've recently revealed the SN Operator for the SNES.<em> I was quite impressed when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/gb-operator-is-a-fun-gadget-for-game-boy-fans-tested-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">checking out the GB Operator back in 2022</a>.</em></p>
<p>This time around it appears they're making it even easier for connecting up to handhelds too, as it will use a USB-C connector instead of the USB-A that came attached to the GB Operator. With support for Linux, macOS and Windows - these devices make true retro gaming on the go or at home real easy. Great devices for retro video game preservation too!</p>
<p>Just connect it up to your PC or handheld with a cartridge inserted, install their Playback app and away you go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12701080941767366137gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It supports region-free playback of Super Nintendo / Super Famicom and Enhancement chips (Super FX, SA-1, DSP, CX4, etc). The device also helps you to spot counterfeit catridges and their software has built-in support for RetroAchievements too.</p>
<p>You can pre-order right now for $71.99 with shipping expected in April for the Founder's Edition.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/sn-operator" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve reveal the most popular Steam games of 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that 2025 is done and finished with, we can see what the most popular games were overall on Steam, and for Steam Deck the list is no big surprise at all.</p>
<p>Valve released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">special page for 2025</a> to give you an overall view of things. From that we can see overall on PC the top games based on playtime which Valve tracked as the "Most played games measured by unique players over the calendar year" were (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>Terraria</li>
<li>PEAK</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>Left 4 Dead 2</li>
<li>Delta Force</li>
<li>Stardew Valley</li>
<li>PUBG Battlegrounds</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>R.E.P.O</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall top sellers were (again in no particular order) and this counts micro-transactions too for free to play games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battlefield 6</li>
<li>Kingdom Come Deliverance II</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>Call of Duty</li>
<li>Schedule I</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>PUBG Battlegrounds</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>
<li>R.E.P.O</li>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8159827391767365063gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Kingdom Come Deliverance II</em></p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, we actually can get the proper order since Valve have an always up to date <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/steamdecktopplayed/pastyear" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dedicated page</a> to show off the playtime stats across different games on the Steam Deck. Going from Jan 3, 2025 - Jan 2, 2026 the most-played games on Steam Deck for the whole year were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stardew Valley</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Hades II</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3</li>
<li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li>
<li>Hollow Knight</li>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
<li>Megabonk</li>
<li>Hades</li>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
</ul>

      <title>Native Linux support for Hytale will be launched as &#34;experimental&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh update on the upcoming game Hytale which will no doubt be quite popular, and it will have what they now say is "experimental" Linux support.</p>
<p>I've covered the game a few times recently, since it moved from being under Riot Games to being cancelled and then revived as an indie game again and they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/hytale-will-run-on-linux-pcs-via-flatpak-but-steam-deck-will-require-more-work/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did previously confirm Linux support for it</a>.</p>
<p>Coming from another <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/2006774600491827296" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media (X) from Kevin Carstens, the Co-Founder and Tech Director for Hytale, Carstens notes:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img &="" (apple="" (monitor,="" (steamdeck="" -="" a="" abandon="" abandoned="" able="" all="" all,="" alt="RE: Linux &amp; Mac Support  🐧Linux: We are launching with Linux (x64, not ARM) support using flatpak.

<p>This is really great to read, and shows that compared to a lot of developers that Hypixel Studios are really going the extra mile here for Linux players. Hopefully the initial launch goes well for them and for everyone waiting on it. Their current plan is to have it available starting January 13th so we'll be sure to take a good look.</p>
<p>Just recently a new rough gameplay video was released to show off some of the PvP you can do:</p>

      <title>Bazzite Linux gets a spring cleaning update to end 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The very popular gaming-focused Bazzite Linux has a fresh release out that ended 2025 with a little spring cleaning, and I've finally joined the ranks.</p>
<p>Over the holiday period I managed to find a rather nice deal on the original Lenovo Legion Go, so I decided to treat myself to a dedicated Bazzite machine - and as a bonus have a little more power for certain games compared to the Steam Deck. I'll have more to say on that all soon, because it has been a very <em>interesting</em> time while testing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1650755601767362928gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Speaking about the update Bazzite founder Kyle Gospodnetich said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happy Holidays &amp; Happy New Year everyone! This month’s update is a smaller one but marks the start of a cleanup effort that will end with us synchronizing with a number of other projects in the Linux Gaming space, sharing resources and patch sets wherever possible. We’ll have much more to share on this in the near future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Moved IWD to be the default wireless connection handler in Bazzite for improved wifi speed and connection stability
	<ul>
<li><strong>This will reset your Wireless Connections one time - we promise it’s worth it</strong>,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Promoted the Live ISOs to the default for future Bazzite installs</li>
<li>Implemented Greenboot which will automatically rollback in the event of a problem after updating.
	<ul>
<li>You can see the status of this system in the terminal MOTD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replaced BTRFS duperemove with <a href="https://github.com/Zygo/bees" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bees</a> - a faster and more stable solution for file deduplication.</li>
<li>Fixed performance issues with the Legion GO 2 when using auto-vram</li>
<li>Added VRR support for the UGREEN DisplayPort to HDMI 2.1 adapter.</li>
<li>Fixed raytracing on Intel Arc and Xe cards</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/Advanced/scopebuddy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ScopeBuddy</a> is now installed as an rpm package</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-spring-cleaning-in-december-update/11408" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bazzite Forum</a></p>
<p>Bazzite land had some unfortunate community issues lately too as a contributor ended up being <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/suspended-contributor/11300" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">removed</a> from the project for repeated violations of their Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Hopefully the Bazzite team and project as a whole will have a stronger 2026.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another loss for game preservation and history, River City Ransom: Underground is being delisted from stores. The notice for it was very abrupt with it already gone from GOG, but it seems it's still for sale on Steam right now (85% off) but all the screenshots and videos were removed so it will be gone soon.</p>
<p>The statement they shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="EventDetailsBody A_A2B6fTn_MPLlGCmsLtd">
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>We wanted to share a quick update.</p>
<p>Due to the expiration of a licensing agreement, this game will be removed from sale on Steam. The delisting process is currently underway.</p>
<p>If you already own the game, nothing changes — it will remain available in your Steam Library, and you can continue to download and play as usual.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has supported the game over the years. We truly appreciate it.</p>
</div>

<p>Released back in 2017 it was the official follow-up to the 1989 beat 'em up game River City Ransom. Shame to see another game lost to the history books. At least if you already own it you get to keep it, as it will not be removed from your own library.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-28 brings fixes for Duet Night Abyss, World of Tanks, games with spatial audio and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh release of the community-made compatibility layer GE-Proton, bringing fixes for some popular games and an issue with spatial audio.</p>
<p>If you're new to SteamOS / Linux land be sure to check out <a class="gol544" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and <a class="gol294" href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GamingOnLinux guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. You generally only need GE-Proton for very specific games as it's best to stick with Valve's official Proton for support.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton10-28" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-28</a> notes it has a "patch for Winealsa fix for games that only allow spatial audio (thanks Vyroliean)", with a longer explainer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>Wine converts spatial and serves it as channel-based stream of 12 channels (in case of GTA and Forza), and then winepulse sends enough metadata for the sound server to apply downmixing. In case of winealsa, it doesn't send the metadata, and in case of stereo, only provides audio to front left and front right skipping FC/LFE/etc. Because of that, the audio is incomplete. As we can't force the correct amount of channels with WINEALSA_CHANNELS variable, I had to code a downmixer.</p>
<p>Patched resolution:</p>
<p>I have implemented the downmixer in the driver itself, and I fully adhered to pipewire downmixer's logic, so the formulas are the same as in pipewire. Pipewire does not downmix top speaker and instead discards them, so this is what I also did in my downmixer. In-game testing shows that the top channels are indeed discarded, because when I tried adding them to winealsa, I could hear more audio coming out compared to winepulse (such as a helicopter above of me).</p>
<p>Because the downmixer made winealsa sound identical to winepulse in these spatial scenarios I even considered even turning it on by default, whether you have WINEALSA_CHANNELS in use or not, and to not block creating a stream with more channels than imposed by the variable. However, more testing had shown that the best way to approach it would likely be to give the user more choice, even if it requires more manual setup.</p>
<p>If we compare sound from downmixed GTA (does not matter winepulse or winealsa, both sound the same, it's related to spatial translation in wine) to Windows, there are noticeable differences. If you were to honk in a car in first person, the audio comes out dominantly out of the left channel on Linux, while it's properly centered on Windows. Because of that, I think it makes more sense to default to channel-based whenever possible so the game can give properly mixed audio, and fall back to downmixing spatial externally if that fails. Though in the case of GTA setting the game flag for disabling spatial results in much worse results than downmixing, I believe it would be the opposite for games that explicitly allow channel-based audio and don't throw errors (like Forza).</p>
<p>This is why I created another variable WINEALSA_SPATIAL, which allows stream creation with more channels than WINEALSA_CHANNELS cap, and then these channels are downmixed. </p>
<p>The behavior of the driver only changes if the variables are active. </p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<p>Put these arguments in steam launch options with %command% at the end, or use your game launcher's method of adding new env vars:</p>
<p>WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winepulse.drv=d" WINEALSA_CHANNELS=2 <br/>
For Stereo: Use 2</p>
<p>For 5.1 Surround: Use 6</p>
<p>For 7.1 Surround: Use 8</p>
<p>UPDATE: since version 10-28, if you get a spatial audio initialization error, you can add the third variable:</p>
<p>WINEALSA_SPATIAL=1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Updates to Proton in this release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>import upstream changes to proton.</li>
<li>update wine bleeding edge.</li>
<li>update dxvk latest git.</li>
<li>update vkd3d-proton latest git.</li>

      <title>Steam survey for December 2025 shows Linux holding to 3.19%</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for December 2025, bringing with it a fresh look at how Linux / SteamOS are doing on Steam. For this month we see that Linux is pretty much just holding steady, after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/linux-players-on-steam-hit-an-all-time-high-for-november-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hitting an all-time high for November 2025</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The overall numbers of user share across platforms on Steam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 94.95%</li>
<li>Linux 3.19%</li>
<li>macOS 1.86%</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently this puts the Linux user share on Steam at its second highest.</p>
<p>And as usual here's a snapshot look at the trend over time from our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker statistics page</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18416311951767361210gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18416311951767361210gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Last month I did a small tweak to that page, to improve how we handle the event markers. Since you can select different dates, sometimes they went off the chart - now their positioning is a <em>lot</em> smarter. And, as per requests, it shows when Windows 10 hit end of life too. Hopefully you continue to find it useful for a historical look.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As for December 2025 the most popular Linux distributions were:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 20.41% -6.01%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 12.24% +2.27%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 8.45% +1.71%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.2 64 bit 8.43% +1.07%</li>
<li>Bazzite 64 bit 6.60% +1.07%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 25.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.72% -0.24%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS 64 bit 4.12% +0.26%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.92% +0.82%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.25% +0.35%</li>
<li>Fedora Linux 43 (KDE Plasma Desktop Edition) 64 bit 2.20% +2.20%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 2.17% -2.12%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 2.15% +0.25%</li>
<li>Other 23.88% +3.45%</li>

      <title>CD PROJEKT and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński acquires GOG from CD PROJEKT</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> is breaking off from CD PROJEKT with 100% of it now owned by one of the original co-founders, Michał Kiciński, who is a co-founder of both GOG and CD PROJEKT.</p>
<p>With this move, GOG will continue operating independently but there's an agreement that's been signed between CD PROJEKT and GOG for future cooperation including releasing games on GOG from CD PROJEKT RED. The purchase of GOG came at a cost of PLN 90.7 million and Kiciński continues holding their shares in CD PROJEKT too as co-founder but now owns 100% of the shares in GOG.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“CD PROJEKT and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership. I believe that CD PROJEKT, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering — making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much,” said Michał Kiciński. “As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026,” concluded Kiciński.</p>
<p>“GOG and Michał Kiciński are aligned by a shared belief that games should live forever,” said Maciej Gołębiewski, Managing Director of GOG. “In a market that’s getting more crowded, more locked-in, and forgets classic games at an increasing pace, we’re doubling down on what only GOG does: reviving classics, keeping them playable on modern PCs, and helping great games find their audience over time” he added.</p>
<p>“With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move,” said Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CD PROJEKT. “For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes. We would like to thank the GOG team for years of fruitful cooperation and wish them all the best. And to the GOG community, I say ‘see you around’, because our upcoming releases will naturally be available on GOG as well”, he added.</p>

      <title>Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from GamingOnLinux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're just about to hit the full swing of the holiday season, and so GamingOnLinux will go into its usual holiday hibernation to spend time with family.</p>
<p>It has been an absolutely <strong>crazy</strong> year not just for Linux gaming, but for the industry as a whole. We've seen tons of progress for open source, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/linux-players-on-steam-hit-an-all-time-high-for-november-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux has reached new heights</a> on Steam and we've got the new <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a> coming next year with SteamOS. Next year is going to be truly <em>nuts</em> and it feels like a true privilege to be able to continue to cover everything daily thanks to all our supporters. Although we do have the doom and gloom of generative AI, and the price hikes on various bits of hardware hanging over us right now, it's also going to be a tough year on that side of things too.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s our 2025 GOTY picks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The year is almost over and so it’s time to let you know what we enjoyed the most this year while gaming on Linux. Doing things a little differently this time, I pulled in some long-time contributors in the community from moderators to article contributors to give their picks too.</p>
<p><strong>Samsai - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deltarune</a></strong></p>
<p>The first parts of Deltarune didn't come out in 2025 and we didn't even get all of it in 2025, but what we did get was still some of the best video gaming fun I have enjoyed not only in 2025 but in the past few years as a whole.</p>
<p>Deltarune has wonderfully witty and funny writing, excellent music, likeable characters and a mystery of a story that I am looking forward to unraveling more in 2026 when the next chapters drop. And don't forget, if you find yourself in the dark, go and eat some moss. It's a delicacy.</p>
<p><strong>Dpanter - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dying Light: The Beast</a></strong></p>
<p>Techland finally delivered a proper sequel to the stellar hit game from 2015, after trying and failing with the ill-fated multiplayer-only title Dying Light: Bad Blood (2018) and the middling numerical sequel release in 2022. I'm of course entirely biased as the original game remains one of my all top time video game favorites, any genre, any platform. That doesn't change the facts and Dying Light is firmly etched into the pages of gaming history as one of the greatest games ever.</p>
<p>This spiritually true sequel is a loving embrace from Techland, having heard and listened to their fans over more than a decade by now. Most of the things beloved in DL1 returns in The Beast, and most of the nonsense from DL2 has been excised. Of course, it cannot be entirely cleansed from DL2 influences as it was originally intended to be a DL2 DLC, and of course it has lots of the classic Techland jank we all know and love.</p>
<p>I would argue no other "AAA" game company in existence cares about their fans more than Techland, and this game proves it beyond any doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Scaine - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2457220/Avowed/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Avowed</a></strong></p>
<p>Skyrim has a lot to answer for when it comes to open world games. Despite its jank, it set the bar almost unreasonably high back 2011, 14 years ago. So I was delighted when I pulled the trigger on Avowed recently, which turned out to a true successor to Skyrim in all the right ways. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment, it has all the features you’d hope for from a Skyrim competitor, such as deep character creation, skill trees, a packed, interesting open world, and some you don’t, like engaging party-based combat, and a driven story line that keeps you on track for around 40 hours minimum.</p>
<p>Combat feels very physical, reminiscent of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, or perhaps the Dying Light games. Swinging a heavy weapon has a satisfying weight of impact on connection, and the magic tree features pleasing elemental effects such as blast, freeze or burn.</p>
<p>Is it Skyrim mk2? Not quite, but it’s the first modern game attempting to not just match Skyrim but exceed it, and it’s my game of the year for 2025.</p>
<p><strong>BTRE</strong></p>
<p>It’s always difficult to pick a single game as my favorite for a given year. It doesn’t help matters that I typically spend most of the year playing through my backlog of games from previous years. This means that I typically only buy very few games on release and that they’re typically niche indie games. That said, the big exception this year was<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-is-out-now-with-linux-support-and-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Civilization VII</a>. In terms of time spent playing I’ve put in around 580 hours which makes it my most-played game this year. It’s a game that has its faults and many players won’t enjoy its different direction but I’ve found something there that’s interesting and challenging in its own right, especially after the various quality of life and improvement patches since launch.</p>
<p>I can’t settle on a single title for game of the year, especially as 2025 proved to be great for indie games.<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksong-is-out-now-with-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Silksong</a> proved to be a masterclass in presentation and, paired with its responsive controls, is a treat to play and conquer its challenges.<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/kaizen-a-factory-story-is-a-great-return-from-the-zachtronics-team/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Kaizen</a> and the return of Zach Barth’s style of puzzles into the gaming world was very welcome; I enjoyed the vibe and atmosphere of 80s Japan while trying to optimize my solutions. The very colorful and focused<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246470/Kulebra_and_the_Souls_of_Limbo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Kulebra</a> deserves a mention as does the usual fun and frantic gameplay that I had fun with in the latest entry in the long-running Touhou series of shoot ’em ups,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3671710/Touhou_Kinjoukyou__Fossilized_Wonders/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Fossilized Wonders</a>. Scratching my strategy and roguelike itch these past few days is also<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/keep-a-close-eye-on-your-kingdom-in-the-king-is-watching/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> The King is Watching</a>, which I think is worth a mention. Lastly, both<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/monster-prom-4-monster-con-now-has-a-demo-live-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Monster Prom 4: Monster Con</a> and<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/stories-from-sol-the-gun-dog-is-a-seriously-cool-visual-novel-love-letter-to-retro-anime-and-80s-sci-fi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog</a> were delightful—the former’s irreverence and charm made me smile at times and the latter’s homage to Japanese ADV games, distinct visual style, and cool setting made for an engaging experience.</p>
<p><strong>Liam - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dispatch</a></strong></p>
<p>Not many games are able to hook me to the point that I have to finish them as <em>quickly</em> as I can, keeping me at the edge of my seat because I just need to know how it ends. Dispatch was that for me this year. With its excellent mixture of wonderful animated scenes, some top-class voice acting and cleverly done hero management with all the little quips between characters it has a really quality blend of features. Everything came together so amazingly to present an experience that just feels so rare nowadays.</p>
<p>I <em>need</em> more like it to release. Sounds like we <em>might</em> be getting a Season 2 of Dispatch, so that makes me even happier.</p>

      <title>Siren is an awesome looking Aliens inspired Doom II conversion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking a slower approach with inspiration taken from the likes of Aliens, the Doom II conversion named Siren looks really awesome for retro FPS fans.</p>
<p>In the original ZDoom forum post the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This aims to be an experience closer to an 'Aliens' game but with the variety and gameplay benefits the rosta of Doom monsters brings. This is a slower, more perilous mod that aims to tell its story through its own set of levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just recently the developer put up Siren version 0.9 along with a new trailer to show it off and wow - it definitely captured my interest right away. This looks absolutely awesome.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xTEfgwgm-fw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/48c37ef5fd6dacc0eb0b06b6c49b813d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xTEfgwgm-fw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It <em>should</em> work with GZDoom / UZDoom, but unfortunately I've been unable to get the brand new 0.9 version to actually work. After a brief logo intro, it will always give me an error, which I've let the developer know about - so hopefully we can get it working easily enough soon.</p>

      <title>Keep creatures fed in the deck-builder Hungry Horrors when it arrives January 19 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by British and Irish folklore, Hungry Horrors is a deck-builder with an unusual purpose - to have you feed the monsters to keep them away. A demo is still currently available on the Steam page.</p>
<p>I previously played a good amount of this in some of the previews and demo, and really love the idea and setting. Definitely one you need to keep on your watchlist.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Hungry Horrors, you play as a spoilt princess forced into action when a ravenous curse spreads across her kingdom and a dragon awakens at its heart. To save the realm, she must perfect her cooking and feed the Horrors drawn from British and Irish legend, under the watchful supervision of a sharp-tongued, sarcastic cat who never misses a chance to comment."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2r2G8UQdbkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95508183559d21cd7f7f2e0e9d07adf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2r2G8UQdbkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What it will include at Early Access:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="styles_listContainer__PSxE8">
<ul>
<li><strong>Five playable biomes</strong>: Caves, Woods, Bogs, Meadows, and the Town, plus the Dungeon and the Kitchen.</li>
<li><strong>20 folklore Horrors</strong>, drawn from British and Irish myth, including Dullahan, Jenny Greenteeth, and Queen Mab.</li>
<li><strong>42 playable dishes</strong> based on real traditional recipes from Britain and Ireland.</li>
<li><strong>8 legendary characters</strong> to encounter, such as Herne the Hunter and the Wulver.</li>
<li>Seasonings, cookware, potions, and artefacts that alter how you play.</li>
<li>Core progression through the Book of Taliesin, unlocking new mechanics and strengthening future runs.</li>
<li><strong>Unique fatality animations</strong> for every Horror.</li>
<li><strong>Five original music tracks</strong> composed for the game by Henry Taylor.</li>
<li>Easter eggs, unlockable mechanics, Steam achievements, and hidden interactions.</li>
<li>Full controller support, plus mouse-only and keyboard-only play modes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux Mint 22.3 gets a Beta release with lots of new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 22.3 is set to be the next long-term supported release and a Beta is now here you can test, with a surprising amount of new features. <em>It will be supported until 2029.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully making issues easier to trace, they've upgraded and rebranded the System Reports tool into a new System Information app that gives you four new pages of system details. This includes now pages for System Information, System Reports, Crash Reports, USB, GPU, PCI and BIOS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14288343961766406811gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14288343961766406811gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - testing the Linux Mint 22.3 Beta</em></p>
<p>On top of that there's a new System Administration tool included, which has a boot menu configuration page available.</p>
<p>There's plenty of additions to themes as well wth a new XApp Symbolic Icons (XSI) set to give application developers (and the Mint team) a set of standard application icons. They said it was made due to GNOME's Adwaita no longer supporting applications outside of GNOME. And with this now available all XApp, Cinnamon, and Linux Mint projects have since migrated to XSI.</p>
<p>Cinnamon Desktop 6.6 is a big one too. There's improvements to keyboard layout support, with keyboard layouts being fully Wayland compatible now too. Another upgrade is the brand new Cinnamon Menu with a modern layout and different layout options.</p>
<p>The file manager Nemo also got improved thumbnail support, a template manager and better search accuracy.</p>
<p>Even the window list had a nice tweak to show notification badges for when you miss things. There's plenty more to see in the blog post <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4973" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> and release <a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/rel_zena_whatsnew.php" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlights page</a>.</p>
<p><em>According to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/linux-players-on-steam-hit-an-all-time-high-for-november-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Steam survey</a>, Linux Mint accounts for around 9.32% of all Linux gamers on Steam.</em></p>

      <title>Free and open source Settlers-like, Widelands v1.3 is out with market trading and new maps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Widelands continues to grow as a great free and open source Settlers-like strategy game, with a brand new holiday release out now. It's fun seeing projects like this continue on for so long, especially as I grew up playing the likes of The Settlers on the Amiga and later Settlers 2 on PC. Good times, absolute classics. </p>
<p>The game has singleplayer and multiplayer support, with the developers noting it was originally inspired by Settlers 2 but has "significantly more variety and depth to it".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16221898761766404614gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16221898761766404614gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The main highlights of the release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Market trading.</li>
<li>Six new maps added and three old maps removed.</li>
<li>Economy districts.</li>
<li>Many improvements to the in-game Encyclopedia.</li>
<li>Download website maps as add-ons.</li>
<li>New visualisation modes in the editor.</li>
<li>Many new capabilities for add-on developers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's available for Linux as an AppImage from the official site, or on Flathub (not up to date at time of writing).</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-27 brings fixes for Star Citizen, The First Descendant and more tweaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Become the piece you capture in the chess-inspired Mate&#39;Morphosis on January 9 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Twisting the classic chess into a strategy game where you become the piece you capture, as you try to outsmart the board on January 9, 2026. After getting hooked in by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/below-the-crown-is-an-curious-brew-of-chess-and-dungeon-crawling-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Below the Crown</a> I'm keen to see what other developers can do with chess.</p>
<p>Doing this differently once again, here you only control a single piece which you use to capture other pieces and assume their form and take their moves. So each capture changes how you'll be playing the game, so it's all about planning ahead to complete each board puzzle.</p>
<p>See the original trailer below:</p>

<p>A demo is available on the Steam page but only for Windows and macOS, but the full game indicates it will have Linux support. You could try the demo in Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>At launch the developer said it will have these features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>60+ Unique &amp; Clever Boards:</strong> Challenge your strategic thinking with over sixty expertly designed and distinct puzzle-like boards, each requiring a fresh approach to the rules of movement and victory.</li>
<li><strong>Deep Customization:</strong> Personalize your game experience! Customize your pieces and board with a variety of different aesthetic and variant options, allowing you to tailor the game's look and feel to your preference.</li>
<li><strong>Accessible Worldwide:</strong> Enjoy the full experience in your native tongue with <strong>Localizations of 10 languages</strong> supported from day one.</li>
<li><strong>Full Input Support:</strong> Play the way you want with comprehensive support for Mouse, Keyboard, and Controllers across all menus and gameplay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Evolution sim Thrive hits the 1.0 release completing the microbe stage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is an open source evolution sim that plans to add many different stages of life with the microbe stage now considered actually ready.</p>
<p>Still far from complete since they want to add 9 different stages but their main development effort will now begin moving onto multicellular which they estimate will take a year to finish. And, after that, they'll then move onto the macroscopic stage. Much like life itself, we're watching evolution happen here.</p>
<p>There's a bunch that's new with this release including new terrain textures, new events and various other smaller tweaks. Check out their new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LmIwSBvXGQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6ed0a3654056530c7598cfb0b0c9310.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LmIwSBvXGQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Thrive is entirely free and open source but you can buy it from stores to support the development. It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible.</p>

      <title>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check set for release on January 12 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Devolver Digital announced that Quarantine Zone: The Last Check from Brigada Games is now set for release on January 12, 2026. I initially stayed away from this one, as the developer was originally using some generative AI content for voice overs with the earlier demos, which has thankfully now been removed.</p>
<p>What is it? Quarantine Zone: The Last Check puts you in charge of a critical checkpoint during a zombie outbreak. Armed with advanced screening tools and your own instincts, you must decide who gets through and who stays behind. One wrong choice could let the infection slip past your post. But holding the line is only the beginning. You’ll need to manage scarce resources, reinforce defenses, and keep your camp alive as chaos intensifies with each passing day.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 project fheroes2 version 1.1.13 has been released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear players of Heroes of Might and Magic II and fans of the fheroes2 project! Just in time for the holidays, we are happy to announce a new version of the <strong><em>fheroes2</em></strong> engine - <strong><a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.13" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">1.1.13</a></strong>. As usual, this release includes a variety of interesting changes and improvements. Let’s take a deeper dive into the details.</p>
<p>First of all, since the announcement of the <strong><em>Random Map Generator</em></strong> in the previous release, we have made significant progress on this feature. The team added a user-friendly UI for the map generator and improved many aspects of map generation, including the placement of roads, objects, and monsters. More features and refinements are planned for future releases.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12036792831766400435gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The <strong><em>iOS build</em></strong> has also seen solid progress since the last release. We fixed multiple issues, made the build process much easier, added documentation, and introduced automated builds. Some additional work is still required, and iOS build will be available for public download very soon.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>AI</em></strong> is now capable of using the Teleport and Earthquake spells, it has more effective spell use in battles, and it spends spell points more wisely. These changes make AI opponents harder to predict and add more variety to the gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/984335771766400455gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The <strong><em>Editor</em></strong> received a highly requested feature - drag-to-draw support for the Terrain and Erase brushes. This improvement helps map makers create maps more efficiently, especially on touch-screen devices where such functionality is essential.</p>
<p>In addition to performance improvements and reduced RAM usage, the team enhanced several UI elements in both gameplay and the Editor, updated translations, and closed over 30 issues since the last release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20939121711766400482gol1.png"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13156897961766400481gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Thank you very much for your continued support, and we wish you happy holidays!</p>

      <title>Latest Steam stable update is live as Windows gets 64-bit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the latest stable update for Steam across Desktop, Steam Deck / SteamOS and we have all the changes here for you to see.</p>
<p>While the 64-bit change only affects Windows, the Linux client may not be too far behind given some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-put-up-a-new-steam-linux-runtime-4-0-with-a-move-towards-64-bit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent changes to the Steam Linux Runtime</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/528740542771627405" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a> for Desktop Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Steam client is now 64-bit on Windows 11 and Windows 10 64-bit.
	<ul>
<li>Systems running 32-bit versions of Windows will continue receiving updates to the 32-bit Steam client until January 1, 2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed non-Steam browser windows erroneously being created sometimes when steamwebhelper is restarted.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Game Recording</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed errors copying to clipboard or exporting H265 videos on systems with a NVIDIA 50xx series gpu.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Friends &amp; Chat</strong>
<ul>
<li>Suspicious or harassing group chat messages can now be reported directly in the chat window by right clicking the message. You can optionally block and/or unfriend the other user while submitting the report.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Big Picture Mode</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed intermittent in-game purchase failures for some games.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed being unable to move the mouse to another monitor when using touch controls on the Steam Link app.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Nintendo Switch 2 controllers connected over USB on Windows</li>
<li>Added support for GameCube adapters in Wii-U mode with rumble on Windows</li>
<li>Added an "Invert Input" toggle in "Regular Press" activator settings. When enabled, this causes button presses to generate releases, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Promoted the newer gyro modes from beta to the default gyro modes loaded. Older configuration that are using the older modes will still see the option and you can also enable Steam Input dev mode under Settings-&gt;Developer to keep them visible all the time.</li>
<li>Adjusted Dualsense "Create" and "Options" glyphs for better recall.</li>
<li>In all Gyro Modes, when selecting multiple gyro activation buttons, you can also choose whether "Any" or "All" buttons are required to Enable/Suppress/Toggle the gyro.</li>
<li>Gyro Haptic On/Off effect is now separated from Gyro Haptic Rotation Effect.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick Deflection Mode: Added "Use Relative Roll" &amp; "Use Relative Pitch" toggles. When enabled, this makes the output Joystick deflection relative to the controller's pose since the Gyro's activation. i.e. turning on the gyro will always center the stick output. When disabled, the deflection angle is absolute vs. the controller's gravity sensor. Previously this was only possible for "Pitch" (old name: "World Auto Tilt"), but it's now available for Roll as well.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick Deflection: "Relative Roll" and "Relative Pitch" toggles are only available if a Gyro Activation Button is selected, because the angles are relative to the pose of the controller each time the Gyro is activated.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the desktop version of the configurator could unexpectedly close when trying to preview a configuration for another game on the Search tab</li>
<li>Fixed Dualsense Edge, Xbox Elite, Nintendo JoyCons in paired mode not finding the correct config to edit.</li>
<li>Fixed Gyro to Joystick Deflection: Lock Extents not working as intended.</li>
<li>Fixed Gyro to Joystick Deflection: Some combinations of "Relative Roll" and "Relative Pitch" toggles resulted in zero joystick output.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And also for Steam Deck / SteamOS these look to be specific from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/500593045099513244" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Selecting Sleep in the Power menu will now prompt the user to enter Display-off downloads when appropriate.</li>
<li>Fixed news items not updating in the "What's New" tab on the Home screen.</li>
<li>On the Bluetooth settings screen, we will now detect and notify the player when trying to pair/connect an Xbox controller with older firmware versions that cannot properly connect to Steam Deck. To fix these issues you must connect the controller to a Windows PC and update the firmware via the Xbox Accessories App.</li>
<li>Moved the Screen Reader's "Stop Talking" button to X so that external gamepads can still open the Quick Access Menu with Guide button + their equivalent of A button.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Valve discontinuing the last Steam Deck LCD model</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have done this pretty quietly, but they're discontinuing the last Steam Deck LCD model now with just the Steam Deck OLED remaining.</p>
<p>There was no press announcement (we're waiting on a reply from Valve about it), and no announcement about it across anywhere else I can see. However, the official Steam Deck page now notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2106340021766236950gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Originally it just stated it in the USA, but today checking the store again it's now showing in the UK too so it seems to be pretty clearly confirmed to be happening.</p>
<p>Valve previously discontinued the other two LCD models with the 64GB and 512GB, so it was only a matter of time until they put all their focus into the much improved OLED version. Not really surprising it comes now either, with the price of various components skyrocketing thanks to AI companies - so streamlining their production makes sense there too.</p>
<p>Jumping from £349 to £479 isn't exactly steep for all the improvements available in the OLED though but still a big shame to see, because the LCD model was a cheap decent entry into the handheld gaming market, and a nice boost for SteamOS Linux adoption <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/linux-players-on-steam-hit-an-all-time-high-for-november-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with Linux hitting an all-time high on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>So if you were after a Steam Deck, now is the last time to grab the Steam Deck LCD 256GB on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>.</p>

      <title>Firefox dev clarifies there will be an AI &#39;kill switch&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 19/12/25 10:02 UTC</strong> - A rep from Mozilla got in touch with GamingOnLinux to note the new CEO, Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, did actually speak about this on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1poe7kb/comment/nuiuwkh/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> directly themselves a couple of days ago as well. Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, Anthony here. I appreciate the input and the feedback. Please keep it coming.</p>
<p>To be successful Firefox should serve almost everyone. Browsers are a unique product, it's a product that has to work for just about everyone on the planet. Developers, Linux users, students, parents, and people who never change a default setting. Their needs differ. Sometimes they conflict. My job is not to ignore one group to serve another. It is to make Firefox work for everyone without losing its core values.</p>
<p>Rest assured, Firefox will always remain a browser built around user control. That includes AI. You will have a clear way to turn AI features off. A real kill switch is coming in Q1 of 2026. Choice matters and demonstrating our commitment to choice is how we build and maintain trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>The saga continues! A Firefox developer has taken to social media to note there will be some sort of "kill switch" to completely remove AI features in the wake of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/it-just-keeps-getting-worse-firefox-to-evolve-into-a-modern-ai-browser/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the news about more AI features coming</a> along with the new CEO.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/webdevs.firefox.com/post/3mab5kub3gs2b" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@firefoxwebdevs/115740500373677782" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> across multiple posts that I'll quote below to save you clicking around they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something that hasn't been made clear: Firefox will have an option to completely disable all AI features. We've been calling it the AI kill switch internally. I'm sure it'll ship with a less murderous name, but that's how seriously and absolutely we're taking this.</p>
<p>All AI features will also be opt-in. I think there are some grey areas in what 'opt-in' means to different people (e.g. is a new toolbar button opt-in?), but the kill switch will absolutely remove all that stuff, and never show it in future. That's unambiguous.</p>
<p>I'm not asking for faith in our direction - the thing I love about the Firefox community is how open, honest, and technical it is.</p>
<p>But I do ask that you don't have the opposite of faith. Like, try not to be determined that we're going to do the wrong thing here.</p>
<p>I hope we can (re)gain your trust here. I don't personally work on this stuff, but I'll try hard to answer any questions you have. And other than that, I'll get back in my lane, and stick to web platform stuff. - Jake (<a class="css-1jxf684 r-1loqt21 r-1xnzce8" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l4m7ynxc47wzkgvlyyunx5n2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@jakearchibald.com)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Personally, it all still makes me very uneasy. The list of problems with generative AI is endless. I'm happy they are committed to a simple switch to turn it all off, but the fact that they're still pouring resources into AI is a problem. A browser simply doesn't need to have a ton of AI features bloating it. To me this feels like Mozilla are just doing what every other company seems to be doing - chasing a ridiculous bubble for marketing and buzzwords.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA release Linux driver version 590.48.01</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As part of the New Feature Branch, NVIDIA driver version 590.48.01 released today for Linux with a few more fixes. It <em>should</em> be okay for most people to use now with it no longer being a Beta, but you may still want to hold off until they promote it to the Recommended / Certified driver branch after it's had a bit more time cooking.</p>
<p>The full changelog for v590.48.01:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Highlights since R590 Beta Release, 590.44.01</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the following EGL platform bugs that prevented multisample configurations from working:

</ul>
<strong>Highlights from R590 Beta Release, 590.44.01</strong>

<li>Raised the minimum supported glibc version to 2.27.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of recreating Vulkan swapchains. This helps prevent stuttering when resizing Vulkan application windows.</li>
<li>Raised the minimum supported X.Org xserver version to 1.17 (video driver ABI version 19).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the Dots Per Inch (DPI) to be incorrectly reported for some monitors such as the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9.</li>

      <title>Continuing to make things weird Two Point Museum and Revenge of the Savage Planet do crossovers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>They did a Vampire Survivors update, so sure why not Revenge of the Savage Planet too? Two Point Museum has expanded again in a free update. Actually love this crossover, especially as someone who has an obsession with the stars and the possibility of aliens (they're out there, they're just ignoring us!).</p>
<p>What a nice little holiday treat for both games. From the press release: "With cosmic chaos, environmental oddities, and classic Two Point mischief, Revenge of the Savage Planet proves once again that museum management is challenging, adventurous, and deeply unwise — especially when alien biology meets corporate ambition".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer for the free Two Point Museum update below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">What’s Included in Two Point Museum – Revenge of the Savage Planet:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experts can explore the world of Revenge of the Savage Planet, visiting Stellaris Prime, Xephyr, and the Zenithian Rift.</li>
<li>Collect six new exhibits, including Botany Exhibits as well as new Terrarium and Habitat creatures.</li>
<li>Create a real sci-fi feel with new decorative items and a new vending machine.</li>

      <title>Arriving early next year, Dune: Awakening - Chapter 3 is sounding great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening from Funcom is getting a big free Chapter 3 update early next year, with the details of it now being revealed along with a paid DLC.</p>
<p>They said the main focus on it apart from expanding the story, was reacting to feedback from players - especially at the late / end game to expand and improve it and give you more to do. For the main story is continues on right after Chapter 2 for a good few more hours of story content.</p>
<p>“We know players want a richer experience late in the game, and this update lays essential foundations for what’s coming next,” said Joel Bylos, Creative Director on Dune: Awakening. “We’ve rebuilt the Landsraad system from the ground up, added new ways to earn rewards whether you play solo or in groups, expanded faction ranks, and introduced the new Specialization system. It also includes new locations in the overland with brand-new missions and unique repeatable Testing Stations with escalating difficulty for additional rewards. Our goal is to give players more options in the late game than ever.”</p>
<p>The $9.99 DLC that's entirely separate will include a lot more items to build with, along with a new stillsuit set, light and heavy armour set, weapon variants, swatches and emotes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9cZRgS2n5oA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/61567368b2bbbc34a3331bdf6fb3b12d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9cZRgS2n5oA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Perhaps that might turn its fortunes around, with the MMO steadily losing players. It seems to have settled around a daily concurrent player count on Steam of around 7K.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/ball-x-pit-is-out-now-and-its-a-brick-breaking-ball-smashing-great-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">One of my favourite games released in 2025</a>, BALL x PIT from Kenny Sun and Friends / Devolver Digital has sold well enough that it's getting free upgrades. Devolver announced recently it hit over 1 million sales, and so they're getting Kenny Sun to make some more balls.</p>
<p>Three content upgrades are planned to release free during 2026 containing new balls, new evolutions, new buildings, new characters and a promise of <em>even more things. </em>When? Not that far off actually. Updates will arrive in January, April and then July.</p>

<p>It's Steam Deck Verified plus it works to perfection on Desktop Linux PCs.</p>
<p>To save you a click here's more about it from Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BALL x PIT is a fast-paced fantasy roguelite where heroes must find the balls to plunge deeper into a seemingly bottomless pit of monsters. Develop arcane ammunition and resources in pursuit of treasure, recruiting additional heroes to aid you in your perilous quest.</p>
<p>Ballbylon has fallen. After a meteoric and completely unexpected event annihilated the great city, all that remains is an ominous, yawning pit. Treasure hunters from far and wide flock to the city’s tomb to seek their fortune, plumbing the depths in search of Ballbylon’s scattered riches. Few return.</p>
<p>The pit plays host to armies of barbaric creatures, hellbent on ending your quest before it even begins. Armed with a growing arsenal of magic-infused projectiles, batter your way through multiple levels of increasingly challenging obstacles to claim the ultimate prizes and rebuild New Ballbylon.</p>
<p>Fuse Your Balls</p>
<p>The Ball Fusion system encourages explosive experimentation with over 60 randomized balls to equip and combine during your journey. Discover overpowered combinations and unexpected synergies from hundreds of possible outcomes.<br/>
Build New Ballbylon</p>
<p>Expand New Ballbylon with over 70 unique buildings that provide gameplay bonuses and unlock further power-ups, new characters, and more! As your community grows, task homebound heroes with automated tasks to keep the resources coming while you dive deeper into the pit.</p>
<p>Discover New Realms</p>
<p>Face legions of diverse enemies within the pit, battling through barren deserts, frozen caverns, savage forests and more. Each region offers its own unique set of hazards on top of hordes of increasingly challenging foes and mighty, screen-filling bosses.<br/>
Recruit Fellow Hunters</p>
<p>As you explore the pit you’ll encounter fellow treasure hunters eager to add their skills to your expedition. Each character has unique, upgradable mechanics that totally change the way you play the game. Experimentation and adaptation are crucial to the success of New Ballbylon!</p>

      <title>Rogue Legacy developer&#39;s next game is Neath, an eldritch roguelike tactical RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed from earlier this month is Neath, a roguelike tactical RPG set in a decaying world shadowed by an irradiated, inverted tower. In development by Cellar Door Games who previously made the Rogue Legacy series and releases sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>“With deep inspiration from not only video games like Into the Breach, but also tabletop boardgames such as Mansions of Madness, Neath is a game we’ve been wanting to make for years,” said Kenny Lee, Co-Founder and Lead Programmer at Cellar Door Games. “Development has taken us far from our comfort zone, working in an unfamiliar genre with an aesthetic much darker than what we usually do. But we’ve got a lot of new ideas, from ‘engagement locking’ to the ‘attack resolve system’, and we’re excited to see if we can move this burgeoning genre in a whole new direction. PRAISE NEATH!”</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GQppoeUo8-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cbbe47aaeffdca4727662dcb00c1de98.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GQppoeUo8-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Control Every "Moment": A unique "engagement-locking" system grips your teammates in fear when they are targeted by enemies, and you must disrupt your foes to save them. In Neath there are no heroes. Work together to survive, or stand alone and fall.</li>
<li>Ascend the Inverted Tower: Face your fears as you ascend the ever-changing inverted tower of Neath in a roguelike tactical RPG where every run is unique.</li>
<li>Defy Fate: Make trapped chests fizzle, barter with the gods, and reshape destiny with the power of Fate's Die. Encounter special events inspired by classic 90's dungeon-crawlers that reshapes your party during every run. But beware the consequences when playing games with providence.</li>
<li>Ever-changing Encounters: Build your party throughout the run to learn new abilities and uncover ancient, powerful relics. Build esoteric synergies that will have you poisoning the air with rotting stench, or striking blows that send enemies hurtling across the room.</li>
<li>Shape your Settlement: Build up the lowly town of Shale to better prepare you to climb deeper into the depths of the tower. Distribute your serfdom to prioritize skills that adjust your playstyle before every run.</li>
<li>PRAISE NEATH: The Taboos must be honoured. The Taboo must be obeyed. Tithe the gods; say their name. Laws may change, but the punishment remains the same. PRAISE NEATH.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Zombie horde shooter World War Z is getting a big The Walking Dead DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The highly rated co-op zombie horde shooter World War Z is set for a big addition with a DLC featuring the The Walking Dead. What a nice surprise, this might actually pull me back in as it sounds and looks pretty great.</p>
<p>More about it: <!-- squire -->"Undead apocalypses collide like never before in World War Z x The Walking Dead DLC, a new campaign episode featuring three thrilling stories starring characters from AMC’s The Walking Dead – Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Negan, and Michonne – with the voices of Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus reprising their fan-favorite characters. From the Prison to the Alexandria Safe Zone and Grady Memorial Hospital, you’ll fight to survive against new versions of World War Z’s infamous Zeke swarms inspired by The Walking Dead’s uniquely slower-moving but no less deadly Walkers."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15184606041766067768gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15184606041766067768gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3210440341766067766gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3210440341766067766gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>DLC Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experience a new story campaign set in the world of AMC’s The Walking Dead</li>
<li>Take on three new chapters: the Prison, Alexandria Safe Zone and Grady Memorial Hospital</li>
<li>Four playable survivors: Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Michonne, and Negan</li>
<li>Two new melee weapons: Michonne's Katana and Negan’s Bat “Lucille”</li>
<li>Two new weapon skins: Rick’s Revolver and Daryl’s Crossbow</li>
<li>World War Z’s signature Zekes have been transformed into Walkers</li>
<li>New special Zeke – Spiked Walkers: An even deadlier variant of Walker with tougher defenses that is impervious to melee until it’s been knocked prone. Force them to the ground with enough damage, then go in for a quick melee kill before it rises again!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:  "Saber has built incredible partnerships across the biggest horror universes and properties, so joining forces with The Walking Dead felt like a natural fit for World War Z,” said Matthew Karch, CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive. “Uniting these two worlds is something I've wanted to do for a long time, and it's amazing to finally have it happening.”</p>
<p>“In the finest tradition of Reese’s and ‘two great tastes that taste great together,’ we are so excited to be partnering with Paramount and Saber to mash up two iconic zombie franchises, The Walking Dead and World War Z,” said Clayton Neuman, VP of Games and Franchise at AMC. “We can’t wait for fans of both series to see for themselves how much fun it is when Walker and Zeke worlds collide.”</p>

      <title>Monster-catching RPG &#39;EvoCreo&#39; arrives on PC on January 7, 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After amassing around 2.5 million downloads on mobile, the first EvoCreo is arriving on Steam with Linux support on January 7th, 2026. </p>
<p>I'm not really a mobile gamer, so I don't exactly know how big a release this will end up being, and a lot of mobile games don't translate too well to the PC audience so it will be interesting to see how this goes.</p>
<p>The latest trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="giYK5UADu4w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e5bdd06a5fcb9a8d3e186c17fcb67e5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/giYK5UADu4w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embark on a journey through the diverse biomes of Zenith.  Discover, raise, and battle more than 170 distinct creatures known as Creo. Become a powerful Evoking Master by challenging rivals, criminal agents, and other Creo collectors in elemental arenas while uncovering a nefarious plot and searching for a lost family member.</p>
<p>Go beyond games of elemental rock-paper-scissors and devise strategies in tactical Creo battles. Leverage move cooldowns, Creo Traits, Abilities, Types, and Status Effects to gain the upper hand. Curate a party ready for any situation with dozens of movesets and evolutionary paths to choose from, setting each adorable and fearsome Creo up for success.</p>
<p>Journey through the world of Zenith solo for more than 30 hours of adventures, then put every Evoker lesson learned to the test online in a free multiplayer update coming soon after launch. Practice new strategies and learn new skills in battle with friends, or challenge Evokers from around the world. Emerge victorious to climb the online rankings and become a global Evoking Master!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developer quote from the press release: “We developed EvoCreo to be like no other monster-taming RPG, with a focus on tactical battles, distinct Creo designs, and a vast world to explore,” said Ebrahim Behbahani, Founder at Ilmfinity. “We felt that these elements were unexplored and can still be improved upon today, so we hope Evokers on more platforms enjoy what makes Zenith so compelling!”</p>
<p>At some point the second game in the series will also arrive on PC as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/highly-rated-creature-collectors-evocreo-and-evocreo-2-are-coming-to-pc-with-linux-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">covered previously on GamingOnLinux</a>.</p>

      <title>The Home Sweet Home update for Palworld with the ULTRAKILL crossover is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld just levelled up with a big new free Home Sweet Home update as Pocketpair work towards finishing up the game for a full release next year. This update not only brings new enhancements to building and raids, but also has an ULTRAKILL crossover.</p>
<p>For the ULTRAKILL content you get some weapons and armour, as well as a V1’s infamous coin toss added to the game. The bigger part of the update is the building system. There's a bunch more building parts, and the much-requests triangular pieces along with the ability to change the colour of building pieces. Additionally the building menu UI was overhauled to make it easier to use.</p>
<p>For summoning a raid boss there's now an option to jump into a special arena, instead of potentially destroying your base. A new raid boss is also available to fight. Melee combat was tweaked to make it "more viable and fun for players" like the ability to attack consecutively by repeatedly clicks, and some weapons now have special attacks. More melee improvements are planned to come for the 1.0 update.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II to release in Spring 2026</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II from Bulwark Studios and Kasedo Games has a release window now set for sometime in Spring 2026. The hotly anticipated sequel is looking promising, but needs time to cook and so going by the expected calendar that puts it anywhere between March 20 - June 20.</p>
<p>Announced via an email to GamingOnLinux they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new release window will allow the team to further refine the experience in response to player requests following the Steam Next Fest demo, where it ranked among the event’s most played titles.</p>
<p>Building on this momentum, Bulwark Studios have listened closely to player feedback and have begun working on those widely requested features. The full game will now include an audio option to play with either ‘lingua-technis’, the binaric machine code language of the Adeptus Mechanicus that contributed heavily to the first game’s distinct atmosphere, or with the traditional human voiceover as heard in the demo. Movement systems are also being enhanced, with an optional setting to allow the Move action to auto-select when cycling between units, creating a smoother and more efficient tactical flow.</p>
<p>The team is equally committed to addressing performance concerns raised during the demo period. These optimisations, together with the continued refinement of new systems and campaign content, are central to delivering a sequel that meets the expectations set by both the community and the studio’s own ambitions.</p>

      <title>MicroProse announce a revival of the retro Geoff Crammond Racing series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>First released in the '90s, the retro racing series designed by Geoff Crammond is making a return under new names with publisher MicroProse.</p>
<p>From the press release GamingOnLinux received today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MicroProse is excited to announce its renewed partnership with legendary game developer Geoff Crammond, creator of some of the most influential racing simulation games of the 1990s and early 2000s. </p>
<p>Together, we are bringing back his groundbreaking racing game engine in a re-release of the original game technology, enhanced with updates, new tools, and Steam Workshop support, through the upcoming Geoff  Crammond Racing series: GCR1, GCR2, GCR3, and GCR4, scheduled to release in 2026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/953321511765972415gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Additionally, MicroProse noted the new titles are to reflect the independent direction and to ensure separation from official motorsport licensing which can be quite a minefield.</p>
<p>More from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geoff Crammond’s original work helped define the foundations of modern racing games, introducing innovations such as advanced real-time physics, highly configurable driving assists (including the ideal racing line, steering help and auto braking), realistic AI driver behaviour, deep telemetry analysis, comprehensive car setup systems, extensive wet weather system, and the list goes on. <br/>
The GCR series proudly carries this legacy forward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that they said to expect more announcements in the series to come, so perhaps we might see some modern games being announced next year.</p>
<p>The classics will be named (Steam links):</p>

      <title>Latest Steam Deck update will warn you if an Xbox controller needs upgrading</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new Steam Deck Beta update that includes a useful tweak to its Xbox controller detection.</p>
<p>There's a bit of a problem with modern Xbox controllers and Bluetooth, where they won't properly connect up with SteamOS / Linux unless they've gone through a firmware update. I've seen a lot of support requests about this issue over the years and so it's good to see Valve highlight it directly. <em>While it's a Steam Deck Beta Client update, it should apply to other SteamOS devices too. </em></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/499466596943660348?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>On the Bluetooth settings screen, we will now detect and notify the player when trying to pair/connect an Xbox controller with older firmware versions that cannot properly connect to Steam Deck. To fix these issues you must connect the controller to a Windows PC and update the firmware via the Xbox Accessories App.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Accessibility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Moved the Screen Reader's "Stop Talking" button to X so that external gamepads can still open the Quick Access Menu with Guide button + their equivalent of A button</li>
</ul>
<strong>Friends &amp; Chat</strong>
<ul>
<li>Suspicious or harassing group chat messages can be reported directly in the chat window by selecting the message and pressing 'Options'. You can optionally block and/or unfriend the other user while submitting the report.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed being unable to move the mouse to another monitor when using touch controls on the Steam Link app.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Frustrating that you're forced into using Windows to do it though but thankfully there's a lot of controllers out there that Steam Input and so SteamOS support.</p>
<p>At some point Valve will have to start calling these Steam Deck Client updates something else, like SteamOS Client update or something similar, given that there's already other official devices with SteamOS (like the Legion Go S) and there's going to be more of their own devices soon with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Frame and Steam Machine</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Replay is live and notes only 14% &#34;of playtime spent by all Steam users&#34; was for 2025 releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released Steam Replay for 2025, showing off some interesting stats about your gaming and how it stacks up against everyone on Steam.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this year they note that only 14% of gaming was "spent by all Steam users in new releases (games released in 2025)". That's actually down a single digit percentage from last year, but continues to show that with<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/over-19000-games-have-released-on-steam-in-2025-with-nearly-half-seeing-fewer-than-10-reviews/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> the onslaught of over 19,000 games from 2025</a> that a lot of people continue playing through their older games. According to the stats 44% of playtime from all Steam users were for releases from the last 1-7 years, and 40% playtime from all Steam users was spent on releases from 8 or more years ago.</p>
<p>Valve's stats don't include time spent in offline mode or when you're without internet.</p>

      <title>It just keeps getting worse - Firefox to &#34;evolve into a modern AI browser&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/please-make-it-stop-google-chrome-to-be-reimagined-with-ai/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Just like Google plan with Chrome</a>, Mozilla aren't sitting still on expanding Firefox into something resembling a web browser but with more AI.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> today on the Mozilla blog, they've got a new CEO with Anthony Enzor-DeMeo. Here's a short but important excerpt on the future of Firefox from the post (emphasis ours):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Mozilla moves forward, we will focus on becoming the trusted software company. This is not a slogan. It is a direction that guides how we build and how we grow. It means three things.</p>
<ul>
<li>First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it.</li>
<li>Second: our business model must align with trust. We will grow through transparent monetization that people recognize and value.</li>
<li>Third: Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. <strong>It will evolve into a modern AI browser</strong> and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>You should read the full post to form your own opinion on it, but regular readers will know my thoughts on AI quite well by now. Companies everywhere are scrambling to force AI into where it isn't needed, or wanted, and all it ends up doing is causing the complete enshittification of whatever it is.</p>
<p>If they really wanted to give us privacy and agency in how we use it, they would give us a very <em>simple</em> opt-out for all AI features. But like other companies and organisations - they won't, because they need to force people into it to make numbers go up. They say we should be able to easily turn it off, but I'll believe that when I see it as a clear option to disable it all.</p>

      <title>Vampire Crawlers from the Vampire Survivors dev gets a fun new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I am seriously stoked by Vampire Crawlers that adds to the world of Vampire Survivors with a fast-paced deck-builder from developer poncle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/vampire-survivors-gets-turned-officially-into-a-crazy-deck-builder-with-vampire-crawlers-from-poncle/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Announced back in November</a>, it's more of a casual deck-builder set in the same world as Vampire Survivors and will no doubt be another success for poncle. They've just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265700/view/583907108616931531" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> it already has amassed over 170K wishlists on Steam and they said: "So far we have published only what is effectively a hype trailer to try to convey how it feels to play Vampire Crawlers, with a few sneak peeks at many of the game features and options to snowball into unhinged chaos. So, for a first update, we are showing a new gameplay trailer and some simple and unedited gameplay footage of the very first dungeon floor, focused on basic gameplay. This should let you see what is at the core of Vampire Crawlers: have fun playing satisfying abilities in turbo turn-based battles, at whatever speed you prefer."</p>
<p>See it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SARs48njusw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/860044c220900d3baa68d058804de545.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SARs48njusw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snowballing, turn‑based carnage</strong>: Play cards in ascending mana order to land combos; each step multiplies the next card’s effect. Use Wilds to extend the stack and keep going to 10, 20, 30… Can you reach infinite?</li>
<li><strong>Pick your pace</strong>: Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!</li>
<li><strong>Deck-Building</strong>: Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards, headbutt chests for customization gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons packed with something seldom seen in Vampire Survivors: functioning walls. And then all sorts of unique treasures and interactions. Find the shovel to dig into the next floor, that will most likely take place in the clouds!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really do love the look of this. Taking the pure chaos of Vampire Survivors and tuning into in a spin-off with a dungeon crawling deck-building focus. Excellent.</p>

      <title>Tingus Goose is completely absurd and possibly 2025&#39;s strangest game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tingus Goose has released recently and after being mystified by the demo, I took a look at the full game and I honestly still have no idea what is going on.</p>
<p>It's a clicker / idle game about growing a weird human-goose hybrid tree, one that spawns little babies called Tingis to help you earn money to continue growing your freak of nature towards the sky to mate with another goose. Once they've mated, your tree fully blossoms and explodes a whole bunch of new geese out into the world and you continue onto the next level.</p>
<p>It's so utterly bizarre I don't quite know how to properly explain it to you. Seeing is believing, and still wildly confusing. Not confusing in the sense of I don't know what I'm doing, the objective is clear to keep growing, I'm just confused on what goes through the mind of the creators when they thought this up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21223741571765891503gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21223741571765891503gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Tingus Goose is laughably nuts but at the same time it's weirdly captivating of your attention too, as you progress you just want to see more of it to see how batshit insane it will become in the later levels. And to appreciate all the little animations sprinkled into the game.</p>
<p>As you grow your freaky baby spawning goose tree, you get various growths (Blossoms) on the side that are various forms of geese with their own screwed up style and benefits. The key is to get the babies crawling and bouncing all over them as they fall down the goose tree to earn you more credits to keep watering that freaky goose to grow some more towards your mate up in the sky.</p>
<p>You get a sprinkle of upgrades as you go through it too. This system is also completely ridiculous. Below the ground are the roots, which get supplied with calcium from a cow. Yes, there's an underground cow hooked up to supply calcium and that's probably the least weirdest thing in the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2051621061765892239gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2051621061765892239gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's here where you can spend bones to unlock permanent upgrades for you run. Like the ability to combine babies into screwed up abominations that earn you even more money to grow your goose.</p>
<p>On top of that there's a freaky doctor who will allow you to buy various extras using gems you find as you grow, that help you earn even more monies. You can buy up new types of Blossoms for your tree, DNA to upgrade your clicks on babies and more weirdness.</p>
<p>With it being an idle / clicker incremental game the main point is just to keep on going. With each chapter you start fresh with a new goose tree and the amount you need to grow gets longer, but you bring with it all the upgrades you've earned to keep things interesting and not even remotely difficult. It's a casual game that just takes time and not much else.</p>
<p>This is the good stuff right here.</p>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Plant seeds in people: Pop a goose seed into a patient's torso, add water, and watch a towering goose-tree burst to life in MasterTingus's unmistakably twisted style.</li>
<li>Idle meets Rube Goldberg: Babies rain down branches, ricocheting off "Blossoms" to generate cash while "Specimens" chain wild synergies for exponential growth.</li>
<li>17 unsettling chapters, 150 plus unlockables: Every chapter introduces new modifiers, lore, Blossoms, Specimens, and Relics. All art is hand-illustrated by MasterTingus.</li>
<li>Each run offers a uniquely bizarre experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There is one issue running the game with Proton - there's a few brief animation videos that don't work on Linux / SteamOS where you end up seeing a <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1770843771765890818gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">video test screen</a> due to the unsupported codec used by the developer. It's quite a common problem and you'll <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">need to use GE-Proton</a> to solve that until the developer fixes it. Apart from that, the game appeared to run fine.</p>
<p>If you like games that try to be different, weird, unique and like nothing else but you also appreciate more chilled games — Tingus Goose is a seriously easy recommendation to pick up.</p>

      <title>ARC Raiders gets a huge v1.7.0 free update with a new map condition, new event, skill tree resets and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embark Games have been cooking, with ARC Raiders v1.7.0 out now that brings quite a lot to the popular extraction shooter - so time for another run.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features for the game has also been added, with the ability to re-do your skill tree. You can also toggle to aim down the sights of weapons now too, useful to save a bit of finger ache. There's a cap on the amount of blue Cred you can have at any one time too, which is now actually shown in-game. We even get to customize our Raider Tool now too, they've improved Stella Montis spawns and moved the Aphelion blueprint drop from the Matriarch to Stella Montis. Also, one of my favourite changes - the Rattler is no longer completely useless with the clip size increased by default to 12.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zdGMteCqknE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b5f65ef609e01fcaf3c078c9aedd0ea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zdGMteCqknE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">That's just the smaller listed above stuff as there's also:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new Cold Snap map condition:
	<ul>
<li>During the Cold Snap condition, the clock is ticking. The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders - getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flickering Flames event:
	<ul>
<li>Gather Candleberries and XP during a run to progress through to earn various items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New free Raider Deck "Goalie" - coming on December 26.</li>
<li>New Quests and Items.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's lots more tweaks you can see all in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/cold-snap-patch-notes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Also, somehow Fanatical still have it on a discount so they're the best place to buy it.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft acquires March of Giants and the team from Amazon joining Ubisoft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amazon continue <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/as-amazon-cut-thousands-of-jobs-new-world-aeternum-will-see-no-more-updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moving further away</a> from making and publishing their own games, with them selling off the upcoming March of Giants and the team behind it to Ubisoft. The game isn't available yet, and only completed a closed alpha test earlier this year so it's likely still quite a while away.</p>
<p>What is March of Giants? An upcoming free-to-play 4v4 War MOBA where you play as a Giant, lead an army of soldiers and deploy tactical structures known as "Battleworks" on a ravaged urban battlefield.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19530500071765886202gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19530500071765886202gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The terms of the deal were not disclosed but it's expect to be completed today, December 16th. From Ubisoft's own press release:</p>
<p>“March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming’s biggest arenas,” said Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and CEO, Ubisoft. “We’re looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team’s ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP.”</p>
<p>“Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle,” said Xavier Marquis, Creative Director. “We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level.”</p>
<p>Alexandre Parizeau added, “My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants. Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs.”</p>
<p>"We're proud of what our team in Montreal has built with March of Giants," said Steve Boom, VP of Audio, Twitch and Games at Amazon. "We're confident that under Ubisoft’s leadership, the talented developers in Montreal will continue to thrive and create amazing game experiences.”</p>
<p>Since the game is in development it's not clear if it will work on Linux platforms at release. It all depends on what anti-cheat they decide to use for it which has been problematic for Linux / SteamOS. Going by reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1924600" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> from the previous testing, they had Linux completely blocked at that point but who knows what will happen now. You can take a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">look on our anti-cheat page</a> for more details on what games do work.</p>

      <title>Poly Bridge developer’s next game is Poly Bricks - a LEGO-like cozy, creative brick-building game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Riding the wave of more cozy games, developer Dry Cactus (Poly Bridge series) is working on their next game titled Poly Bricks that will come to Linux. They originally described it as a "cozy, creative brick-building game" that's "designed to capture the joy of building sets on your bedroom floor".</p>
<p>This was actually revealed back in June, which no doubt plenty of people missed (I certainly did). In the Steam forum in reply to a question on Linux support the developer just <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3449470/discussions/0/597408128295835601/#c842866071372416268" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">this week said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Yes we do plan on having a build available for Linux (and Mac), we haven't gotten to testing other platforms yet but should be fairly easy to achieve</blockquote>
<p>See the original trailer below:</p>

<p>More about it (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Build, design, and share — brick by brick.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assemble beautiful sets and unlock new designs as you progress through<strong> </strong>the different themes of increasing complexity.</li>
<li>Team up with friends and build together with real-time online multiplayer.</li>
<li>Let your imagination run wild with the Sandbox — design your own builds, optionally creating step-by-step instructions, and upload your creations to the Workshop.</li>
<li>Browse and download other people's creations on the Workshop.</li>
<li>Customize your library by importing custom 3d models for bricks and images for stickers to make your builds truly unique.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The classic Plague Inc: Evolved gets a new free daily Outbreak Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Plague Inc: Evolved is a game about infecting the world by evolving a deadly global plague, and now there's new ways to play it.</p>
<p>A major free update just landed with the Outbreak Mode that adds in Daily Outbreaks, giving you the chance to see something new every 24 hours with different starting bonuses, origin countries and more. There's also new Unique Mutators that bring unique modifiers that will "fundamentally change both your plague and the world".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4930586371765884782gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4930586371765884782gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's such a strangely absorbing game. Just interesting to see how things spread, and cause a little chaos. Good fun if you're in the mood for a different type of strategy game.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>Features &amp; Additions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Outbreak Mode: Daily Challenges, 100s of Modifiers, 100s of Rewards</li>
<li>New News Headlines - With many submitted by the community!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Balance Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mad Cow Disease Scenario: Reduced score requirement for 3 biohazards. Now need 50,000 Point and 30,000 for 2 Biohazards</li>
<li>Mad Cow Disease Scenario: Reduced randomness of Fish Event, allowing for more opportunity to infect islands</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quality of Life</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved variation of Disease Name randomiser</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed description for Rice trait in the Mad Cow Disease scenario</li>
<li>Fixed mutation issues with Dairy and Beef traits in the Mad Cow Disease scenario</li>
</ul>
</div>
</details>
<p>There is an odd bug in the game where a whole bunch of text may be missing which appears to be an issue with resolutions. The game started for me on the lowest resolution possible, and when switching to the correct resolution it didn't fix it. But a restart did. Something to keep in mind if you're going to jump in.</p>

      <title>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven arrives in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Massive Monster has revealed the exciting Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven DLC will arrive January 22, 2026 with a new trailer and more info. One of my favourites is about to get a whole lot more interesting.</p>
<p>Some more info they've shared about it includes the new freezing map condition requiring a mixture of special meals, décor and clothing to keep them happy. There's even a special hot tub party you can let your followers enjoy - oh my. All very seasonal with snowlambs to build, snowballs to throw and more. A bigger map too, which you'll need for all the new stuff. With the Woolhaven area you'll need to bring it back to life by clearing rubble and rebuilding shops, which will unlock ranching for your cult. There's two more dungeons to run through too and plenty more.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9YH21SghaUU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8c0b9935a99803644198244a0ba0fa21.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9YH21SghaUU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full DLC notes, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3><strong>Survive the Winter!</strong></h3>
With the introduction of Woolhaven, a chill will spread across the Lands of the Old Faith. The God of Winter, Yngya, will ask you to find the souls of Lambs passed, scattered across the mountain, and to return them to Woolhaven. However, with each soul returned, Yngya grows stronger - posing new challenges to your cult.

<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your cult fed and warm</strong> - lest your Followers start to freeze! Special meals, decor and clothing will help.</li>
<li>You can even let your Followers enjoy a cosy little hot tub party!</li>
<li>Build snowlambs, throw snowballs, and enjoy the festive season with your Followers, who have new traits, quests and quirks to keep you entertained.</li>
<li><strong>Expand your base!</strong> There will be ample room for all the new structures and decor - like the Exorcism Altar, allowing you to reroll Follower traits, or the Work Tent allowing you to assign even more jobs to your faithful Followers!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bring Woolhaven Back to Life!</strong></h3>
As you play, you will be able to revive Woolhaven to its former glory, by returning lost souls, clearing rubble, and even rebuilding shops.

<ul>
<li>Unlock ranching - where you can ride, pet, tame and even harvest your adorable ranching animals.</li>
<li>Find and reforge legendary weapons!</li>
<li>Interact with the former residents of Woolhaven</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Explore and Conquer New Dungeons - Ewefall, and The Rot</strong></h3>
There are two new dungeons to explore in Woolhaven! <strong>Ewefall</strong> : the snowy mountain exterior, and home to Marchosias, the leader of the Free Pack.

<ul>
<li>The pack roams the freezing mountain side, determined to end all Gods (that means you).</li>
<li>Marchosias is a wolf of science, and he's found a way to harness the storms that plague the mountain to power his dark experiments. His wolves hunt as a pack, determined to end you.</li>
<li>Marchosias will <strong>never</strong> give up the mountain to a God. If you want it, <strong>you'll have to take it by force</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<strong>The Rot</strong>: a grotesque mountain interior. A living, pulsing place full of vile and furious creatures.

<ul>
<li>The enemies in The Rot have been driven mad with pain and suffering. They will rip themselves apart to stop you, mutating and duplicating.</li>
<li>The Rot is a festering, burning place that corrupts all it touches - but what is it, and where did it come from?</li>
<li>Help an ancient dragon hatch her eggs, bring a monstrous garden to bloom, guide an old friend home (or take your revenge), and even lead a wayward moth to her sexy destiny.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>And in other news...</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We have been working on a brand new merch drop to go alongside Woolhaven, better than we have ever done before!</li>
</ul>
<p>Woolhaven arrives January 22nd, 2026 - and pre-orders start today!</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong to get a free expansion, Hollow Knight getting a refresh upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Cherry just revealed some huge news for both Hollow Knight: Silksong and the original Hollow Knight with some free extras on the way.</p>
<p>For the original Hollow Knight there's a refresh update coming, which is already in Beta and you can test it on Steam right now as per <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their post</a> it contains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Added support for 21:9 &amp; 16:10 resolutions.<br/>
- Game now pauses while in inventory menus.<br/>
- Upgraded to Unity Input System for broader controller support (original input system is still available, if preferred, via Options&gt;Controller&gt;Advanced Settings)<br/>
- Added dithering effect, and dithering options, to reduce colour banding.<br/>
- Fixed a softlock in City of Tears Grub room.<br/>
- Reduced Grey Prince Zote's stagger bounce height.<br/>
- Updated Sly's Great Slash collider to closer match visual.<br/>
- Salubra's Blessing now deactivates after reaching max Soul.<br/>
- Map panning is now smoother<br/>
- Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>They also note that with Proton you'll see a video test pattern, so to switch to the Native Linux version.</em></p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong meanwhile is getting a whole free expansion named Sea of Sorrow. Expect to find "New areas, bosses, tools, and more! Hornet’s adventures continue in our nautically themed expansion, coming free for all players next year". We'll get more info closer to the release date as they want to keep plenty secret.</p>

<p>They also revealed in <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the blog post</a> that Silksong has sold over 7 million copies. That's pretty incredible, but not unexpected given the mass hype around the game before release.</p>

      <title>GOG formally announce their GOG Patrons subscription donation system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As covered by GamingOnLinux <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/gog-asking-for-more-donations-from-gamers-with-the-new-gog-patrons-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in October</a> when it silently launched, GOG have now actually properly announced the GOG Patrons subscription donation system.</p>
<p>This is a new way for super fans of <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> to directly support the DRM-free store with an optional monthly subscription. It gives you a few perks like Discord access, voting on priorities for the GOG Preservation Program, your nickname may appear on certain game pages, a special profile badge to show you supported it and behind the scenes content.</p>
<p>So this is very much like Patreon but for fans of GOG directly to help the store along.</p>
<p>To me, this only continues to show that GOG really isn't doing very well when it comes to revenue (you can see it on their <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/?report-type=periodical&amp;accounting-year=2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>). If I've read it right, GOG's net profit for the first 9 months of 2025 is only 910,000 PLN (approx $253,554 USD), for the whole of 2024 it was only 1,134,000 PLN (approx $315K USD) and that's down from 10,255,000 PLN for 2023 which for an entire store like it is really not a whole lot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/page=10/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">We've seen before </a>as well how they were really struggling because the PC gaming default is very much still Steam. Earlier this year they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/gog-asking-for-more-donations-from-gamers-with-the-new-gog-patrons-program/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">began to ask for donations when buying games</a> at the checkout too, and now this next big step.</p>
<p>Just look at Epic Games - they continue to be held up by Fortnite and even with constantly throwing out big free games they continue to burn through money because the majority shop on Steam. For two years in a row Epic Games saw a decline in purchases for third-party games (sources: <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2024</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2023</a>). Other stores not only have to be different, but really need a hook to pull people in.</p>

      <title>Retro arcade-style rally racer Parking Garage Rally Circuit gets a DX edition with a lot more content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX has been revealed today, greatly expanding the content of this popular retro arcade-style rally racer.</p>
<p>Currently, the DX version is only available to play via the browser on <a href="https://wavedash.gg/walaber-entertainment/pgrc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wavedash</a>. A service that was <em>entirely</em> unknown to me until the press email came in. With Parking Garage Rally Circuit getting Parking Garage Rally Circuit <em>DX</em> as a DLC on Steam next year. I imagine most people will simply wait for the Steam DLC in 2026, rather than pay to play the game in the browser and have pretty much zero ownership at all and have an internet connection required. At least with things like GeForce NOW - the games are still <em>yours</em> (as much as the licensing argument allows me to say they're yours - you know what I mean). <em>Wavedash reminds me of the failure of Google Stadia…</em></p>
<p>What does the DX edition have? The developer said it doubles the content of the original release with a new European Tour adding 8 multistorey car parks to drift through on top of the original 8 American parking garages to make a total of 16 tracks. From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Visit multistory car parks in Paris (Art Car Park), York (York Castle Car Park), Turin (Car Factory), Montpellier (Double Loop), Hamburg (Concert Hall), Copenhagen (Power Plant), Geneva (Parking Tour) and Naples (Cave Park) as you drift and boost your way to victory in the single-player mode, or against other players online. These locations are all inspired by real multistorey carparks, though the odd underwater tunnel or falling stalactites may suggest a touch of artistic liberty. Do it all to a full new soundtrack from The Holophonics, the band behind the catchy tunes that graced the original game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"What started as the idea of delivering a little more content for Parking Garage Rally Circuit has expanded into what is effectively a whole new game that doubles the size of the original,” said developer Tim ‘Walaber’ Fitzrandolph. “I’m really excited that Parking Garage Rally Circuit DX is part of the launch of a new platform in Wavedash that reduces friction and complexity for players to discover and play games like mine. I look forward to coming back next year with more news on bringing DX and the European Tour to Steam and console players.”</p>

      <title>The incredibly complex sci-fi grand strategy game Terra Invicta has a release date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the team that created the Long War mod for XCOM, the rather complex grand strategy game Terra Invicta now has a full release date.</p>
<p>Last time I tried to play it, I was completely overwhelmed by not just all the options but how complicated the game interface felt and I just couldn't get into it. As much as I wanted too, it was a bit <em>too</em> involved in every little thing. Even so, it seemed to run really well with Valve's Proton on Linux. </p>
<p>More about it: "After aliens are detected at the fringes of the Solar System, humanity fractures into seven ideological factions, each with a unique vision of the future, each vying for power among the world’s nations. Take control of Earth’s nations, expand across the Solar System to exploit its resources, and build space-faring ships to fight in realistic tactical combat."</p>
<p>They've now set a release date for 1.0 on January 5th. This brings with it a new 2026 scenario for modern day Earth, along with support for new languages including Czech, Italian, Korean, Russian, and Ukrainian. That's on top of masses of improvements they've been adding in testing builds recently like an updated tutorial and an overhaul of the UI. Perhaps I'll actually be able to understand it now.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor gets mid-game saves and CPU optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The excellent bullet heaven Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor has Patch 3 out now which includes the much requested mid-game saving system. We finally don't have to do an entire run in one go! <em>Something that really should have been there from the start don't you think?</em></p>
<p>Now when you play through it, the game will save any time you enter the shop for you to pick it back up again later which sounds ideal. On top of that it should run smoother across all systems too as they "Optimized bullet trail rendering. This reduces the CPU load in bullet-heavy scenarios" and there's some additional levels added to the upgrades menu so you have a little more to work towards.</p>

      <title>From Ruins – A Detective Adventure looks worth keeping an eye on</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Ruins – A Detective Adventure caught my eye recently with it's interesting premise and some pretty slick looking pixel-art for point and click fans.</p>
<p>An upcoming "new-gen" adventure game that combines "deduction gameplay with a gripping story full of twists and turns". Doing a little detective work you'll be gathering clues to establish connections, and get solving a series of challenging cases. Currently in development by DigiTales Interactive who also made the positively rated Lacuna – A Sci-Fi Noir Adventure and Between Horizons – A Sci-Fi Detective Adventure.</p>
<p>Have a look at the first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l6q7Ie2Vvhc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e00627d07ac29934a08644496082c1f6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l6q7Ie2Vvhc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They're going the self-publishing route this time too. CEO Julian Colbus said: "Even though From Ruins is somewhat similar to our previous titles, it's a major, scary step for us from a business perspective. As you may know, our previous releases were published and partially funded by German publisher Assemble Entertainment as well as additional partners for the Asian markets. This time around, we are flying completely solo, which means that all the marketing, PR, and distribution work falls on us. Like for many studios who have taken the same plunge, this might end up being a do-or-die situation. If you care about us and /or our ability to keep making games, it's more important now than ever before to help us get the word out."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Although it's a classic styled point and click adventure they say it will have:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Modern conveniences such as tight movement controls, gamepad support, and an autosave system.</li>
<li>Contemporary game design that can get tricky but is never illogical.</li>
<li>Combines high-quality pixel art with state-of-the-art VFX and sound design.</li>
<li>Tells a fast-paced story that respects your time.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The results are in - Bullet Heaven moves forward to be an official genre</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The results are in, game developers look to move forward to create Bullet Heaven as an official genre spawned from Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>You know it by now I'm sure — all these survivor-like reverse bullet hell games that appeared rapidly over the last few years. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors</a> that started it now there's the likes of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Brotato</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2163330/Yet_Another_Zombie_Survivors/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Yet Another Zombie Survivors</a> (from Awesome Games Studio), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Megabonk</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2321470/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Survivor/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2904000/The_Spell_Brigade/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Spell Brigade</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2922410/Achilles_Survivor/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Achilles: Survivor</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2066020/Soulstone_Survivors/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Soulstone Survivors</a> and no doubt <em>tons</em> you've never heard of.</p>
<p>I've covered quite a number of them by now that you can see across <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/bullet-heaven/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our own Bullet Heaven article tag</a> too.</p>
<p>Well, to settle on an actual name for this genre, Awesome Games Studio <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczuipvt1qjXbUKE55K4HJUKXJo2lz-i6AXOErwle-Yj3zLnA/viewanalytics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">did a poll recently</a> and after 8,023 responses the winner was clear, it's going to be <strong>Bullet Heaven</strong>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yVjG3oCstyo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8ef5da1cba13afd11bd84cd3edd9de49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yVjG3oCstyo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now they just need Valve / Steam to get on board with the idea, and give it an official category like many others on Steam have. What you can do to help settle it once and for all, is add your own Bullet Heaven Steam tag to various games, which should show Valve there's a need for it.</p>

      <title>The popular Megabonk gets a mega update with new content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>New content for Megabonk? As if I needed more reasons to load it up. The absolute indie gem survivor-like bullet heaven just got even bigger.</p>
<p>What is Megabonk? Riding the wave create by Vampire Survivors, it's a roguelike survival game where you must fight your way through hordes of enemies and bosses in randomly generated maps. It feels quite a bit like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/megabonk-is-risk-of-rain-2-fused-with-vampire-survivors-and-its-glorious/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Risk of Rain 2 fused with Vampire Survivors</a>.</p>
<p>The developer said that this was supposed to be a Halloween update and is still named the "Spooky Update", but oops - they made it bigger and it took longer. So you can expect to see a new map, a new character, a new weapon, new items, new enemies and bosses and new challenges too. A whole lot to play through.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7329978421765796608gol1.jpg"/></p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full changelog, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>New Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Map</li>
<li>New Character</li>
<li>New Weapon</li>
<li>New Items</li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses</li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges</li>
</ul>
<h3>Game</h3>
<ul>
<li>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork's Megacrit didn't work</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity</li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)</li>
<li>Fixed a "bug" where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings - Will enable certain settings that most players don't need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.</li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won't be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Balancing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the "caveman" bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn't be able to spawn close to you or reach you</li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won't be OP</li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile</li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1% Posion Damage per level.</li>
<li>Calcium's passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now looses about 25%, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6%</li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It's to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you're veeeryy late game.</li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16</li>
<li>Dragon's Breath now has 200% faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1% -&gt; 0.75%, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2% -&gt; 1.5%</li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn't make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet</li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Console</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can press f10 to open the console</li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something</li>
<li>Type "help" in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free 3-16 player party shooter of teamwork and betrayal, Klaus Veen&#39;s Treason added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for the holiday period, Klaus Veen's Treason is a fun looking 3-16 player party shooter of teamwork and betrayal that now has Native Linux support. It's also free to play, so you can have a great time without spending a penny on it.</p>
<p>A social deduction shooter which seems like a really interesting idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Treason, the Don has been murdered! Innocents must find Clues to identify the Traitors before they strike again.</p>
<p>Each round, a small group of players become Traitors who must eliminate all Innocents. Meanwhile, Innocents work with the Detective and Doctor to expose the killers using the Clue Processing Unit.</p>
<p>Choose your class (Slim, Medium, or Heavy), master unique abilities and gadgets, and survive the betrayal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

<p>The Linux version came with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1786950/view/523110495538905788" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> released December 12th, with the developer noting "The highlight of this update is native Linux support. We have ported Treason to Linux, which was quite more complicated than just hitting "compile" on the source code". The rest of the update was dealing with community feedback with fixing up issues reported.</p>

      <title>If you need a new retro boomer shooter check out Ctesiphon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released in November, Ctesiphon puts you in the role of a Galactic Bounty Hunter extraordinaire in a fresh retro styled futuristic boomer shooter.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this one was built entirely on Linux. The solo developer mentioned they built it over a decade using "C/C++, OpenGL, and open-source Quake mapping tools" with a custom game engine. Some more about the Linux development and support on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Made in bits and pieces over the course of nearly a decade by a single developer on Linux using C/C++, OpenGL, and open-source Quake mapping tools, Ctesiphon's custom engine allows for the game to run reliably on low-spec systems. It's built to withstand large firefights with dozens of enemies, hundreds of blood spatter and bullet impact decals, and piles of giblets and scrap as you blow the enemies apart into clouds of particles and debris.</p>
<p>Ctesiphon has been developed on Linux first and supports virtually all controllers connected to it. On Windows only XInput-compatible controllers are supported natively, but others will work fine with SteamInput enabled. The big exception is for the Steam Deck and Steam Controllers, these won't be natively supported on Linux/SteamOS until after release but in the meantime they should work fine if you play the Windows build by setting compatibility to any version of Proton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9156153651765795485gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's also Steam Deck Verified, although it uses Proton by default on Steam Deck due to controller issues with the Native Version that the developer mentioned some info about it in a previous Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3808730/view/501717042106204534" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA have discontinued Quake II RTX</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quake II RTX released back in 2019, with NVIDIA using it to show off more ray tracing effects for their RTX GPUs but now they're done with it. It's still free on Steam and the project behind it is open source, but NVIDIA aren't doing any more with it now.</p>
<p>Noted on the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/Q2RTX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> page is a message that it has been discontinued, and the GitHub repository has been archived. They did one small final release version 1.8.1 with a few fixes but that's it now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20260743471765795145gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it: "Quake II RTX builds on the work of Christoph Schied and the team at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, who added ray tracing to Quake II to create Q2VKPT (in turn building upon the Q2PRO code base). NVIDIA has introduced new path-traced visual effects, has improved texturing, and has made dozens of other changes and improvements, resulting in an experience that rivals games created today, and pushes your RTX hardware to the limit."</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terminator 2D: NO FATE from Bitmap Bureau / Reef Entertainment has released today to give you some retro themed action-platformer goodness.</p>

      <title>Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7 on Linux, D7VK has a 1.0 release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bringing more classic gaming goodies with the Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7, D7VK 1.0 is out now for Linux.</p>
<p>From the GitHub page: "A Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 7, which allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine. It uses DXVK's D3D9 backend as well as Wine's DDraw implementation (or the windows native DDraw) and acts as a proxy between the two, providing a minimal D3D7-on-D3D9 implementation."</p>
<p>In the release <a href="https://github.com/WinterSnowfall/d7vk/releases/tag/v1.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned how they consider it "production ready" but not everything on it is quite finished, but it's good enough to run a whole bunch of games properly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19351272901765541763gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19351272901765541763gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured -  Clive Barker's Undying</em></p>
<p>Some notes from the release announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Why bother with D7VK at all?</h3>
<h4>The good (vs WineD3D):</h4>
<ul>
<li>Anti-aliasing / <code class="inline-code">D3DRENDERSTATE_ANTIALIAS</code> support (you can also optionally force enable it)</li>
<li>targeted performance fixes for bad behaving games (looking at you, 1NSANE)</li>
<li>built-in frame caps for games known to break at high frame rates, or simply over 60 FPS (which is, sadly, quite common in D3D7)</li>
</ul>
<h4>The bad:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A few missing D3D7 features, that I'll most likely add at some point in the future</li>
<li>General WSI wonkiness on Wayland</li>
</ul>
<h4>The ugly:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Quite a few remaining bugs</li>
<li>A cursed design that by some miracle happens to work well enough in most cases</li>
</ul>
<h3>You'll still need to use WineD3D for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Earlier D3D and DDraw</li>
<li>Games that make use of cursed legacy DDraw &lt;-&gt; D3D7 interop (thankfully, it didn't turn out to be entirely all <em>that</em> common)</li>
<li>Its excellent general compatibility and feature coverage</li>
<li>GPUs that don't support Vulkan 1.3</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing to see what the open source community comes up with. </p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how insane it is to be a game developer right now, we've hit an all-time high for game releases on Steam in 2025 and not many get seen.</p>
<p>Taken from <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, we can see from their data that there's been 19,008 games for 2025. That is a <em>lot</em> of games to be launching in a single year, which is up from 18,558 games in 2024 and 14,111 in 2023. This is a reminder that developers are not just competing with new releases when launching a game, but <em>everything</em> on Steam with many older titles remaining incredibly popular.</p>
<p>Showing just how difficult it can be to actually get a game in front of an audience, of the 19,008 from this year, a whopping 9,269 games have 10 or fewer reviews. There is a slight silver lining here though, as it appears the number of games receiving at least 100 reviews have been growing over the years since 2020. It's a bit lower than 2024 right now, but that will likely even-out before the end of 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10867522751765534775gol1.png"/></p>
<p>It doesn't take a whole lot to launch a game on Steam. A little bit of know-how along with paying the Steam Direct fee which is about $100 / £73.99. After that, if you're approved, it's mostly down to developers and publishers to actually find a way to market their games and cut through the noise of hundreds releasing constantly.</p>
<p>As someone who follows the constant stream of releases, there really is a lot of pure junk getting released onto Steam. And, with the increase use of generative AI, that release counter is only going to continue increasing. I expect 2026 will be another explosive year on Steam. I even just recently had a press release enter the GamingOnLinux mailbox that proudly mentioned the game was "100% AI", which went quickly into the bin.</p>
<p>Leaving a review for a game you enjoyed is still one of the best boosts for a game developer. So something to keep in mind.</p>

      <title>Aspyr have indefinitely delayed Deus Ex Remastered</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After revealing the Deus Ex Remastered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/deus-ex-remastered-announced-and-arrives-in-february-2026/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in September</a>, Aspyr faced a fair amount of backlash on the style of it and now it has been delayed. There's no date being shared for when it might release now.</p>
<p>They posted on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3131640/view/618811986201804985" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and across social media to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered.</p>
<p>We've listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes.</p>
<p>All existing preorders will be fully refunded. Thank you again for your patience and support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we hear any more about a new date, we'll let you know. <em>That's if it doesn't get cancelled.</em></p>
<p>Hopefully they'll be able to bring it up to a standard that Deus Ex fans will love, as it would be great to see it done properly and bring new players into the Deus Ex universe with it. Perhaps they need to take a look at what Nightdive Studios have been doing with their many highly successful updates of older games.</p>
<p>The original trailer is below:</p>

      <title>Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with the COSMIC Desktop Environment is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have today finally released Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with the newly launched COSMIC Desktop Environment. Giving the team at System76 their own foundation to build upon and help make their hardware more tailored and unique, it will be interesting to see the wider reception for the COSMIC desktop.</p>
<p>I'm certainly not expecting perfection from the first proper release of COSMIC, but from the time I've spent playing around with it - I am quite impressed with what they've done. The way everything flows is quite nice. Although, I really don't like the big thick borders by default.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6097662201765478834gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6097662201765478834gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5534457201765478833gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5534457201765478833gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>Kitten Space Agency is the spiritual successor to Kerbal Space Program</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitten Space Agency is an in-development spiritual successor to Kerbal Space Program from RocketWerkz that you can try right now for free.</p>
<p>It's using a crowdfunding model to pull in supporters via <a href="https://ahwoo.com/store/KPbAA1Au/kitten-space-agency" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ahwoo</a>, which allows you to try the game completely free without paying a penny and it's your choice to donate after if you feel it's worth it. With what happened to Kerbal Space Program 2 where we still don't entirely know what's going on but the game is basically dead, another developer picking up the torch seems like an interesting idea for fans of the original.</p>
<p>More about it: Kitten Space Agency is a space-flight game that turns real aerospace concepts into something you can learn, test, and explore. Built in Auckland, New Zealand by RocketWerkz, the project aims to inspire future explorers while giving players deep control over engineering, mission planning, and flight execution. KSA is powered by RocketWerkz's new BRUTAL development framework, designed to enable moddability, high performance, and long-term scalability. </p>
<p>A popular idea it seems even this early-on, with the developer recently announcing their campaign has crossed over $100K in funding from people. The project is led by DayZ and ICARUS creator Dean Hall, joined by Felipe Falanghe (HarvestR), original creator of Kerbal Space Program, and Stefan Moluf, former SpaceX flight software engineer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15911984681765477268gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15911984681765477268gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>"The support for Kitten Space Agency has been incredibly encouraging. We set out to try a more open way of building games and it’s clear people want to be part of that mission. Contributions through Ahwoo help us keep developing the project, but so does playing our other games like Stationeers or Icarus which help fund the work behind Kitten Space Agency. However people choose to support us, we’re grateful. It all helps us keep pushing this mission forward."  — Dean Hall, CEO of RocketWerkz.</p>
<p>The game in the current development build appears to work on Linux. I tested it adding the installer directly into Steam, and setting it to use Proton Experimental and it loaded without an issue.</p>
<p>One to keep an eye on if you love your simulation games.</p>

      <title>The huge Project Zomboid build 42 finally gets multiplayer just in time for the holidays</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow - that sure took a while! A year since the first part of build 42 released and just in time for the holidays, Project Zomboid build 42 finally goes online. You'll now be able to play with friends, or others online but the developers recommend only playing on whitelisted servers or in Steam co-op. However, the build is labelled as "unstable" still, you need to opt into the Beta for it.</p>
<p>The list of what has changed for build 42.13.0 that includes multiplayer is long, <a href="https://theindiestone.com/forums/index.php?/topic/88501-build-42130-unstable-multiplayer-released/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">really long</a>. That's not taking into account all the main features added for build 42 originally (which at this point is years in the making) that was basically more of everything and huge improvements across every part of the survival game. <em>Saves made before 42.13.0 are also not compatible.</em></p>
<p>Here's their little celebration video for it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lYKS02PYF7E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4933dbfd4c5109e0735c6c00dfa71b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lYKS02PYF7E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the Linux side, Project Zomboid will do native Wayland support now too if available. Here's what they said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- The Linux version will use Wayland if available and the -Dzomboid.wayland=1 JVM option is used.<br/>
  -- This required moving keyboard initialisation until after window creation, only when Wayland is used.<br/>
  -- Known issues: While testing Wayland, it does not seem to be enabled by default on Linux using Wayland. It is also not possible to enable it through any Steam commands, since the “Dzomboid” flag is only a jvm command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This build is Steam-only for now, they will put it up on GOG when it's ready.</p>

      <title>Fantasy city-builder with huge battles Songs of Syx gets a major upgrade with a focus on war</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rated Overwhelmingly Positive from users on Steam, war is the focus of a major upgrade that just arrived for fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx.</p>
<p>What actually is it? Taking inspiration from the likes of Rome: Total War, Caesar, and RimWorld with the solo developer aiming to create the most ambitious city state sim ever. You start off with nothing and build up from a tiny village into a huge sprawling city and eventually a whole empire.</p>
<p>Version 70 is quite the game-changing upgrade for the battles in the game with the introduction of spearmen and cavalry, and the AI has been improved to be a fair bit smarter too so a little more planning is going to be needed. The scale of this one is seriously impressive!</p>
<p>They also have a brand new trailer to accompany the release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ci4_cFT7yaQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bee9eef018bb80849e7a3f05b692de3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ci4_cFT7yaQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And additionally the developer update video to go over it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yHI0BqHv0Hc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c1e8bcc886ffe597455d230d423f0d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yHI0BqHv0Hc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The main update highlights condensed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New quick battle mode.</li>
<li>New unit cards, tooltips and QoL for divisions.</li>
<li>Division flags.</li>
<li>Improved AI tactics, and division maneuvering.</li>
<li>Remade combat mechanics and stats (New battle engine).</li>
<li>Cavalry (livestock equip). Increases mass, offence skill, decreases defense skill.</li>
<li>Spears. Increases formation defence (defence gained in the front of on guard divisions).</li>
<li>Visuals for all battle equips.</li>
<li>10 new soundtracks.</li>
<li>Advisor.</li>
<li>Resettle option (start over but keep level + resources).</li>
<li>Labs and libraries have non-recource options, enabled by default.</li>
<li>Limits on techs in tech tree.</li>
<li>All titles can be unlocked per race for more effect.</li>
<li>More efficient janitors.</li>
<li>Hunters effective for a bit longer, but diminishing returns per employee.</li>
<li>Autumn tree colors more prominent.</li>
<li>Lifebringer achievement fixed.</li>
<li>Fixed stalled invasions.</li>
<li>Fixed buggy caravans.</li>
<li>Region delivery of farmed goods fix.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dog merging roguelike deckbuilder Dogpile is out now and it&#39;s wonderful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dogpile was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/merge-dogs-to-make-bigger-dogs-in-the-roguelike-deckbuilder-dogpile/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of my absolute favourites</a> during Steam Next Fest in October, and as a surprise it released yesterday. Note: the developer provided a key to GamingOnLinux.</p>
<p>This is the first collaboration between the co-developers Studio Folly and Toot Games, the audio design team A Shell in the Pit, and the co-publishing team at WINGS. A deck-builder where you drop dogs on top of dogs and they'll merge into bigger dogs. It's pretty clever how they've merged elements of Suika Game bouncy physics, with elements of Balatro and deck-builders into something unique. I just love all the tiny little animations on the different dogs, really helps bring it to life.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10888640981765473608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10888640981765473608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You play dogs, get a little money when you combine them and keep progressing to customize them with special traits and figure out game-breaking combinations. It can get pretty funny with the different traits on the dogs, especially when things get a little bouncy with the physics system.</p>
<p>Check out the developer feature below that went with the surprise release:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6KCfDtJt6ts"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97851314f510275b65d3e41ddc783e79.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6KCfDtJt6ts" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game works great on Linux with Proton. Wonderful stuff and easily worth a purchase if you love your more chilled-out styled games. A lovely casual deck-builder.</p>

      <title>Monster Hunter Wilds is set for some big performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a recent showcase video, Capcom revealed that Monster Hunter Wilds is set for multiple patches that should bring some decent performance boosts. </p>
<p>Performance seems to be a constant problem for the game, even on a high-end PC it has been full of issues. Perhaps these upgrades might even make it just a bit closer to playable on Steam Deck too. As shown in the Monster Hunter Showcase December 2025 showcase video, a screen capture of their plans is below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16373718431765463979gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16373718431765463979gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Title Update 4 is due out December 16, so it will be interesting to see just how far those listed upgrades will push the game. However, Title Update 4 is the "final large-scale update" for the game outside of a few technical patches they have planned as noted in the image above. So they'll be mostly moving onto other games.</p>
<p>All that and more in the video you can view below:</p>

      <title>Paradox have hopefully fixed the Vulkan performance in Crusader Kings III</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the release of the Crusader Kings III: All Under Heaven expansion and free update, the Linux and macOS versions were problematic but it should now be fixed.</p>
<p>There were many reports of it, and it seemed specifically to do with the Vulkan API and it affected Windows too. As of the latest update with version 1.18.2 released today, the issue should hopefully now be solved. Noted under the tech improvements part of the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We now support Apple Silicon CPUs natively (ARM architecture) and that should give a nice performance boost for people using M1/M2/M3/M4 chips.</li>
<li><strong>Graphical performance of Vulkan under Linux and Mac is brought back to roughly before-update levels.</strong></li>
<li>Map graphics shader performance has been fine tuned and improved, which will help out mid-range graphics cards the most.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A whole lot more came with this update too including three hit musical tracks from CK2 Jade Dragon for everyone, and various new features and various other bits of free content including: new events, special buildings, Steam Rich Presence for All Under Heaven features, UI improvements and so on.</p>
<p>It's a surprisingly big patch for the game. See all in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/594042189388972086" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>Talking point - what have you been playing lately?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome back, dear readers, to another community article for us all to have a little chat about what we've been playing recently. It's been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/talking-point-what-have-you-been-playing-lately/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">about a month</a> since we last did this, so it's time to see how you're all doing.</p>
<p>Last time I was completely hooked on ARC Raiders, clocking up a current total of 135 hours. I'm at a point where I feel like I've seen pretty much everything the game has to offer, and so I've taken a bit of a break from it for a while to see how it evolves across a few updates. Very enjoyable though, as long as you don't mind the PvP where you end up losing your good stuff constantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4227499901765462380gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4227499901765462380gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9823858711765462379gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9823858711765462379gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now that I've kicked the ARC habit, I've been jumping into a few other games including the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sektori-is-absolutely-one-of-the-best-modern-twin-stick-shooters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">truly excellent Sektori</a>. Mixed in with some Overwatch 2 for the new season and winter events, because family members love it. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/overwatch-2-with-season-20-has-some-very-annoying-crash-bugs-on-linux-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Despite a brief hiccup</a> with the latest season, it continues running great on Linux.</p>
<p>I also properly tried to get into Fallout 76 with the partner recently too, but something about it just feels a bit off. I can't quite put my finger on why. I think, perhaps, I just enjoyed Fallout 3 and New Vegas too much that it doesn't do it for me as an MMO? More time needed to see for sure. Am I really missing too much if I skip over F76?</p>
<p>Over to you in the comments - what have you been playing lately?</p>

      <title>Open source XR runtime Monado 25.1.0 released with expanded hardware support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monado is an impressive open source XR runtime that aims to support a whole lot of hardware, with a focus on great Linux support and version 25.1.0 is out now. If you're a true XR enthusiast this is one for you to check out, as you might see some hardware you have working quite well with it.</p>
<p>What's new in this release? Quite a lot! Highlights courtesy of Collabora:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Hand-tracking enhancements</h4>
<p>This release introduces support for the XR_EXT_hand_tracking_data_source extension, enabling Monado to distinguish between unobstructed and conforming hand-tracking modes, an important step for better controller-aware tracking and more robust multi-source input. Alongside this work, several drivers were updated to leverage the new roles, and long-standing quirks in hand-pose selection and orientation were fixed.</p>
<h4>Asynchronous OpenXR calls</h4>
<p>Another major milestone is the introduction of Monado's xrt_future system and support for the XR_EXT_future extension. This new async plumbing code prepares Monado for the next generation of OpenXR features that rely on asynchronous operations.</p>
<h4>More device support</h4>
<p>Device support also expands significantly in this release with new drivers for the Blubur S1, Rift DK2, and SolarXR IPC, plus improvements for the Razer Hydra, Vive Pro 2, Xreal Air 2 Ultra, and Fujitsu headset. The compositor sees important enhancements as well, including per-scanline timewarp for rolling-scanout displays and more robust swapchain setup. On Android, users can now scan and store Cardboard calibration QR codes directly from the Monado main application page.</p>
<p>Overall, Monado 25.1.0 focuses on improving reliability, modernizing internal infrastructure, and broadening hardware compatibility. All these enhancements continue the project’s mission to make open XR technology more capable, flexible, and widely accessible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See more in the Collabora <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/monado-25-1-0-enabling-tomorrows-openxr-experiences.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado/-/releases/v25.1.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>I'll admit I haven't actually tried anything with Monado yet, but from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamvr-2-13-brings-a-whole-lot-of-bug-fixes/?comment_id=285480" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous comments</a> on GamingOnLinux, you could see a good experience with it. Hopefully Valve will continue to improve SteamVR directly on Linux too, especially with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming Steam Frame</a> that uses SteamOS.</p>

      <title>AMD FSR Redstone arrives with AMD FSR SDK 2.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD today properly revealed and released AMD FSR Redstone with the AMD FSR SDK 2.1, bringing many enhancements to their upscaling tech. Currently though, there's no direct support for Linux. Most likely, we'll have to wait and see how Valve's Proton / Wine can handle the new tech.</p>
<p>They're only officially supporting Windows 10 and Windows 11 with DirectX 12, that and the main highlight features are still just for AMD RDNA 4 (AMD Radeon RX 9000 series) but they do say there's "analytical fallback modes for select features support RDNA 3.5 architecture and earlier graphics". With this they're also doing a minor rebrand to cut down on all the long names so instead of things like "AMD FidelityFX" it's now just all going under the "AMD FSR" branding.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of what's new for this release includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Frame Generation</strong> - an advanced frame-generating solution that leverages state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) algorithms to generate high-quality intermediate frames from two consecutive source images, interpolating the motion of pixels between the start and end images. The neural approach significantly reduces artifacts common in analytical interpolation such as ghosting and motion discontinuities.</li>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Ray Regeneration</strong> - a standalone, machine learning-powered real-time denoiser that integrates seamlessly with any game engine, enabling high-quality visuals by denoising inputs from ray-traced workloads. Requiring AMD RDNA 4 architecture graphics, it works best when combined with other AMD FSR “Redstone” technologies to transforming noisy outputs from ray tracing into a clean, coherent image.</li>
<li><strong>AMD FSR Radiance Caching</strong> - a state-of-the-art illumination cache designed to work in tandem with Monte Carlo path tracing to boost rendering performance. At its core is an online machine learning model that continuously trains on complex, multi-bounce global illumination (GI) on-device and in real-time. The result is richer, more immersive lighting environments that respond dynamically without the need for pre-computation or baking.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Factorio mod developer and Hooded Horse reveal new automation game Substructure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is going to be horrible for my free time. Substructure sounds like a real interesting entry into the factory building automation genre. Coming from the developer of the popular Factorio mod Ultracube, now going by Dubious Design and publisher Hooded Horse. With vertical layers, it's set to add some interesting design choices.</p>
<p>More about it: "Set on a rogue planet that appears at the far reaches of the solar system, players will be tasked with leading an expedition to uncover the mysteries of this interstellar interloper. Establish complex automated factories and production chains on the lush surface of this alien world, all to support further exploration below the crust. Players can also work alone or with friends as they build around intricate caverns, and exploit alien resources hidden beneath the surface, driving the light of industrialization to the very depths. What mysteries will awaken and what dangerous threats will emerge remain to be seen…"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OwV_0_25zh8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/adde8c5946758e2d24190d48da6b0b60.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OwV_0_25zh8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “Dubious Design is building something that goes far beyond the usual factory-builder,” says Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender. “Between the vertical layers, intricate logistics, and day one support for modding and co-op, this will be the last factory game you’ll ever play.”</p>
<p>“We couldn’t be happier to (finally) announce we’re working with Hooded Horse,” says Dubious Design CEO Michael Donoghue. “It was clear from the outset that we had a shared passion for these types of experiences, and together we’ll be able to make Substructure truly great. We could not have hoped for a better partner.”</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Industry &amp; Agriculture – Resource extraction and management, from humble crops to vital building materials, to rare minerals.</li>
<li>Factory-oh! – Automation mechanics that will let the fires of industry burn bright!</li>
<li>Multi-level – build programmable elevator shafts to explore beneath the surface, and adapt production chains to account for resources coming from other layers.</li>
<li>Constant Innovation – use the materials found below the ground to improve processes on the surface. </li>
<li>Multiplayer – play solo or with friends in co-op! </li>
<li>Mod Support – From day one, add new resources, buildings, or just balance the game as desired! This game is built by modders, for modders.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Social stealth narrative game Better Than Us is all about creating a web of lies to steal from the ultra-rich</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><!-- squire -->A political social stealth narrative game about lying and stealing from the ultra-wealthy? Better Than Us certainly sounds like a game for the times. Sitting somewhere between a point and click adventure and a visual novel, it has a really great style to it.</p>
<p>Developed by Little Bat Games, who made the BAFTA-nominated Vampire Therapist it's going to feature an all-star voice cast to keep you hooked in. Here's a little more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->Set in the year 2200, Better Than Us depicts a (not entirely absurd) future directly inspired by humanity’s past and present. The wealthiest people in centuries have created floating cities to insulate themselves from a worldwide climate apocalypse of their own creation, not to own mansions and sports cars, but to buy moral authority itself. And surprise, surprise: extreme wealth doesn't afford anyone a greater sense of morality.</p>
<p><!-- squire -->They might have stolen our future, but in <strong><em>Better Than Us</em></strong> the spoils of past plundering and pillaging can be stolen from them. Players will take on the role of a master thief and manipulator (and her rodent pal), infiltrating exclusive parties thrown by the ultra-wealthy in their floating fortresses. Rather than stealth or violence, players will use charm and deception to develop key relationships with a cast of bizarre characters corrupted by their own wealth. They’ll need to remember which lies were told to which people, weaving an ever-growing web of deceit that even an all-powerful oligarchy will struggle to see through. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LVUF2QlTa04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f2235f8dca1a559be58c62330e39f759.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LVUF2QlTa04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Looking to the past is a helpful way of examining modern issues. Not only is the historical record inspiring, but dead people are less able to sue small game studios," said Cyrus Nemati, creative director at Little Bat Games. </p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tell Lies, Remember Lies</strong> - It doesn't matter what you say. It matters that you remember what you said, and to whom. Track your deceptions or watch them collapse around you.</li>
<li><strong>Extraordinary Voice Acting -</strong><em> Better Than Us</em> will include an all-star cast led by Sarah Grayson (<em>Hades II, Vampire Therapist, Gone Home),</em> joined by Cyrus Nemati (<em>Hades II, Vampire Therapist, Duck Detective)</em> and more.</li>
<li><strong>Sneak Queen </strong>- Navigate lavish parties in an opulent post-apocalyptic world, sneak into places you don't belong, and steal what the wealthy value most: their stupid expensive crap.</li>
<li><strong>History Echoes Forward</strong> - Developed in consultation with historians from Oxford, UC Davis, and the University of Florida, Better Than Us is directly inspired by the consequences of extreme wealth inequality through the past and present.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer confirmed it will launch with support for Linux, macOS and Windows.</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s 2025 fundraising has been a huge success</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Absolutely smashing their goals, the KDE team have managed to have a huge success for the <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2025 fundraiser</a> that's currently ongoing. 70% of KDE funding comes directly from users, so it's essential to help fund the free and open source software that you love.</p>
<p>The current total at time of writing has managed to hit a nice <strong>€272,256.5</strong>. Going by a <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/12/06/this-week-in-plasma-better-hardware-support/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from developer Nate Graham, a whole lot of it came directly from the KDE Plasma pop-up that they added to remind people to support development:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Donate to <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">KDE’s 2025 fundraiser</a>! It really makes a big difference. Believe it or not, the fundraiser has topped €100,000! And that’s just for the fundraiser itself; the yearly donation pop-up has also raised another €100k in just the past five days (!!!).</p>
<p>It’s kind of amazing. This money will help keep KDE strong and independent for years to come, and I’m just in awe of the generosity of the KDE community and userbase. Thank you all for helping KDE to grow and prosper!</p>
<p>If money is tight, you can help KDE by directly <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">getting involved</a>. Donating time is actually more impactful than donating money. Each contributor makes a huge difference in KDE — you are not a number or a cog in a machine! You don’t have to be a programmer, either; many other opportunities exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see this. I hope that 2026 will see KDE and the Plasma desktop continue to reach new heights. And with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a> launching next year with SteamOS Linux and the Plasma desktop mode - it's going to be a great year for Linux gaming.</p>
<p>I donated to KDE this year, did you?</p>

      <title>Get ready for another adventure with The Darkside Detective: Backside of the Moon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The lovely Darkside Detective series is set to expand with a new announcement of The Darkside Detective: Backside of the Moon. Coming from Irish developer Spooky Doorway and published by Akupara Games, there's no release date for it yet but most likely next year.</p>
<p>It was shown off during the 2025 Unity Awards Showcase earlier this month. Here's a bit more about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Detective McQueen and Officer Dooley are back from their sabbatical, and although they miss their midday mimosas and suntanning on the beach, crime never sleeps, and neither does McQueen (we’re prescribing him Melatonin, god help us it works).</p>
<p>Follow six never before seen cases, where our dream(y) team is back and more ready than ever to put the zing in Van Helsing although… this time around, there are no vampire stories... that we know of. Still, our heroes swore a vow to serve and protect so they will explore, gather, combine, point AND click their way through whatever comes their way. Keep an eye out for werewolves, cursed items, rituals, treasure hunts, and perhaps the most terrifying monster of all - rich people!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See the reveal trailer below:</p>

<p>We don't know yet if it will have Native Linux support but their previous games did. If not, there's Proton to run it on Linux.</p>

      <title>Overwatch 2 with Season 20 has some very annoying crash-bugs on Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Update 10/12/25 08:42 AM UTC - Blizzard actually fixed it directly in the game. Really great to see actual direct support like this. From the Overwatch <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/proton-support-is-broken-game-crashes-on-esc-chats-etc/992546/79" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum</a> from developer Bee:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Hi all, apologies for this issue. We have released a patch that we believe resolves this crash. Thanks!" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2732921411765356111gol1.jpg"/></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Overwatch 2 has launched the big Season 20 update but unfortunately for Linux / SteamOS fans, it comes with some really annoying crash bugs.</p>
<p>Such is the way with live-service type games, where Linux clearly isn't a tested platform before updates are rolled out. Something that may cause issues over time with Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new upcoming Steam Machine</a>. However, as long as you <em>don't</em> do a few things you should be okay. The issue is that certain menu interactions will just completely crash the game. We'll have to wait for Valve developers to get a fix into Proton for the game to work properly again.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the bug report on Valve's Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7033#issuecomment-3634156013" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> the game will crash and quit if you do any of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the chat and close it or press enter with it open (confirmed myself).</li>
<li>Clicking on a prestige tier in the new battle pass (confirmed myself).</li>
<li>Potentially pressing ESC during a match (didn't happen for me).</li>
<li>Clicking around in the Missions section of the menu.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, stay off the chat entirely during matches and you should still be able to play. As annoying as that may be. I've played quite a few rounds and it will reliably crash if you try to interact with the chat box. There's also posts on the Steam forum about it crashing on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2357570/discussions/0/689743495770993552/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Linux PCs</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2357570/discussions/0/689743495770990967/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uN5FMv69Sas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/795f0f26fdf46d0bd51c986851ee6203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uN5FMv69Sas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hopefully we'll see a fix soon!</p>

      <title>Total War: MEDIEVAL III announced by Creative Assembly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Creative Assembly recently held their 25th Anniversary Showcase for the Total War series, with Total War: MEDIEVAL III being announced. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/four-total-war-classics-join-gog-in-their-preservation-program-with-more-on-the-way/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG also recently expanded their Preservation Program</a> with some classic Total War titles and more are coming to GOG too.</p>
<p>As for Total War: MEDIEVAL III, it's quite some time away as it's only in the "opening stages" and sounds like it's going to be a <em>big</em> thing for Creative Assembly as a developer. Their full announcement on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been waiting a long time to say this: Total War is going back to the medieval era.</p>
<p>We’re in the opening stages of Total War: MEDIEVAL III’s development – pre-production, to be precise, meaning we’re still years from release. But this isn’t just another game for us, it’s the realisation of something we’ve dreamed about for almost 20 years. The Medieval series is one of the most cherished chapters in Total War’s history, and creating a true successor is a goal we’ve held close for a long time. Now, we finally have the chance to make it happen.</p>
<p>This next chapter will be both a tribute to its predecessors and a bold revolution for what historical Total War can be. The team’s vision is clear: to create the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox featuring our signature blend of grand strategy and tactical real-time battles. A game that lets you shape your realms, rewrite history, and immerse yourself in the drama and intrigue of the Middle Ages like never before.</p>
<p>Some of you might be asking why we’ve revealed it this early, and the answer is quite simple: we want you to come on this development journey with us. At certain points throughout the year, we’ll share behind-the-scenes insights and give you a closer look at how the game is taking shape, so you can see it evolve with us – and in some cases influence its direction.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a sequel; it’s the rebirth of historical Total War.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As part of this, they're also completely overhauling their game engine "Warcore". They said it is the most advanced game engine in the history of the franchise that will empower their developers "with powerful tools to make gameplay more immersive, dynamic, and responsive than ever before". They said this new game engine also opens up the possibility for console releases too, so hopefully this means some big gamepad improvements for future titles on PC as well (which could be great for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's new Steam Machine</a>).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qFKhUJTnC-E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/195f3611e905bdaff02c2ff217e8aa26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While Feral Interactive have previously done Native Linux ports of their games, it's far too early to tell if they will continue to do so, as Feral seem to be mostly out of doing Linux ports now. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/total-war-pharaoh-announced-linux-port-from-feral-interactive/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back when Total War: PHARAOH was announced</a>, Creative Assembly incorrectly listed Feral as doing a Linux port with Feral later confirming it was only doing macOS for it. I'm going to presume you'll need Proton to continue playing the Total War series on Linux at this point, especially if you want cross-platform multiplayer.</p>

      <title>War Thunder is getting infantry combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh no, it's going to pull me back in isn't it? War Thunder is finally adding infantry combat to its roster of war games in a future update. Testing is due to begin this month, being spread across stages for an eventual full roll-out during next year as the mode is still under development.</p>
<p>Interestingly, they're taking some elements from another game they publish called Enlisted, with you controlling a squad. They said you control a single soldier, but you have "full tactical control over the entire squad" and they will automatically follow you and assist in all combat situations.</p>
<p>It will come with a new location that mixes infantry, ground vehicles and aircraft set in Eastern Europe. During the closed beta there will only be a Domination mode, with soldiers and vehicles battling for control over a few specific points. There will also be specific set squads to pick during the beta. </p>

<p>They said the beta will be supported across "Windows, Linux and Mac, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles".</p>

      <title>Classic roguelike top-down shooter Nuclear Throne major update 100 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A lovely blast from the past of 2015, Nuclear Throne from the revived Vlambeer has update #100 out now with some major additions and improvements. Originally founded by Rami Ismail and Jan Willem Nijman, nowadays Nijman owns 100% of the company after Ismail sold their part in it back in 2024.</p>
<p>Going back 10 years ago, Nuclear Throne was easily one of the most popular games in its genre. To this day, it's easily still one of the best too. Valve have also now given it a re-test and they've given it the green tick of Steam Deck Verified approval. It does have a Native Linux version, but Valve set it to use Proton 10.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11870694471765280170gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11870694471765280170gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main highlights of it include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A thirteenth character: <strong>Cuz </strong>is not afraid to show his emotions, with a Cry ability that tears through enemies and projectiles alike. Oh, and he gets to carry 3 (three) weapons.</li>
<li><strong>Custom mode,</strong> allowing you to modify Nuclear Throne to your liking, create unique runs and challenges, and to get to know the game better than ever before.</li>
<li>New unlockable <strong>C-skins</strong> for every character (and new achievements for these).</li>
<li>Localization for <strong>15 languages</strong>: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, BR Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Turkish, &amp; Dutch. Tell your friends around the world!</li>
<li>The game now supports up to <strong>4 player local co-op</strong>.</li>
<li>Co-op reviving has been reworked and now works with Revive Chests.</li>
<li>Co-op Ultra Mutations have been slightly changed to work with 2-4 characters.</li>
<li>Reworked and re-organized the settings menu.</li>
<li>The game now runs at <strong>60+ fps</strong> (but 30 is still supported for the true believers).</li>
<li><strong>Widescreen</strong> support.</li>
<li>New side art and a new cursor.</li>
<li>Open Mind has been buffed a little.</li>
<li>Mutations and weapons in the HUD now show information on hover.</li>
<li>The GO button in the menu has been replaced with a cool little icon. This was done <s>to save money on localization</s> so that we could fit Cuz in!</li>
<li>We are now Steam Deck™ Verified.</li>
<li>Updates Mac build to run on 64-bit devices including Apple Silicon.</li>
<li>Gamepads should work better, especially on computers with a bunch of them connected.</li>
<li>Community leaderboards site <a class="Focusable Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fthronebutt.com%2Fdaily" target="_blank">Thronebutt</a> has gotten a beautiful overhaul!</li>
<li>Many more little fixes and quality of life changes that you might already know from the beta branch. Full changelog can be found <a class="Focusable Link _29bMZB6BOQfTQ_3za-w60I" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FYAL-Game-Tools%2Fbits-of-nuclear-throne%2Fblob%2Fmain%2FChangelog.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>We forgot to add any secrets. Sorry.</li>

      <title>Discord gets improvements for video on Linux PCs and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer team at Discord released a new engineering <a href="https://discord.com/blog/discord-patch-notes-december-8-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> yesterday (December 8th) detailing lots of fixes, along with some Linux improvements. As one of the most popular chat apps in the world, it's good to see their support of Linux continue to get better over time.</p>
<p>Scanning over the long multi-list of changes here's some improvements for us:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Resolved an issue that caused Linux clients to display two titlebars.</li>
<li>Discord now supports hardware accelerated video encoding for AMD graphics cards on Linux through VAAPI, yielding almost twice the quality using less resources.</li>
<li>Go Live on Steamdeck is now faster with zero-copy encoding from Gamescope, making it possible to share the action with your friends without burning up your Steamdeck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest is mostly just a long separated list of bug fixes, along with an upgrade on Desktop to use Electron 37. Along with some other main highlights their team noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We've refactored our media upload client code with improved retry logic and added support for file upload resumption, so large uploads can continue if interrupted. The new retry logic is written in Rust and delivered significant latency improvements—around 15% overall, with mobile platforms seeing the biggest gains (21% faster on iOS, 10% faster on Android). </li>
<li>We’ve shipped a redesign of our Desktop User Settings. The goal of the redesign was to improve user’s ability to find what they’re looking for by improving the design language. Our metrics indicate this was successful, but please reach out if you have feedback.</li>
<li>We invested in some CDN configuration changes that dramatically improved video embed startup times. P90 latency improved 54% from 600ms to 275ms, and p95 latency improved 47% from 1,250ms to 658ms. This also fixed certain aberrant cases where videos could take as long as 40 seconds to play. Enjoy the consistent, speedy loads of video content.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Hytale will run on Linux PCs via Flatpak but Steam Deck will require more work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the first release of Hytale finally approaching, the developers are still working through getting it running on Linux and macOS. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/hytale-devs-confirm-they-are-working-to-bring-it-to-linux-and-macos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As covered on GamingOnLinux previously</a>, the developers did confirm they were working on both versions officially now.</p>
<p>At least now we know how you'll be getting it, with the developer doing it via a Flatpak which means you should be able to install it across many different distributions.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/slikey/status/1998020881499513243" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X/Twitter from Kevin Carstens, the Co-Founder and Tech Director for Hytale, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="RE: Mac &amp; Linux Support  We have finally removed the last library that was causing trouble for Mac and Linux support.  We are able to build for Linux now using flatpak. Mac builds are work in progress. There is more work on the CICD pipeline to host the files required for flatpak.  This is still NO CONFIRMATION for Linux / Mac support at launch but we are getting closer to that becoming a reality.  More in-depth testing remains, will keep updating as we move forward." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17979898501765278486gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And for those wanting to play it on Steam Deck, it may technically work since it will have a Linux version but may not feel very good right now:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Thats a different story. Steamdeck may be technically possible but you still have the small screen size, gamepad controls and battery optimizations. We treat Steamdeck as a seperate platform in terms of development. We won't prevent you from installing it and trying but we need to do more work to really support it." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12592249441765278485gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's also no gamepad support at launch, but it's next up on the accessibility roadmap.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic becomes Team Fortress 2 Classified and arrives January 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer team EMINOMA have officially rebranded Team Fortress 2 Classic into Team Fortress 2 Classified, and they've set a release date for January 30th.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/team-fortress-2-classic-scrap-their-open-beta-and-new-valve-rules-likely-mean-they-have-to-change-the-name/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux back in October</a> they had issues running a playtest demo that had to be scrapped due to technical stuff on Steam, and alluded to changing the name due to new rules from Valve. This was confirmed in a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3545060/view/512976676069574040" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> to announce the new Team Fortress 2 Classified name. Turns out sorting a new name when you're based on a Valve game is not a particularly easy or quick process.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8399888661765276662gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Thankfully, it's all sorted and should be out for everyone to play for free on January 30th.</p>
<p>Some highlights from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>NEW-OLD FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Meet the Civilian, a brand-new special class based on the legacy Team Fortress character, and deliver him mostly-unharmed to the objective in VIP mode.</li>
<li>Use TF2 pre-release inspired weapons like the Nail Gun, the Dynamite Pack, and the Tranquilizer Gun, all redesigned from the ground up to feel right at home with what's already there.</li>
<li>Go on a rampage in Multi-Team maps, where GRN and YLW bring their unique (yet strangely identical) brand of violence to Arena, King of the Hill, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h4>NEW-NEW FEATURES</h4>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive new gamemodes, including Domination and VIP Race — all playable on professional-quality official maps, with more yet to come.</li>
<li>Jump pads, flak cannons, bricks, chains wrapped around your fists; made-in-house weapons that go beyond mere sidegrades, and dramatically change how you play the game.</li>
<li>Extensive modding support, allowing players to customize the look of their game, and allowing servers to host advanced custom weapon packs and maps.</li>
<li>A whole host of visual enhancements, including improved textures, models, mapping features, and restored toon-style shading that was mostly absent in the retail release.</li>
<li>A chicken, or so we're led to believe.</li>
</ul>

</table>
<p>It's nice to see another company put their money where their mouth is. Lots of companies talk about openness and the like, but many don't bother to support all the projects they make use of. For Framework, it seems perfectly fitting for them to get on board with more open source with the nature of their modular open hardware.</p>

<p>Oh dear. Goonswarm Games are shutting down after Running With Scissors cancelled POSTAL: Bullet Paradise due to the use of generative AI. <em>It's a bit of a saga this one.</em></p>
<p>I covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/survivor-like-bullet-heavens-are-going-first-person-postal-with-postal-bullet-paradise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the initial announcement</a>, along with a follow-up update in there where Running With Scissors attempted to defend the developer. The backlash only continued, and eventually RWS cancelled it as per the statement GamingOnLinux was sent on December 5th via Vince Desi, founder of Running With Scissors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After revealing POSTAL: Bullet Paradise, a title Running With Scissors was planning on publishing but not developing, we've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned POSTAL Community. The strong feedback from them is that elements of the game are very likely AI-generated and thus has caused extreme damage to our brand and our company reputation.</p>
<p>We’ve always been, and will always be, transparent with our community. Our trust in the development team is broken; therefore, we've killed the project. We have a lot of good things coming (some you know and some you don’t).</p>
<p>Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we’ve always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the POSTAL franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond. We can’t wait to share more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a fresh follow-up statement on December 8th from Vince Desi, founder of Running With Scissors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following our statement on Friday, Running With Scissors would like to share an update. While we needed to cut ties with Goonswarm Games on Friday and state the reason for doing so, our broken trust, we still wanted to give Goonswarm the time and space to be transparent about what had occured.</p>
<p>After sharing <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1996984553257279918" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a tweet</a> on Friday that got more than 8.5 million views which denied they had used generative A.I. and were closing the studio, on Saturday, Goonswarm Games issued a <a href="https://x.com/goonswarmgames/status/1997357931436663056" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">follow-up tweet</a> acknowledging the use of generative A.I. and apologizing. We wish them all the best as we both move forward in our seperate ways.</p>
<p>Running With Scissors has always operated with an unwavering commitment to the truth and transparency. We look forward to continuing to support our fans and expand on the <em>POSTAL</em> universe played by millions.</p>
