      <title>Square Enix shifting from &#34;quantity to quality&#34; and be more multi-platform</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Final Fantasy developer Square Enix have <a href="https://tdnet-pdf.kabutan.jp/20240513/140120240513592496.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released</a> their Financial Results for the end of the Japanese financial year, and it seems they're going through a big change in their strategy.</p>
<p>While they have numerous titles available on PC, plenty of which work great on Linux and Steam Deck thanks to Valve's Proton, they do have a habit of doing exclusives and they publish quite a lot overall. However, they've announced a new "medium-term business plan" which covers the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025 through the fiscal year ending March 31, 2027 that they're calling "Square Enix Reboots and Awakens" as a plan for long-term growth.</p>
<p>Part of this plan includes the move from "quantity to quality" so they can "strive for a regular launch cadence, focusing its development efforts and investments on titles with substantial potential to be loved by customers for years".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1736022781715606525gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1736022781715606525gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE</em></p>
<p>This plan involves a "Shift to a multiplatform strategy" for HD titles (meaning major consoles and PCs) as they "will aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs". But they also said they will include the "possibility of PC launches" for their SD titles (those meant for mobile and browsers).</p>
<p>For those of us on desktop PCs and handhelds, it's again good news, as they said clearly in regards to expanding digital sales that "the Group will engage in initiatives which focus on the acquisition of PC users".</p>
<p>So the hope is that we should see far more same-day (or close to it) releases on PC for Square Enix games.</p>
<p><em>Interesting that we have Square Enix just generally looking to expand across more platforms and slow down a little for quality, while <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ea-want-to-put-adverts-in-your-video-games-to-squeeze-you-for-every-penny/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA just want to put adverts in your games</a>.</em></p>

      <title>LPCAMM2 upgradeable RAM for laptops sounds awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p style="text-align:justify">Since I almost entirely use a desktop or Steam Deck, I don't follow the laptop world too closely but the new upgradeable LPCAMM2 RAM for laptops sounds really awesome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Laptop RAM has been a problem for quite a long time, and while there's various laptops out there that do have somewhat easily upgradable RAM there's plenty that don't. One of the major reasons being power-draw in tech like SODIMM (which is pretty old now), which is why plenty of vendors opt for LPDDR instead but that's generally soldered down tight by the CPU. So this is where the new LPCAMM2 comes in. It's low-power but soldered onto a special PCB that you can easily slot in and out of a laptop. Heck, could be great for handhelds too, some definite potential there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-delivers-crucial-lpcamm2-lpddr5x-memory-new-ai-ready" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Micron</a> are the first to supply it, with Lenovo getting in early adopting it for their new <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-unveils-its-new-ai-ready-thinkpad-p1-gen-7-mobile-workstation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ThinkPad P1 Gen 7</a>.</p>
<p>“LPCAMM2 is a game-changer for mobile workstation users who want to enjoy the benefits of the latest mobile high performance memory technology without sacrificing superior performance, upgradeability, power efficiency or space,” said Jonathan Weech, senior director of product marketing for Micron’s Commercial Products Group. “With LPCAMM2, we are delivering a future-proof memory solution, enabling faster speeds and longer battery life to support demanding creative and AI workloads.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The team at iFixit are really excited about it, since it makes laptops again more upgradable and repairable and going by their video below it looks ridiculously easy to do.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K3zB9EFntmA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/901e054a79f911fa879dd17a8505c595.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K3zB9EFntmA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Easy to replace, fast and low power draw? Sold. Hopefully we will begin to see wider vendor adoption on this!</p>
<p>There's a fun bit of history behind this tech you can read about in the iFixit <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/95078/lpcamm2-memory-is-finally-here" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> too. As we owe Dell a firm handshake on this one for the initial iteration (CAMM), which they decided not to keep for themselves to help make it an actual standard.</p>

      <title>Stellaris devs clarify &#34;ethical&#34; AI use in the Stellaris: The Machine Age DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a bit of a stir recently with the release of the Stellaris: The Machine Age DLC, as Paradox Interactive put up an AI statement on Steam that the developers have now attempted to give more info on.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840100/Stellaris_The_Machine_Age/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> there's a notice if you scroll down far enough that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We employ generative AI technologies during the creation of some assets. Typically this involves the ideation of content and visual reference material. These elements represent a minor component of the overall development. AI has been used to generate voices for an AI antagonist and a player advisor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have to do this, since Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now have new rules</a> about developers stating on Steam pages what they used AI for in the games.</p>
<p>So it's clear the game <em>is</em> using AI content, specifically for generated voices. In a way, an AI voice for an AI seems kind of on-point for a sci-fi space game like this but AI makes a lot of people feel quite uneasy (and for good reason). This caused some commotion on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/281990/discussions/0/4358996848566933856/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam forum</a> with lots of replies. The Game Director on Stellaris, Stephen Muray, did reply to the Steam post to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/281990/discussions/0/4358996848566933856/?ctp=6#c4364628251565788128" rel="noopener" target="_blank">note</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About this - the AI voice generation tools we use on Stellaris ensure that the voice actors that signed up and built the models receive royalties for every line we create. Ethical use of AI technology is very important to us - we're pretty good at exploring dystopian sci-fi and don't want to end up there ourselves.</p>
<p>I'll have the team put together a dev diary on how we use AI tools a couple of weeks from now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then explained further on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/1cop93r/comment/l3fsoez/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We didn't use it for concept art in The Machine Age - we've got a couple of awesome concept artists on staff for that. (You'll get to see more of their art in next week's dev diary.) There may be a couple of AI generated pieces on the visdev exploration/mood board, but they'd be among a bunch of other inspirational thematic pictures.</p>
<p>Personally, I use image generation tools to make basic sketches of things the System Designers and I are thinking of since I very much suck at art, but am pretty decent at getting computers to do what we're thinking. (Making tokens for 4,000 Pathfinder characters that I'll never play paid off!) The artists then take our ideas and might or might not use them as inspiration to make final assets. None of those design images go into the game.</p>
<p>We used some text generative AIs for "ideation of content", as we said - basically content designers can break writer's block by asking an AI "hey, what are 40 different things I can find in a mysterious box" and see if any of them spark any inspiration. None of the results or generated text go into the game.</p>
<p>We've got some strict guidelines in place on how we can use AI tools legally and ethically that we abide by.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of their concept artists also followed up to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/1cop93r/comment/l3fzsfd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">say</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chiming in here late but for myself (not speaking for the entire art team here) there were several explorations that leveraged generators but none were beyond the vis dev stage, and none were continued into the final art pieces.</p>
<p>For myself at least 0% of in-game assets include any sort of AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most importantly: how do you feel about this? Let me know in the comments. Currently the DLC has a Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>

      <title>CachyOS gets experimental handheld edition for ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion GO and Steam Deck (soon)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CachyOS, a customizable Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, has a new release available which brings with it an experimental edition for the growing list of PC gaming handhelds like the ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion GO, MSI Claw and coming soon to Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://cachyos.org/blog/2405-may-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> for their CachyOS May 2024 Release they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last but not least, we are adding an experimental handheld Edition for CachyOS. The Deckify Edition automatically setups a Steam Deck like experience and installs all required Gaming Tools for it. We are also proud to announce that this version will use the LAVD Scheduler, which is funded by Valve and improves the Frametime and 1% lows on Handhelds dramatically. The Deckify Edition is currently tested on the Rog Ally, Lenovo Legion GO and MSI Claw. Steam Deck support is also being currently worked on, but there are some small issues that should be fixed with upcoming releases. For more information check out following: <a href="https://discuss.cachyos.org/t/information-experimental-cachyos-deckify/203" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deckify information</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I'm not actually too familiar with CachyOS myself, with this being the first time actually looking at it.</em></p>
<p>Interesting to see even more competition in the Linux space for handhelds, there's now quite a few good options if you're tired of Windows or want something different to SteamOS. On top of this we also have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=ChimeraOS&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=Bazzite&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bazzite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=HoloISO&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HoloISO</a> and probably others I'm forgetting. I suppose the Manjaro Gaming Edition that will come on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/more-details-on-the-manjaro-orange-pi-neo-gaming-handheld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orange Pi Neo gaming handheld</a> also counts.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers Steam Deck plugin in testing, plus a way to Remote Play Together anything</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of NonSteamLaunchers got in touch to mention that a Steam Deck (Decky Loader) plugin is now available for testing, plus the latest release pulling in a handy tool for being able to Remote Play Together anything.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/releases/tag/v3.8.8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">v3.8.8</a> release that went out a few days ago they've hooked up <a href="https://github.com/m4dEngi/RemotePlayWhatever" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RemotePlayWhatever</a>, a tool I hadn't heard of until now. It's a "Tiny application that lets you force remote play together any game you have in your steam library including non-steam ones" which sounds really useful for playing games from other stores on Steam Deck and for emulation too.</p>
<p>On top of that the developer mentioned they have a Decky Loader <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchersDecky" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plugin</a> in development, which is now available for testing. This means you won't have to go into Desktop Mode to install or remove the extra stores like Epic Games, GOG and so on, as long as you have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/decky-loader-makes-steam-deck-plugins-even-easier-with-new-installer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader set up</a> and ready. Nice!</p>
<p>They sent along this video demo of it in action:</p>

      <title>Glyphica: Typing Survival brings typing games into the survivor-like era</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Survivor-likes, bullet-heaven horde-games are everywhere after Vampire Survivors showed up and now one developer is attempting to do the same with a typing game in Glyphica: Typing Survival.</p>
<p>Here it's also a bit like a tower defense game with you in the middle and enemies coming at your from all angles. You have to type out their names to fire at them and eventually you'll level up, giving you a random set of upgrades to pick from like new weapons (some which fire automatically). It even has controller support, which is actually quite unique here with you pressing various button combos to fire instead of spelling out names on a keyboard.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10592884911715595222gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10592884911715595222gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even the upgrade system needs you to get typing. Everything does. It's a real workout for your keyboard and your fingers and after playing a good few rounds this morning mine really ache. Smaller enemies are easy to deal with as you fire off small words, but then you start getting bigger and bigger enemies, requiring multiple words to take down their health. What a great idea for a game.</p>

<p>I tested the demo and it works great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/proton-9-0-released-with-expanded-game-support-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the new Proton 9</a>. However, the developer has incorrectly tagged the game for Linux (noting Proton in the system requirements) which results in an empty download. Until they fix that, you need to manually select Proton in the Steam properties for the game. I've let them know. <strong>Update</strong>: that should be fixed now as they got my message.</p>
<p>Currently not really playable on Steam Deck as it has resolution issues, which I've also let them know about. But at least on desktop Linux it's a fun experience and certainly a little different.</p>

      <title>PlayStation Remote Play app for Steam Deck adds easier connections, new resolution options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Version 1.7.0 is out now for chiaki4deck, the open source community-made PlayStation Remote Play app for Steam Deck bringing in some goodies. This follows on from a recent pre-release, now ready for everyone.</p>
<p>This version brings with it the new remote connection via the PlayStation Network, so you can connect to your console without needing to mess around with port forwarding making it much easier to get going when someone is hogging your TV.</p>
<p>Other changes / additions include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allow zooming out from resolution for users targeting a resolution beyond their screen resolution (i.e., 1080p on Steam Deck).</li>
<li>Enable don't fragment for MacOS Big Sur and later for more accurate MTU readings during Senkusha.</li>
<li>Create a fallback session id when session id isn't received instead of erroring out.</li>
<li>Workaround patch for vulkan ffmpeg hw decoder bug affecting Nvidia 30 series graphics card users.</li>
<li>Add additional option for obtaining the PSN AccountId via logging in with your PSN username and password (in addition to the public lookup).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see it continue to improve! Great software and it really works well.</p>

      <title>EA want to put adverts in your video games to squeeze you for every penny</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As if things couldn't get any worse, now EA are looking at ways of putting adverts in video games to squeeze every possible penny from you.</p>
<p>We have mass layoffs with CEOs taking no responsibility, AI being shoved in our faces everywhere possible to eventually replace everyone and now real-world adverts inside our video games too? When will this AAA enshittification of gaming end? Never, obviously. CEOs and their shareholders will never stop chasing every possible extra penny. Growth for growths sake and it simply must continue. Consume consumers!</p>
<p>Writing in their latest <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/894350492/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Q4-FY24-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Earnings Call</a>, Andrew Wilson - Electronic Arts Inc. - Chairman &amp; CEO said:</p>
<p>"To answer your question on advertising broadly, again, I think it's still early on that front. And we have looked over the course of our history to be very thoughtful about advertising in the context of our play experiences. But again, as we think about the many, many billions of hours spent, both playing, creating, watching and connecting and where much of that engagement happens to be on the bounds of a traditional game experience, our expectation is that advertising has an opportunity to be a meaningful driver of growth for us."</p>
<p>Wilson continues:</p>
<p>"We'll be very thoughtful as we move into that, but we have teams internally in the company right now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of our game experiences. But more importantly, as we start to build community and harness the power of community beyond the bounds of our games, how do we think about advertising as a growth driver in those types of experiences?"</p>
<p>This only makes me think of that scene in Ready Player One, where they talk about selling up to 80% of your vision for adverts.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6913786331715590791gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6913786331715590791gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Ready Player One, Warner Bros. Pictures</em></p>
<p>Also mentioned in the report is that Apex Legends continues to do well as it "grew 29 points over the last fiscal year" and as for Battlefield? A new one is on the way that "is going to be another tremendous live service". That's…certainly a way to describe an upcoming game.</p>
<p>For Linux and Steam Deck fans, EA are not exactly doing great. Their continued push for their home-grown <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=EA+anticheat&amp;title_only=on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA anticheat</a> has been causing problems because it's not supported at all. At least for now Apex Legends is safe with EAC which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/apex-legends-upheaval-update-live-with-eos-anti-cheat-breaking-it-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was just updated</a>.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA switching to open kernel modules by default in future driver update for Turing+</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have announced some big changes are coming to their Linux drivers, which will start with the upcoming 560 series.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/unix-graphics-feature-deprecation-schedule/60588" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update </a>on the NVIDIA forum they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting in the release 560 series, it will be recommended to use the <a href="http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/550.78/README/kernel_open.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open flavor of NVIDIA Linux Kernel Modules</a> wherever possible (Turing or later GPUs, or Ada or later when using GPU virtualization).</p>
<p>If installing from the .run file, installation will detect what GPUs are present and default to installing the open kernel modules if all NVIDIA GPUs in the system can be driven by the open kernel modules. Distribution-specific repackaging of the NVIDIA driver may require additional steps, specific to that packaging, to choose the open flavor.</p>
<p>In the release 560 series, it will still be possible to configure the .run file to install the proprietary flavor of kernel modules, with the <code class="inline-code">--kernel-module-type=proprietary</code> command line option. However, in the future, some GPUs may only be supported with the open flavor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We still have the 555 Beta to come this month which will bring Explicit Sync support. So this will be the update after that.</p>
<p>Interesting though to see NVIDIA move more and more towards open source. We've seen recently how the<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/former-nouveau-driver-lead-joins-nvidia-and-sent-a-massive-patch-set/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> former Nouveau driver lead joined NVIDIA</a> and sent a massive patch set, and then we had news that an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/nvidia-developer-contributing-to-the-open-source-nvk-driver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA developer contributed to the open source NVK driver</a> and even on top of that they put up a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nvidia-make-it-easier-to-get-geforce-now-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">script for GeForce NOW on Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>Certainly an interesting time for the green camp.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental brings controller support for more launchers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released an update to Proton Experimental for Linux and Steam Deck today which continues to expand the controller support available for various games launchers, amongst a bunch of other improvements.</p>
<p>Continuing to make use of the open source tool <a href="http://github.com/madewokherd/xalia/tree/main" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xalia</a>, the controller support was expanded to include launchers for Tomb Raider: Legend, Tomb Raider: Anniversary, Fallout 4, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition, and partial support of Fallout 3 (standard and GOTY edition).</p>
<p>Interesting to see Fallout 4 in that list, which had the launcher hidden <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/fallout-4-next-gen-update-out-now-and-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in the next gen update</a> recently on Steam Deck. Although you can get it back with a simple Steam launch option of: <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/48418651715375521gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/48418651715375521gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fallout 4</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Apex Legends not starting after a recent game update (previously in Proton Hotfix).</li>
<li>Fix The Finals wrongly detecting button mashing (previously in Proton Hotfix).</li>
<li>Added raw HID support for VKB Gunfighter SCG.</li>
<li>Improved font rendering in Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop.</li>
<li>Fixed video playback in Twisted Sails.</li>
<li>Made Xalia hidden when no controller is plugged in.</li>
<li>Improved controller input support for Tower Princess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valve also marked Alpha League as now playable as of this update. See all in the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>Bungie&#39;s classic free FPS &#39;Marathon&#39; is now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Before the likes of Halo: Combat Evolved and Destiny, Bungie created the FPS series Marathon which nowadays lives on as an open source project called Aleph One and now it's available on Steam.</p>
<p>Only the first one has been released on Steam so far as Classic Marathon with the other two also planned. Currently, the Steam release of Marathon only has versions for macOS and Windows, but I've confirmed it does seem to run quite nicely with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/proton-9-0-released-with-expanded-game-support-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15080538381715360808gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15080538381715360808gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Classic Marathon on Steam, running on Linux with Proton.</em></p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alien forces have boarded the colony ship UESC Marathon in the Tau Ceti system, in orbit around humanity’s first interstellar colony. The situation is dire, and as a security officer assigned to the Marathon, your duty is to defend the ship and its crew from the alien threat.<br/>
<br/>
This classic 1994 Bungie™ FPS had a foundational influence on the genre, and is now maintained by the fan community. Experience authentic game play using the original data files, with optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60+ fps interpolation, just in case the original is <em>too</em> authentic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the game released originally in 1994 it was only available for the Apple Macintosh, and later Bungie opened up the source code of the Marathon 2 engine in 1999 with the game assets being made freeware in 2005. Which made all this possible. To be clear, the Steam release is not from Bungie, but from the Aleph One team.</p>
<p>A good bit of gaming history there. Nowhere near the level on the likes of DOOM of course but perhaps you'll have some fun with it. The Aleph One game engine does have a good few community-made games that you might want to check out too. Who knows, maybe the Steam release will give it a whole new life.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398450/Classic_Marathon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's free. See the <a href="https://alephone.lhowon.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> for more along with the Linux version available there.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/steamos-3-6-how-the-steam-deck-atomic-updates-are-improving.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Collabora blog post</a> from Ludovico de Nittis gives a refresher on how the update system works, which in simple terms has two partitions one for the live system and one for updates which then replaces the live system. One part of this process uses a tool called <a href="https://github.com/systemd/casync/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">casync</a>, a tool for distributing file system images.</p>
<p>However, they identified a number of points that could be improved for example: how it uses a single thread for calculating the current image seed which "On the Steam Deck this usually means that when you press the "apply update" button, nearly the full first minute is spent to chunk and hash the entire image that is currently in use, with one CPU core at 100% usage." amongst other issues affecting the time it takes to actually do a SteamOS update.</p>
<p>They ended up finding the tool <a href="https://github.com/folbricht/desync" rel="noopener" target="_blank">desync</a> which is pretty much a drop-in replacement, has proper active development on it, along with various other enhancements they wanted like multiple parallel HTTP(S) requests support and multi-threaded chunking. But some work was still needed and they sent multiple patches to the desync project (which have been merged).</p>
<p>By now you're probably wanting to know the benefits which are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is now significantly faster to apply system updates. How much "faster" heavily depends on the size of the update and the Internet connection speed. From our testings, usually the overall update process was consistently at least <strong>30%-50% faster</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the download of an update fails midway, e.g. if there is a connection error, the second download attempt will be able to quickly resume from the point previously reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The download progress percentage is more precise and refreshed more frequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It allows us to quickly check if the current image is pristine or has been altered. Useful for example during the factory reset operation to avoid having to download an image from the Internet unless necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lays out the base to allow in the future the ability for the clients to quickly estimate the download size of system updates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just another reason why I love the Steam Deck and SteamOS, the majority of it is all based on open source and Valve fund contributions to so many projects I've lost count that improve things for <em>everyone</em>.</p>

      <title>Men of War II will be online-only at launch but an offline mode is in development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The release of the strategy game Men of War II is fast approaching from Fulqrum Publishing and Ukrainian studio Best Way, which is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/men-of-war-ii-releases-may-15th-with-linux-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> to have Native Linux support but there's one sore spot.</p>
<p>Detail on one feature had been a little buried in the Steam forum but the developers have now properly announced in a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128860/view/4204749829182005781" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> that it will initially be online-only. Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can confirm that Men of War II will require you to be always online only at launch - an offline mode is in development. The game was developed as always online to allow us to maintain live leaderboards, properly synchronize rewards players receive (including for actions in single-player and co-op content) and prevent cheating at the same time; thanks to this, it is near to impossible to cheat in Men of War II multiplayer. But we have heard your concerns and are working on a solution that will allow you to play the single-player part of Men of War II, as well as mods, without requiring an always-online internet connection; and this will be implemented after release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hope it doesn't take too long for this feature to come along, which ideally should have been in the full release. Forced online requirements even for single-player are a source of constant frustrations, especially if developers decide to fully move on from a game and stop the servers for it - leaving people with broken games.</p>
<p>The game is due to release on May 15th and will cost $44.99 USD / £37.99 GBP / €44.99 EUR.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy it from:</p>

      <title>Rogue Voltage is a refreshing and very creative engineering roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Voltage takes the idea of roguelikes and deck-builders and spins it into something incredible clever with a little engineering involving lots of wires. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Here your deck is a backpack full of modules you build up during a run. You wire up power to modules to do everything from healing to attacking and more. The idea is just so refreshing and clever since there's a lot of room for all kinds of crazy combinations and over-powered chain reactions. It feels almost like a Zachtronics puzzle game turned into a roguelike.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8986039951715348778gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8986039951715348778gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even though it can get just a tad complicated, it's still pretty accessible. I'm not particularly smart with this kind of stuff and yet I've been having a blast. Your backpack isn't exactly large, so there's not an overly <em>ridiculous</em> amount of things going on. Although, that said, there's multiple characters too, and what you do with all these wired up modules often needs to work in tandem across different turns to take down all those nasty creatures. With how many different combos there are, and I'm barely scratching the surface of getting good at it, there's going to be plenty of room for the developer to keep expanding on the idea.</p>
<p>Another clever feature is the timeline. The battles are based on turns <em>but</em> with your modules you can push people around on the timeline. There's just so many little strategies to find and use to your advantage here.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rGQ_FIvrnXo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/15d67782ee14c0ae711dbec13d63f6e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rGQ_FIvrnXo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's some really funny and <em>surprising</em> mechanics going on here.</p>
<p>At one point early on, which really made me appreciate the game and caused my brain to demand I play more, was an enemy throwing a Time Bomb at me. In six steps on the timeline it would <em>explode</em>, dealing damage to <em>both</em> characters. However, I could stick it in one of my backpacks, and wire up some power into it to reduce the damage. However, energy is precious. You have only a small amount (at least to start with). So you really have to think up a good strategy here to balance attacking, defending, building up some extra energy to unleash combos and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3457102811715348289gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3457102811715348289gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Rogue Voltage has a number of curious features like that.</em></p>
<p>In the case above, I was quite lucky. I had an Amplifier module I picked up from a previous encounter so I could double the 1 energy from the Generator, and then feed that into the Time Bomb therefore destroying it in a single step on the timeline. And leave my other character to attack the enemy. Nice.</p>
<p>You know it's <strong>really</strong> frustrating lately. There's too many games like this appearing that are just so damn good. I need a clone to work so I can play them all. Or maybe a time machine, so I can play Rogue Voltage for hours and hours and then go back in time to do some work. This is easily one of the best ideas for a game I've played so far this year.</p>
<p>The developer, Horizont Computergrafik, is a new Berlin-based studio with a background in simulation and visualization software. Rogue Voltage's unique wiring mechanics are inspired by music production with modular synthesizers. With the game currently in Early Access they said it's expected to stay there for around 1 year as they have plans to add in more characters, modules, play-styles and meta-progression.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support that works perfectly on Kubuntu 24.04, and the developer said the build has been optimized for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1494560/Rogue_Voltage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">purchase on Steam</a>. There's also a demo available which I seriously urge you to try.</p>

      <title>Death of a Wish gets Linux support with the Randomizer update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer melessthanthree has today released the Randomizer update for Death of a Wish, which amongst new features brings in Native Linux support.</p>
<p>What it is? Death of a Wish is a vicious action-RPG where style is salvation. Fight your way through a nightmare filled with horrifying monsters and terrifying people. Master brutal attacks and flashy combos as you struggle against the Corruption consuming you with style and grace. The graphical style is certainly unusual. Giving you what looks like a sketch-book in motion there's really nothing else like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tleiqAL6PiI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/415764af57d758ccc338dfcdab4d7fde.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tleiqAL6PiI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2302080/view/4221637059934541727" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam the new update: "The Randomizer Update adds a new mode that allows players to experience the Nightmare like never before! This mode allows players to replay the entire game with randomized enemy and item placements, including randomized starting equipment.</p>
<p>Take on the game in brand new ways by mastering different combat styles and managing unpredictable encounters. No two playthroughs will be the same, so it's almost like trying the game from scratch!"</p>
<p>Nice to see more developers do full Linux support. It has full controller support too and should be a good one on Steam Deck for gaming on the go.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2302080/Death_of_a_Wish/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a rad steampunk autoshooter - dev talks Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a fun looking spin-off from the much loved Airships: Conquer the Skies developed by David Stark.</p>
<p>What is it? A steampunk auto-shooter where you fight your way through waves of enemies on your way to a safe harbour. Destroy your foes, harvest wreckage and upgrade your ship. Taking a few ideas from the popular Vampire Survivor-like genre along with a sprinkle of the wave and upgrade system from Brotato, it weaves it into something unique I think you're going to enjoy. So it's basically SteampunkShip Survivors? Airship Survivors? Something like that anyway.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CeEgsFIE2PI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f36a9185e376bf6f07afed77dcda98c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CeEgsFIE2PI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Menagerie of Monsters</strong> - Engage enemies with different attack patterns and abilities. Fight massive boss monsters that require cunning and firepower to defeat.</p>
<p><strong>An Array of Airships</strong> - Pick the slow but powerful Battleship, the nimble Copter, or the Science Vessel with its railgun and energy shield. Build a strategy around their strengths and weaknesses. Don't feel the need to ever stop? The Megaplane will suit you. Want to build a mighty fleet? Start with the Flagship.</p>
<p><strong>A Panoply of Powerups</strong> - Equip your ship with cannons, rockets, aerial torpedoes, mines, gatling guns, and more. Strengthen it with modules like ammo elevators, guard barracks, command posts. Host strange temples.<br/>
<br/>
Improve your ship with training for your crew, more armor plating, or senior officers. Pick a doctrine to gain its advantages: terrify your enemies, dodge incoming attacks, make your money through trade. Find powerful combinations that lay waste to your enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Charismatic Captains</strong> - Unlock captains for your ship that give you powerful advantages and disadvantages and change the rules of your game.</p>
<p><strong>Strange Stelae</strong> - -Temples and monoliths as well as more familiar ports float in the skies, changing the game rules in parts of the map. Disadvantage your enemies and boost your abilities with careful positioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the demo out now I've had a chance to have a little blast with it and it's a <strong>lot</strong> of fun. Enemies are varied with some fun behaviours, there's elements of the map that can help or hurt you, the enemies weapons are a good mixture and there's just so many little mechanics that add up to a surprising experience here. The shop UI needs a bit of work to be simpler to understand but other than that, not many issues with the game from the demo.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5834710921715266484gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5834710921715266484gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9788939191715266486gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9788939191715266486gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click pictures to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>One really interesting mechanic is fire. You're in a flying ship, and various enemy bullets will set you on fire. It takes time to get it put out, and will repeatedly bring down your health but there's numerous upgrades to speed that up, or reduce fire damage as a whole. Another fun one is the weapon upgrade system which is multi-tier. For example you could upgrade a Cannon with heated shots to set enemies alight, or armour piercing to deal with bigger nuisances. You can even get little ships to fly around with and upgrade those as well.</p>
<p>If you enjoy the crazy over-powered builds you can make in all the survivor-likes, you should feel right at home here. The demo is obviously very limited but a great example of what's to come. I have a feeling I'm going to be spending most of this evening playing more of the Airships: Lost Flotilla demo. I'm itching for more right now. This is my new favourite thing.</p>
<p>I had a little chance to catch up with Stark about the continued Linux support. Here's what they had to say:</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about continued Linux support?</strong></p>
<p>DS: "Very strongly! With the continued enshittification of computers in general and operating systems in particular, it's very important to me that the software I make is on an open source platform. We've seen again and again that companies will simply decide to shut down and remove support for things that no longer directly profit them, and so I want to have my games on Linux, so I know that people can keep playing them."<br/>
<br/>
<strong>How difficult is it for you to support Linux directly like this?</strong></p>
<p>DS: "Very easy because I use Linux as my development OS. For Lost Flotilla I'm using Monogame, which is based on XNA, which Microsoft abandoned (see "shut down and remove support" above) but now has a very nice open-source cross-platform implementation. So I just develop on Linux and then compile for Windows and Linux, and briefly switch over to Windows on occasion to make sure the game works properly. I also think this is a lot more future-proof than Unity, which seems to be doing its best to alienate developers, and never got around to making a usable Linux version.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, Linux gamers, even if there aren't that many of them, are really an asset to a developer because they tend to be very good about giving feedback and reporting bugs."<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What are your thoughts on Proton and the Steam Deck?</strong></p>
<p>DS: "I actually got a Steam Deck while developing Lost Flotilla, because I wanted the game to run on it. With the previous game, Airships: Conquer the Skies, I gave no thought to controller support, and so now while it technically runs on the Deck, the experience is pretty terrible. With Lost Flotilla, mouse, keyboard and controller are all first-tier ways of playing the game.<br/>
<br/>
For playing games, I've found the Deck works well for a limited type of games. There's a lot of games that are "verified to work" on the Deck but are painfully hard to actually play, and some other ones that supposedly "partially supported" that work perfectly fine. If you've got 20/20 vision, anyway. So for me it sits in a bit of an awkward spot: most of the games that are fun to play on the Deck, I can also play on my phone, and for most big complicated strategy games the screen is just too small and the controls just aren't precise enough.<br/>
<br/>
As for Proton, I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, it worries me that it's basically giving up on native Linux games. On the other hand, it will arguably hollow out Windows, turning it from an operating system to a platform specification to make games for, which can then be played from the OS of your choice. Which sounds nice."</p>

      <title>Sink your teeth into capitalism after a 500-year slumber in Brocula out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What if you took a bit of Stardew Valley but you're a Vampire rudely awoken from a deep 500 year nap and now you have to deal with capitalism? That's your problem in Brocula. Out now with Native Linux support, it looks like a game you'll want to sink your teeth in deep.</p>
<p>So not only do you have to deal with part-time jobs for money, you also need to repair and build up your ancestral castle that's been left to ruins. You get a farming loop as you tend to crops and a little fishing, then you also need to manage your own little cult too (you are a Vampire after all). </p>
<p>Get an extended look at some gameplay below:</p>

      <title>GUNDAM BREAKER 4 releases August 29th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a huge fan of all things Gundam (I've seen every series and movie there is), I am ridiculously looking forward to GUNDAM BREAKER 4 and now it has an actual release date.</p>
<p>Planned to arrive on August 29th it's an ongoing series of games where you make your own Gunpla (Gundam plastic model), by freely combining parts together and then control it battle. It looks like a lot of fun for people who like Gundam and action games. Here you even get to smash apart enemy mechs, to add parts to your collection, sounds like a fun loot system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kiEwPKg9Aco"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0103cf98f7bfaa7aa49c30945312911b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kiEwPKg9Aco" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With over 250 base kits and the ability to combine whatever you want together, along with paint, weathering, decals and more it seems like you can make some really unique Gunpla in it.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will work well in Proton on desktop Linux and Steam Deck but we will know more closer to release. It would be great if it saw testing and verification before release, which we've seen Valve do a fair bit more recently.</p>

      <title>Contra crossover Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After recently releasing an update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/vampire-survivors-gets-a-aaaa-update-with-functional-doors-a-train-and-rail-kart-racing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adding in trains and working doors</a>, Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns is officially out now with plenty of extra content to play through.</p>
<p>Made in collaboration with the KONAMI's Contra team, you'll finally get some proper guns. And you know what, it fits perfectly within the game. There's a new large stage and a bonus stage, 11 new characters, 22 new weapons between base and evolutions, 6 new music tracks, 13 music tracks directly from the Contra series (6 brand new covers) and a new 6 chapter Adventure too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D1XEXZevEbI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/22248f4fbf1c1c27b24e060f4485de23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D1XEXZevEbI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Vampire Survivors is Steam Deck Verified and also has a (unadvertised) Native Linux version.</p>
<p>This DLC was an easy purchase for me, lots of hours of fun in Vampire Survivors and with all these new characters to go through I'm going to sink a whole lot more into it right now. The base game and DLC are still ridiculously cheap too, which caused the developer to answer why it's cheap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As usual we've been receiving kind comments about pricing and giving us more money, some intended just as a compliment, some actually serious. Collab DLCs have a much higher production cost for us, but that doesn't mean their price should skyrocket.</p>
<p>You've already given us the luxury to keep working on Vampire Survivors even just for fun (hence the constant free updates), it just seems fair to try keep the cost of major expansions as contained as possible and border-line risky. We'd need something very big to justify a higher price point.</p>
<p>And then if we accidentally inflate our own production costs because we decide to add 12 characters for fun instead of the usual 8... well that's our problem innit.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Zelda-inspired dungeon maker &#39;Quest Master&#39; arrives May 29th with a new demo live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pulling in elements of both classic Zelda and Super Mario Maker, Quest Master has a really entertaining idea that sees you design dungeons and go on adventures. The developer has now announced they plan to release it into Early Access on May 29th, and there's a big demo refresh now available to try out. It also has Native Linux support. </p>
<p>You get to dream up multi-tiered dungeons full of levers, timed switches, moving platforms, then add infinite verticality with stairwells and abyssal holes and so much more. Oh, there's monsters too, because what's a dungeon crawler without something to bash with a sword or a bow.</p>
<p>In the new demo, utilize updated building tools to fabricate perilous journeys and perplexing puzzle-filled dungeons across multiple themes, including ornate temples, volcanic caverns, and labyrinthine lairs. Train for combat in the dojo, and test one’s luck in mini-games for prizes like Lucky’s Locks where heroes hunt for a loot-filled chest hidden amongst empty containers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YDu-7EFRrb0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d531d4224473de21aae14f8476b0a8e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YDu-7EFRrb0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Our community has been very supportive and vocal, and we’re happy to implement some of their requests in both the Early Access launch and the new demo,” said Julian Creutz, Lead Developer of Quest Master. ”The user-created dungeons we’ve seen from demo players have been mind-blowing, and we can’t wait to provide even more creative tools to quest masters around the world.”</p>
<p>You can wishlist / follow and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094070/Quest_Master/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">try the demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Get ready to kick-up some dust in #DRIVE Rally</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>#DRIVE Rally from Polish developer Pixel Perfect Dude now has a release window for sometime this Autumn and it looks like a lot of fan for rally fans. This is the same developer that made the endless driving game #DRIVE which is available on Switch and mobile and #DRIVE Rally is the spiritual successor.</p>
<p>"#DRIVE Rally isn't just a trip down memory lane; it's an arcade-inspired rally-driving experience set in the golden racing era of the ‘90s. From the lush, evergreen forests of Holzberg in Germany, to the twisty, arid roads of the American southwest, #DRIVE Rally offers a variety of iconic tracks and legendary rally cars that players can tune and customize. Whether you’re a newcomer or a seasoned pro, the game ensures that every race is challenging and rewarding. Plus, co-drivers aren’t just there for the ride—they bring personality to the journey with their unique brand of humour and insightful driving directions!"</p>
<p>Check out the teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HqYmuCbXcbk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fb3167dea81e4efea242253dc8000e57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HqYmuCbXcbk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>#DRIVE All Over the World</strong>: From the sunny landscapes of Dry Crumbs, through the whispering woods of Holzberg, to the chilly wilderness of Revontuli, each track offers unique features and asks drivers to go the distance.</li>
<li><strong>Legendary Cars</strong>: Jump behind the wheel of legendary rally cars, including Das Holzwagen, The Doggo, The Bobond, and many more from the studio’s previous title #DRIVE. New from the ‘90s era are Das Sandsturm and Celestia, just for a start!</li>
<li><strong>Passionate Co-Drivers</strong>:  For better or worse, your co-driver is with you to the end! There to help and lend some humourous jabs, they’re your trusty navigator —and your worst critic.</li>
<li><strong>#DRIVE Design</strong>: It’s your way <em>and</em> the highway, baby! From tires to tailpipe, build your car to your liking. Add your special touches with paintwork, decals, and decorations. Take a picture in Photo Mode - it’ll last longer.</li>
<li><strong>#DRIVE Like it’s 1999</strong>: pumped up with 90’s Easter Eggs and references in an adoring homage to the thunderous days of rally racing circa 1990s, this game feels like a finely-tuned arcade experience, with no coins needed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For those of you specifically on Steam Deck, the developer mentioned it should run "just fine with 60fps on ultra settings" on the Native Linux build.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2494780/DRIVE_Rally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>. There's currently a demo available.</p>

      <title>With a Nintendo Switch 2 on the way, I hope Valve make a Steam Deck 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love my Steam Deck, as any regular reader will know. It's my favourite gaming device but it could always be better right? And with competition hot (hi Nintendo), I hope Valve have more plans.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not dumb enough to think that the Steam Deck is in actual competition with the Nintendo Switch. That's just not a reality. The Switch has sold over 140 million units and continues to sell millions, it's in stores everywhere, people buy it for their children, for themselves and yeah — you get the idea. But still, for us PC fans the Steam Deck (and specifically us Linux lot) and other PC handhelds are simply <em>awesome</em>.</p>
<p>We all knew a Nintendo Switch 2 would happen, there just hadn't been any real proper confirmation, until now. Writing on social media, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on May 7th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Furukawa, President of Nintendo. We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year. It will have been over nine years since we announced the existence of Nintendo Switch back in March 2015. We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So sometime before the end of March 2025, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed.</em></p>
<p>That leads me to think about the future. The Switch 2 will no doubt sell by the truck-loads once again. So let's just set that aside because it's a different market overall. Still, we have other handheld PC gaming vendors appearing often like the ROG Ally, Legion GO, MSI Claw, various devices from OneXPlayer, GPD, Ayaneo and more on the way so there's really a <em>lot</em> of these devices now.</p>
<p>To me, handheld gaming like this is the future. You may think I am heavily biased, and in many ways I am (obviously, I run this website) but I'm a tech-fan. I have a PlayStation, a Switch, an Xbox and more. But it feels increasingly weird to have a dedicated solid box permanently attached to a single TV. I actually don't like that at all now. Being able to take a much smaller device with you to play anywhere, <em>and</em> additionally have the ability to hook it up to a TV whenever you want just feels so much <em>better</em>. Nintendo definitely had the right idea, as did Valve.</p>
<p>We've seen in the past that Valve have said pretty clearly they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had plans to keep going</a>, and with the Steam Deck still <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-had-a-strong-end-to-2023-and-a-great-start-for-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">continuing to sell constantly</a>, it would be crazy if Valve didn't produce a Steam Deck 2. Even though you could argue the Steam Deck OLED is such a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ridiculous</a> improvement it might as well be a Steam Deck 2, I want more. A lot more.</p>
<p>The current shell design is just <em>fine</em>, I don't think Valve really need to do many changes there at all. The OLED design gave us enough improvements inside to various parts so thinking on what they <em>should</em> add in for the big number 2: a newer generation AMD APU to bring performance up, with a slightly higher resolution screen and I honestly think I would be ridiculously happy. It doesn't take much. Performance being the biggest one and with more new AMD chips on the way, give it <em>another</em> year for the generation after that (or their refresh) and we could be looking at a really fun performance boost.</p>
<p>So, let's say a Steam Deck 2 announcement in late 2026. Make it so, Valve.</p>
<p>What do you think? And what do you <em>now</em> want from a Steam Deck 2?</p>

      <title>Story-driven RPG &#39;The Thaumaturge&#39; is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Thaumaturge released back in March from Fool's Theory and 11 bit studios, it looks pretty great and now it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Originally at release Valve tagged it as having small text and the performance wasn't good enough. Seems enough has changed now though since it has the green Steam Deck Verified tick with Proton 9. So with Valve's upgrades to Proton along with multiple updates to the game since release to focus on the UI, bugs and performance, it should now work quite well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10982093581715173542gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10982093581715173542gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5458572011715173541gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5458572011715173541gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Thaumaturge is an isometric, story-rich RPG with a unique take on turn-based combat, character development features, and investigation mechanics, facing you with morally ambiguous choices – set in a world teeming with mysterious powers and strange ethereal beings called salutors.</p>
<p>The year is 1905. Warsaw lives under the yoke of imperial Russian tsardom. Its inhabitants constitute a diverse group of different ancestries, views, and beliefs with often conflicting interests: Russian soldiers, Jewish merchants, Polish townspeople, and more. Despite the circumstances, the city is a buzzing metropolis, where one can attend a breathtaking party with the high society, and later get robbed in one of the dark alleys of the Praga district. A city of great hopes and dreams on one hand and dark desires on the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see an increasing amount of games get nicely supported on Steam Deck, and so making them work well on Desktop Linux too thanks to Proton.</p>

      <title>Vampire survival game V Rising 1.0 live with gamepad support (good for Steam Deck)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>V Rising took Steam by storm back when it hit Early Access in 2022, and now Stunlock Studios have released the big 1.0 with lots of upgrades and it should work better than ever for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>It already ran quite well on desktop Linux and Steam Deck but a sore spot was the controls system. It was very much designed for a keyboard and mouse. Due to this and some small text, Valve gave it a Steam Deck Playable rating.</p>
<p>That changes with the 1.0 release which adds in full gamepad support, along with a "reimagined HUD user interface crafted specifically for gamepad enthusiasts, ensuring a seamless and immersive gameplay journey". That sounds fantastic, so I might finally be able to properly play it, as I much prefer gamepads on desktop too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aB_2ZRn9F_k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c359e3e2e4c92f5b77d06fa17b3dc19.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aB_2ZRn9F_k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There is of course a lot more new in the update including new music, an achievement system, new locations to explore, more NPCs to find roaming the world, visual upgrades, new enemies to encounter (like Dracula) and one of the legendary Belmont family from Castlevania will appear too. There's also an improved magic system, new weapons, you can turn into a spider (yes really), new armour and so <a href="https://playvrising.com/launch-update" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much more</a>.</p>
<p>“After 5 years of dedication and relentless effort, we've realized the vision we set out for V Rising many years ago. I couldn't be prouder of our team for crafting a game that exemplifies what we're renowned for: unique genre hybrids focusing on gameplay first. With V Rising, we've elevated our craft to new heights. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to every player who supported us during Early Access, empowering us to shape the game into what it is today. And to our new players, welcome to the finest iteration of V Rising Vampires!”</p>

      <title>Awesome GZDoom shooter Selaco will delist the demo (but you can still get it)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco is easily the game I am most excited about this year, a GZDoom powered shooter that had a brilliant demo but Altered Orbit Studios are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4173224631786978598" rel="noopener" target="_blank">about to</a> delist the demo.</p>
<p>Why? As fantastic as the demo is, it's heavily outdated and saves won't be compatible. So to prevent people having to re-play a section and to not give the wrong impression, the demo is being removed from Steam soon. They could update the demo but that would take a fair amount of time away from just developing the game.</p>
<p>The good news is that as fans of game preservation, the demo is officially being uploaded to <a href="https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Altered+Orbit+Studios%22" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Archive.org</a> where it will live on for a long time. Really interesting to see a developer do this, quite a nice way to preserve it in the old state. Currently the Windows demo is up but they <a href="https://twitter.com/SelacoGame/status/1787917233194197270" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the Linux version will be up there too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nUbF8Ytadx0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f9d495c1130ff6c161a0637adada5e7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nUbF8Ytadx0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Selaco is set to hit Early Access on May 31st.</p>
<p>Follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Forming part of what they're calling Stellaris Season 08, both The Machine Age DLC and the free Andromeda update are out now.</p>
<p>The free update brings in the usual bug fixes but it also rebalances the Genetic, Cybernetic, and Synthetic tradition trees (for owners of Utopia and Synthetic Dawn), enhances various AI functions related to leader assignment and economic management, reworks Fallen Empire buildings and enables modders to introduce new Crisis paths, among other improvements.</p>
<p>DLC launch trailer:</p>

<p>The Machine Age DLC brings in:</p>

<li><strong>NEW ENDGAME CRISIS</strong> - A tempest rages in space, a Fallen Empire goes dark, and a long-forgotten enemy emerges to shake the foundations of power.<br/>
Cetana, the Synthetic Queen, promises to deliver the galaxy from suffering. Her reach is immense, and her true aims opaque. Will you collaborate, or seek to derail her plans? Prepare for a Crisis unlike any other, and a battle beyond imagination…</li>
<li><strong>NEW PLAYER CRISIS PATH</strong> - We are all bound by limits – constraints of the body, of time, and the physical rules of an uncaring universe. Who among us has not dreamed of casting off these chains? Of breaking through to a new, better reality?<br/>
To accomplish such a task, technology on a scale never before seen must be developed. Calculations will be needed far beyond the scope of any computer.

<li><strong>Cybernetic Creed</strong> - Your empire pursues a divine calling: the holy fusion of the body and cybernetics. Augmentation is worship.</li>
<li><strong>Synthetic Fertility </strong>- Once a thriving society, a novel genetic disease leaves your empire unable to reproduce biologically. Digital salvation seems the only option to avoid extinction.</li>
<li><strong>Arc Welders </strong>- Hailing from a world starved for space, a robotic society turns to the stars for resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On top of that, 6 new Civics, 2 shipsets (Cybernetic and Machine), 2 new superstructures (the molten Arc Furnace and powerful Dyson Swarm), new Pop Traits, and 7 brand new music tracks for the best in synthetic beats!</li>
</ul>

<p>At least on Steam the expansion has been received really well. It has a Very Positive rating which is good to see for one of my favourite strategy games. You can buy the DLC by itself, or pick up the Season 08 pass which will give you the next two planned packs as well.</p>
<p>Stellaris has Native Linux support and you can buy Stellaris from:</p>

      <title>SteamVR 2.5 released with multiple Linux fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a couple of Beta releases, Valve has now launched the latest stable release of SteamVR which brings in the recent Linux improvements.</p>
<p>I've covered the Beta changes across a couple of articles so it's nice to see them rolled out for everyone now. This release focuses on bug fixes, quality of life improvements across SteamVR as a whole, Steam Link and Linux. Valve also released an updated version of Steam Link for Meta Quest devices. Hopefully at some point soon we might see Linux support for that too.</p>
<p>All the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/4186735430669975751" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> are:</p>
<blockquote>

<li>Fixed a bug where compatibility mode would fail for certain controller / HMD combinations and legacy input titles.</li>
<li>This release has an experimental feature allowing overlays to use controller simulation in bindings.</li>
<li>Disabled AMD Wireless VR driver by default. You can reenable it under startup/shutdown manage addons. This is a wireless driver installed by the AMD GPU driver that can interfere with some new, asynchronous paths in SteamVR.</li>
<li>Detect when AMD drivers were installed, but no AMD card is present, preventing "Error 309" and other crashes when loading LiquidVR.</li>
<li>Fixed some localization issues in the binding UI.</li>
<li>Fixing missing haptic component in some vive tracker profiles.</li>
<li>Fixing some scenarios where the menu button didn't work on HTC wrist trackers.</li>
<li>Add ability for Vive tracker haptic pogo pins to be bound.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Link:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">Steam VR 2.5 release corresponds to Steam Link client version 2.0.8.748</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved prediction for increased lateral tracking stability.</li>
<li>Fix initialization issue causing connection failure. Requires client and server to both be updated.</li>
<li>Fix issue causing persistent failure when headset goes into standby and returns.</li>
<li>Fix deadlock on host when USB devices are inserted or removed.</li>
<li>Resolved two client crashes.</li>
<li>Fix an issue with video encoder initialization on certain AMD integrated GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>OpenXR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix Vive tracker menu pogo pin not being mapped correctly for OpenXR apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Add support for direct mode drivers (IVRDriverDirectModeComponent) on Linux.</li>
<li>Improved launch scripts and log capture for bug reports.</li>
<li>Fixed random colors appearing at the periphery of the right eye's viewable area.</li>
<li>Fixed SteamVR Home launch script.</li>
<li>Fixed an SDL compatibility problem on Fedora.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll have to jump back into some VR soon on my Index and see how it runs on Kubuntu 24.04 now.</p>

      <title>Apex Legends Upheaval update live with EOS Anti-Cheat breaking it on Steam Deck / Linux (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update - 08/05/24, 08:18 AM</strong>: Valve released an update to Proton Hotfix that solves the issue. With a <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/5595?commit_id=34b0eb5ce584c8d8c05b233803e433be19dbe4a8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch</a> sent into Wine to solve it upstream too. Proton Hotfix is set as the default for Apex Legends on Steam.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Respawn and EA have today released a major update for the popular battle royale shooter Apex Legends, which gives it an anti-cheat upgrade. Sadly it's causing issues for Steam Deck / Linux players.</p>
<p>Previously Apex Legends was using the older standalone Easy Anti-Cheat, but they've now upgraded to the EOS (Epic Online Services) version of it. Everyone seems to be having the same issue on Linux / Steam Deck now with any Proton version, the game will just not run. You get to the splash-screen that has the EAC logo, it waits a bit and then will just stop. Seems likely it's getting stuck on the new anti-cheat integration.</p>
<p>Both versions of EAC <em>do</em> work on Linux either via Proton or Native Linux builds, so hopefully Valve will be able to figure out what's blocking it this time and update Proton again for it. It's likely we'll see a Proton Hotfix update hopefully in the next day or so for it since it's a major Steam Deck Verified title. Heck, it could even be that Respawn / EA didn't go into the EOS control panel and actually tick the box for Linux.</p>
<p>As one of the biggest games on Steam, it's a shame Respawn and EA don't give Valve a little time to get ready for their major updates like this.</p>
<p>The bug report on the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/4350" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton GitHub</a> has people talking about it and reporting it.</p>
<p><em>Will update you when I know more.</em></p>
<p>Apex Legends is free to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam / Steam Deck stable client update released fixing lots of bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest stable update to the Steam Client today for PC and Steam Deck, which fixes a whole lot of issues. This bundles up all the changes from many multiple Beta releases and there's a lot to go over. </p>
<p>One of the interesting tweaks is that Valve adjusted the CSS to "reduce feature leaks", I guess they're growing a little tired of certain people scraping it constantly to see what they're working on. I wonder if they have something specific coming up they don't want spoilt? What do you think?</p>
<p>The changelog is the same across desktop and Steam Deck, since this is a Steam Client update. The full list of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4182231197207095612" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam client menus opening in separate windows from main window after sleep/account change.</li>
<li>Fixed crash when playing back certain media in Steam music player.</li>
<li>Fixed issue loading and saving the app achievement cache file which in some cases caused excessive memory usage in steamwebhelper.</li>
<li>Fixed notifications not being displayed on Windows when the desktop is focused.</li>
<li>Fixed notifications intermittently being queued until a game is launched.</li>
<li>Reduced network traffic at startup and reconnect.</li>
<li>Fixed regression causing Steam News button to not work.</li>
<li>Fixed secondary context menu opening when right-clicking open context menu.</li>
<li>Fix an error when launching some games that was introduced in the previous beta.</li>
<li>If a game failed to update, show why on the details page as well as the downloads page.</li>
<li>Fixed embedded browser views showing with high contrast settings when enabled on Windows.</li>
<li>Made taking screenshots more responsive.</li>
<li>Increased brightness of HDR screenshots.</li>
<li>Modified CSS classnames to reduce package size and reduce feature leaks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where after playing a game it would require extra B button presses to back out of the game's library page.</li>
<li>Fixed support alert messages intermittently producing an error at startup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Cloud</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed case where files for one Steam account could be overwritten by files from another Steam account if the first account had logged in but not played the game yet on the device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Configurator feature "Swap Left with Right": While editing a Controller Configuration, you can Swap the behavior of the Left Stick and the Right Stick, or Left Trackpad and Right Trackpad etc. Highlight the source you want to swap in the "Edit Layout" page, and the "Y" button should appear to allow the swap. This should be handy for "South Paws".</li>
<li>New Mouse Action: "Reset to Horizon". This helper can reset your camera to the horizon by sending 180 degrees down, and then 90 degrees up after a very short delay. This action can be bound to any activator slot.</li>
<li>New Mouse Action: "Turn Camera 360". By default this will generate 360 degrees of rotation.</li>
<li>New Mouse Action: "Turn to Face Direction". When activating this, the camera will turn to face the direction you are pushing on the Left Stick (default - Track pads, DPads and Buttons can also be used). Can be combined with "Reset to Horizon" to produce a behavior similar to Splatoon's camera reset button.</li>
<li>Note: The New Mouse actions all require Dots per 360 to calibrated for any of them to be accurate. To do this, use "Turn Camera 360" in combination with either "FlickStick" or "Gyro to Mouse", and make sure that one press of your "Turn Camera 360" makes one 360 turn in game. If it does not, tune the Dots per 360 setting from the Controller Quick Settings menu. You do not have to use Gyro to Mouse or FlickStick after this step.</li>
<li>FlickStick mode's templates will now default to binding to the correct "Stick Click", but only in Mouse only or Mixed config templates.</li>
<li>Added "Invert Command Binding" for FlickStick's Outer Ring Command.</li>
<li>Added an option to allow the FlickStick to trigger a Flick Turn if the stick is thrown when the action set/action layer/mode shift is activate.</li>
<li>Fixed SteamDeck Configurator Templates' FlickStick default bindings.</li>
<li>Gyro Button Picker: you can now choose from any combination of pre-existing gyro enabling buttons. This replaces the "Gyro Activation" Dropdown.</li>
<li>Config Defaults: Mouse templates, and "Mixed" Mouse and Gamepad Templates now use "Gyro to Mouse" instead of "As Mouse".</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick modes now no longer generate haptic events when outside the active range.</li>
<li>(On those controllers with haptics support) a haptic bump will occur when gyroscope is turned on and off due to the Gyro Enable/Disable/Toggle Button, if haptics are not set to "Off". Choose to disable/enable this from the Gyro Button Picker.</li>
<li>Added Dualsense and Dualshock Gyro Enable/Disable/Toggle "center touch" and "center click" for completeness/to help with certain Paddle Mods..</li>
<li>Fixed inverted axes when using "Setup Device Inputs".</li>
<li>Fixed swapped A/B buttons when using Nintendo GameCube controllers.</li>
<li>UI: Joystick Mouse Deadzone controls now use the common Deadzone Editor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Greatly improved streaming performance on newer AMD cards.</li>
<li>Increased brightness of HDR streaming.</li>
<li>Added support for full HDR to HDR streaming when streaming from a Windows PC using NVIDIA or AMD hardware acceleration to another Windows PC or Mac with an HDR display. The computer receiving the stream must have Enhanced 1080p or 4K enabled in the Steam Remote Play advanced client settings.</li>
<li>Fixed the streaming button staying stuck on "Stop" when the streaming client exits quickly.</li>
<li>Fixed installation of Steam streaming audio drivers on macOS 14.3+.</li>
<li>Fixed missing audio when streaming from macOS.</li>
<li>Fixed occasional black screen flickering when streaming from macOS.</li>
<li>Improved recovery from network disconnections before starting the stream.</li>
<li>Fixed continually being prompted for the PIN when pairing a device.</li>
<li>Fixed the performance graph being reset to icons when changing to Enhanced 1080p or Enhanced 4K.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some causes of steamwebhelper crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed slow startup on busy systems.</li>
<li>Fixed startup delays when running in flatpak environments.</li>
<li>Changed the default scale from 200% to 150% on a 4K monitor.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the store tab would fail to display any content after maximizing the steam window.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the window may become unresponsive until resized.</li>
<li>No longer listing incompatible options under an application's Compatibility settings.</li>
<li>Fixed a situation where Steam would attempt to execute the Windows version of a title without using Steam Play.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Planetiles is a beautiful blend of Tetris and Dorfromantik</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Planetiles is an absolute puzzle gem from developer MythicOwl (Hexologic, Harmony's Odyssey) that gives you a wonderful blending of gameplay ideas from Tetris and Dorfromantik but on a mini-planetary scale. <em>Note: key provided by Big Games Machine.</em></p>
<p>Released on April 3rd, it has Native Linux support and works great on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Here you go through various planets that form the levels, building them up using tiles. These tiles can be a mixture of forests, mountains, fields, sand and more. You only have a limited space to place down these tiles and they come in different shapes. It's your job to fit as many together as you can, to build up a higher score. It's a really relaxing game but challenging at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6355666121715095529gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6355666121715095529gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's a mission-based mode where you have to hit certain conditions like total score, amount of free spaces left or a mixture of them. There's also a sandbox mode where you can just keep going doing what you want to build up a score and even a special endless planet to go on forever. </p>
<p>Even when you think you're doing well, the game has a fun little events system that sprinkles in some nuisances to keep you on your toes. You might end up with erupting volcanoes, devastating cataclysms, or swirling space storms for an additional layer of challenge to city planning. Thankfully, there's various technologies you can unlock in the form of perks to deal with these and other challenges you come up against.</p>

<p>As relaxing as it is in the gameplay, it can be a little frustrating too when you're just not getting things place how you want them. True to the Tetris styling, some moves can really mess you up. Be sure to leave the right sized gaps, and build somewhere else on the planet before leaving a gap that's too small to fill in.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Lose yourself in the peaceful atmosphere of planet-building in deep space.</li>
<li>Plan carefully and strategically place tiles to maximize bonuses and hit high scores.</li>
<li>Create vibrant biomes of lush forests and looming mountain ranges; all presented through a colourful visual style!</li>
<li>Overcome natural disasters and withstand the forces of nature (and space).</li>
<li>Roguelite progression ensures there’s always a planet ready to be revamped.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's going to get bigger too, as they just recently announced an exciting sounding roadmap to expand the game that includes a whole new game mode, 2 new missions and plenty more to come. It's already a great game and it seems it's only going to get better.</p>
<p>Planetiles is absolutely lovely and well worth a purchase.</p>

      <title>Nerobi is a new gorgeous looking platforming adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hitting Early Access today is Nerobi, a gorgeous looking platforming adventure that blends in what the developer says are "several elements typical of a graphic adventure". It has a Native Linux version available. Definitely looks like something perhaps a bit special, with a really interesting art style that looks like it has pretty good production value here to stand out amongst the crowd.</p>
<p>"In a universe regulated by a balance between Life and Oblivion, embodied by the spirit Ikimaki and the demon Bokyaku, Nerobi no longer has memory and self-awareness. He finds himself in the Middle World, the place where the Essences must pass before reincarnating.</p>
<p>However, the Middle World is invaded by Demons, who have possessed the Eight Guardians. So, as he discovers his past and his identity, Nerobi will be called to exercise his hidden powers."</p>

<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Totally hand-drawn visual experience.</li>
<li>Immersive and exciting story.</li>
<li>Challenging gameplay along the lines of old arcade games.</li>
<li>Puzzles.</li>
<li>Powers to unlock that expand the gameplay experience.</li>
<li>Engaging soundtrack.</li>
<li>Hidden collectable cards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you like a challenge wrapped up in gorgeous styling, this might be one for you! The developer was keen to point out it's a tough game, so bring your best controller for this one and get your hands warmed up. Feels like this one just came out of nowhere! </p>
<p>The developer even mentioned in in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2534250/discussions/0/4360124186536831426/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> post on Steam: "Does it run on Steam Deck? Yes, we optimized Nerobi to run 60 fps on it.". Wonderful to see that too! Hopefully it will see a Steam Deck Verified tick at some point then.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2534250/Nerobi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It's 30% off until May 14th.</p>

      <title>Microsoft closes Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin and others</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this sure is a terrible time for the gaming industry isn't it. Now it's Microsoft turn again to close multiple studios. As first posted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IGN</a> who managed to get a copy of an internal email sent by Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, the studios themselves have now confirmed it's all true across various posts on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>The studios that have been announced that will be closing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tango Gameworks who made The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, Hero Dice and Hi-Fi Rush.</li>
<li>Alpha Dog Studios who made multiple mobiles games like Mighty DOOM (which will shut) and Wraithborne.</li>
<li>Roundhouse Games (reformed from Human Head Studios) but they will be joining up with ZeniMax Online Studios.</li>
<li>Arkane Austin who made Redfall but "some" of their team will be placed elsewhere in Bethesda. As a result, Redfall will get no more updates now. However, Arkane Lyon are still going and working on games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a shame to see more studios get the chop, especially odd is Tango Gameworks because Hi-Fi Rush was quite a hit overall even though it was completely surprise released. And since <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according</a> to Microsoft it "was a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations".</p>
<p>Statements on X from: <a href="https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tango Gameworks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkaneStudios/status/1787837804287860886" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arkane Studios</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/AlphaDogGames/status/1787837921900245221" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alpha Dog Games</a>.</p>
<p>Remind me again why game industry consolidation is a good thing? Because it never seems like it is. These massive companies buy up various other publishers and developers, force them into box-ticking exercises for every penny they can get and then shut them all down. I'm tired of seeing it.</p>
<p>This news comes only days after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/gta-6-publisher-take-two-reportedly-shutting-roll7-and-intercept-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GTA 6 publisher Take-Two shuts Roll7 and Intercept Games</a>.</p>

      <title>Ant colony RTS &#39;Empires of the Undergrowth&#39; hits 1.0 in June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I haven't played this for a while, but I remember it making my skin crawl. Damn bugs everywhere. Empires of the Undergrowth is a pretty great RTS that puts you in charge of an Ant colony. They've just announced the the big 1.0 release is finally coming as it's going to leave Early Access on June 7th.</p>
<p>Here you build intricate nests, develop pheromone-based tactics, and evolve the brood to combat escalating threats across multiple game modes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D_cbpZaZZ70"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/427e45f3f3814cc39f4ee7f09aefd9c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D_cbpZaZZ70" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The big 1.0 update will include a range of new features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new savannah environment with its own creatures and hazards.</li>
<li>New ant species you can play in the campaign or custom games.</li>
<li>The final arc of the single-player campaign, featuring three new documentary missions with full voice acting and new artwork, as well as a final climactic challenge.</li>
<li>New Game Plus mode so the campaign can be played again with further upgrades and increased difficulty.</li>
<li>And many more quality-of-life tweaks and improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>This one actually does have a Native Linux version, although the version on Steam hasn't been updated for a while, as the developer prefers people to use Proton as they previously said due to engine issues it worked a lot better in Proton. The Native Linux version is available on GOG and appears to be up to date. </p>

      <title>Pull off some slick moves in Lunar Lander Beyond on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in late April, Lunar Lander Beyond was released by Dreams Uncorporated and Atari, as another classic remake built for new audiences. <em>Note: key provided by ÜberStrategist.</em></p>
<p>"As a newly appointed captain of the Pegasus corporation, you must guide a roster of colorful pilots, eclectic advisors and state-of-the-art landers through a taxing series of missions. Deliver cargo, retrieve resources, and rescue stranded pilots as you navigate a mysterious universe of moons and planets."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rjYZG25IJRM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20e8cc3b2cdcaeb11da71fd3fb4cba84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rjYZG25IJRM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Confusingly, at one point it did note it would have Native Linux support, but this seemed to be an error as the actual release only has a Windows version. The <em>good</em> news is that it works well on both desktop Linux and Steam Deck using Proton with one caveat. Some of the cut-scenes have a problem playing in Proton. They display fine but the audio is all choppy so it does very briefly sour the experience. Oddly, it's only on some of them. Thankfully, there's no issues with the actual gameplay but still something that ideally needs solving.</p>
<p>You likely already know what to expect from this one. The basic mechanic is exactly the same as the classic. You're always being pulled downwards due to gravity, so it's up to you to do some truly fancy finger-work to avoid obstacles and land safely while you race around doing various types of missions. If you liked the original, you'll probably enjoy this a fair bit too as I did. It's that basic mechanic, amped-up by <em>lots</em> of modern touches with multiple ships to unlock, multiple pilots with abilities and various special abilities to equip on your ships that you can swap between missions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8306300831715084264gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8306300831715084264gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here you actually have a story too and the little cut-scenes and mission intros are a good touch, although the AI assist voice seriously got on my nerves. It sounded like one of those awful Tiktok AI voices.</p>
<p>The 4 difficulty options are a nice addition too giving you quite a different game to play across them. They tweak the damage received from bumping into things, pilot XP penalties, credit penalties, pilots dying or not, the ability to retry missions or not and fuel consumption.</p>
<p>I quite liked the pilot system in Lunar Lander Beyond giving you multiple to pick from for each mission, along with them levelling up and gaining random traits that can be really helpful. The stress mechanic is a nice unique twist too, as each pilot has their own stress meter that fills up as you screw up. If it gets too high, they might start freaking out seeing things and it can get <em>really</em> weird.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7447367471715086613gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7447367471715086613gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It can be quite a frustrating game overall, but that's firmly part of its point. The initial ship you get is quite terrible, and can incredibly easily just smash into a wall due to the thrust power. The other ships are all quite different, so you (like me) will probably end up just sticking to one ship type and not wanting to use the others. The ship controls, plus the pilot perks and all the abilities also ends up sort-of <em>cheapening</em> the whole idea of the game. The entire point of the original was to be a thorough challenge all the way through, and get you to stick it out because you really liked the challenge. There's not too much of that feeling here because of all the extras, it's a game that's in a slightly weird place.</p>
<p>That said, all of the additions and changes do make it a <em>much</em> more accessible game, which is what I feel they were really going for there. And so on that, they certainly succeeded. The gameplay can be pretty rewarding too, when you manage to pull off some slick moves across some of the trickier levels, and especially so when playing on a higher difficulty because that does make you hyper-focus a whole lot when you don't want to lose a precious pilot.</p>
<p>Overall it's a good game, and an interesting attempt to bring the gravity lander mechanic into the modern age. The Steam release seems to have been buried and ignored by most people, with it only seeing at time of writing this last bit a grand total of 4 reviews. Shame because I think it deserves a bit more attention.</p>
<p>I think the price is the biggest issue here. I really <em>don't</em> like the idea of developers undervaluing their games as they can take a lot of time and effort to make, and pricing even for indies is tough but at £24.99 for a game that really is relying on nostalgia, in years when we've had <em>constant</em> amazing new releases that are either cheaper or a similar price. It's a pretty tough sell.</p>
<p>Valve has given it a Steam Deck Playable rating, noting some small text.</p>

      <title>SteamVR Beta gets an SDL fix for Fedora Linux fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve seem to be actually cleaning up SteamVR on Linux a bit more recently, which is kind of exciting when it's been left rough for so long.</p>
<p>A Beta update for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/steamvr-beta-linux-fixes-plus-beta-updates-for-desktop-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamVR on April 26th</a> included fixes on Linux for uninitialized memory in the right eye, they fixed the SteamVR Home launch script and even improved launch scripts and log capture for bug reports. An earlier one on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/4146199229186243608" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 26th</a> also added support for direct mode drivers (IVRDriverDirectModeComponent) on Linux too.</p>
<p>Now we have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/4186735430669421181" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another</a> small update to the SteamVR Beta that "Fixed an SDL compatibility problem on Fedora" along with two other main SteamVR changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing missing haptic component in some Vive tracker profiles.</li>
<li>Fixing some scenarios where the menu button didn't work on trackers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've seen the rumours for a long time now on an upcoming Valve Steam VR headset, code-named Deckard. So perhaps we're starting to see a little extra work here towards that end? Who knows. Either way, it's truly nice to see Linux actually getting some VR attention from Valve.</p>
<p>For our VR readers: what's the issue annoying you the most with VR on Linux right now?</p>

      <title>With a few days to go Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy is fully funded on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy is the next game from the ATOM RPG team, inspired by the classic Infinity Engine games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and more. They plan full Native Linux support once again, as I covered about the game previously, and controller support eventually too so it should hopefully play well on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With the Kickstarter campaign only having 3 days left, the good news for people wanting to play more RPGs like it is that it's now fully funded. With nearly €40K pledged against the €36K goal they have a bit of wiggle-room there as they're just about to hit the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/atomrpg/swordhaven-iron-conspiracy/posts/4087458" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first stretch-goal</a> to improve the player-base system of the game, which gives you a home to call your own.</p>

<p>Features include:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A flexible combat engine. Experience battle as a tactician in turn-based combat, or hasten the pace with the real-time with pause (RTwP) mode.</li>
<li>A classless roleplaying system: each stat combination provides a unique gaming experience, distinctive dialogues, and novel ways to solve quests.</li>
<li>A classics-inspired yet modern User Interface with large customization possibilities.</li>
<li>A vast, nonlinear world filled with unique NPCs and multi-solution quests that reward exploration, always offering alternative approaches to satisfy any character build.</li>
<li>Dozens of hours of exploration, from quiet village hamlets to hidden temples of the ancients, horrid crypts, bizarre dungeons, and otherworldly locales…</li>

      <title>Playtron give a bit more detail on the Linux-based PlaytronOS and their plans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>So far, I've not been particularly impressed by Playtron and PlaytronOS, but I'm always keen to see more Linux-based systems and devices do well especially when they do have developers who know what they're doing. Now we have another trickle of info coming in about it.</p>
<p>As a reminder: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/playtron-plan-to-launch-playtronos-a-linux-based-system-for-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlaytronOS announced back in March</a> is a Linux-based system designed for gaming across handhelds, and they have plans to eventually be on laptops, PCs, TVs and so on.</p>
<p>The only hardware that's actually been announced to use it so far is the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SuiPlay0x1</a>, a weird looking web3 blockchain handheld. Not exactly something that's going to turn many heads towards them. To be fair to Playtron, they're <em>not</em> a hardware vendor, they're just making an OS based on Linux that anyone will be able to use. One that will support the Epic Games Store, GOG, Steam and more out of the box.</p>
<p>Until now we've not actually had all that much <em>properly</em> confirmed about it, which they're beginning to clean up and they've now posted a proper FAQ. Although it's only in their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/yNBMRt8qZq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord</a> right now so to save you joining yet-another-server here's what they've said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why should I install PlaytronOS?</strong></p>
<p>Playtron is an optimized Linux-based gaming OS that allows you to play all of your favorite Epic Games Store, Good Old Games, Steam games, and more.<br/>
Improved game compatibility compared to other devices on the market.</p>
<p><strong>When will the pre-alpha launch of PlaytronOS come out?</strong></p>
<p>Summer 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any Playtron devices coming out?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Many different devices with varying form factors, features, and price points will be coming out in 2025. One of the first devices will be the SuiPlay OX1.</p>
<p><strong>When will the first Playtron device be launched?</strong></p>
<p>We are aiming for the first half of 2025.</p>
<p><strong>What operating system is PlaytronOS based on?</strong></p>
<p>We are based on the Fedora Silverblue family of Atomic Desktop distros. PlaytronOS is not affiliated with the Fedora Project.</p>
<p><strong>What version of Fedora is PlaytronOS based on?</strong></p>
<p>The pre-alpha will be based on Fedora 40.</p>
<p><strong>What are the system requirements for PlaytronOS?</strong></p>
<p>We provide best-effort support on a wide range of devices. Here is a list of devices we have tested on:<br/>
*Aya Neo 2<br/>
ASUS ROG Ally<br/>
GPD Win 4 (2023)<br/>
Lenovo Legion Go<br/>
Valve Steam Deck LCD<br/>
Valve Steam Deck OLED*</p>
<p><strong>What are the minimum requirements for PlaytronOS?<br/>
CPU</strong><br/>
x86<br/>
AMD Ryzen or Intel 6th Gen Kaby Lake</p>
<p><strong>GPU</strong><br/>
AMD Navi<br/>
Intel Xe<br/>
NVIDIA Turing</p>
<p><strong>Does Playtron run Linux games?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, PlaytronOS only runs Windows games using Wine. Native Linux games will be supported in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Is Playtron a hardware company?</strong></p>
<p>No. We are a software company working closely with hardware OEMs.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Playtron located?</strong></p>
<p>Playtron is a registered company in California but employees are working remotely all across the globe.</p>
<p><strong>What games will run on Playtron?</strong></p>
<p>While thousands of games are already compatible with Playtron in its pre-alpha stage, our official game support program is currently under development and review.</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages of PlaytronOS over other operating systems?</strong></p>
<p>Unified out-of-the-box experience for installing and playing games from the Epic Games Store, Good Old Games (GOG), and Steam.</p>
<p><strong>What does Playtron have to do with Crypto?</strong></p>
<p>Playtron is backed by a handful of crypto companies. If game developers believe blockchain features can improve their games, we are all for it. The use of these technologies from a user perspective will be optional.</p>
<p><strong>What integration does Playtron have with Sui?</strong></p>
<p>You'll be able to make purchases with your SUI wallet. Web2 and Web3 games will be available to download and play.</p>
<p><strong>Will the pre-alpha launch include Arm support?</strong></p>
<p>No. The pre-alpha will only support x86 CPU architecture.</p>
<p><strong>How will Playtron deal with anti-cheat on Linux?</strong></p>
<p>Playtron is working with interested partners to enable anti-cheat services.</p>
<p><strong>Is PlaytronOS open source?</strong></p>
<p>At first, only the operating system code will be open source. We have plans to open source more and release API documentation to allow developers in the community to contribute and build their solutions using Playtron.</p>
<p><strong>How can I get in touch with Playtron?</strong></p>
<p>For now, you can follow us over at <a href="https://twitter.com/PLAYTR0N" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@PLAYTR0N</a> on X and our website, <a href="https://www.playtron.one/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">www.playtron.one</a>, for more updates.</p>
<p><strong>What about auto-mounting and formatting drives?</strong></p>
<p>We've created a drive formatting tool in Playtron and will auto-mount devices for you. No need for desktop mode.</p>
<p><strong>How can I contribute to PlaytronOS?</strong><br/>
Stay tuned for more information on contributing to our project.</p>

      <title>Hades II gets Steam Deck Verified and a surprise Early Access release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a game developer I hope you weren't planning to launch soon, as Hades II just sneakily dropped into Early Access on Steam. It's also Steam Deck Verified right away!</p>
<p>Hades II is a rogue-like dungeon crawler in which you'll battle beyond the Underworld of Greek myth using dark sorcery to take on the sinister Titan of Time. It builds on the best aspects of the award-winning original in an all-new, action-packed, endlessly replayable experience rooted in Greek myth and its deep connections to the dawn of witchcraft.</p>
<p>Even though it's in Early Access it still has more content than the first game including "more environments, foes, and fully-voiced characters" but "key areas, characters, foes, narrative events, and systems are still to come".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Miu_akSity4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46c17890ebbb3e115988161b43c31be5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Miu_akSity4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Confession time: I have still not played through the original. I know — I know, I'll get around to it. I'm currently finally playing through Telltale's The Walking Dead, so I'll put it on my list for after…</p>
<p>For those who <em>have</em> played the first one, I bet it's going to be difficult to hold off on it considering it's not finished yet. The developers state they expect it to be in Early Access for at least all of 2024. Really nice to see it got Steam Deck testing so early-on too, that's a good sign.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updates OpenXR and fixes Command &amp; Conquer, The Desolate Hope + more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put up a fresh Proton Experimental update today now than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/proton-9-0-released-with-expanded-game-support-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0 is officially available</a>, with the usual assorted game compatibility improvements for Steam Deck / Linux.</p>
<p>Noted in the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> is that <em>FreestyleFootball R</em> is now playable as of this release and additionally they've added support for <em>OpenXR 1.1.36</em>. Another change is that Valve have limited the CPU cores seen by <em>Command &amp; Conquer and The Covert Operations</em>, allowing them to be played on high core-count systems (much like they did for multiple titles in Proton 9.0).</p>

      <title>PlayStation Remote Play for Steam Deck app chiaki4deck testing easier connections</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Great news for anyone who uses their Steam Deck for PlayStation Remote Play, as the open source chiaki4deck app is testing a big upgrade for easier console connections.</p>
<p>Mentioned on <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/releases/tag/psn_test" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for the new test release they said "This is a test release for the new feature of remote connection using PSN for Setup using UDP Holepunching instead of requiring port forwarding by the end user.". So the result should be a lot less fiddly and a smoother experience overall, with you no longer needing to screw around with internet router settings.</p>
<p>Some requirements for testing it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console must be connected to PSN and updated to the latest firmware</li>
<li>Console must be registered either locally or remotely via the traditional registration</li>
<li>Home network must be compatible with UDP holepunching (not all networks are compatible)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console will show up as Remote Connection Via PSN with the console nickname</li>
<li>Console will only show up for remote connection if console is not discovered locally (otherwise Chiaki4deck will use local connection)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a test AppImage on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/releases/tag/psn_test" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release page</a>, which also gives info on using their test Flatpak if you would prefer.</p>
<p><em>Nice to see for when your friends, partners, kids and so on are hogging the TV. </em></p>

      <title>City-building puzzler TerraScape gets controller support, Steam Deck support coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since I'm a big fan of stuff like Dorfromantik I've been keeping an eye on TerraScape, which just added controller support and they say Steam Deck support is planned too. Here it's a beautiful puzzle game wearing the face of a city-builder, and the idea of it looks great.</p>
<p>The developer has put up the Voyage Update which includes a whole bunch of new features, but they also clearly stated "full Steam deck support is coming in the future" when talking about the new controller support.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-dfiFjb9NTA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0979847525ac0e190d16bf9b4228dcb4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-dfiFjb9NTA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features highlighted from the update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Main menu rework.</li>
<li>Completely new representation of building placement, range, influence points and highlighting of building complexes.</li>
<li>New animation for obtaining points for buildings on place.</li>
<li>Blueprints/Ping and map overlays (controller) are now quickly selectable via right-click and ring menu.</li>
<li>Controller support (full Steam deck support is coming in the future).</li>
<li>A new but important building complex.</li>
<li>Anti-Cheat mechanisms.</li>
<li>Performance improvements when placing buildings, merging and loading terrain.</li>
<li>Unique rewards for the weekly challenges when you reach bronze, silver and gold.</li>
<li>Animals now walk freely on their little hexagons and are no longer rooted to the ground.</li>
<li>New map overlay for displaying buildings (type).</li>
<li>Reworked the puzzle map menu.</li>
</ul>

      <title>PS1 love-letter survival horror game Crow Country gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Ahead of the release of May 9th, SFB Games have managed to get their upcoming survival horror game Crow Country that's a love-letter to classic PlayStation horror games Steam Deck Verified. It looks really good, if you're itching for the atmosphere from the classics like the original Resident Evil.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1996010/announcements/detail/4186735430651616100" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, developer Tom Vian mentioned "Both Adam and I have done a lot of playtesting of the game on our Steam Decks, and we think it feels great. Turns out, Valve agrees with us!".</p>
<p>What is it: A survival horror game, where you’ll test yourself against puzzles and riddles as you investigate the eerie tranquility of the abandoned theme park. Don’t be deceived by the whimsical surroundings, something is awfully wrong in Crow Country.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FiuI7_1FLUw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef7b392cfd3b927cc873fbeba79540f9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FiuI7_1FLUw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore the Park - As you unlock new areas, backtrack and discover more, you gradually piece together why Edward really shut down his park and where he mysteriously disappeared to. You’ve heard some pretty disturbing rumors, but they couldn’t possibly be true…..right?</li>
<li>See the Sights - For visitors to the park who are more interested in spotting crows and taking in the sights, Exploration Mode allows you to journey on without the fear of being attacked by the mysterious monsters roaming Crow Country. If you knew what those monsters really are…..</li>
<li>Solve the Mystery - Just how far would someone go to follow their ambition? Are some sins too wicked for redemption?</li>
<li>Find Answers - A tale of reckless hubris and human greed, and now at the center of it all... you.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Time survival roguelite in space Cozy Space Survivors is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those who love to game but have little time, here's a fresh take on the whole survivor-like genre thing with Cozy Space Survivors out now.</p>
<p>Developed by Simon Trümpler who previously worked on the likes of Sacred 2, X:Rebirth, RIME, The Invisible Hours and more. They have a pretty interesting website where they go over <a href="https://simonschreibt.de/game-art-tricks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">various art tricks</a> video games use. But we're not here to talk about all that, we're here for Cozy Space Survivors.</p>
<p>"Explore a colorful, tiny universe. Help its cute inhabitants solve their problems. Use satisfying weapons to defend you and your new friends against hordes of quirky enemies. You can focus on controlling your shipy while shooting happens automatically. There are unique landmarks to discover, and enemies leave experience points for level-ups to gain new skills. In addition, you can mine chocolate asteroids to unlock permanent upgrades."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0WskX_VnYFQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8de7d43247a822a05a511bdba3f7ce20.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0WskX_VnYFQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall it's a fun blending of ideas to create something rather unique. The developer said about their inspiration that it pulls in the survivor-like action that Vampire Survivors made popular along with "Binding of Isaac for physicality of bullets, Halls of Torment for adding Quests to a Vampire Survivors-Like, Fallout for the story summary at the end of the game and Into the Breach for the little NPC dialog texts which add so much atmosphere".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2657850/Cozy_Space_Survivors/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy Cozy Space Survivors on Steam</a>. For the £2.49 (non-sale) price it's an absolute steal.</p>

      <title>Valve graphics dev gets Gamescope working on NVK with Explicit Sync</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve developers have done a lot of work over the years to improve AMD GPUs on Linux, and continue to do so with the Steam Deck using AMD and it seems like they're now getting stuck into NVIDIA too.</p>
<p>Specifically for NVK, the open source Vulkan NVIDIA driver in Mesa which has seen a lot of focus recently on bringing up performance. Now though it's getting improved so that Gamescope can properly run on it too, which will be really useful.</p>
<p>Posting on X (formerly Twitter) Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1786544648389025928" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Thanks to Mohamed's work (as part of our graphics team), gamescope now works on NVK with explicit sync!" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15155712261714988767gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The two patches noted from developer Mohamed Ahmed are a Mesa <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/28843" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Merge Request</a> for get the Vulkan extensions VK_EXT_image_drm_format_modifier support hooked up. And then a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/20240430155453.21132-1-mohamedahmedegypt2001@gmail.com/T/#u" rel="noopener" target="_blank">change</a> for Nouveau that notes it "Allows PTE kind and tile mode on BO create with VM_BIND, as well as adds a GETPARAM to indicate this change. This is needed to support modifiers in NVK and ensure correctness when dealing with the nouveau GL driver."</p>

      <title>Sony gives up on forcing PlayStation Network for Helldivers 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Operation Completed? Sony announced their plans for forcing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/helldivers-2-sees-over-130k-bad-reviews-on-steam-as-sony-double-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Network accounts for Helldivers 2</a> have now been scrapped.</p>
<p>Writing on X (formerly Twitter) the official PlayStation account <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1787331667616829929" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Helldivers fans -- we’ve heard your feedback on the Helldivers 2 account linking update. The May 6 update, which would have required Steam and PlayStation Network account linking for new players and for current players beginning May 30, will not be moving forward.  We’re still learning what is best for PC players and your feedback has been invaluable. Thanks again for your continued support of Helldivers 2 and we’ll keep you updated on future plans." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7272431761714987130gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This comes after a <em>huge</em> backlash seeing the Steam page for Helldivers 2 hit over 200,000 negative reviews in the space of only a few days. As a result, it became one of the worst reviewed games of all time on Steam.</p>
<p>The situation was evolving pretty quickly, with Sony removing the purchasing option of Helldivers 2 on Steam in 177 regions. At of time of writing, that has not been reversed yet but hopefully it will so people won't have to resort to workarounds.</p>
<p>Now we have to wait and see what happens to all the negative reviews. I imagine quite a lot will stick, but there will likely be a good amount of players that either remove their negative review, or swap it over to a positive rating to reflect Sony actually listening.</p>
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 works great on Linux with Proton and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>UK Government replies to petition about requiring publishers to keep games working</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/stop-killing-games-is-a-new-campaign-to-stop-developers-making-games-unplayable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I covered</a> an interesting movement called <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a>, which has an aim to bring to light the issue of publishers dropping support for and turning off games that people paid for.</p>
<p>This came about after Ubisoft decided to shut down The Crew, so everyone who had purchased it got left with a game that no longer works due to their forced online requirement. This certainly isn't the first game to do it, there's been a good few games left broken over the years and with how big the gaming industry is now, there will be more games shut by bigger publishers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11743145411714919088gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The Crew</em></p>
<p><a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/659071" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A petition was set up</a> on the UK government's <em>official</em> petition website. On here when a petition hits 10,000 votes the government has to reply. If they hit 100,000 though, it's supposed to then be considered for an actual debate in Parliament. The petition closes on 16th October 2024.</p>
<p>That petition has hit 17,426 signatures at time of writing, and the UK government replied on May 2nd. The short version is: "Those selling games must comply with UK consumer law. They must provide clear information and allow continued access to games if sold on the understanding that they will remain playable indefinitely.".</p>
<p>No game is marketed anywhere on being available indefinitely, and in the case of Steam, you're only buying a license and not ownership of the game, so this isn't likely to go much further until it can be pushed much harder.</p>
<p>The full reply is much wordier and goes on to mention how "There may be occasions where companies make commercial decisions based on the high running costs of maintaining older servers for video games that have declining user bases.".</p>
<p>Which is a valid point, maintaining game servers does cost time and money, but that's not <em>quite</em> the point of the campaign argument. The point is these games with single-player modes that have forced server connections are made so that there's no way for players to continue them on, you're just left with nothing when the publisher decides to move on.</p>
<p>The full UK government reply is below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Government recognises recent concerns raised by video games users regarding the long-term operability of purchased products.</p>
<p>Consumers should be aware that there is no requirement in UK law compelling software companies and providers to support older versions of their operating systems, software or connected products. There may be occasions where companies make commercial decisions based on the high running costs of maintaining older servers for video games that have declining user bases. However, video games sellers must comply with existing consumer law, including the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs).</p>
<p>The CPRs require information to consumers to be clear and correct, and prohibit commercial practices which through false information or misleading omissions cause the average consumer to make a different choice, for example, to purchase goods or services they would not otherwise have purchased. The regulations prohibit commercial practices which omit or hide information which the average consumer needs to make an informed choice, and prohibits traders from providing material information in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner. If consumers are led to believe that a game will remain playable indefinitely for certain systems, despite the end of physical support, the CPRs may require that the game remains technically feasible (for example, available offline) to play under those circumstances.</p>
<p>The CPRs are enforced by Trading Standards and the Competition and Markets Authority. If consumers believe that there has been a breach of these regulations, they should report the matter in the first instance to the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 0808 223 1133 (<a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.citizensadvice.org.uk</a>). People living in Scotland should contact Advice Direct Scotland on 0808 164 6000 (<a href="http://www.consumeradvice.scot/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.consumeradvice.scot</a>). Both helplines offer a free service advising consumers on their rights and how best to take their case forward. The helplines will refer complaints to Trading Standards services where appropriate. Consumers can also pursue private redress through the courts where a trader has provided misleading information on a product.</p>
<p>The CRA gives consumers important rights when they make a contract with a trader for the supply of digital content. This includes requiring digital content to be of satisfactory quality, fit for a particular purpose and as described by the seller. It can be difficult and expensive for businesses to maintain dedicated support for old software, particularly if it needs to interact with modern hardware, apps and websites, but if software is being offered for sale that is not supported by the provider, then this should be made clear.</p>
<p>If the digital content does not meet these quality rights, the consumer has the right to a repair or replacement of the digital content. If a repair or replacement is not possible, or does not fix the problem, then the consumer will be entitled to some money back or a price reduction which can be up to 100% of the cost of the digital content. These rights apply to intangible digital content like computer software or a PC game, as well as digital content in a tangible form like a physical copy of a video game. The CRA has a time limit of up to six years after a breach of contract during which a consumer can take legal action.</p>
<p>The standards outlined above apply to digital content where there is a contractual right of the trader or a third party to modify or update the digital content. In practice, this means that a trader or third party can upgrade, fix, enhance and improve the features of digital content so long as it continues to match any description given by the trader and continues to conform with any pre-contract information including main characteristics, functionality and compatibility provided by the trader, unless varied by express agreement.</p>
<p>Consumers should also be aware that while there is a statutory right for goods (including intangible digital content) to be of a satisfactory quality, that will only be breached if they are not of the standard which a reasonable person would consider to be satisfactory, taking into account circumstances including the price and any description given. For example, a manufacturer’s support for a mobile phone is likely to be withdrawn as they launch new models. It will remain usable but without, for example, security updates, and over time some app developers may decide to withdraw support.</p>
<p>Department Culture, Media &amp; Sport</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no real good solution to this. Government intervention would likely be quite messy for the industry, <em>especially</em> for smaller developers. The better solution would be for big publishers to stop forcing online requirements for games that have single-player. Handing out server builds for players is an option too of course, lots and lots of games do that. And there's probably numerous other ways to handle this that isn't just <em>taking away </em>what people <em>paid</em> for.</p>
<p>The reality is, until people en masse stop buying games with those requirements, nothing will change.</p>

      <title>Steam PC and Steam Deck Beta released solving Proton 9 download issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/proton-9-0-released-with-expanded-game-support-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently releasing Proton 9</a>, as the latest major update to the Windows compatibility layer for Linux / Steam Deck, there were some download issues that should now be solved.</p>
<p>With the fixes coming in a Steam Client Beta that's available for Desktop and Steam Deck. Although curiously it's noted to be a Beta, but my Steam Deck OLED gave me the update on the Stable channel. Either way, it should roll out for everyone soon.</p>
<p>Here's all that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4199120329637230599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a> (it's the same across Desktop and Steam Deck):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed desktop notifications no longer displaying after editing notes for a game</li>
<li>Fixed download notification for newly downloaded DLC not showing the correct name.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed problems downloading Proton 9.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix Regression for "Custom Deadzones" not applying correctly.</li>
<li>UI: Joystick Mouse Deadzone controls now use the common Deadzone Editor.</li>
<li>Added "Invert Command Binding" for FlickStick's Outer Ring Command.</li>
<li>Added an option to allow the FlickStick to trigger a Flick Turn if the stick is thrown when the action set/action layer/mode shift is activated.</li>
<li>Reset Camera to Horizon/Turn Camera to Face Direction/ Turn Camera 360: these actions will still work even if Flick Stick or Gyro to Mouse are removed from your settings. Dots per 360 must first be calibrated using those two modes, however.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Note: this beta was re-released to fix a regression in opening the desktop onscreen keyboard.</p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 sees over 130K bad reviews on Steam as Sony double down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: 06/05/24</strong>: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/sony-gives-up-on-forcing-playstation-network-for-helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sony gives up on forcing PlayStation Network for Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>The HELLDIVERS 2 situation is an increasingly messy one, and it's only getting worse for Arrowhead Game Studios thanks to Sony.</p>
<p>As a reminder on what's going on: since release, HELLDIVERS 2 has stated on the Steam page "Requires 3rd-Party Account: PlayStation Network (Supports Linking to Steam Account)". It has been there all along, although you do have to scroll down a bit to see it. However, due to overwhelming demand initially when it released, they didn't force it. An <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4196868529806518741" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> was posted on the Steam page recently mentioning it will now actually be forced, which interestingly was signed by "Sony Interactive Entertainment" rather than the developer as usual.</p>
<p>The Steam page for HELLDIVERS 2 at time of writing has amassed a crazy 134,069 negative reviews over the last few days. This has pushed the recent reviews into Mostly Negative, with an overall Mixed score.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20622813491714898583gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20622813491714898583gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now, Sony seem to be doubling down on this. As shown on <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/137730/history/?changeid=23416542" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the game is no longer available for purchase in 177 locations. Why? PlayStation Network is not available in a lot of places, and so forcing this will mean players in these regions will be unable to play the game.</p>
<p>Valve has also reportedly begun approving <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ck4mql/refunds_on_steam_work_here_is_good_guy_steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">refunds</a> for players not happy about it. Even people with many tens of hours in the game, which is quite unusual for Valve. It makes sense though, Valve likely don't want the legal headaches of potentially thousands of people suddenly unable to play their purchase because of a newly enforced restriction.</p>
<p>Writing on X (formerly Twitter), the Arrowhead CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1786454659256758447" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Ouch, right in the review score  Well, I guess it's warranted. Sorry everyone for how this all transpired. I hope we will make it up and regain the trust by providing a continued great game experience.  I just want to make great games!" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12010670531714898095gol1.png"/></p>
<p>This forcing of the account system comes from Sony directly, <em>not</em> from Arrowhead Game Studios, and clearly the team at Arrowhead are rather unhappy about it too. Writing in Discord, some of their team have been posting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cjyll7/some_discord_updates/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updates</a> on it like:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7632209051714898303gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7632209051714898303gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1814632021714898340gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17519348311714898397gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A clear case in how to destroy something great. Hopefully Sony do the right thing here and make steps to fix the situation to improve the experience for players.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the player counts on Steam have barely changed (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#1w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) at all during this time.</p>
<p>Interestingly. Sony updated their PSN sign-in on PC <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/psn-sign-in-pc/#faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">help page</a> too recently. Originally it stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I have to sign in to PSN to play a PlayStation game on PC?<br/>
Signing in to PSN is optional when playing a PlayStation game on PC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240504213615/https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/games/psn-sign-in-pc/#faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a> around May 4th to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do I have to sign in to PSN to play a PlayStation game on PC?</p>
<p>Some PlayStation games may require you sign in and link to an account for PSN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now it's back to saying it's optional again. So they changed it and then changed it back.</p>
<p>I'm also hoping this is a wake-up call for Valve too on forced 3rd-party accounts. A single mention in the Steam page sidebar is clearly not enough to inform buyers. My basic idea is to add it clearly during checkout too, above the price and payment info. Something that cannot be skipped. There's quite a lot of games on Steam now that require an extra account, so it would make sense for Valve to have a much more prominent statement on it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update: 05/05/24 14:47</strong> - The Arrowhead CEO, Johan Pilestedt, <a href="http://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1787073896560165299" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter) to confirm "We are talking solutions with PlayStation, especially for non-PSN countries. Your voice has been heard, and I am doing everything I can to speak for the community - but I don't have the final say.".</p>
<p>And in reply to a user mentioning they should have known about this, Pilestedt <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1787076609188483254" rel="noopener" target="_blank">replied</a>: "I do have a part to play. I am not blameless in all of this - it was my decision to disable account linking at launch so that players could play the game. I did not ensure players were aware of the requirement and we didn't talk about it enough.</p>
<p>We knew for about 6 months before launch that it would be mandatory for online PS titles."</p>
<p>On top of that, just to be clear, another user asked why they sold it in unsupported regions to which Pilestedt <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1787111359450120237" rel="noopener" target="_blank">replied</a>: "We do not handle selling the game.". So once again, how this is being handled is down to Sony.</p>

      <title>Men of War II releases May 15th with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite a surprise. Men of War II from Best Way and Fulqrum Publishing releases on May 15th and it will have Native Linux support too. Originally due to launch in September 2023, they decided to delay it until this year after gathering feedback from multiple playtests.</p>
<p>Men of War II will launch with three playable nations - the Soviets, Americans and the Third Reich - each with their own narrative campaign, as well as two further Historical campaigns, a dynamic Conquest campaign and a skirmish-like Raid mode. All of the single-player content can also be played in co-op with up to five players, and the game offers extensive PvP and PvE multiplayer options, including ranked match-making for all three battle setups (Battalions, Combined Arms and Classic Mode). Even with single-player though, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1128860/discussions/0/4358998116397977773/#c4358998116398146819" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> an active internet connection is required.</p>
<p>Release date trailer:</p>

<p>The Steam page shows it will have Linux support, and one of their team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1128860/discussions/0/3202618375229924467/?tscn=1714752876#c4358998287108331623" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> on the Steam forum "Men of War II has native Linux support. It's also compatible with Steam Deck.".</p>
<p>As a huge fan of real time strategy games, I can't wait to sink my teeth into this one.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy it from:</p>

      <title>Roguelite survivor game Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok has launched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another popular survivor-like roguelite has launched, with Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok leaving Early Access to the big 1.0.</p>
<p>Taking the ideas from Vampire Survivors and putting a Nordic spin on it, so they could have just called it Viking Survivors and that would have been fine. Overall it seems it's hit the mark for most, with players giving it a Very Positive rating on Steam and it regularly sees multiple thousands of people playing it concurrently each day. So overall the developer has done well with it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RolDBKeSKac"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/988696b1a34ae179119113c614382858.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RolDBKeSKac" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 maps, inspired by each realm of Norse mythology.</li>
<li>10+ characters, with exclusive skills and weapons.</li>
<li>Skill tree in the form of character constellations, to improve the stats of each survivor.</li>
<li>Yggdrasil as a meta-progress tree to boost different features that will make you feel more powerful in your adventure.</li>
<li>Character Masteries to upgrade your characters to their maximum potential.</li>
<li>5 game modes: Adventure, Ragnarok, Daily Challenge, Custom and Nightmare.</li>
<li>Alternative character skins for every character.</li>
<li>Elites and Bosses with their own behaviors to make battles more epic.</li>
<li>Reward Shrines scattered throughout the realm to always have quests or challenges to complete during a run.</li>
<li>Ascensions of each character's relics to boost them even more.</li>
<li>+150 Relics.</li>
<li>+150 Achievements.</li>
<li>Secrets.</li>
<li>Twitch integration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 1.0 release is not the end, as you might expect, the developer has various plans to continue updating and expand the game. </p>
<p>When I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/nordic-ashes-survivors-of-ragnarok-norse-horde-survival-rogue-lite/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took a look at it originally</a>, I noted how it was a fair bit slower than other similar games that required a bit more skill on the movement and that hasn't really changed. So if others were too fast for you, perhaps give this one a try.</p>
<p>Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2068280/Nordic_Ashes_Survivors_of_Ragnarok/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nintendo DMCA nukes 8,535 GitHub copies of Switch emulator yuzu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The battle continues! The fallout is ongoing from the legal battle between Nintendo and yuzu that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">saw the yuzu team fold</a>.</p>
<p>It's getting increasingly difficult for anyone to host a copy of the original code, or forks that continue it on, as Nintendo are not stopping in their battle against the popular Switch emulator. Nintendo sent another DMCA over to GitHub which caused 8,535 source code repositories to go offline</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2024/04/2024-04-29-nintendo.md" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DMCA notice</a> available on GitHub it mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Because the reported network that contained the allegedly infringing content was larger than one hundred (100) repositories, and the submitter alleged that all or most of the forks were infringing to the same extent as the parent repository, GitHub processed the takedown notice against the entire network of 8,535 repositories, inclusive of the parent repository.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The DMCA also states that yuzu "illegally circumvents Nintendo’s technological protection measures and runs illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games".</p>
<p>GitLab isn't safe for yuzu-related code either, since they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/gitlab-takes-down-nintendo-switch-emulator-suyu-due-to-the-dmca/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took down suyu too</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://ryujinx.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ryujinx</a> is just sat over there in the corner, hoping Nintendo don't come calling.</p>
<p>Nintendo are clearly keeping a constant watch on anything related to yuzu, and they're quite busy lately, even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/garrys-mod-forced-to-remove-nintendo-content-after-takedowns/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">putting Garry's Mod in their sights</a> to get content removed.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO announce the desktop-replacement Stellaris 17 gen6 notebook</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Stellaris 17 from TUXEDO is a new refreshed (their sixth version) high-powered desktop-replacement notebook, with a high price and a tease of more models in this series to come. With full Linux support of course, like everything from TUXEDO you can pick between their own TUXEDO OS, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu Budgie.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6633326231714743075gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The base model is pricey at €2,099 EUR but for that you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 8GB GDDR6 | up to a RTX 4090.</li>
<li>17'' 2560 x 1600 16:10 display at 240Hz | ~99 % sRGB | ~380 nits.</li>
<li>Intel Core i9-14900HX (24 Cores | 32 Threads | Max. 5.8 GHz | 36 MB Cache | 55 W TDP).</li>
<li>Intel UHD Graphics | 32 Execution Units (EUs) | max. 1.65 MHz graphics frequency</li>
<li>16 GB (2x 8GB) DDR5 5600MHz Crucial.</li>
<li>500 GB Samsung 980 (NVMe PCIe 3.0).</li>
<li>Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211 (802.11ax | 2.4, 5 &amp; 6 GHz | Bluetooth 5.3).</li>
<li>99 Wh battery.</li>
<li>Along with a healthy dose of ports including: USB-A 3.2 Gen2x1, Mic-in, Headphone-out (compatible with combi-plugs), Card reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC), 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen1, Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4 Gen3x1, HDMI 2.1, RJ45 Port 2.5 Gbit, power plug (DC-in).</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on which GPU you go for, you also get a different keyboard. the RTX 4060 gives you a "quiet" membrane keyboard, whereas the RTX 4070-4090 have the optional of a mechanical keyboard. But the RTX 4090 also has an option for a "silent" membrane keyboard too. You get a Linux TUX super-key on all layouts.</p>
<p>There's also an optional external water cooling addon for stationary use. If you really wanted to push it while at home.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-Stellaris-17-Gen6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their store page</a>.</p>
<p>TUXEDO are also teasing two other Stellaris models with the Stellaris 15 Slim they say say is a "compact ultra-slim gamer in highly portable 15.3" format" and the Stellaris 16 they say is the "best combination of performance, thermals and portability". No word on when they will appear though.</p>

      <title>Classic RTS Perimeter returns as PERIMETER: Legate Edition with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Perimeter originally released back in 2004, and it's set to make a return from developer K-D Lab with the PERIMETER: Legate Edition. This new version of the game will be releasing on May 21st, and it will come with Native Linux support much like the developer did with the re-release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/vangers-the-open-source-classic-from-1998-continues-to-be-upgraded/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vangers</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-lrTdw7DSKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b7162d84d4a3eb9a3b9b1f9edf41713.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-lrTdw7DSKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features of the new edition include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform compatibility: Windows, Linux.</li>
<li>"Emperor’s Testament" add-on included in the main game.</li>
<li>Support for widescreen monitors with almost any resolution. You can change the resolution without restarting the game, and in windowed mode, changing the window size dynamically adjusts the game resolution.</li>
<li>Full support for online multiplayer gaming.</li>
<li>Capability for multiplayer with more than 4 players (on special maps).</li>
<li>Enhanced textures and models.</li>
<li>Support for custom mods.</li>
<li>Improved game balance.</li>
<li>Availability of all frames from both Geometry of War and Emperor’s Testament, as well as electro-technologies in battles and multiplayer. New player colours added.</li>
<li>Numerous minor improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually always wanted to give this one a go but never got round to it when it originally came out, so seeing this new edition is great and that looks like a rather nice list of upgrades. Nice to see some developers don't want to see their games forgotten.</p>
<p>Also, it's open source! Under the GPL on <a href="https://github.com/KD-lab-Open-Source/Perimeter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. That's only the code though, it still needs assets from the game to work. Nice to see and they did the same with Vangers.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2530170/PERIMETER_Legate_Edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Multiplayer arcade battler Armed and Gelatinous: Couch Edition now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jumping over from actual arcade machines, we have Armed and Gelatinous: Couch Edition now available with Native Linux support on Steam.</p>

<p>Now you get to sit your buttocks down on a sofa with family and friends to compete in chaotic party games like the sandbox mode Blob Dojo or sports minigames like Blob Soccer, Football, Dodgeball, and more. Crank up the party fun with house-only rules in fully custom game modes like melee weapons only and see who really reigns champion of all blob-kind.</p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 will soon actually require a PlayStation Network account</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Although the Steam page for HELLDIVERS 2 has clearly stated since release that a PlayStation Network account is required, you actually haven't had to link them. That will change really soon.</p>
<p>In a fresh Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4196868529806518741?l=english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers said it not being required right away was due to sorting all the technical issues but that "grace period will now expire". This is set to happen on May 6th, although they also said for current Steam players you will have until May 30th. So either way, you'll want to ensure you have a working PSN account set up and ready.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8142211061714738667gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8142211061714738667gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Why though? They said "Account linking plays a critical role in protecting our players and upholding the values of safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games. This is our main way to protect players from griefing and abuse by enabling the banning of players that engage in that type of behaviour. It also allows those players that have been banned the right to appeal."</p>
<p>Thankfully it's easy to link a Steam account and a PSN account, but for anyone in a region that PSN doesn't support, it could cause issues.</p>
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 works great on Linux with Proton and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

</ul>
<p>As seen from the official <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to update?</strong></p>
<p>If you already had the Beta of Proton 9.0 downloaded, it will just show up as a normal update in your Steam Downloads. If you went to play a game that was verified on Proton 9.0, that would also get it to download automatically. Otherwise, you can search for Proton 9.0 in your Steam Library and select to install it there. Example on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13310104671714668812gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13310104671714668812gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10158961931714668813gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10158961931714668813gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click images to enlarge. Left: searching for Proton. Right: About to install Proton 9.</em></p>
<p>Just before the weekend, giving you plenty of time to get testing all the latest. Excellent work from Valve and everyone else who works on Proton. That's a really great list of improvements there overall.</p>
<p>Is there a specific game you're waiting on being compatible? Let me know in the comments!</p>

      <title>NVIDIA make it easier to get GeForce NOW on Steam Deck </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing just how popular the Steam Deck is, NVIDIA are officially making it easier to get their cloud gaming service GeForce NOW on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While you've been able to get it working on Steam Deck for a while now, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/chrome-on-steam-deck-now-supports-the-deck-controller-with-geforce-now-working/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I've showed off before previously</a>, it's still a bit of manual effort to do. Thankfully, it seems that's going to change.</p>
<p>News comes from their <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-may-games-list/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest blog post</a>, which mentions they have a new <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">install option</a> (scroll down) that's currently in Beta. This will "automatically configure GeForce NOW’s browser in Steam Deck’s Gaming Mode" that installs Google Chrome for you, and sorts out all the settings you need to get it working.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4356811171714662140gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4356811171714662140gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Looking at the actual download specifically the readme notes it will install Chrome if it's not already installed, adjust the Flatpak settings for gamepad use, add a GeForce NOW shortcut to Steam, update the shortcut assets to look correct for their branding and set a default gamepad layout for it too. So pretty much what I expected there but great to see. Now it's just a simple script to download and run in Desktop Mode and all the little bits are done for you.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/release-highlights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> they released last week (v2.0.62) for GeForce NOW also tweaked it so that you can more easily navigate the service using a gamepad too (like the Steam Deck). So with the two together, it's easier than ever to do some cloud gaming on the Steam Deck for those games that it just can't handle, especially good if you don't have a powerful PC to stream to it too.</p>
<p>This will give you access to games from Steam, Battle.net, Epic Games, Ubisoft Connect, GOG and more.</p>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III gets the 5.0 update and Thrones of Decay for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feral Interactive have now ported over all the changes from the Total War: WARHAMMER III v5.0 update, along with support for the new Thrones of Decay DLCs. The update and 3 DLCs were released on April 30th, with the Linux port being updated today - pretty good turnaround from Feral there which is nice to see for one of their last Native Linux ports.</p>
<p>The Thrones of Decay pack is actually 3 DLC, which you can buy together or individually. The Thrones of Decay pack introduces 3 new Legendary Lords, for Nurgle, the Empire, and the Dwarfs, usable in both the Realm of Chaos and Immortal Empires campaigns. Launch trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="N_Pnd9fZGLw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7893353d74436eb2b50fd68d162a70c1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/N_Pnd9fZGLw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The 5.0 patch notes are <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty long</a> but some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Empire and Dwarf have had a full sweep of their building trees to bring them up to date.</li>
<li>Remastered and remade some of the old frontend videos for a variety of Legendary Lords.</li>
<li>Gotrek and Felix have been reworked so that both of them are now legendary heroes.</li>
<li>Ironman Mode.</li>
<li>Lots and lots of bug fixes, various balance changes, UI updates and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a linked Creative Assembly account then update 5.0 also adds an extra free Legendary Lord for the Nurgle race, Epidemius.</p>

      <title>Dark fantasy 2D platformer Saviorless is out now with a real unique style</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In Saviorless, you'll explore treacherous landscapes, fight nightmarish monsters, unravel a mysterious narrative and experience dynamic gameplay as three unique characters all while bathed in an atmospheric soundtrack.</p>
<p>A new Native Linux release I missed from early April, one that looks really good too. There's just too many games releasing but the style in this one looks great so it for sure deserves a bit of your attention. The creature and world design really looks interesting! Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KalS5UDppXE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/890db704ff57f01f4a0eec03531fdfa9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KalS5UDppXE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Created by Cuban indie gave developer, Empty Head Games and publisher Dear Villagers, developing a video game in Cuba presented challenges to Empty Head Games beyond those traditionally faced by developers worldwide, such as daily power outages, lack of technical equipment, very limited internet access (relying on public parks to connect to Wi-Fi networks), and the inability to access any form of international financing or promotion.</p>
<p>From the developer: "Starting in 2016 we only hoped this day would come but it’s here and Saviorless is finally seeing the light of day! We are beyond excited and are thankful to all our friends, colleagues, partners and every single one of our supporters who helped us get here. We cannot wait for players to experience the unique game that is Saviorless!" – said Josuhe H. Pagliery, Game Designer at Empty Head Games.</p>

      <title>Promise Mascot Agency is an open world mascot management crime drama</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay, so what the heck is this then? Kaizen Game Works (Paradise Killer) recently announced Promise Mascot Agency and the setting sounds absolutely bizarre.</p>
<p>Shown off during the ID@Xbox show it's what they're calling the "world's first and best open world mascot management crime drama". This is probably one of the most unique games I've seen for a while because of how it blends genres together like this. It also has a suitably weird trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nOcz48bQlzg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3e996ec9f26a621dbe245e613d05fa39.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nOcz48bQlzg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Michi, a disgraced yakuza lieutenant, is exiled to a cursed town to turn a bankrupt mascot agency into a profitable enterprise. As he struggles in his new life, can he manage to create a successful business and unravel the conspiracy behind his exile? He’s helped by Assistant Manager Pinky, who happens to be a mascot herself.</p>
<p>Players will explore their new home of Kaso-Machi in Michi’s run-down (but upgradable!) truck. There’s plenty to discover in this forgotten Japanese town - new friends to make, collectibles to find (and destroy), other businesses to partner with and, most importantly, a variety of mascots to recruit.</p>
<p>As we all know, mascots are living creatures that have coexisted with mankind since the dawn of history. Mascots have their own hopes, dreams and desires and you’ll need to negotiate to recruit them. Some mascots want money, some want fame, some want a rice ball from the local convenience store and some want to see the entire world burn to ashes in purifying hellfire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kaizen Game Works collaborated with well-known Japanese developer Ikumi Nakamura (The Evil Within, Ghostwire: Tokyo) and concept artist Mai Mattori on concept and art direction for Promise Mascot Agency. The pair helped Kaizen design and develop the world and characters, working together to create a unique Yakuza family, a repurposed love hotel and a cast of memorable, occasionally-horrific mascots! </p>
<p>To bring the concept art to life, Kaizen Game Works worked with Inko Ai Takita, a Japanese manga artist based in the UK who illustrated Promise Mascot Agency's band of freaks and weirdos in her signature manga style. </p>
<p>This looks like one I absolutely have to try. So hopefully it works well enough with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. It's not due out until 2025, and I've spoken to the developer about a key when they become available so hopefully I'll be able to take a look.</p>

      <title>Scribbly vicious action-RPG &#39;Death of a Wish&#39; releases for Linux on May 9th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer melessthanthree has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2302080/announcements/detail/4221637059934547058" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that Death of a Wish, their scribbly-art styled vicious hack-and-slash action-RPG, will be releasing a Linux version on May 9th.</p>
<p>More: "Death of a Wish is a vicious action-RPG where style is salvation.</p>
<p>Play as Christian as he unites with new comrades to challenge the cult that raised him. By taking down the four Sanctum Faiths: Father, Sister, Cardinal, and Priest, they will upend the order of the world.</p>
<p>Fight your way through a nightmare filled with horrifying monsters and terrifying people. Master brutal attacks and flashy combos as you struggle against the Corruption consuming you with style and grace. Shine your light in this surreal sea of darkness."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tleiqAL6PiI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/415764af57d758ccc338dfcdab4d7fde.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tleiqAL6PiI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Linux (and macOS) versions will be coming along with the Randomizer Update that adds in a new randomized game mode, great for those who complete it and want something more. This mode randomizes the enemy and item placements, and also gives you randomized starting equipment.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ENGAGE IN VICIOUSLY GRACEFUL COMBAT</strong> Unleash Christian’s cursed powers in a demanding and rewarding combat system. Be careful not to succumb to the ever-encroaching Corruption; achieve high ranks in combat and perform graceful combos to hold the Corruption at bay.</li>
<li><strong>CUSTOMIZE YOUR MARKED POWERS</strong> Rend your foes asunder with magical combos called Arias. Enhance your abilities with powerful Virtues that alter your approach to battle and the rhythm of combat. With a limitless array of ways to fight stylishly, build your character with passion to destroy your foes.</li>
<li><strong>DESCEND INTO THE NIGHTMARE</strong> In the dreamworld of Paradiso, repressed memories and unspeakable feelings come to life as the nightmarish city of Neo-Sanctum. Delve into the secret underworld of the esoteric and abandoned to meet new comrades who will aid you on your journey.</li>
<li><strong>SURREAL AND SPECTACULAR</strong> Christian’s world is rendered with a surreal aesthetic like no other. Harsh, pulsating scratches upon a sea of darkness render a thick atmosphere brooding with emotion. Battles come to life in an animated spectacle of light and motion that remains easy to parse in play.</li>
<li>For audio, Nicolo Telesca’s chilling score mixes electronic sounds with live instrumentation and complements the visuals by eliciting feelings of tense anxiety and electrifying catharsis.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>GTA 6 publisher Take-Two reportedly shutting Roll7 and Intercept Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, here's another blow for the gaming industry. It's being <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> that Take-Two Interactive are shutting down two studios.</p>
<p>Roll7 are known for Rollerdrome and the OlliOlli series, while Intercept Games were the team working on Kerbal Space Program 2 which is still in Early Access. Part of the info also comes from a <a href="https://esd.wa.gov/about-employees/WARN" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WARN</a> notice, showing Take-Two closing an unnamed studio affecting 70 people in Seattle, which is where Intercept Games are based.</p>
<p>It's worth <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-doubled-its-executives-pay-last-year" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting</a> at this point that Take-Two's CEO, Strauss Zelnick, was paid $42.1 million last year, which is more than two-and-a-half times the previous year. So once again, the people at the top are pulling in big numbers while cutting the people doing the work.</p>
<p>This is all part of a "cost reduction program" from the Grand Theft Auto publisher, who <a href="https://taketwointeractivesoftwareinc.gcs-web.com/node/30301/html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> last month their plan to reduce their staff by 5% along with cancelling various future titles. They expect to finish this cost-cutting by December this year, so expect more job losses to come yet.</p>
<p>For anyone curious on the future of Kerbal Space Program 2, Game Developer has <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-confirms-kerbal-space-program-2-is-safe-despite-seattle-layoffs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> it's going to continue to be supported via Private Division.</p>

      <title>Steam Survey for April 2024 shows a small dip for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now published the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey: April 2024, and overall the movements are pretty small but there is a small dip for Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For the operating system numbers April 2024 shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.76% +0.09%</li>
<li>Linux 1.90% -0.04%</li>
<li>macOS 1.35% -0.03%</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time via our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a> for Linux:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4152528461714641120gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4152528461714641120gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When you filter over to the Linux details, we can see the small dip for Steam Deck this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit (Steam Deck) 42.33% -1.89%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 8.24% +0.58%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS 64 bit 6.13% +0.59%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.01% +0.04%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.3 64 bit 4.39% +0.62%<img src="https://store.akamai.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif" style="height:1px; width:20px"/></li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.37% -0.05%</li>
<li>Other 29.53% +0.12%</li>
</ul>
<p>This also shows on the GPU details with the AMD AMD Custom GPU 0405 (Steam Deck) seeing -2.77%. Overall though, the Steam Deck with SteamOS is still the most used system in for Linux gaming on Steam.</p>

      <title>Bye Sweet Carole blends horror with what looks like classic Disney movies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I've no idea how I missed Bye Sweet Carole being announced a good while ago, but maybe you did too and it deserves a look because it honestly looks pretty incredible. Created by Chris Darril of the Remothered series it looks like it really does blend classic Disney movies, with a more mature horror theme.</p>
<p>The reveal trailer from last year:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KSd5hbRGYR4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/43147d8070260f3c3bd28785980fb945.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KSd5hbRGYR4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Set in the early 1900s, in an age where the phenomenon of the feminist political movement begins to shake the British nation, young Lana Benton, guest of the eerie Bunny Hall orphanage, is the only one to suspect that her best friend Carole didn’t just run away. The secret correspondence between Carole and a mysterious “French” pushes Lana to investigate enough to find herself surviving, poised between the real world and the fantastic kingdom of Corolla that, under the cruel influence of the terrifying Mr.Kyn, the insensitive owl Velenia, and the ravenous colonies of tar bunnies, is inexorably perishing."</p>
<p>And then for some very early gameplay shown during Gamescom 2023:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YuM4LqSR_5A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7e3d5f49312c73dde393801a4a221cd3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YuM4LqSR_5A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Embark on a horrific journey through a dark tale set in the austere Bunny Hall and the mesmerizing world of Corolla.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a hand-drawn universe brought to life using cinematographic techniques inspired by the greatest animated movies.</li>
<li>Shape-shift into a rabbit and harness your various forms to conquer the deadly challenges that await you.</li>
<li>Encounter a vibrant cast of characters, from your loyal friend Mr. Baesie to the malevolent owl Velenia and the terrifying Mr. Kyn.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Right onto the wishlist it goes. Can't wait to give this one a run through. It releases later this year.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2428980/Bye_Sweet_Carole/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. No doubt it will work well with Proton on Linux.</p>

      <title>Palworld is bringing in fun new Pals for you to put to work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pocketpair's absolute smash-hit Early Access game Palworld is set to expanding, with some new Pals being teased that will be coming sometime this Summer.</p>
<p>This is a further tease on what the developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/palworld-is-getting-a-major-content-update-this-summer-plus-a-pvp-arena-mode-later/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously announced</a> recently for the big Summer update that will bring in a whole bunch of new content, including a new island and eventually a PvP mode too. Now we're getting our first glimpse at some of what to expect.</p>
<p>We're going to see a frog with a stick, some sort of ostrich, a dog with long ears and a cute little dino-like creature with a silly-looking mushroom on its head. Do any look like Pokemon? That's been an ongoing complaint about Palworld's design since even before release. <em>I don't know </em>but<em> </em>they look fun though. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RrrRs7-gpzg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0552d51c271e020e464ecd4965f4664e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RrrRs7-gpzg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Palworld is rated Steam Deck Playable and works great on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palworld on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors gets a AAAA update with functional doors, a train and rail kart racing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Poking a bit of fun at Ubisoft for calling Skull and Bones "AAAA", poncle have released a fresh free update to Vampire Survivors with the AAAA Laborratory update.</p>
<p>That's right your favourite and the original survivor-like that spawned a great many clones is back to suck you in for many more hours. Yes, they did also spell it with the double r, it's the Laborratory update. The trailer is a real treat too poking fun at big publishers (and themselves) about "hyper realistic" characters, "immersive door opening action", trains and my favourite "fully rendered running animations". Oh there's also some go-karting on tracks because why not right?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Tgn_XyvtOro"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/80513b6415c0735e425870ef88f1d7be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Tgn_XyvtOro" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New content:</p>
<ul>
<li>7 new EXTRA achievements.</li>
<li>1 new challenge stage.</li>
<li>1 new bonus stage.</li>
<li>1 new character.</li>
<li>1 new weapon with its evolution.</li>
<li>1 new passive weapon.</li>
<li>1 new power-up, Seal III.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also said in the release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/4104540932629694732" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> that work for co-op online play support is going well, but it's too early for them to go into details on it. More Adventures are planned too, but for now they're working on something secret for the base game before coming back to releasing more.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors is Steam Deck Verified and also has a (unadvertised) Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>The huge life-sim Life by You from Paradox hits Early Access on June 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What could potentially be a The Sims killer, Paradox Interactive plan to finally launch Life by You into Early Access on June 4th after multiple delays.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Paradox didn't have another trailer ready for this new release date announcement. However, the team at Paradox Tectonic, which is led by Rod Humble formerly of Electronic Arts have been putting up regular development update videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lifebyyou/videos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a> going over various features. A few of the videos include partnering up with popular YouTuber FakeGamerGirl like this one going through some gameplay:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wXnAL_642Gc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55e96b088a81c954ba0b74c64085a7e2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wXnAL_642Gc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It definitely looks very much like The Sims, only clearly a bit rougher around the edges.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play in an open world: Live life with no loading screens. Strike up real-language conversations. Drive or bike to the countryside. Discover and complete quests to unlock new experiences.</li>
<li>Tell stories through conversations: Every real-language conversation is generated based on your human’s unique situation. You can even craft your own conversations in-game.</li>
<li>Expand your creativity: Make your own in-game content through mods. Utilize a variety of deep Creator Tools. Change the gameplay anytime. Life is yours to make -and break.</li>
<li>Take direct control: Drag and drop your humans into their place - or drive them directly in third-person mode. Live the life of one or tell the stories of many. Climb a career ladder. Fall in love. Raise a family.</li>
<li>Design your own world: Build your humans’ dream homes or businesses from scratch. Furnish them from top to bottom, inside to outside. Drag, demolish, and rearrange entire towns.</li>
<li>Create fully customized humans: Design your families in the Human Creator, including deep personality and character traits. Style and restyle your humans at any time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358660/Life_by_You/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be taking a look at it when it releases? Hopefully it will work well with Proton outside of the usual expected bugs from an Early Access game. </p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jackbox Games are finally doing a special little pack of games just for adults with the teased Jackbox Naughty Pack. This will be the first time the Jackbox team have designed a set of party games for a mature audience.</p>
<p>There's not a whole lot of details on it yet and the press release was also light on info:</p>
<p>"Responding to overwhelming demand from fans in customer feedback surveys, Jackbox Games has curated a selection of adult-themed experiences that promise to deliver on laughter, wit, and a touch of irreverence.

      <title>NVIDIA 550.78 released fixing issues for RTX 4xxx series GPUs notebooks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Towards the end of April, NVIDIA released the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/224458/en-uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.78</a> driver and if you use a notebook with a RTX 4xxx series GPU you may want to update for this one.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> the exciting release we're all waiting for that adds in Explicit Sync support, as last we heard that should be due <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland/pull/104#issuecomment-2010292221" rel="noopener" target="_blank">around</a> May 15th with the new 555 Beta series.</p>
<p>For this release the one-liner is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression that led to Xid errors when loading the NVIDIA driver on some notebook systems with RTX 4xxx series GPUs. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a notebook that had this issue on Linux? Did this driver fix it? Let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>There was also another earlier driver update I missed with version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/224033/en-uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.76</a> from April 16th:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could prevent the driver from initializing on some systems running RHEL 9.3.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Albion Online now officially launched in Europe and MENA regions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Albion Online the MMO from Sandbox Interactive has now formally opened the gates for Europe and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) with their brand new server.</p>
<p>This will give players in those regions "substantially improved ping" the developers say, along with a fresh start for everyone playing on them. This is the third server introduced to the game alongside Albion Americas and Albion Asia, although the new one does have certain initial <a href="https://forum.albiononline.com/index.php/Thread/195377-Europe-Server-World-Size-Starting-Conditions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restrictions</a> for now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/946867521714391172gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/946867521714391172gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Albion Online is a sandbox MMORPG featuring full-loot combat, a fully player-driven economy, and a classless "you are what you wear" skill system. The game is fully cross-platform, playable across Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android with a single account.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">Launch trailer:</span></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xPyw4nZlGNA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5c0f8d0b8462c922b7f4029e8b2d9ae3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xPyw4nZlGNA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New Server Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new and untouched version of the game, where all players start as equals and can claim their own piece of Albion.</li>
<li>A game world that is fully separate and independent from the existing US and Asia servers.</li>
<li>Greatly improved connection speeds and ping for the whole Europe and MENA region.</li>
<li>Timings of game and server events (territory battles, Crystal League, Faction Warfare, maintenance, etc.) that are optimized for the region.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The event timing is a big one. For players in Europe / UK the timings on events in this and other games always being Americanised gets quite <em>annoying</em>. So now you'll be able to do them on your own time, which is probably the most exciting thing about this.</p>
<p>Albion Online has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Play via their <a href="https://albiononline.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/761890/Albion_Online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The big hit medieval strategy game Manor Lords works well on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Manor Lords is currently another 2024 release smashing through the charts on Steam! Coming from developer Slavic Magic and publisher Hooded Horse, it's certainly impressive. <em>Note: personal purchase, but publisher did send a key that I missed - woops.</em></p>
<p>A game that blends together a medieval city-builder with a full RTS game where you try to take over neighbouring lands, it's a really interesting mix that will suck away a lot of your time.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this Early Access release already works rather well on Desktop Linux thanks to Proton. I've been testing it with Proton 9, and apart from the pop-over tutorial videos being <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9806438631714388874gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blank</a>, it's been smooth-sailing. That is the <em>only</em> Linux-specific issue I've encountered with it so far as all other issues seem to be present on Windows too from reports I've seen on Steam.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S7MnkE_qxj8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7af371e922bbbfe16fb72682688d6e43.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S7MnkE_qxj8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Testing on my main desktop system with Proton 9 (Beta): Kubuntu Linux 23.10, AMD Ryzen 5800X, Radeon RX 6800 XT with Mesa 24.0.6 at a 2560x1440 resolution with the settings cranked up to the maximum (with FSR on Quality) it has been performing really well above 100FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6657768281714388872gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6657768281714388872gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm going to be spending a lot more time with this one as so far I am thoroughly captured by the setting, the mechanics, the visuals and pretty much everything about it. There's certain rough edges though of course, with it being Early Access (where the dev estimates another year to finish it) but fantastic so far. It can be quite a challenge too, especially with how construction depends on having Oxen, if you're dumb (like me) and allow them to all run away early on, you're pretty much screwed. There's no doubt going to be plenty of tweaks to the balancing on that, but I gather it's not supposed to exactly be easy and you will learn from your mistakes as I did.</p>
<p>What blows my mind is that Manor Lords is mostly the work of solo developer Greg Styczeń. It goes to show what small teams can accomplish. Publisher Hooded Horse <a href="https://twitter.com/HoodedHorseInc/status/1784333658297626810" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on X (formerly Twitter) that Manor Lords has already sold over 1 million copies in only about a day. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since yesterday's launch Manor Lords has already sold over 1 million copies &amp; hit a peak Steam concurrent player count of 170k - highest ever for a city builder (or for other different genres like GSG/4x/colony sim).</p>

      <title>Zink driver startup time squashed with new patches</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Mike Blumenkrantz is once again blogging about working on the Zink driver, and this time a nice optimization is on the way for startup times.</p>
<p>As a brief refresher on Zink from the Mesa documentation: "The Zink driver is a Gallium driver that emits Vulkan API calls instead of targeting a specific GPU architecture. This can be used to get full desktop OpenGL support on devices that only support Vulkan.".</p>
<p>One problem that has been encountered recently was slow startup times, specifically some testing has been done against a GTK4 demo. In <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/startup/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the blog post</a>, Blumenkrantz notes how on the Iris driver (Intel) the average startup time for the gtk4-demo was "between 190-200ms" but on Zink it was between "350-370ms".</p>
<p>After profiling and getting some <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/28955" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patches</a> made to move more of the work into more threads, they've been able to reduce the startup time to an average of around "average of 260-280ms, a 25% improvement". Nice.</p>
<p>This isn't the end though, Blumenkrantz said investigation is ongoing and hopefully they will get it closer to the startup times on Iris.</p>
<p>Overall it might not sound like a huge amount when talking milliseconds, but every bit counts and getting apps and games to startup quickly is obviously a nice improvement overall.</p>

      <title>VR game Alien: Rogue Incursion releases late 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh damn, this is quite exciting as an Alien fan and might be a reason to pop my VR headset back on again. Alien: Rogue Incursion is coming sometime in late 2024. I only hope that Valve can keep improving SteamVR on Linux, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/steamvr-beta-linux-fixes-plus-beta-updates-for-desktop-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we had some fixes for recently</a>.</p>
<p>Coming from Survios, an industry-leading virtual reality studio, in collaboration with 20th Century Games, they said it will be releasing "Holiday 2024" so it's most likely around December.</p>
<p>It has only just been announced so details are still quite light and their announcement video didn't actually show anything:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uaYbugGRV3c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95e1d6c3e583ae21d0a1c64104b611ae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uaYbugGRV3c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the press release:</p>
<p><em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em> fully immerses players in a harrowing VR journey deep into the <em>Alien</em> universe with an all-new storyline of an ultimate mission that tests their courage, wits, and skill to survive the terrors of the “Perfect Organism.”</p>
<p>“Our team at Survios are huge fans of <em>Alien</em> and have been building <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em> for a long time, honing our ability to pair the most technically advanced, immersive, and engaging VR experiences with best-in-class franchises,” said <strong>TQ Jefferson, Chief Product Officer </strong>at <strong>Survios</strong>. “This fully original story embraces all our favorite elements from 45 years of <em>Alien</em>, from kinetic action and heart-pounding exploration to our terrifyingly resourceful Xenomorphs that will truly make your skin crawl. We can’t wait for fans to get their hands on it this holiday season.”</p>
<p>Look, if this is even remotely anything like Alien: Isolation, I'm already sold. Terrifying.</p>

      <title>Bazzite 3.0 out now with Steam Deck OLED support nearly ready</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite 3.0 has been released with the internals upgraded to Fedora 40, which brings with it numerous improvements for gamers looking to get Linux on their PC or handheld gaming device like a Steam Deck or ROG Ally.</p>
<p><em>A great alternative to SteamOS, which is still exclusive to the Steam Deck from Valve.</em></p>
<p>For Steam Deck OLED support they said it's ready to the point that "it should be mostly functional", however there's at least one major issue left which "has to do with audio crashing when switching to Desktop Mode" and some other issues related to HDR support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5866340771714380987gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive gets upgraded to Godot 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game engine upgrade across a major version is quite a big thing, and it initially proved a little problematic for the open source evolution sim Thrive but it is done.</p>
<p>What is Thrive? In Thrive, you take control of an organism on an alien planet, beginning with the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA). Your goal is to survive in the environment, adapt your species by adding mutations, and thrive. Other species will emerge to compete with yours. They will evolve via a population dynamics driven simulation with random mutations - you must improve and spread your species to surpass them. The success of your species depends both on your skill in surviving as an individual cell and the changes you make in the editor.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-41-godot-4-is-here/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the developers mentioned for this update it was "pretty painful to upgrade to" Godot 4, but the improvements should be worth it for improved performance and Godot's new Vulkan renderer and this was all "necessary for the long-term future of Thrive as the game". One of the actual visual changes I'm happy to see in this release is cells no longer just flashing when eating, thanks to some additional shader magic you'll see the food getting engulfed.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="45Fy6j_gNx4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f889d4f330ff15cf3116f8bcd5bb8f97.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/45Fy6j_gNx4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated to Godot 4.2.2 (we were previously on 3.5 so this is a massive upgrade).</li>
<li>Updated to .NET 8 runtime and C# 12 as it turns out this can be used with Godot 4.</li>
<li>New engulf animation that creates wave lines instead of the old just flashing blue animation.</li>
<li>Oxygen now has different levels in different patches which affects the utility of certain parts a ton.</li>
<li>There's now a native library variant that doesn't require AVX, this should make Thrive playable again on some older CPUs.</li>
<li>Arabic fallback font had to be removed as it caused buggy line heights in all text in Godot 4.</li>
<li>Osmoregulation cost values are now shown in red as it is a negative property.</li>
<li>Engulfment storage full tutorial now has an end trigger once the player has digested enough things.</li>
<li>Fixed new player species name not immediately applying after exiting the editor.</li>
<li>Fixed new cell button crashing multicellular freebuild editor.</li>
<li>Fixed data cache disposed errors that only seemed to trigger in exported version of the game.</li>
<li>Fixed no changes in editor tutorial being able to prevent multicellular editor exit.</li>
<li>Memory usage metrics now works on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed CPU check only checking AVX and not AVX 2 which was then used anyway causing a crash on CPUs that have AVX but not AVX2.</li>
<li>Switched the AVX feature check to use standard C# function, which is hopefully more accurate than the previous approach that we got reports about false negatives.</li>
<li>Tweaked wording on the fallback opengl renderer use and disabled the 3D backgrounds again for that as they still aren't fully correct.</li>
<li>Updated our colour picker customizations for Godot 4 (pick from game window seems to not work currently on Linux).</li>
<li>Removed our custom checkbox implementation now that Godot's has all the needed features.</li>
<li>Switched from the previously used tar compression library to C# standard one which shouldn't have any save corruption issues (due to this we were stuck on an old version of the compression library).</li>
<li>Added check to tools against omitting part of a version number this removes potential for a mistake that almost was in 0.6.5.</li>
<li>Added simple C#-code-only unit tests for a few things.</li>
<li>Converted some things to use direct references instead of NodePaths.</li>
<li>There's now a nix flake for Thrive developers.</li>
<li>Updated our documentation impacted by the upgrade to Godot 4.</li>
<li>Updated Jolt physics engine to newest version.</li>
<li>Updated YamlDotNet from 15.1.1 to 15.1.2.</li>
<li>Updated AngleSharp from 1.1.0 to 1.1.2.</li>
<li>Updated code checking tools version.</li>
<li>Updated translations.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Golf With Your Friends adds a hilarious new Speed Golf mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grab your friends and play something resembling Golf in the latest free update to Golf With Your Friends, which adds in a new rather funny looking Speed Golf mode. </p>
<p>The idea here is to forget about par and the number of shots taken, it's all about how fast you are. It's a furious race to putt your ball before everyone else and score points based on how quickly you can do this. To help with this it brings in a new handbrake feature, letting you slow your ball down at specific moments to set up for another quick shot. And like something out of Sonic or Mario Kart, there's special speed gates to give you a boost.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ohy2xwlmg4o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eee1c33c59657a7bfc78cba198fd49f6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ohy2xwlmg4o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Speed is king in the brand new Speed Golf mode! Take your positions on the starting line and race to the hole to claim first place. Speed Golf is available to play online or offline on any course, including all workshop content! Speed Golf can even be experienced in teams play for an all new team racing experience.</li>
<li>New game setting options are now available for Speed Golf players. Race to the hole in an anything goes ruleset where only time matters, or add time penalties for every stroke taken to reward both speed and accuracy.</li>
<li>All courses have been turbo charged with brand new Turbo Charge Boosters! Passing through boosters allow you to reach speeds and take routes never before possible.</li>
<li>Turbo Charge Boosters are also now available to use in the Level Editor in order to turbo charge your own creations!</li>
<li>Sometimes slowing down is the best way to speed up. The new handbrake feature allows you to slow your roll, opening up new ways for you to save yourself valuable seconds, or you know, just save yourself.</li>
<li>The brand new “Critical Hit” pack (DLC) is now available featuring 10 new cosmetic items based on the spoils of a particularly fruitful party’s campaign. This pack includes 4 Hats, 2 Floaties, 2 Trails and 2 Stickers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamVR Beta gets Linux fixes, plus Beta updates for Desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Three sets of Steam Beta updates this weekend across SteamVR, Desktop and Steam Deck so here's all the details for you in one place.</p>
<p>Firstly, the SteamVR Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/4207000995142471429" rel="noopener" target="_blank">v2.5.3</a> comes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Link:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix an issue with video encoder initialization on certain AMD integrated GPUs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved launch scripts and log capture for bug reports.</li>
<li>Fixed uninitialized memory in right eye.</li>
<li>Fixed SteamVR Home launch script.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really nice to see some VR fixes for Linux, which is pretty much always in a rough state.</p>
<p>There's one Steam Deck specific adjustment in the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4202497395516169013" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta</a> which is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Settings-&gt;Storage will now display drives that are missing a steam library as format targets.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And all these <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4173223997929872639?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changes</a> below affect both Steam Deck and Desktop:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Big Picture</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where after playing a game it would require extra B button presses to back out of the game's library page.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the store tab would fail to display any content after maximizing the steam window.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>New Configurator feature "Swap Left with Right": While editing a Controller Configuration, you can Swap the behavior of the Left Stick and the Right Stick, or Left Trackpad and Right Trackpad etc. Highlight the source you want to swap in the "Edit Layout" page, and the "Y" button should appear to allow the swap. This should be handy for "South Paws".</li>
<li>New Mouse Action: "Turn to Face Direction". When activating this, the camera will turn to face the direction you are pushing on the Left Stick (default - Track pads, DPads and Buttons can also be used). Can be combined with "Reset to Horizon" to produce a behavior similar to Splatoon's camera reset button. Note: Dots per 360 must be calibrated for this to be accurate.</li>
<li>New Mouse Action: "Dots per 360 Calibration". By default this will generate 360 degrees of rotation. You can use this to tune the Dots per 360 value in the Flick Stick / Gyro To Mouse modes.</li>
<li>Gyro to Joystick modes now no longer generate haptic events when outside the active range.</li>
</ul>
