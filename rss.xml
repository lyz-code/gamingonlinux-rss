      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to fix Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released a fresh update to the special Proton Hotfix version. This fixes up issues on Steam Deck / Linux across Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you're confused on all the different Proton versions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see my guide for more info</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said across two posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix has been deployed to address the crash on startup with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the latest update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix has been deployed earlier today to address the intermittent stutter issue with Marvel Rivals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see that Valve can get moving so quickly on issues in popular games. Hopefully with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS rolling out to more devices</a> we'll see developers test their updates more often instead of things getting broken like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/875175781740230253gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Marvel Rivals</em></p>
<p>If you have any Proton compatibility manually selected for them in the Properties on Steam, you can just unselect them to let Proton Hotfix be picked up for them automatically which Valve have now set as the default for both games.</p>
<p>Want to know how to change Proton versions? I also have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a guide available for that</a>.</p>

      <title>Among Us 3D announced supporting cross-play with Among Us VR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's not compatible with the original 2D game, the announcement of Among Us 3D is quite exciting bridging the worlds of traditional 3D and VR together for the popular social deduction game. A demo will be available during Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>At release players in Among Us 3D will be able to play with those across  Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO. The VR version is actually going to get a rebrand to just Among Us 3D along with bringing a new in-game currency to expand the customization options and support ongoing expansions to the content.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UYMaaMTgxa4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/727de1ac106366beca092f5db3075c54.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UYMaaMTgxa4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Native Proximity Voice Chat — Yap with your friends directly in-game. No need for additional third-party platforms! </li>
<li>New and Returning Minigames —  Experience the tasks you know and love, along with some new ones. Now, with first-person controls.</li>
<li>Crossplay Functionality — Join lobbies with other VR players! (Note: The game is NOT compatible with the original Among Us game. Sorry, beans.) </li>
<li>Customize Your Beansona — Expand your wardrobe of hats, gloves, and skins with an endless number of cosmetic customization combinations!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press release:</p>
<p>"With Among Us 3D, we're excited to bring the first-person perspective to an even wider audience," said Ryan Hall, Project Director at Schell Games. "By uniting VR and PC players, we’re opening up even more ways to brutally betray your friends—your whole crew can get in on the fun!"</p>
<p>"The launch of Among Us VR gave players the chance to step inside the game, bringing an entirely new level of suspense and hilarity to the social deduction experience,” said Victoria Tran, Community Director at Innersloth. “This crossplay feature strengthens our amazing community, making it easier than ever for players to team up—or backstab each other—regardless of their platform."</p>

      <title>What to claim from Prime Gaming, February 21st edition - plenty for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for February 21st, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon's previous VP of Prime Gaming said they "tried everything" to disrupt Steam</a>.</em></p>

Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Playstation 2 Emulator PCSX2 enables Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who enjoy seeing improvements for emulation on Linux, and for Wayland support - the Playstation 2 Emulator PCSX2 has now enabled support for it by default.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/ps2-emulator-emulator-pcsx2-should-get-wayland-support-in-the-coming-months/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared the news</a> that they were working towards it, after previously stopping it being the default due to lots of issues. With the latest code that's been <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/12333" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merged</a>, it is now enabled by default for an upcoming release.</p>
<p>They have also filed a <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-133919" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug</a> with upstream Qt "Wayland rendering bug when using native windows on GNOME/Weston". Hopefully that will also be solved in a future Qt release.</p>
<p>Great for continued game preservation on modern Linux. You can see more about the emulator on the <a href="https://pcsx2.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>Playtron GameOS Alpha 3 brings the &#39;GameLAB&#39; tool for game configuration and remote management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playtron, the company attempting to build a Linux gaming distribution to take on Valve, Microsoft and others have released GameOS Alpha 3 with a bunch of new features. This includes a new fancy open source tool named GameLAB.<em> It was originally called PlaytronOS but they've now settled on calling it GameOS.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder: the idea of PlayTron's GameOS is to bring a Linux-powered system that runs games from Epic Games Store, GOG.com, Steam and more directly out of the box. </p>
<p>The major changes in Alpha 3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New &amp; Updated Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>GameLAB
	<ul>
<li>A new program for Linux, macOS, and Windows</li>
<li>Remotely manage a Playtron device for power users</li>
<li>Configure and submit custom launch configurations</li>
<li>Configure and submit custom controller input configurations</li>
<li>Requires Playtron GameOS Alpha 3 or newer on the remote Playtron device</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Steam support
	<ul>
<li>Full Cloud Saves support</li>
<li>More reliable game downloads</li>
<li>Faster and more reliable steam game launching</li>
<li>More reliable offline support for Steam</li>
<li>QR code login using the Steam app on Android or iOS</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Touchscreen support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-Steam Deck touchscreen controls are not completely supported</li>
<li>Progress bar does not work when updating</li>
<li>ASUS ROG Ally is not receiving inputs from the touchscreen</li>
<li>Some Steam games fail to download at 100% progress with error code 57</li>
<li>Sometimes Playtron GameOS will boot into a black screen when using slow storage media</li>
<li>Steam Cloud Saves can get corrupted</li>
<li>Steam Cloud Saves have no conflict resolution</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking over email, Luke Short, Director of Linux Engineering at Playtron gave a little more detail about this new <a href="https://github.com/playtron-os/gamelab" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GameLAB</a> tool and their plans for it. Luke Short said it "revolves around community submissions" and that it's "similar to Lutris in how you can create custom installation scripts". In the short-term they want to get their fixes put back into protonfixes, so GE-Proton and the like can benefit from it directly. Long-term they want to "make all of our fixes easily accessible to everyone. Possibly with a conversion tool between different providers (protonfixes, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, Phoenicis, etc.)".</p>
<p>The only device currently planned to ship with it is the weird crypto device <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SuiPlay0x1</a>, but there's hints that something else may be on the table soon. I'll be keeping an eye on it.</p>

      <title>My favourite comedy dungeon crawler Lucky Tower Ultimate just got a big content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The update simply called "Content" brings a whole lot of extras to Lucky Tower Ultimate, my current favourite dungeon crawler that keeps on making me laugh.</p>
<p>It's a truly silly game that will keep you coming back for more. It's equal parts frustrating as it is funny though, like any good dungeon crawler it can be a challenge but it's all the stupid interactions that really sell it. There's so many surprising things that can happen and they just keep expanding on it. It's Steam Deck Verified (and does work great) and works just fine on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8883893751740139064gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Update 2: Content was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1700270/view/497187708384314044" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> Wednesday, adding in various content from community votes including these major additions to the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The Pipefitter</h3>
A team of industrious sisters in the village that let you carry more tower items outside. Once you help build an elaborate chute system, you will have a slot in each segment of the tower that you can use for one item. That item will be transported to the next segment in the current run. Once the item is outside, it can be bought in the village at the pipefitter.<br/>
<h3>The Bard</h3>
You’ll meet a Bard in the village who needs new instruments to impress the townsfolk… who currently hate their music. Fascinated with the musical wonders that you carried outside, the Bard will enter the tower once you’ve fulfilled their quest (to disastrous results). You will then be able to loot their corpse in the tower, which will be located in a random place every run. The corpse contains a new instrument and other useful items.<br/>
<h3>Snowy &amp; Puffles</h3>
This trap is inspired by one from the original Lucky Tower web game. At the end of a room, you’ll discover three doors with names above them. When you choose one of them and enter a small chamber, the door closes behind you and you’ll face whatever is in it. It might be a harmless snail, a peasant companion, or a tough enemy. You can deduce the room’s contents by the name above the door, which will be combined from a pool of possibilities.<br/>
<h3>The Pipes</h3>
The tower's sewer system becomes all the more visible with this trap. Unfortunately, the tower has such horrible plumbing that, from time to time, these pipes shake and…<br/>
1. Unleash a poisonous cloud into the air<br/>
2. There's also a chance they are clogged by slime, which will drop from the pipes instead<br/>
3. Or they do nothing (lucky you)<br/>
<h3>Bear Trap + Rake</h3>
<p>What's more slapstick than a rake handle to the face or a bear trap? These will be placed randomly in rooms just like mouse traps, but both have their own little twist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll also get over 270 new voice lines, new unique rooms, new items to find, new architecture to see all over the tower, you can buy a beard from The Barber, new achievements and so on. It really is a big update to the game, and I've had a blast again attempting to run through to spot some of the new stuff. Really great game to relax with.</p>
<p>One not to sit on, a seriously easy recommendation to pick up.</p>

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle gets DLSS 4 and FSR 3.1 but breaks on Steam Deck / Linux with Mesa</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle just got a major update with some fancy new features, but it seems like it's now broken on Linux with AMD GPUs using Mesa like Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Reports have begun appearing on Valve's Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8292" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> report tracker, with a Mesa RADV driver <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/12652" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> now open, but Valve developer Samuel Pitoiset mentioned "This is indeed a game bug, it passes through a pNext chain loop for the physical device creation..." and so it seems the game itself may need to be fixed this time before it will work again.</p>
<p>Going by reports it still works on NVIDA GPUs on Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6751200331740136452gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/502817574909640811" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch</a> contents it added NVIDIA DLSS 4, AMD FSR 3.1 with Frame Generation, Intel XESS 1.4 and support for Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. Plus numerous game bug fixes.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see a resolution for Linux systems soon. Would be good to see since AMD FSR 3.1 could make it perform a fair bit better on the likes of the Steam Deck. Especially since Valve fixed the graphical bug with characters eyes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steam-deck-steamos-3-6-21-released-fixing-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-eyes-and-security-bugs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a recent SteamOS update</a>.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Surprisingly, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has been given the Steam Deck Verified checkmark by Valve, after the latest patch was released with more updates planned. Valve verified it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">A third patch was released today with various improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Release Notes (1.218.0.0)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated NVIDIA Streamline SDK to version 2.7.2.</li>
<li>Fixes for various visual bugs in cinematics on ultra-wide monitors.</li>
<li>Various visual bug fixes related to reflections.</li>
<li>Various visual bug fixes related to ray-traced shadows.</li>
<li>Various fixes for low quality texture assets.</li>
<li>Various user interface bug fixes and improvements</li>
<li>When opening the Suits menu, the list will now always scroll to the selected suit.</li>
<li>'Pull' Quick Time Events now work when Space or Left Mouse Button are assigned to Jump or Dodge.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during 'Graffiti in Trouble' with text language set to Spanish.</li>
<li>Various stability improvements and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/eventcomments/597393274090583972?snr=2_9_100015_#c597393274090584835" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a Steam post that they are "actively working on more updates with additional bug fixes and performance optimizations".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21170869761740071679gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've yet to play it myself, so I can't comment on if it deserves the rating or not. However, I've seen a lot of talk about it across social media, with the initial release being full of issues across Desktop and Steam Deck but it seems like these first few patches have really cleaned it up. At least from various recent reports I've seen it can <em>mostly</em> stay around 30FPS, which is generally the floor Valve go for with Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Have you played it on Deck? Let me know if you agree with the rating in the comments, especially after this latest patch.</p>

      <title>A year later, Palworld hits 32m players while continuing to fight off Nintendo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a little bit over a year now since Palworld arrived in Early Access, with developer Pocketpair announcing how well it's done along with another patch out now. ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-developer-pocketpair-launches-pocketpair-publishing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pocketpair recently launched Pocketpair Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/en-palworld.pocketpair.jp/post/3lijyufslqk25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> the Palworld account revealed "It's been a year since Palworld was released, and thanks to you our fans, Palworld has surpassed over 32 million players across all platforms! (Steam, Xbox, PS5)". A truly incredible number but not particularly surprising given all the attention on it, especially with the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo / The Pokémon Company.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13809198951740057969gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Palworld version v0.4.15 was also just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/496061541789991031" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a>:</p>

・Fixed several Xbox and SteamDeck crashes.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
▼Balance Adjustments<br/>
・Adjusted the elemental chest rewards. They are now guaranteed to drop Dog Coins and also have a low chance of dropping work suitability books too.<br/>
<br/>
▼Network<br/>
・Added measures to address the player rubberbanding issues in multiplayer.<br/>
<br/>
▼Optimization<br/>
・Optimized save data file sizes.<br/>
<br/>
▼Bug Fixes<br/>

・Fixed an issue where some naturally occurring map objects, such as mushrooms, were not spawning after being destroyed by player construction<br/>
・Fixed an issue where neutral NPCs spawned in random events would not become criminal when attacked<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals would not work if summoned too close to a tree<br/>
・Fixed an issue where NPCs would sometimes shake when firing their guns<br/>
・Fixed minor bugs such as texture issues<br/>
・Fixed an issue where anti-aircraft missile launchers would occasionally respawn<br/>
・Fixed an issue where some buildings would not align properly<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals would not enter caves<br/>
<br/>
==<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your continued support of Palworld<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
The following changes in the v0.4.15 patch were not applied correctly and accidentally left out of the patch:<br/>
<br/>
・Adjusted the elemental chest rewards. They are now guaranteed to drop Dog Coins and also have a low chance of dropping work suitability books too.<br/>
<br/>
We're currently working to correct the issue.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your continued support of Palworld.</p>

<p>Whatever happens with the lawsuit, it's going to be one for the history books given how Nintendo's patents cover a fair amount of features that quite a number of other games either use or use something very similar. Pocketpair <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/palworld-dev-details-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously gave more info</a> on some of the patents involved. Nintendo also continue to fight for getting more patents approved in the US, so this lawsuit <em>could</em> eventually go multi-national.</p>

      <title>Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming thinks generative AI will help game preservation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft recently announced Muse, "a generative AI model of a video game that can generate game visuals, controller actions, or both". And somehow, Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming thinks it will help game preservation.</p>
<p>Speaking in a video that has been set as unlisted (hidden) on YouTube, but included in their Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming goes off talking about how this somehow might magically help game preservation. No, I don't know how it would either, that's not how it works. Getting a generative AI to hallucinate games is not really preserving anything.</p>
<p>Anyway here's what Spencer said: "I'll tell you one of the things that I get excited about. You know, one of the things we care a lot about at Xbox is game preservation. And I think about an opportunity to have models learn about older games, games that were maybe tied to unique pieces of hardware where that engine on that hardware, is kind of time will erode the amount of hardware that's out there that can actually play a game. But you can imagine a world where from gameplay data and video, that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run."</p>
<p>Continuing Spencer said: "We've talked about game preservation as an activity for us. These models and their ability to learn completely how a game plays, without the necessity of the original engine running on the original hardware opens up a ton of opportunity."</p>
<p>The video can be viewed below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c15vxDHJ2lU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7667ea3ae23bbd1c1f888efa1d2c012c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c15vxDHJ2lU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At some point, this whole "AI everything" thing will come crashing down. But until then, we will see more and more executives dreaming up things that won't happen. Game preservation is absolutely vital, and there's so many ways to do it correctly, but getting an AI to dream one up that it thinks is accurate is definitely not it.</p>
<p>You can also read more about Muse in the Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>.</p>

      <title>The OBS Studio versus Fedora drama seems to have calmed down - no more legal threats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/fedora-threatened-with-legal-action-from-obs-studio-due-to-their-flatpak-packaging/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recently I highlighted a fight</a> that had broken out between the OBS Studio team and the Fedora Linux developers. The issue was centred around the Fedora Flatpak of OBS Studio but it seems to have calmed down now.</p>
<p>Things got pretty messy with the legal threat from the OBS Studio team, but thankfully it appears to be mostly solved down thanks to the two camps coming together to discuss it properly.</p>
<p>OBS Studio team member Joel Bethke <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/sigs/flatpak/fedora-flatpaks/-/issues/39#note_2354562186" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> in the ticket on GitLab:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an update to everyone following, I had a meeting today with the Flatpak SIG and Fedora Project Leader, which was a very good conversation. We discussed the issues, how we got here, and what next steps are. For anyone not interested in the specific details, the OBS Project is no longer requesting a removal of IP or rebrand of the OBS Studio application provided by Fedora Flatpaks.</p>
<p>This issue should be used for tracking of the other specific, technical issues, that the Fedora Flatpak does still have, which I will address below.</p>
<p>From our perspective, there were two key points that we feel are the most important to address:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issue with the Qt runtime having regression</li>
<li>The issue of not knowing where to report bugs for what is a downstream package</li>
</ul>
<p>For the first bullet, this should be resolved with the update to the latest runtime, which includes Qt 6.8.2 that has the fixes for those regressions in it.</p>
<p>For the second, this is obviously a much larger issue to tackle, especially for a project as large as Fedora. We had some very good discussion on how this might be accomplished in the medium-long term, but don't consider it a blocker at this point. We plan to stay engaged and offer our perspective as an upstream project.</p>
<p>In addition to those two previously blocking issues, we discussed a handful of other problems with the Fedora Flatpak. I'll keep the details high level in the interest of brevity on this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>OBS Studio running on Mesa LLLVM pipe instead of with hardware acceleration (i.e. the GPU)</li>
<li>X11 Fallback leading to OBS crashing</li>
<li>VLC Plugin not behaving as expected in the sandbox, needs testing</li>
<li>Shipping of third-party plugins in the Fedora Flatpak</li>
</ul>
<p>The discussion was positive and they are actively working to resolve those issues as well, which should hopefully only affect a small number of users.</p>
<p>I would like to give a final thank you to Yaakov and the FPL for taking the time to talk to us today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see a resolution!</p>

      <title>Take a trip through an indie dev brain in Terry&#39;s Other Games from Terry Cavanagh</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A name you might know from the likes of Dicey Dungeons, Super Hexagon and VVVVVV. This is not a single game but a collection of various experiments done by Terry Cavanagh over many years.</p>
<p>What's in it? There's a lot of smaller "messier" games, some made in a weekend, joke games and more. But there's also some more "substantial" games too. This is just an interesting look behind the mind of an indie developer who has been making games for a very long time.</p>
<p>Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0qnv5XR-HlU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7d043a2a28ab6cf58d14bbb4fb3f771f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0qnv5XR-HlU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://distractionware.com/blog/2025/02/out-now-terrys-other-games/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> Cavanagh said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A big shout out to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jdbaudi.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Justo</a> for coming on to this weird project with me and helping me make it a reality, and to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/terrycavanaghgames.com/post/3lihdo6f7ok2v" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dav999</a> for helping me to localize everything into more than 20 languages. Putting this thing together has been a huge undertaking, and I am so happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p>One of the big inspirations for this project was the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Calvin_and_Hobbes_Tenth_Anniversary/xtiMQXCLdJEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0&amp;kptab=getbook" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Calvin and Hobbes 10th Anniversary</a> collection, which I read as a teenager, and which really made an impact on me. Here is this guy, you know, Bill, he makes so-called lowbrow art, comics for newspapers – but the book is full of little stories about what he was interested in, about what was going on with his career as he was making the comics, about experiments that didn’t work out and how he came up with his world and his different characters. I found that so inspiring, and still do.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I’ve succeeded, but I tried to put a little bit of that into this; less museum exhibition and more designer’s notebook. I hope there are some things in here that surprise and delight and inspire. &lt;3</p>
<p>Right. Time to go make some new games!</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The huge hit deck-builder Monster Train is getting a sequel, with Monster Train 2 getting an announcement and demo in the same day so you can try it early. I know quite a fan fans of the first game, so hopefully this one is just as good. The first worked great on Linux with Proton too!</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pyre Hearts</strong>: Each Pyre Heart brings unique functionality to gameplay. Unlocking them not only provides another way to customize your run before departing, but also plays a key role in advancing the story.</li>
<li><strong>Dimensional Challenges</strong>: Ready for a new twist on your adventure? This mode offers handcrafted challenges, new Mutators, and unique cosmetic rewards to be earned as you complete them.</li>

<li><strong>Daily Challenges</strong>: Take on a new challenge every day with a hugely modified run featuring brand new mutators, as well as some returning old favorites. Compete globally and against friends, and climb the leaderboards with a skill-focused scoring system.</li>
<li><strong>Celestial Alcoves</strong>: The rapid expansion of the Rail has attracted many new visitors to Hell. Encounter a wide variety of random events with exciting gameplay and maybe even a few surprises from outside of the Monster Train universe.</li>

      <title>There&#39;s been a flood in the Wandering Waters update for Dota 2 </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continue building up their next MOBA with Deadlock, their current Dota 2 is still as popular as ever and the Wandering Waters update for Dota 2 sounds pretty awesome.</p>
<p>As expected from a major update the patch notes are ridiculously long, as it seems to touch on so many different areas of the game. If you haven't played for quite some time (like me), prepare to re-learn a whole lot of it. From a changed map to gameplay features, there's a lot that's new.</p>
<p>The biggest change being the map which is a lot wetter. There's been a bit of a flood and so the water that was a sort of diving-line in the map has expanded and reshaped the battlefield. This comes with new gameplay features like faster movement when running with the current, slowing you if you run against it and a new amphibious creep type that evolves during the match.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19996480331740048346gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Dota 2 has also introduced Madstone, a new resource to craft specialised Neutral Items. Clearing out a Neutral Camp will you give 2 and 1 to a random ally. Saving them up for a while and you can then use them to craft your fully personalized items: an Artifact that gives your item new abilities, and an Enchantment that gives it passive stat/attribute bonuses.</p>
<p>There's various other quality of life additions like a timer to see when Roshan will return, marking items to sell as soon as you're alive again, new item effects to help you see which hero is the source of it, a backpack grace period giving you six seconds to pull newly acquired items out and more.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other gameplay features were also tweaked like Lifesteal. It no longer has various ways of working, instead Valve made it a much more standard ability making it easier to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifesteal applies to physical damage from attacks and is reduced by 40% when damaging non-heroes.</li>
<li>Spell Lifesteal now applies to physical damage from spells and magical damage from spells or attacks and is reduced by 80% when damaging non-heroes.</li>
<li>Neither Lifesteal nor Spell Lifesteal applies to pure damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>I genuinely think I'm going to have to get back into Dota 2, for real this time, it all sounds awesome.</p>

<p>For those of you who want a stable experience, you would usually want to wait for the first update point release with at least Mesa 25.0.1. Here's a reminder of their currently planned release schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>2025-03-05 - 25.0.1</li>
<li>2025-03-19 - 25.0.2</li>
<li>2025-04-02 - 25.0.3</li>
<li>2025-04-16 - 25.0.4</li>
<li>2025-04-30 - 25.0.5</li>
<li>2025-05-14 - 25.0.6</li>
<li>2025-05-28 - 25.0.7 (last planned)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Amazon&#39;s previous VP of Prime Gaming said they &#34;tried everything&#34; to disrupt Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everything except making a store people wanted to use? Ethan Evans, who was previously Vice President of Prime Gaming at Amazon, has a short retrospective of trying to take on Steam.</p>
<p>It's a typical <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ethanevansvp_as-vp-of-prime-gaming-at-amazon-we-failed-activity-7295834479036702720-cDmX/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn post</a> that doesn't exactly go into a whole lot of detail, but it's still interesting to get just a little behind the scenes from people who worked at companies that thought they could dethrone Steam. In the post Evans notes how "we failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam" despite being "250x bigger" and how they "tried everything".</p>
<p>Evans continued noting "We acquired Reflexive Entertainment (a small PC game store) and tried to scale it. It went nowhere" and then after buying Twitch and trying a store there assuming people would use it because they watch livestreams, they were also wrong. Then it comes to the cloud gaming platform Luna, which also appears to not be going particularly well, noting how along with Stadia from Google that "Neither gained significant traction".</p>
<p>Why the failures? Evans said "The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam. It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well".</p>
<p><em>It's not just Amazon though.</em></p>
<p>When you think about the Epic Games Store, and how they're trying to compete with constant free game giveaways, they're pretty much coasting on the revenue from the likes of Fortnite, and it shows you truly how difficult it is to move people away from what they like and what they're used to.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2024-year-in-review" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Epic's 2024 Year in Review</a> they might show off some fancy numbers in multiple places with an increase in total spending from users, but they had an 18% cut in third-party PC game spending on the Epic Store. Looking back to <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2023</a>, they had a 13% cut in third-party PC game spending, so it's actually getting <em>worse</em>.</p>
<p>If you want to compete in an established market, against a company that's massive and (on the whole) quite well liked, you have to have something better to offer in some way. Just being big doesn't mean you'll be a success.</p>

      <title>Even with the incredible launch Marvel Rivals developer NetEase sends US staff packing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game didn't sell enough? Staff cuts. Game did incredible! Staff cuts. It seems there's just no winning for some people as Marvel Rivals developer NetEase sends US staff packing.</p>
<p>Some initial reports out there made it out to be seemingly bigger than it is, but no matter how you want to cut it, the developer of a huge hit game has shed some staff responsible for helping it succeed.</p>
<p>First coming in from a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on LinkedIn from Thaddeus Sasser, a Game Director based in the US for NetEase who said in a post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is such a weird industry...<br/>
<br/>
My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...<br/>
<br/>
...and were just laid off!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Level designer Garry McGee also confirmed it in their own LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297717165019803649/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, hello! As the old saying goes, “All good things must come to an end.” My team recently helped develop and launch Marvel Rivals, which turned out to be a bigger hit than any of us expected! Unfortunately my team was also laid off. Strange times all across the industry indeed.</p>

<em>Pictured - Marvel Rivals</em></p>
<p>For some added context: in their official Discord server, the Community Manager has been responding to a bunch of users concerned about it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4904128381739960798gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4904128381739960798gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Also in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/just-couldnt-dodge-that-big-boot-i-guess-no-matter-how-big-the-success-of-the-gig-marvel-rivals-developers-in-the-us-say-netease-just-laid-off-their-whole-team/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a>, NetEase confirmed the layoffs noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally NetEase said they remain committed to the game with their development team in China.</p>

      <title>Valve use a little code from Godot for Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source, Team Fortress 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is the beauty of open source in action - everyone can benefit. Valve are no stranger to open source, and as it turns out they're using a little bit of code from <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> now too.</p>
<p>Spotted by a few eagle eyes in the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big Source SDK update that gives the code for Team Fortress 2</a> for modders, the official Valve GitHub page actually <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/0759e2e8e179d5352d81d0d4aaded72c1704b7a9/src/materialsystem/stdshaders/common_lightmappedgeneric_fxc.h#L153C4-L153C25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a> that "Bicubic lightmap code lovingly taken and adapted from Godot" (with the Godot license also <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/0759e2e8e179d5352d81d0d4aaded72c1704b7a9/thirdpartylegalnotices.txt#L890" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>).</p>
<p>Bicubic lightmap support was first introduced in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/half-life-2-free-to-keep-until-november-18th-episodes-one-two-now-included-with-a-huge-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Update</a>, and then rolled out yesterday for various Valve classics like Team Fortress 2, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/counter-strike-source-and-day-of-defeat-source-get-major-updates-with-64bit-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source</a> and others as part of all their big updates.</p>

<p>Just a fun little detail I thought you might like to know. Valve do a lot with open source, the most notable being their compatibility layer Proton to run Windows games on Linux / SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 major update released and source available for modders via the Source SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It wasn't just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/counter-strike-source-and-day-of-defeat-source-get-major-updates-with-64bit-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source</a> that received big updates today, as Valve also published a new update for Team Fortress 2 along with updating the Source SDK to include TF2! This is a big one for modders, since you now have the source available for TF2!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on the official TF2 website, having the Source SDK updated to include "all the Team Fortress 2 client and server game code" means modders can do a whole lot with it. This includes building entire conversions, which can be released on Steam. This SDK is under a "non-commercial basis" so everything made with it must be free. Valve included a little word on TF2 items though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players have a lot of investment in their TF2 inventories, and Steam Workshop contributors have created of a lot of that content. The majority of items in the game now are thanks to the hard work of the TF2 community. To respect that, we're asking TF2 mod makers continue to respect that connection, and to not make mods that have the purpose of trying to profit off Workshop contributors' efforts. We're hoping that many mods will continue to allow players access their TF2 inventory, if this makes sense for the mod.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A nice surprise for some classic Valve games today with multiple titles like Counter-Strike: Source and Day of Defeat: Source getting major updates. Not many developers continue supporting their games this long after release! Although, Valve do have a lot of resources to do such a thing thanks to how popular Steam is.</p>
<p>These updates are mainly about bringing them up to scratch on modern systems complete with 64bit support, improved networking, UI scaling and some little features pulled in from the Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Update. Exciting to see!</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/240/view/689716592460694165" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Changes</a> for Counter-Strike: Source:</p>

	<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where when unducking, the view could glitch out if the player doesn't have space to unduck</li>
<li>Fixed gifts not randomly dropping when players are killed during the winter event</li>
<li>Added sv_autobunnyhopping so bhop servers can have this wanted behaviour with client-side prediction</li>
<li>Fixed a prediction bug where if the player was moved on the client, their input-based movement for that tick was not taken into account in non-player actions</li>
<li>Improved prediction for walking on props and other entities</li>
<li>Made certain client-side entities only trigger local prediction errors
		<ul>
<li>e.g. If the viewmodel experiences a prediction error, the player will not experience a prediction error</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed prediction of viewmodel sway</li>
<li>Fixed a prediction error regarding weapon idle animations</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>About it: "Broken Shell is a cute and cozy adventure game follows the love story of two little hermit crabs searching for a new home. Despite human interference in their habitat, they face challenges leading to their separation. Embark on adventures, meet new friends, and assist diverse characters, all through solving puzzles and mini-games, a combination of humorous narrative events within a heartfelt romantic drama without a single word."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Feature Highlight:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Story-Driven Experience: An emotional and heartfelt tale of love, hope, and the lengths we go to protect what we cherish. Perfect for players who seek a meaningful and immersive storytelling experience.</li>
<li>Intuitive &amp; Engaging Gameplay: A seamless point-and-click experience with natural, rewarding interactions, perfectly balancing ease of play and depth.</li>

<p>The game is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foggystudio/broken-shell-a-cute-and-cozy-hand-drawn-puzzle-adventure/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a>, with Linux being a clear target for support. They only have a small €8,000 goal, which is rather small, but they said that's to "bring Broken Shell to life at the highest possible quality and ensure it becomes the heartfelt experience we’ve envisioned" with it being self-funded until now. They're expecting it to be ready for release in October 2025.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A narrative-driven management simulation that plunges players into the heart of a 90s-era data harvesting and artificial intelligence empire, FACEMINER is set for release on February 27th.</p>
<p>AI is very much at the centre of this one. It's set against the backdrop of 90s techno-optimism, a story-driven descent into the machinery of data harvesting and artificial intelligence. From server meltdowns to climate catastrophes, every decision carries weight as you navigate the complex world of planetary-scale data management. FACEMINER blends management mechanics with a layered narrative, inviting players to reflect on the cascading consequences of their actions while scaling their surveillance empire.</p>
<p>Check out the release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kUYLimuZ1Yw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d3027294a97ba17999c51b9bec2560c7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kUYLimuZ1Yw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>

<p>Dynamic Internal Messaging System - Uncover over 200 in-game messages to reveal office gossip, backstory, and the secrets of the FACEMINER project.</p>
<p>Player-Driven Choices - Will you prioritize eco-friendly solutions or maximize profits at any cost? Build your own surveillance network, or rely on third-party brokers. Your choices shape your empire’s rise—and its ultimate destiny.</p>
<p>Rich 90s Interface - Experience the nostalgia of a meticulously crafted retro operating system. Monitor your progress through the Visualiser 3D view and track your influence with a global surveillance map.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With AI (and specifically AI generation) being a hot topic right now, it seems like quite a fitting game for the times. The developers filled out their AI disclosure on Steam too, which makes it clear it's all quite on-point for the theme of the game. They only use AI for a very specific feature, which seems to fit in well with the overall subject of the game itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FACEMINER is a concept-driven game that directly engages with the ethics of AI. For thematic purposes, the game features faces which have been generated by a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) trained on the FFHQ dataset, a research dataset released by NVIDIA that is the backbone of many real-world facial recognition applications.

      <title>OCCT for stress-testing comes to Linux and Steam Deck, with a Steam release planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OCCT has long been a popular tool for PC stability and performance testing on Windows, and now it's officially been made available for Linux in Alpha, including Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>With the new Linux version in Alpha, it's not fully ready for everyone just yet, it's also only available to their Patreon supporters via a direct download for Linux / Steam Deck. In the announcement the developers mentioned they're even planning a Steam release of the tool, although there's no release date for that just yet.</p>
<p>Why they say it's a game changer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For years, Linux users have struggled with reliable stress-testing solutions for CPUs and GPUs. With OCCT now available on Linux, testing hardware stability has never been easier.</p>
<p><strong>Easy Installation</strong> – Just download, make the file executable, and you're ready to go. No complex dependencies required.</p>
<p><strong>Same Powerful Features as Windows</strong> – The Linux version includes all the core functionalities of OCCT, from CPU and GPU stress tests to power supply diagnostics.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect for Server Environments</strong> – IT professionals can now utilize OCCT to validate hardware performance on Linux-based systems.</p>
<p><strong>Allow for bootable diagnostics</strong> – No more OS corruption, just run Linux from a Live DVD/USB setup and test your settings!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>

<p>It's fantastic to see more regular software add in Linux support. Thanks to Valve picking Linux (SteamOS) for the Steam Deck, we've seen a really nice boost to all areas of Linux over the last few years. And with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS readying for more devices</a>, I expect this support to continue.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 46: Bursting Bubbles</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-45-free-as-in-beer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 45: Free as in Beer</a></strong></p>
<p>Unlike when building a retro Windows computer which gives you certain milestone releases to target, the incremental nature of Linux leaves it more difficult to settle on which version you wish to run, even if you have decided on a distribution. I opted to use Red Hat Linux 7.3 Valhalla for largely two reasons: the decent 3D support it offers for my ATI Rage 128 Pro graphics card, and it still being on the right side of the glibc 2.3 boundary after which Loki Software titles will start to break.</p>
<p>Thanks to this I have had my fair share of success in running games released up to around 2004 or so, but after that I do begin to encounter more issues with binary compatibility. The true strength of Linux has always been in source compatibility however, and by leaning into this fact you can still find means and ways of getting newer games and software to launch, even if they were released well after the heyday of your chosen Linux version.</p>
<p>If you are given access to a source tarball with requirements already in line with your build environment, then this can often be as easy as just typing "make" and letting the magic happen. When playing with software from the future this often fails to be the case though, with new libraries being introduced and newer versions of existing libraries being demanded. At least when using an RPM based distribution such as Red Hat Linux, this is where source RPMs can become incredibly useful.</p>
<p>Not only do they give you all the benefits of package management such as proper dependency resolution, but by using source RPMs I have been able to version bump existing system libraries and even install new ones to those packaged for later Red Hat and Fedora releases, all without breaking compatibility elsewhere. Your mileage of course may vary, and a certain discretion is required, but one success I have had was in upgrading SDL to the version found in Red Hat Linux 8.0 Psyche.</p>
<p>My main interest was in trying to get SDL Mixer reliant games with MIDI music to utilize my hardware synthesizer, a feature in later SDL versions that I sadly still have not gotten to work, but in upgrading SDL I was also able to finally build and then play the 1.0.0 version of <em>Frozen Bubble</em> outside of a live Knoppix environment. To do this I needed to grab the SDL-1.2.4-5.src.rpm, SDL_image-1.2.2-3.src.rpm, SDL_mixer-1.2.4-5.src.rpm, and SDL_net-1.2.4-3.src.rpm files from the Red Hat archives.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19663923531739822760gol6.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19663923531739822760gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11438794101739822761gol6.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11438794101739822761gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>To build and install a source RPM on Red Hat Linux 7.3 you need to use the "rpm --rebuild" command followed by the name of the package files in question, which if successful will generate regular binary RPM packages in the /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 directory. Assuming there are no conflicts you can then use these to install or update your software, although in this case I did need to ensure that the SDL and SDL-devel packages were installed first in order to respect the depedency chain.</p>
<p>Building SDL also required nasm to be installed as a dependency, and the <em>Frozen Bubble</em> source RPM package that I used also needed the desktop-file-utils-0.2-1.i386.rpm package to be installed, all of which was communicated by the package manager saving me any guesswork. The main stumbling block I always had when trying to build <em>Frozen Bubble</em> in the past was perl-SDL, but with the newer version of SDL installed, I was at last able build a perl-SDL source RPM without incident.</p>
<p>The Enet library served a similar role in blocking my ability to compile the final release of <em>Cube</em>, but by grabbing a source RPM from when it was included with Fedora 7 Moonshine I was at last able to get it to build. Overall performance is weaker than in the earlier release I covered, as while <em>Cube</em> remains playable it dips into uncomfortable frame rates far more often. I do feel the game plays smoother at 32-bit colours, as I found with <em>Unreal Tournament</em>, but the difference here was marginal.</p>
<p>In accomplishing this I corrected what were two of my greatest failures in getting newer releases of games to run, but I was not able to redress everything. Newer versions of ClanLib are built with X.org rather than XFree86 in mind, meaning I was unable to get later versions of <em>Trophy</em> to work for instance. Attempts at using later <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> source RPM packages also just produced the same errors related to GL detection that I got when I tried to build them with the source tarballs.</p>
<p>Now that I have the binary RPM packages created for Red Hat Linux 7.3 Valhalla I can just distribute them to save anyone else the trouble, but there are lessons to be learned here for anyone trying to run new software on legacy RPM based distributions; source RPMs for Mandrake and its descendants are not compatible with Red Hat however, and Debian and derivatives possess their own separate ways of handling package sources. Time to tackle a different challenge, and look back in time instead.</p>

      <title>Is This Seat Taken? is a thoroughly charming puzzle game about swapping seats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo now available, Is This Seat Taken? is a wonderfully charming idea for a logic puzzle game about picking up people and putting them in the right seat. The idea is simple and brilliantly executed, at least going by the demo I've played which has a Native Linux version available.</p>
<p>Across various different settings including cars, busses, diners and more you get given a set of characters with different needs and it's up to you to pick them up and drop them onto a seat that will be suitable for them. Some want a window seat, others want to sit next to a particular character, another might want to sit alone — and then there's the unwashed smelly people that will cause other problems with multiple people not wanting to sit near them and so on. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="V5Nw0qzomec"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc6f0b3424a7db12bf346b96a80a560c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/V5Nw0qzomec" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo contains the first city of the full game giving you 5 different levels and 1 special level to play. It's a really inventive take on a puzzle game with some charming visuals. Another demo thoroughly worth checking out. Loved it. Really want to get my hands on the full game and play it through now and the Linux build worked perfectly.</p>
<p>Hopefully it gets a little more challenging as the levels go on in the full game though, as the demo was reasonably easy.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play seating matchmaker to please picky characters.</li>
<li>Discover each character’s unique traits—relatable, outlandish, and everything in between.</li>
<li>Piece together satisfying puzzles with no timers or leaderboards.</li>
<li>Unlock fun new scenarios as you progress—from bus rides to banquets!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Now you can get a real-life Deep Rock Galactic mug for all your beer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a bit of fluff for you today: fans of Deep Rock Galactic are in for a treat, as you can now grab an officially licensed beer mug and they sure do look fancy. With it you'll be able to give cheers in style for rock, stone and Karl.</p>
<p>They're technically not available <em>yet</em>, since it's going through a crowdfunding campaign. Against a €250,000 goal though, it's smashed through it like a dwarf through rock and at time of writing has amassed €583,000 in loot from nearly 4,000 wannabe dwarves. Certainly not cheap, but this kind of custom merch never is, at a minimum it's €55 (about £46) just to get one of them.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0NpxMY9KAdI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/491f57141af8ffb83c2f10a1f70f3036.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0NpxMY9KAdI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to the campaign they're as tough as the dwarves themselves. They say all the mugs will be safe for dishwashers and microwaves, along with them being suitable for hot drinks too along with being "tested to meet EU and FDA standards". You probably shouldn't go throwing them around though.</p>
<p>There's some extras you can add in too like themed coasters, a special bottle opener, a bar mat and more.</p>
<p>With Deep Rock Galactic being one of my favourite co-op games, I'm itching to grab one of these…</p>

      <title>AI is everywhere in AI Confidential and it&#39;s your job to fix up all the robots - check out the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a world where Artificial Intelligence is everywhere, you work for an AI megacorp and you're the one sent around to people's homes to fix up all their problems. A setting that is steadily becoming all that much closer to reality.</p>
<p>A first-person story-driven adventure game, one that may leave you thinking. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/from-broken-parts-to-broken-hearts-mend-robots-in-ai-confidential/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A game I wrote about back in June 2024</a>, as the premise of it and the way you interact certainly seemed interesting. Doing away with textual conversations, instead relying on emotions. The developer has put up a public demo now with Linux support that they said "represents ~7 months of active development time" from their small four person team.</p>
<p>Original trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LUEqaVVl_9s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a0b3de987285db4d81f63ed295aff07f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LUEqaVVl_9s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What you get in the demo is only a small slice of what to expect of course, but this little introduction case is certainly a curious one. You're dealing with a dog caretaker assistant robot that's a bit broken, which seems to be a mixture of both broken hardware and an AI acting rather suspicious. There's some really good voice acting in this that really helps to sell the experience, complete with the ridiculously annoying client that sounds like an over-excited livestreamer.</p>
<p>You get the clear feeling pretty early on something isn't right here, as the little robot companion is acting <em>really</em> strangely and you quickly put the pieces together to figure out what happened. The conversation system is a fun unique point in it, giving you no right or wrong answers, just going based on your own feel for it.</p>
<p>A demo definitely worth jumping in. The developers do note it has "Adult language and some mature themes".</p>

      <title>SUPER DEBT is a twin-stick bullet-hell dungeon crawler where time eats away your money</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Things get weird real fast in SUPER DEBT, a new bullet-hell dungeon crawler from developer zagawee, who also made Garbanzo Quest. On <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zachisagardner.bsky.social/post/3li6454kvv22a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> the developer said: "what if: Balatro, But Everything Is Trying To Kill You". I'll admit, that was enough to hook me in to give it a go.</p>
<p>A demo is available on Steam with Native Linux support, and the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2105910/view/4507632124228043201" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> it has full Steam Deck support, they've done "many 100% playthroughs on the Steam Deck and I can confidently say that it runs great without any special configuration".</p>

The upcoming PC release is "the full PC package" they said with "new content, original soundtrack, in-world events like traders, prestige system for endless replayability, difficulty modes, cloud saving and more…".</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Replicube an open-ended programming puzzle game from Walaber</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Walaber Entertainment who made Parking Garage Rally Circuit and JellyCar Worlds, their next game is Replicube. There's a demo now available to try and it looks really interesting and it's another they're making with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, and it has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Replicube is an open-ended programming puzzle game about writing code to replicate 3D voxel-based objects. The developer said they took what they liked about writing shaders, and turned it into a game. Here you solve puzzles, pursue leaderboard glory, or just make art to share with the in-game community.</p>
<p>Check out their introduction trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_k_IZhIu_BU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/40d7287474f80e5b7520e36b68426982.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_k_IZhIu_BU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it's a puzzle game, it's also a tool that can export into common formats to add into other 3D creation tools. You can also use it to generate images and animations.</p>

      <title>Luanti (formerly Minetest) v5.11 out now with an in-game settings menu and better server browser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Luanti (formerly Minetest) has a new release out, which finally adds an in-game settings menu so you don't have to quit your current game to adjust things. Something missing that was definitely felt from it.</p>
<p>Even with the settings menu now in-game, not every setting supports live changes, they said some may still require you to reconnect. Hopefully over time they can reduce the amount of settings that require you to do that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14271114931739791849gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14271114931739791849gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For people on devices with touchscreens, there's also a new layout editor so you can setup the controls how you want.</p>
<p>When going to join an online game, the server list has also been improved. They've added in 4 new buttons allowing you to open the server’s website, view its mod list, see which players are online, and manage your favourites. You can also now filter server searches by game, mod and player.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12752375871739791960gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12752375871739791960gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Other additions / changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mods can override the default fonts</li>
<li><strong>Clients’ <code class="inline-code">version_string</code> is now available</strong> in <code class="inline-code">core.get_player_information()</code>, with <code class="inline-code">core.protocol_versions</code> added to verify available client features (<a href="https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15708" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#15708</a>).</li>
<li><strong>glTF STEP interpolation</strong> is now supported (<a href="https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15525" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#15525</a>).</li>
<li>The chat console has a scrollbar now (<a href="https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15104" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#15104</a>).</li>
<li>Some unwanted disconnects have been eliminated (<a href="https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/15680" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#15680</a>).</li>
<li>Various rendering issues (shadow flicker, overlay Z-fighting, MSAA/bloom artifacts, orbit tilt distortions, and more) have been fixed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Work is already in progress on the next version to bring further enhancements.</p>

      <title>A whole lot of people picked up a shovel for A Game About Digging A Hole</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Game About Digging A Hole has a very simple idea, everything about it is in the name, and yet it managed to pull a whole lot of people in. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/please-dont-distract-me-im-trying-to-dig-a-big-hole-over-here/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As I said in my previous article</a>, it works great with Proton, and really does suck you in to get to the bottom of the hole.</p>
<p>They've announced it crossed over 250,000 sales in the space of a single week. For any smaller developer, that's pretty incredible really. Especially nice for them since it was just a small side-project. Seems we all can't shake that primal urge to dig.</p>
<p>More about it: "A Game About Digging A Hole challenges you to dig a hole in your newly purchased house. On your way down, collect resources to sell and upgrade equipment to dig deeper and take garden excavation to a new level! But beware! With every spadeful you take, you start to uncover a mysterious secret, and the deeper you dig, the closer you get to the truth. But take your time, as there is no rush and no rules. Just you, your spade and a great underground adventure!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P-Ys4PRZxsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c397b11f8932023861734122cb0968a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P-Ys4PRZxsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It also has a Very Positive rating on Steam from over 5,000 user reviews. According to their PR team it was a hit across social media too including "over 5 million views on TikTok, 2.2 million views on YouTube Shorts, and a jaw-dropping 14.5 million views on Instagram reels".</p>
<p>Seems they plan some updates to the game with the first now available adding in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FOV slider – You can now adjust the field of view.</li>
<li>Motion blur toggle – Turn it off if you prefer a clearer image.</li>
<li>Russian &amp; Italian localization fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The beautiful diorama builder Tiny Glade adds controller support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After previously making some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/popular-diorama-builder-tiny-glade-is-getting-better-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">improvements for Steam Deck</a>, developer Pounce Light have now implemented more proper controller support for Tiny Glade. Now even more people will be able to enjoy it, as controller support will make it a lot more accessible.</p>
<p>Said in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2198150/view/511824321138655283" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "While not great for vitamin D, the darkness does align with productive game development. We've finished conjuring the ancient incantations of Steam Input, infused the magicks of VDFs and action glyphs into Tiny Glade, and the tickbox of "Controller Support" is now officially ticked! Thanks to everyone who helped us test the beta".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13864514401739788197gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More info from the post on what's been done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's there</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All the menus and UIs can now be navigated using controllers: DPad/Left Joystick, A/B, L1/R1.</li>
<li>The same is also true for the keyboard: Arrow keys, Enter/Esc, PgDown/PgUp.</li>
<li>There's now two action sets in Steam Input: one for gameplay, and one for the menu.</li>
<li>Action sets expose a whole bunch of extra controls useful for custom layouts.</li>
<li>Tutorials/input hints in the game show controller glyphs.</li>
<li>The game will dynamically detect any connected controllers, and seamlessly read input from all of them and/or keyboard + mouse.</li>
<li>On Steam Deck, the folder icon in photo mode now shows an info screen for where to find screenshots in SteamOS's menus.</li>
<li>There's now a "Controller Bindings" button in the Controls menu (only shows if you have a controller connected).</li>
<li>Ditto for key bindings; they have been moved to their own sub-screen.</li>
<li>You can now draw walls &amp; fences by clicking and moving <em>the camera</em> instead of the cursor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What's not there yet</strong></p>
There's a few things that we'll address in future patches:

<ul>
<li>There's a bunch of new strings that we haven't yet localized to other languages.</li>
<li>If you change the toolbar alignment in settings, you'll need to restart the game, or controller mapping will be all borked.</li>
<li>Our graphics driver warning/information screen doesn't support controllers yet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're hoping to get the game bumped up to a Steam Deck Verified status.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck update gets a small battery life boost with the Frame Limiter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new Steam Deck Beta Client update for February 14th, showing the love to battery life with a little extra juice. You need to be on the Preview / Beta channel to receive the update for testing.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/518579539928940547" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an error on the Downloads page when a Free to Play game is removed during installation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced polling rate while the Steam Frame Limiter is active to save additional power. This can save up to 6% on battery life when running at 30fps in a low-power game like HL2.</li>
<li>Fixed an error on the virtual menu settings when bound to gyro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great to see the Steam Deck just keeps on improving so many things years after release. That's one of the benefits of the Steam Deck compared with other hardware, Valve just keep on pushing out those updates.</p>

      <title>SteamOS-like Bazzite Linux has some nice growth thanks to great handheld PC support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's no need to wait on Valve releasing SteamOS 3 for everyone thanks to Bazzite. Some really impressive work continues to go into it, and it appears they're enjoying some nice overall growth.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on the Bazzite Discourse forum, developer Jorge O. Castro made a post titled "<a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/just-how-many-of-us-are-there/6852/1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Just how many of us are there?</a>" that went over some fun details, with comparisons to a few other Linux builds like Fedora Silverblue and Fedora Kinoite. One thing is clear from it — Bazzite is steadily increasing in popularity with over 25,000 systems active using it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7924869381739553313gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Heck, Bazzite even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/marvel-rivals-gets-a-low-quality-ui-fix-for-bazzite-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">got a shout out in a recent Marvel Rival's patch note</a>. More and more are taking notice of Linux for gaming, thanks to how actually easy it is to get going now. And a lot of it, of course, thanks to Valve with the Steam Deck making it truly accessible to millions of gamers. Bazzite has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/even-with-steamos-coming-to-more-systems-bazzite-has-no-plans-to-go-anywhere/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">no plans to go anywhere</a> even when SteamOS 3 is released for everyone.</p>

      <title>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater releases in August</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KONAMI announced that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is going to be launching on August 28th, with pre-orders now live. Another that was announced during the PlayStation State of Play recently and the mini-game from the original is returning too.</p>
<p>With pre-orders live it's another that's doing Advanced Access for the more expensive edition of the game. This allows you to play 48 hours earlier than the standard edition.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KflwVzVIk_o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d2da3a3a943788422c6f0e009cf9877.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KflwVzVIk_o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In addition to giving Advanced Access the Digital Deluxe Edition also gives you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>●Sneaking DLC Pack<br/>
・Uniform: Battle Dress (PW ver.)<br/>
・Uniform: Sneaking Suit (PW ver.)<br/>
・Uniform: Crocodile Suit<br/>
・Uniform: Naked Woodland<br/>
・Uniform: Naked Ammunition Belt<br/>
・Uniform: Gold<br/>
・Face: Glasses<br/>
・Face: Sunglasses<br/>
・Equipment: Kerotan Mask<br/>
・Equipment: GA-KO Mask<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Content<br/>
・Uniform: White Tuxedo<br/>
*This content is also obtainable through in-game progress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Steam release they also confirmed the Snake vs. Monkey minigame from the original is back, where you have to capture a group of mischievous monkeys. </p>
<p>In the PlayStation <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-releases-august-28-2025-on-ps5/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> they also confirmed the game will feature both a "New Style" third-person view, and a "Legacy Style" top-down view "to recreate the look and feel of the original game".</p>
<p>This is another that I expect may be a bit too much for the Steam Deck, with it powered by Unreal Engine 5. Hopefully overall though at least on Desktop Linux it should be okay with Valve's Proton. I'm thoroughly looking forward to it, actually skipping over it from the Master Collection Version to wait for this.</p>

      <title>Open source non-profit platform Codeberg &#34;suffering from hate campaigns due to far-right forces&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Codeberg</a> are a "non-profit, community-led effort that provides Git hosting and other services for free and open source projects" and they've recently had a major problem from what they say are far-right forces engaging in a hate campaign.</p>
<p>Entering my email early on Wednesday morning was something that made me raise my eyebrows. I get a lot of emails, often from various projects I'm tracking across various instances of Git. This one definitely wasn't normal though, coming from a repository on Codeberg named "truth" from a user "truth". The issue subject line from the email I won't repeat, but it was clear racial hatred. Inside the email the issue had a whole bunch of people tagged, myself included.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, an official email from Codeberg came in to apologise and linked to their <a href="https://blog.codeberg.org/we-stay-strong-against-hate-and-hatred.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Codeberg say they're "currently suffering from hate campaigns due to far-right forces, and so are our users", with the target being "several projects advocating tolerance and equal rights" that have been subjected to "hate attacks, such as massive spam of abusive messages in their issue trackers". The attackers took advantage of Codeberg's notification system, that enabled people to create a repository, make an issue and then tag anyone in it notifying them generating an email.</p>
<p>According to Codeberg they have "blocked access to the used functionality and deleted the user accounts" but "they managed to generate a large amount of notification emails already".</p>
<p>Thankfully this hasn't deterred Codeberg from their mostly volunteer-led mission. And they end the announcement with a note about how they will "not be discouraged in our fight against far-right ideologies". They've also been working on securing funding from <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NLnet</a> for more moderation tooling.</p>
<p>I'll take this moment to remind people that I, and GamingOnLinux, take a very firm stance against any kind of hatred. It won't stand in the comments, and I won't put up with it in any attached community like our <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>. It's a real shame the lengths some people will go to when spreading hate.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider II open source re-implementation adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>TRX, the Tomb Raider I &amp; II: Community Edition open source re-implementation project, has continued advancing and a fresh release of both are out now. With the Tomb Raider II side adding Linux support.</p>
<p>While the Tomb Raider I-III Remastered collection does exist, this project works with the originals and enhances them. You do need to own the games to run through TRX. You can grab them from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The latest release of <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases/tag/tr2-0.9" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TR2X 0.9</a> is out now, which amongst other things includes "Linux builds and toolchain" support, so you can run it natively on Linux and benefit from all the improvements. Going by the <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/tree/develop/docs/tr2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">status page</a> they say "TR2X is finished with the decompilation and is now able to run without the original game .exe. The focus is now to clean up the code base and enrich the game with new enhancements and features". The update also includes a pause dialog, a photo mode feature, support for animated sprites and more.</p>

      <title>A workaround for Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on Linux with NVIDIA GPUs has been found</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Final Fantasy VII Rebirth can work on Linux with AMD GPUs (like Steam Deck), the situation with NVIDIA GPUs has been messy. Open source to the rescue though, again.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8408#issuecomment-2657340142" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Commenting</a> on the official Valve Proton GitHub, VKD3D-Proton developer Hans-Kristian Arntzen revealed another project — <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/pyroveil" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pyroveil</a>. From the GitHub it says it's "a Vulkan layer that can automatically replace shaders or roundtrip them via SPIRV-Cross -&gt; glslang. This can create SPIR-V that is more compatible with NVIDIA drivers in particular".</p>
<p>Multiple user reports show it enables the game to render correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14268485861739527229gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>It may not be perfect, with some users still reporting other issues, but at least now NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux can get this game to actually work until NVIDIA solve the driver issues directly. And with this new open source Pyroveil project, perhaps we might see less NVIDIA issues in future for gaming on Linux.</p>

      <title>Fedora threatened with legal action from OBS Studio due to their Flatpak packaging</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing you can always count on in the Linux world it's that packaging can be a nightmare. The OBS Studio team are not happy with the Fedora folks due to Flatpak problems and threatened legal action.</p>
<p>Like with traditional distribution packages (RPM, DEB, etc), distros can also run their own Flatpak repositories, instead of using Flathub. This is what Fedora does by default, they have their own Fedora Flatpaks, where they often repackage various software. To note: the OBS Studio on Flathub, is an official OBS package.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago Joel Bethke of the OBS Studio team put up an <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/sigs/flatpak/fedora-flatpaks/-/issues/39" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> on the Fedora Flatpaks GitLab titled "Broken OBS Studio Flatpak presented as official package" that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/flatpaks/obs-studio" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">unofficial OBS Studio Flatpak</a> on Fedora Flatpaks is, seemingly, poorly packaged and broken, leading to users complaining upstream thinking they are being served the official package. There are several examples of this being the case outside of OBS Studio as well, and many users who are unhappy with Fedora Flatpaks being pushed with no or unclear options to opt-out.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/2754" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-software/-/issues/2754</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to request that this package is either removed, or made clear that it is a third party package. It should not be upstream's responsibility to ensure downstream packages are working, especially when they overwrite official packages.</p>
<p>I would also like some sort of explanation on why someone thought it was a good idea to take a Flatpak that was working perfectly fine, break it, and publish it at a higher priority to our official builds. We spend an enormous amount of effort on our official Flatpak published to Flathub to ensure everything is working as well as it can be.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This led to a <a href="https://pagure.io/fedora-workstation/issue/463" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> being filed on Fedora Workstation titled "Deprioritize or remove Fedora Flatpaks, and prioritize Flathub in GNOME Software". The issue noted receiving complaints from upstream developers, like the OBS Studio team. With lots of discussion going on about changing the order of how Fedora presents packages between Fedora Flatpaks, Flathub and RPMs. Inside the comments, there's a fair bit of disagreement between Fedora / Red Hat and the OBS Studio team.</p>
<p>Then on the 12th of February, Bethke escalated things with a <a href="https://gitlab.com/fedora/sigs/flatpak/fedora-flatpaks/-/issues/39#note_2344970813" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> on the original ticket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since it's clear that Fedora does not have any interest in a rational discussion at this point, and has decided to resort to name-calling, we are now considering the Fedora Flatpaks distribution of OBS Studio a hostile fork.</p>
<p>This is a formal request to remove all of our branding, including but not limited to, our name, our logo, any additional IP belonging to the OBS Project, from your distribution.</p>
<p>Failure to comply may result in further legal action taken. We expect a response within the next 7 business days (By Friday, February 21st, 2025).</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since then the Fedora team have <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/flatpaks/obs-studio/c/aa78e92a7e68e795b9554bc8dd3b48204be58357?branch=stable" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> their Flatpak of OBS Studio to an "end of life" status, and eventually it looks like it will be removed, so things seem to be moving into a direction that should appease the OBS Studio team.</p>
<p>A messy situation but hopefully one some lessons can be learned from.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN launches in May - will have Kernel Level Anti-Cheat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN is now set for launch on May 30th, and it does look great, but the anti-cheat could be a problem for Steam Deck / Linux players.</p>
<p>While the first ELDEN RING <em>also</em> has anti-cheat, specifically Easy Anti-Cheat (and does work), you can <em>never</em> be certain if a new game using it will actually work on Steam Deck / Linux with Proton unless the developer is clear on it. NIGHTREIGN clearly mentions on the Steam page it uses "Kernel Level Anti-Cheat" this time around too, which ELDEN RING does not (but that's a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty new rule from Valve</a>). Compared with the first game, NIGHTREIGN is also firmly focused on the online play which <em>could</em> make a big difference here.</p>
<p>New trailer below:</p>

<p>We're tracking various games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat status on a dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>I've reached out via email to find out if the anti-cheat will be supported again like the first ELDEN RING.</p>

      <title>Wayland Colour Management and HDR Protocol finally merged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After years of work across many areas, lots of discussions and more work - the Wayland Colour Management and HDR Protocol has been merged! This means it will finally be released with a future version of Wayland Protocols.</p>
<p>Some desktop environments and compositors already have support for it, at varying levels, and in some cases pulled in parts of it early just to get the ball rolling on it. Now it's really <em>properly</em> ready.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Going back to the original merge request from <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/14/diffs?commit_id=452e943b4991ffd0584b69cfb1b2c72852857b47" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">five years ago</a> the main goals were:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reliably maintain the display server color setup.</li>
<li>Support professional color managed applications (presentation).</li>
<li>Support displaying TV broadcasts and other high quality video content.</li>
<li>Support a wide variety of monitors and application content, including wide gamut and/or HDR.</li>
<li>Bring basic color management to applications that are not color-aware at all.</li>
<li>Bring adequate color management to Wayland applications that are color-aware but not color managed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be really great to see proper HDR support on Linux now for apps and games, one less barrier for people switching from other platforms and for just advancing Linux on the desktop as a whole.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress has some exciting plans for the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Adventure Mode out now, the Dwarf Fortress team are looking ahead and it's sounding quite exciting with some big features coming to the game.</p>
<p>Over the next few updates there's going to be an Lua upgrade which they said "will allow you to create more powerful mods and lay the foundation for future Myth and Magic updates". For the Fortress mode, they're going to be focusing on sieges as they want "to give players the tools and abilities to be more properly prepared for an attack". Plus plans to have abilities to "interact with magic systems (beyond necromancers and mods.)".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1853985991739453234gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some other of their plans for the next few updates include (no guarantees though):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allow siegers to plan and learn, tracking where deaths occur and using alternate routes.</li>
<li>Properly equipped siegers should be able to build, demolish and dig (default on, can be turned off in difficulty settings).</li>
<li>Kidnapped humans and dwarves should be more interesting - warlords and demon-trained sorcerers focused on siege warfare and infiltration (for now).</li>
<li>Temple/etc.-based defenses for any magic that proves too annoying to combat with soldiers.</li>
<li>Ranged weapon/squad fixes.</li>
<li>Changes to defensive siege weapons to make them more useful.</li>
<li>If ranged weapon changes remove the delightful effect of fast-shooting crossbows, add a repeating defensive bolt thrower emplacement that uses regular bolts.</li>
<li>Changes to cage traps to make it more intensive but still possible to e.g. capture megabeasts.</li>
<li>Make megabeast and kobold attacks more functional and interesting.</li>
<li>Fix and improve underground civilization attacks (as far as we can without future map changes).</li>
<li>Anything from Combat Flow and Combat Styles that comes up, also a notion of reach.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>After that back to Adventure Mode and they are hoping to add "Site Building", a way for you to have your own little settlements. It was in the classic version but not in the new graphical Steam build. Then after that the focus is on Maps that will include world map rewrites and graphics improvements, which they say is needed to prepare "for a more magical and procedural, dynamically-reactive future".</p>
<p>Sometime eventually they'll then get back to various other bigger new features like "Villains, army warfare, civilizations, etc". They also said all steps through the roadmap will include various art additions and "content that make sense to add along the way".</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade confirmed for a PC release in June - Steam page now live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hot on the heels of the recent news that Shift Up mentioned <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/stellar-blade-to-be-optimized-for-the-steam-deck-and-other-umpc-environments/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellar Blade would be optimized for Steam Deck</a> and other smaller devices, we have a Steam page and release month.</p>
<p>During the PlayStation State of Play February 2025 edition, it was announced that "Both the PC version of Stellar Blade and the Goddess of Victory: Nikke DLC (available on PS5 and PC) launch in June". To go along with that the Steam page has been set live so you can wishlist and follow it now too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/90025721739452233gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explore an awe-inspiring post-apocalyptic world</strong></p>
<p>The future of humanity is balanced on the edge of a blade. Ravaged by strange, powerful creatures, Earth has been abandoned, and what is left of the decimated human race has fled to a Colony in outer space.</p>
<p>After travelling from the Colony, EVE arrives on the desolate remains of our planet with a clear-cut mission: to save humankind by reclaiming Earth from the Naytiba – the malevolent force that has devastated it.</p>
<p>But as EVE tackles the Naytiba one-by-one, piecing together the mysteries of the past in the ruins of human civilization, she realizes that her mission is far from straightforward. In fact, almost nothing is as it seems…</p>
<p><strong>A thrilling slice of razor-sharp action</strong></p>
<p>Engage in blisteringly fast combat as you slash a path through the remnants of Earth. Unleash graceful yet brutal attacking combos, unlock new moves and weapon upgrades, and face epic boss encounters that will challenge both brain and brawn in equal measure.</p>
<p><strong>An incredible visual experience</strong></p>
<p>Become immersed in a highly detailed post-apocalyptic world that blends beauty and horror to spectacular effect.</p>
<p><strong>A deep, unforgettable adventure</strong></p>
<p>Unravel a gripping human fate story, with mature themes, a thought-provoking narrative and emotionally-charged revelations from beginning to end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is going to be quite the treat for gamers on PC / Steam Deck. I can't wait to see how it runs with Proton to see what all the fuss is about on this.</p>

      <title>The glibc 2.41 update has been causing problems for Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems a recent update to glibc with version 2.41 release at the end of January, has been causing all sorts of problems for Linux gamers that have pulled in the update (mostly on rolling-release distributions).</p>
<p>Valve have already updated multiple titles to get around the issue including <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/portal-2-gets-a-compatibility-update-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Portal 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/left-4-dead-2-gets-a-compatibility-update-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Left 4 Dead 2</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/542223345638178895" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Half-Life 2</a> and other updates on the way for some older games. This isn't just affecting Valve though, as more and more games are appearing to have problems. Some other quick examples with the bug include <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/504230/discussions/4/601895505111349304/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Celeste</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1627350/discussions/1/600770015625540643/?tscn=1739448468" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DEAD LETTER DEPT.</a>, there's no doubt many more that it will affect but I'm not going to give a really long list here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2981381451739451439gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Half-Life 2</em></p>
<p>There's an open <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32653" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> for glibc, with a recent reply from a developer noting that due to the backwards compatibility issue, the bug was reopened "to consider possible options for the release and the applications involved". This is not the first time glibc has caused problems with Linux compatibility for gaming, like a previous DT_HASH change that resulted in Easy Anti-Cheat breaking.</p>
<p>Not the end of the world though this time, developers and Linux users can still solve the issue themselves if needed running <code class="inline-code">execstack -c</code> on the affected libraries. Don't just take my advice on it though if you're a developer or gamer reading this, always look up what you're doing fully. Run at your own risk.</p>
<p>For game devs using FMOD, they were already aware of the issue, and <a href="http://qa.fmod.com/t/glibc-2-41-breaks-loading-fmodstudio-libraries-in-standalone-linux-builds/22592/2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">solved</a> it with FMOD 2.02.00. The FMOD team said for older versions, using the execstack command is safe.</p>
<p>Hopefully the glibc developers will be able to do something about this breaking change for various games.</p>

      <title>Borderlands 4 confirmed for release in September with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gearbox and 2K have now revealed that Borderlands 4 is set for release on September 23rd, along with giving it a short new trailer. However, they've said a more thorough gameplay reveal will come in the PlayStation State of Play later this Spring.</p>
<p>We still only know a very limited amount of info about the game, apart from it will continue the tradition of being a co-op shooter. Previous games in the series worked well enough on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton, so likely this one will again too unless they do something odd.</p>

<p>The press release wasn't even particularly helpful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most ambitious Borderlands title to-date delivers more looter-shooter Mayhem than ever before, as the new trailer packs in intense action, outrageous enemies, and the killer loot awaiting players on the dangerous new planet Kairos.</p>
<p><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> transforms players into an unstoppable force on the battlefield, blasting through enemies with an arsenal of incredible weaponry. The iconic Borderlands gameplay fans know and love is evolving with even more movement abilities, as players can flex their skill expression with glide, dodge, double jump, fixed-point grapple, and more, to deftly deal death from every direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you looking forward to it? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Marvel Rivals gets a low-quality UI fix for Bazzite Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see dedicated support like this from a massive game. Marvel Rivals had a small update that came with a fix for Bazzite Linux.</p>
<p>You don't see this happening from many developers of online multiplayer games. The patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/523083139556311044" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> "High-end computers running the Bazzite (Linux) system were mistakenly tapping into low-quality UI resources. Fear not—this issue has been rm'd!".</p>
<p>This is in addition to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/marvel-rivals-team-issue-a-statement-on-recent-bans-for-steam-deck-and-macos-players/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their previous announcement</a> about compatibility layer support (Proton / Wine) for Linux, Steam Deck and macOS reversing some unfortunate accidental bans. Clearly, NetEase Games are showing how it can be done here. Quite a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/blocking-linux-steam-deck-in-apex-legends-led-to-a-meaningful-reduction-in-cheaters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big difference to the likes of Apex Legends</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>The release date, new trailer and demo all went live today. Speaking about the demo content the developer said: "This demo takes you through the first area of the game - the Spawning Pools, and contains all the lovely feedback and QoL changes that came from the playtest (thanks again for everyone who got involved in that!)".</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xrRyV6uc4PQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/40589278eeac7538b2ff5e92da76e88c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xrRyV6uc4PQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mudborne is a casual nature management sim about discovering &amp; breeding frogs!<br/>
<br/>
You awaken from your hibernation to find your pond abandoned and empty. Through a combination of crafting minigames, menu management and puzzle solving, experiment with genetics to breed new frogs and recover what was lost.<br/>
<br/>
Using the genetic keys of the new species you create you can unlock the paths between the waking and dreaming worlds, explore the land of those still hibernating, and embark on a journey to help restore the lost populations and find out what happened.</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires confirmed for a March release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The most popular game from Paradox Development Studio, Hearts of Iron IV, is set for a new country pack expansion on March 4th. Released originally in 2016, it's the most played game from PDS with a 46,735 concurrent player peak from the last 24 hours. Much bigger than their other games. </p>
<p>With the newest DLC, Country Pack - Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires, Paradox said: "Imperial ambitions collide in the challenging lands of Central and South Asia. The British Empire is secure in the Raj and Iraq, but has long held designs on influencing oil rich Iran and unconquerable Afghanistan - also targets of an aggressive Soviet foreign policy from the north. Rewrite the history of a region caught between bowing to a larger alliance and homegrown dreams of national strength. Can you defy the odds and possibly resurrect the glories of a far distant past?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FW103FLlgM0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f42164077029990cbfa679a05b10e745.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FW103FLlgM0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hearts of Iron IV: Graveyard of Empires includes new content for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iran: Iran is a potential great power, hemmed in by the pressure of the Soviet Union and the British Empire. A significant new Focus Tree allows the player to resist the imperial incursions that historically weakened Iran, as well as offering potential for a revived and modern Persian Empire in the heart of Asia.</li>
<li>India: The Raj is the jewel of the British Empire, rich and strategically vital. However, a growing independence movement threatens to disrupt the war effort and dissolve the empire. A large focus tree focused on the struggle of Indian Independence offers many alternate historical paths, including the revival of the East India Company as a corporate nation, as well as the possible freedom of the Princely States, restoration of the Mughal Empire and more.</li>
<li>Iraq: Take control of this British client state and try to chart your own path, embracing the calls for pan-arab nationalism and siding with the axis against the allies. Manage the many competing ethnic and religious factions in Iraq and develop the strategically important oil fields.</li>
<li>Afghanistan: The historic Graveyard of Empires, isolated from the wider war, offers many alternate paths. Continue the historical path of neutrality and isolation, or choose the road of rapid industrialization and building a new power in the mountains of Central Asia.</li>

      <title>Check out the demo for retro styled isometric solve &#39;em up Blackford PI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BitGlint Games have released a demo for Blackford PI, a retro styled isometric detective adventure that looks really charming. Announced by the developer on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ericretro.bsky.social/post/3lhret6uovs2a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, the demo has a Linux version.</p>
<p>According to the developer they were inspired by retro classic 8-bit games like MOVIE, Contact Sam Cruise &amp; the Magic Knight series. They said the puzzles you'll find are built on a traditional verb/noun structure but implemented via a menu system.</p>
<p>More: "Set in 1940s New York in the offices of a secretive engineering &amp; design company, You play Clarence Blackford, a man tasked with unravelling the mysterious goings on at Midtown Design Bureau".</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/blackford-pi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">check out the demo on itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>The developer also previously released <a href="https://bitglint.itch.io/melkhiors-mansion" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Melkhior's Mansion</a>, a colourful retro throwback to classic games from the 80s with a ZX Spectrum inspired colour palette. I'm sure a few older readers will love that one. That also has a Linux version available.</p>

      <title>Tryhard is a sports RPG about managing an underdog rugby club in New Zealand</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grapefruit Games recently revealed Tryhard, a sports RPG about managing an underdog rugby club in New Zealand.</p>
<p>"You were just a tourist visiting New Zealand - but now you're managing an underdog rugby club somehow. Everyone expects you to fail. You've never even played rugby before! But you'll prove them wrong, challenge the champs, and win the Ramphorlie Shield."</p>
<p>Writing in an announcement on Steam they give a little more detail on their thought process for this one, titled "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3443270/view/500565049177276422" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">A Sportslike Manifesto</a>". Basically, they want to refresh the entire sports genre with it as other traditional sports games "ignore too many aspects of sports, and thus, have stagnated and offer little to gamers today". Definitely has my curiosity piqued here.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oO6uRbBykeg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d481a1e20d913e824c567dcdf6775c06.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oO6uRbBykeg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>TACTICAL TURN-BASED AUTO SPORTS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh blend of tactical RPG, auto battler, and sports genres.</li>
<li>Build the perfect squad from 15+ recruitable characters and dozens of skills inspired by real-life rugby.</li>
<li>Rugby knowledge is OPTIONAL. <em>It’s OK, many rugby players don’t know anything about rugby either.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>MANAGE A SPORTS CLUB</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Search for club sponsors and fundraise for new equipment.</li>
<li>You’ll need to recruit a secretary, treasurer, and patron too.</li>
<li>File paperwork and argue with the bank! <em>The possibilities are endless.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>LIVE IN VIRTUAL NEW ZEALAND</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you lose, the story mode continues, just like real-life.</li>
<li>Explore an authentic 3D recreation of the biggest city in New Zealand!</li>
<li>Keep your day job, pay the rent, feed your dog, go on dates… <em>but definitely DO NOT fall in love.</em></li>
</ul>

      <title>Crytek lay off 15% of staff with Crysis 4 on hold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More news on some job losses today following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/unity-continues-laying-off-staff-as-troubles-continue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unity game engine layoffs</a>, we have Crytek also shedding staff and shelving Crysis 4. On X / Twitter, the official Crytek account <a href="https://x.com/Crytek/status/1889623029723885913" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> an image announcement. Crytek said it will affect about 15% of their staff, so about 60 people.</p>
<p>I've copied the text and image below to save you clicking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavorable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years. It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15% of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>
<p>While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services.</p>

      <title>Unity continues laying off staff as troubles continue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After all the mess that was the Unity fees situation, the troubles continue, with another round of layoffs at the game engine developer.</p>
<p>Multiple reports by now former employees have spread, including a <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/an-update-on-behavior/1598451" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> from Behavior Package Tech Lead, Shanee Nishry, that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Behavior Community,</p>
<p>Thank you for your love and support for our project. Unfortunately we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer.</p>
<p>I’ve reached out to leadership to ask if they can open source the project, but there is no guarantee.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank you so much again for your kindness and support and your amazing engagement and feedback. I wish we could take Behavior to the finish line we wanted to get it to.</p>
<p>Farewell </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One entire team gone, along with reports across Unity of others being told their time is up. Like André de Miranda Cardoso, Unity Lead Game Designer, who noted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andre-mc_unfortunately-i-was-affected-by-the-latest-activity-7295024528282288128-4mqz/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> that they've been included in the layoff. Another Florence (Rolland) Rolland-Soulier, who was a Senior Software Enginner, noted they were also let go in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294815856256049152/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> mentioning "another wave of mass layoffs hit Unity".</p>
<p>In an article on <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">80.lv</a>, where they've seen the email that was sent to staff from Matthew Bromberg, Unity President and CEO, which clearly noted how Unity are focusing on adverts a lot with tighter advert tech integrations following the merger with ironSource <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/unity-to-merge-with-ironsource-with-a-buzzword-salad-press-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Unity for comment.</em></p>
<p>A good time to remind you of the free, open source and cross-platform <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> that has made huge advancements in the last few years with more game developers picking it up.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.21 released fixing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle eyes and security bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta since December 2024, Valve have now released SteamOS 3.6.21 as stable for Steam Deck bringing in some bug and security fixes.</p>
<p>Here's all that's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/520831247493103691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a rendering issue with characters' eyes in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</li>
<li>Added support for the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller.</li>
<li>Fixed Linux kernel CVE-2024-50089.</li>
<li>Fixed mpg123 CVE-2024-10573.</li>
<li>Fixed libarchive CVE-2024-20696.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2681699051739359856gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></p>
<p>Don't go expecting Steam Input to support the extra buttons on the top of the 8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless though, as they're done via 8BitDo software. Much like with the 8BitDo Ultimate 2.4G Controller, the back buttons cannot be changed either.</p>

      <title>Keep Driving is a refreshing road trip management RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A road trip RPG that blends in some inventory management and unique turn-based battles that has you fight off everything on the road from tractors to abandoned suitcases, Keep Driving is a charming and clever game worth your time. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>Tested on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 9.0-4</a> working perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1101130751739305509gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1101130751739305509gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here you're trying to get across the country to join up with friends at a festival. It's a long way though, filled with dangerous roads and all sorts of strange people wanting to be picked up along the way. You'll be ensuring your car stays in top shape, along with sorting through your inventory often and attempting to keep up your own energy levels. It's a really unique blend of game features.</p>
<p>The developer said The Oregon Trail is one of the main inspirations for the game, and going into it knowing that should give you a reasonable idea of what type of gameplay to expect. It's like a modernised version of it with an early 2000's vibe. It's just captivating from the moment you set off and start to burn some rubber.</p>
<p>One of the really interesting ideas here is the battle system. It's not like you're getting out of your car and hitting people, instead it's about the encounters directly with everything being a possible danger, but also at times quite lucrative for loot. This could be overtaking another vehicle, getting lost, dealing with puddles of water, your car making weird noises, potholes and lots more random events.</p>
<p>The battles are turn-based and each turn has the possibility to reduce your car durability, your personal energy, your money and your gas. The attacks come as various icons that appear on the bar at the bottom of the screen, and you have various abilities to reduce how much damage each will take every turn. These abilities of yours need you to drag them over the bar to match up their icons as much as possible to remove the harmful effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11928045591739303689gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11928045591739303689gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since it's a road trip game, there will be hitchhikers to pick up (or not). As you pick up more passengers they will all add to your abilities during these battle encounters. They will also add to the overall atmosphere of the game, sprinkling in some chatter along the way. Like my first passenger, who has a condition where they just fall asleep all the time, who kept asking me not to dump them in the rain as they didn't want to fall asleep in a puddle. Passengers gain experience and level up to become more important as the trip goes on too.</p>
<p>You also get to constantly upgrade your vehicle (and unlock more) as well. There's quite a lot of upgrades and customisation you can do here. Simple things like changing the colour but also proper upgrades like tyre types for different bonuses, engine upgrades, roof upgrades and more.</p>
<p>There is of course a lot that can go wrong during the game. Constantly trying to balance your different attributes is actually quite a bit more challenging than expected. You really do need to ensure you're always nicely stocked up, skipping even a single shop on your trip can end up quite fatal. Don't worry though, you can always call your parents to bail you out, but if they don't — game over.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8379871931739304461gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8379871931739304461gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You also have character status effects to deal with too, that you will want to get rid of as soon as possible as they will debuff you during your run. Things like being cold, that you could get rid of by drinking some hot coffee, will add to your durability damage during events. Or if you're starving, which will increase your energy costs.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A procedurally generated pixel art world to explore one road at a time.</li>
<li>A nostalgic early 2000s setting with an emphasis on the analogue.</li>
<li>Use turn-based ‘combat’ to solve situations (like getting stuck behind a tractor).</li>
<li>Pick up misfits, oddballs and lost souls as you go.</li>
<li>Featuring a killer soundtrack by local indie bands.</li>
<li>Multiple endings to unlock when you return to the road.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>While it works great on Desktop Linux, it's not yet a perfect experience on Steam Deck due to some text being too small and no controller support (which they said they're working on). Feels like it <em>should</em> be a perfect fit for handhelds when they sort those two issues out.</p>
<p>Love it. Wonderful idea with some great music and the pixel art is terrific too. Absolutely worth grabbing.</p>

      <title>Linux gaming overlay MangoHud version 0.8 is out now with Intel GPU support, improved Wayland keybinds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a short testing period, the Linux performance overlay MangoHud had version 0.8.0 released today to bring new features and fixes to one of my favourite open source projects. This also powers the built-in overlay on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p><em>There's no major changes from the Beta that I previously reported on, so I'll just refresh your memory here.</em></p>
<p>This release adds a few more applications to the blacklist to stop it appearing and causing issues with them including the Ubisoft Store (UplayWebCore.exe), halloy (IRC client) and Plutonium Launcher (plutonium.exe, plutonium-launcher-win32.exe).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21461146021739293656gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21461146021739293656gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Customized MangoHud, click image to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>If you like my simple horizontal layout you can find it on <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/199a3341f0d91d2f306375a76ab4e7f3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Just pop it into "~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf".</p>
<p>By default, it will look more like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/127365671739293438gol1.jpg"/></p>

<li>logging would sometimes crash if it returned an empty vec.</li>
<li>fix double-logging of avg fps.</li>
<li>nvidia: warn if both nvml and xnvctrl are unavailable.</li>

	<ul>
<li>The shim is preloaded first instead of the opengl library</li>
<li>it checks to make sure there is an opengl context to hook before loading mangohud</li>
<li>this should resolve some crashes. More detailed information here <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/commit/c22ced01083fd32476b0bdd8b969ee749631469a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">c22ced0</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using exec and inside steam runtime, launch command using <code class="inline-code">steam-runtime-launch-client</code>
<ul>
<li>If mangohud is used inside flatpak, you need to allow your app to speak on <code class="inline-code">org.freedesktop.Flatpak</code> dbus address.</li>
<li>Example if you're using mangohud in steam: <code class="inline-code">flatpak override --user --talk-name=org.freedesktop.Flatpak com.valvesoftware.Steam</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Intel GPUs support (integrated and discrete, i915 and xe drivers)
	<ul>
<li>Temperature is only available in linux 6.13+</li>
<li>Temperature and Power Usage is not available for integrated gpus</li>
<li>VRAM and GPU Usage is per-process not per-system (that would require root rights)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiple GPUs support:
	<ul>
<li>By default, MangoHud displays all GPUs. To select needed GPUs, you can use <code class="inline-code">gpu_list</code> or <code class="inline-code">pci_dev</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Params</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">network_color</code> sets the color of the network hud element</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">display_server</code> shows if the display server is Xorg, Xwayland or wayland</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_list</code> set the GPUs to display in the hud e.g gpu_list=0,1</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">proc_mem</code> and <code class="inline-code">io_read</code> now works properly in gamescope (mangoapp)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Excellent narrative adventure Scarlet Hollow is getting a greatly expanded &#34;soft relaunch&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best narrative adventure visual novels on PC, Scarlet Hollow is getting a big juicy update in March that's basically a "soft relaunch" of the game. From Black Tabby Games, they also made the very popular Slay the Princess.</p>
<p>The update called Scarlet Hollow - The Roads Untraveled, will launch on March 3rd. It comes with a whole lot including over "70,000 words of new story content" across Episodes 1 and 2 which allow you to explore previously unseen paths.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14250912701739290682gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>We're also getting an overhaul to the user interface and visuals, a small update to Episode 3 and 4 and they're hoping to also have a cut ending for Episode 4 make it in time too.</p>
<p>They said that "Not only will the first two chapters feel more dynamic once this update is out, but the new and expanded content will better position us to make Episode 5 hit just the way we'd like it to". Going by the Steam page, a total of 7 episodes are planned to be released eventually.</p>
<p>Scarlet Hollow has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">A bit more about it if you missed it before:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A heavily branching narrative where your decisions (actually) matter</strong>. The relationships you forge and the decisions you make will dramatically alter your journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A complex paranormal mystery</strong>. Investigate haunted houses, strange sightings in the woods, a deteriorating mine, and more as you try and piece together what happened in Scarlet Hollow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trait-based dialogue and role-playing.</strong> Scarlet Hollow's dialogue system is driven by role-playing elements that let you choose who you want to be. Are you quiet and observant? Hot and clueless? <strong><em>Can you talk to animals</em></strong>? 21 different character builds change how you interact with the world and how your story unfolds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A dynamic relationship system that reacts to your every choice and changes how your story unfolds.</strong> People won't just like or dislike you. Become friendly rivals, bitter adversaries, best friends, or mild acquaintances with everyone in town based on how you approach the story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Original monster designs </strong>inspired by Appalachian myths and cryptids<strong>.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No jumpscares.</strong> All of the horror in Scarlet Hollow comes from dread, tension, and a sprinkle of disturbing imagery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A touch of romance.</strong> Whether you're into goths, dads, moms, paranormal investigators, mysterious recluses, or <strong>actual monsters</strong>, you'll find something waiting for you here. And if you'd rather avoid that entirely, your story won't be any less for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hundreds of meticulously hand-drawn and traditionally inked backgrounds.</strong> Every background in the game is hand drawn and inked by Ignatz-winning graphic novelist Abby Howard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fully immersive art.</strong> Each major character has dozens—and often hundreds—of hand-drawn sprites that interact with backgrounds and capture a full range of lighting, emotion, environment, and outfit changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: “Before diving into Scarlet Hollow’s final chapters, we wanted to take the opportunity to make its opening act more reflective of the extreme agency and deep character writing that defines the later episodes,” says Tony Howard-Arias, co-founder at Black Tabby Games. “Episode 1 was the very first game we made, and while we’re so proud of the impact it’s had on people, we’ve also learned so much since its release. We’re better game designers, better writers, and we know our characters much more intimately now than when we started. We’re so excited to give old fans an opportunity to re-explore the beginning of their journeys, and we can’t wait for a whole new crop of players to enter the Holler for the first time.” </p>

      <title>Fight off pesky humans and raise spider babies in Isle Goblin, a blend of Stardew Valley and Terraria</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kilowatt Games are currently working on Isle Goblin, a curious blend of features from the likes of Stardew Valley and Terraria that I'm pretty excited to see more from.</p>
<p>With a big mixture of features including dungeon crawling, big-boss combat, town building, farming and much more that you can play alone or with up to 8 people it has a lot of fun sounding ideas. The developer has been doing video logs on YouTube about it for 3 years now, and the progress on it is looking really impressive.</p>
<p>More about it: "Human scum have invaded your island, and it's up to you to defend your territory! Embark on a journey filled with action, exploration, and the joy of nurturing a thriving goblin community. Grow crops, raise livestock, and build a bustling farm to sustain your goblin tribe. Delve deep into the long-untouched depths, mining precious resources and discovering hidden treasures that will aid you in your fight against the encroaching humans."</p>
<p>Check out their preview video from 2024:</p>

<p>Being made in Unity, the developer was looking at switching game engines like a lot of developers when the big Unity fee situation happened back in 2023. They've continued on Unity for now though, but in one video mentioned they do plan to use something else for future projects.</p>
<p>In a much more recent video, they estimate the game might have a demo out around May:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engaging top-down RPG gameplay centered around exploration and construction.</li>
<li>Cultivate crops, tend to livestock, and manage your farm to ensure your goblin tribe's prosperity.</li>
<li>Uncover rich mineral deposits and dig deep into underground caves for valuable resources.</li>
<li>Explore the fully-destructable terrain.</li>
<li>Engage in intense battles against formidable human bosses.</li>
<li>Discover human "artifacts" (garbage) and use them to your advantage.</li>

</ul>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.3 is out now with big fractional scaling improvements, drawing tablet upgrades and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Plasma 6.3 has been released and it's another beautiful sounding release! Filled with new features and fixes for my favourite Linux desktop environment. <em>Plasma is also used on the Steam Deck for the Desktop Mode.</em></p>
<p>For those of you scaling up your desktop there's some good news with this release. The developers overhauled how fractional scaling works, making a "stronger effort to snap things to the screen’s pixel grid, greatly reducing blurriness and visual gaps everywhere and producing sharper and crisper images". Sounds awesome and they said it works at high zoom levels too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1442913371739287563gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1442913371739287563gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Plasma 6.3</em></p>
<p>For people who own a drawing tablet there's plenty of improvements there too. There's an overhauled system settings page for tablets, along with a bunch of new configuration options to really set it up how you want it. Laptop users should rejoice too, since you can now configure the built-in touchpad to be turned off to not interfere with typing.</p>
<p>Panels, like the bar at the bottom in the above screenshot, can also now be cloned. Plus the Kickoff launcher to go through applications had a tweak to only change category (Games, Graphics, Office etc) when you click on them, instead of flicking through constantly whenever you hover the mouse.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Lots of other changes like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto random password being created when setting up a network hotspot.</li>
<li>Discover store will show sandbox apps that have permissions changing with updates.</li>
<li>Discover will also show if a package is directly from a developer, verified or from a trusted third party.</li>
<li>System Monitor got improvements to be more accurate and use less CPU resources.</li>
<li>More accurate colours when using the Night Light feature.</li>
<li>+ lots of smaller additions and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more in the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.3.0/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The release schedule has also been <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2025/02/10/about-the-plasma-release-schedule/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changed</a>. In future, Beta releases will be spread across 6 weeks instead of 4, with a new Beta every 2 weeks.</p>

      <title>Monster taming roguelite Aethermancer from the devs of Monster Sanctuary gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monster Sanctuary was good fun, so I'm real keen to see more from moi rai games. Their sticking to monster taming / capturing with Aethermancer and now you can try it out in a demo.</p>
<p>There's some interesting design choices here. Firstly with the capture system, where you capture the soul of a creature so you can rebirth it into your party. A fun difference to capturing specific monsters directly. The second is that when one of your creatures dies in battle, it's gone forever. That's not the end of it though, as this game is all about the cycle of death and rebirth. It's all about the rogue-lite hook here of meta progression, with creatures becoming stronger from previous lives.</p>
<p>Check out the demo trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pDoTiL14oIg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ee133adbe573a369cbf28308d6dbb3c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pDoTiL14oIg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What they said to expect from the demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Classic Roguelite experience but mixed with monster taming.</li>
<li>You are expected to fail! But collecting new Monsters and gaining experience will eventually make you succeed!</li>
<li>While this is a demo, you can spend a lot of time until you discover everything it contains.</li>
<li>15 playable monsters with hundreds of skills</li>
<li>2 Areas (and Champions to defeat!)</li>
<li>NPCs with a dynamic dialogue system that react to your choices</li>
<li>A lot of meta upgrades: soulbonding monsters (to be able to play with them on new runs) for example</li>
<li>Languages supported: English, German, French, Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese</li>
<li>Controller support</li>
<li>An additional 'Heroic' difficulty challenge if you defeat the game on normal.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For this one they're not going with Team17 as publisher again. Instead, they're working with offbrand games.</p>
<p>As far as I know it will have Linux support at release, but the demo needs to be run via Proton. I've tested it working perfectly with the latest Proton 9.0-4 from Valve. This is definitely one you're going to want to try. Some really slick animations in the battles, with some really fun creature design too. The way you gain new creatures is also quite interesting, and definitely different to other games in the monster taming genre.</p>
<p>I have a feeling this is going to hook me badly at release, the demo was delicious. Check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3462260/Aethermancer_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the demo</a> on Steam.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VII is out now with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games / 2K have today fully launched Sid Meier's Civilization VII, along with full Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>It's really great to see continued Linux support here. Previous versions of the game were external ports by Aspyr Media, that often ended up quite outdated with broken cross-play for Linux but this time around it appears Firaxis did it directly.</p>
<p>Since I personally purchased it to play and cover it here, you'll have to keep in mind I've had basically no time with it so far, as 2K did not reply to my email about a key. At least on a very cursory look the Linux version appears to run quite nicely, coming in with Vulkan as the default rendering API. The game does have Denuvo Anti-tamper on Windows, but as far as I'm aware as usual that does not apply to the Linux version.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19090530531739281298gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19090530531739281298gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Civilization VII on Linux, Max Settings</em></p>
<p>There's been a lot of complaints about the game as a whole, with it only just hitting above 50% positive user reviews on Steam to a Mixed overall score. Lots of complaints about the UI, to bigger issues with gameplay changes, so it's clear Firaxis have work to do, and it's coming in hot with patches already out during the previous Advanced Access period.</p>
<p>In a way, I get the complaints, it feels less personal than older Civilization games with the changes to progression. When you go through Ages, you pick an entirely new Civilization, which then changes how you'll continue to progress through it. However, it also makes it feel quite fresh compared with previous iterations. I'm already not a fan of some of the forced diplomacy choices though, as you have to respond in some situations and depending on how much Influence you have accumulated you may be locked into a specific choice you really don't want to do.</p>
<p>At least in terms of performance, so far I can't see any issue with the Linux version, it's incredibly smooth on my system (Ryzen 5800X, Radeon RX 6800 XT, Kubuntu 24.10). The game is absolutely gorgeous too, it really does look incredible. Performance, naturally, does degrade as the game goes on though. But on max settings it's looking really good.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5741169531739281192gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5741169531739281192gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Firaxis did already give a small roadmap of what they're doing about all the feedback as a reminder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prioritizing UI Improvements:</strong> Our top priority is improving the UI. We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more. We're committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Implementing Community-Requested Features:</strong> Several key features that we've seen you ask for will be included in upcoming patches as free updates, and we'll continue to work with the community to improve and add to the game. We're still working on exact timing, but can share the following items are being prioritized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
<strong>Rolling Out Quality-of-Life Updates in Patch 1.1.0 (Deploying in March):</strong> Work is already well underway on Patch 1.1.0, which includes fixes and adjustments that were already on our radar. This list includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, plus additional bug fixes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that it's Steam Deck Verified, I was definitely curious to see for myself what the experience was like there too. Testing on an LCD 512GB Steam Deck and it actually surprisingly does feel really good there. Although, it took an age to reserve the space before even downloading it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19780500261739282500gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19780500261739282500gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Civilization VII on Steam Deck, Medium Settings, Zoomed Out</em></p>
<p>The save system is <em>not</em> using the Steam Cloud though. If you want saves across devices, you have to login to the 2K account system (which worked fine), and then specifically save it in the cross play menu. Once you've sorted your 2K account, loading a game on Steam Deck from another device is not an issue at all.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the game does include some text scaling and it all looks pretty good, nice and readable. Nice to see Firaxis remember that not everyone has perfect vision and play on a huge monitor. There's even a "viewing experience" setting to change it between handheld, TV and desktop.</p>
<p>As for performance on Steam Deck: on the Medium preset at least in the early game, it's holding 60FPS when moving around the map when zoomed out. But when you zoom right in, the performance is all over the place when scrolling. Changing down to Low didn't help, so you probably want to just lock it to 30FPS to make it smoother overall. Plus, it looks absolutely fine on Low on Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4613226341739282985gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4613226341739282985gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Civilization VII on Steam Deck, Low Settings, Zoomed In</em></p>
<p>I also found an odd controller bug here, as I was completely unable to change the graphics preset on Steam Deck while in a game. The drop-down doesn't correctly grab controller input and even touchscreen was no help. It worked from the main menu though. Other than that, they've done some great work to make it accessible on the controls overall.</p>
<p>Nice to see Sid Meier's Civilization VII running very nicely on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck at release.</p>

      <title>Stellar Blade to be optimized for the Steam Deck and other &#34;UMPC environments&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shift Up have today released another earnings report for the end of 2024, and in it they talk about some expectations for the upcoming PC release of the popular Stellar Blade. <em>A PC release was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/stellar-blade-should-come-to-pc-in-2025-dev-expects-sales-to-exceed-console/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed in November last year</a>.</em></p>
<p>On page 6 of their business performance report PDF, there's a Q&amp;A with this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q.2: What are the expected results of PC version, and why?</p>
<p>A.2 : In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version. We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry.</p>
<p>We have identified and analyzed both successful and underperforming cases of console exclusives released on PC, and we are preparing to release the game in a way that ensures continued success in the PC market. This will include optimization, enhancing user convenience, adding supplementary content, and tailored marketing strategies<br/>
unique to Shift Up. In particular, we plan to optimize the game to ensure smooth gameplay even in UMPC (Steam Deck) environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>UMPC means usually "Ultra-mobile PC".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9990785961739217556gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Stellar Blade</em></p>
<p>Hopefully then, we should see Stellar Blade performing well on the Steam Deck, and across the PC platform as a whole, whenever it releases. We've seen quite a lot of poorly performing game releases over the last year, so I do hope Stellar Blade doesn't disappoint.</p>

      <title>Try the new demo and trailer for Rift Riff, a fast and &#34;strategically tight&#34; tower defense game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love tower defense games, you're going to want to check out the new demo and trailer for the upcoming Rift Riff. A "strategically tight" game, the developer says.</p>
<p>With quite minimalist design, and pretty fast gameplay, this one is really easy to get into. Quite a fast-moving game, one that will end up taking your full attention as you run around the map building various towers. It was previously shown off in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/godot-engines-2024-showreel-shows-a-lot-of-fun-stuff-for-the-open-source-game-engine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine showreel from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Rift Riff puts you in the shoes of a lone rifter navigating the depths of spacetime in search of treasure. Across a shifting cycle of lush and barren worlds, you summon towers, harvest energy, and battle hostile inhabitants – all to expand your arsenal and plunge even deeper into the unknown."</p>
<p>A new trailer is live too below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M79VZIUvhHA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6a969c566a45be7d531ebe777053aad4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M79VZIUvhHA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo should give you just over an hour gameplay, showing off the first 8 worlds. The full game has much more:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>14 worlds with 2 or more scenarios each.</li>
<li>15 tower types with 8 overpowered upgrades.</li>
<li>24 monster types with varying behaviors.</li>
<li>28 challenges with increasing difficulty.</li>
<li>All the good Steam stuff: achievements, stats, controller support, cloud saves.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've tried out the demo, which has a Native Linux version, and came away really impressed with it. Some lovely visual design and fantastic audio to go along with it. Definitely keen to see a whole lot more from this one. The action is great when you get further in and have a few extra tower types too.</p>

      <title>Popular game launcher Playnite will get Linux support but it&#39;s still a while away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Playnite is a very popular free and open source video game library manager, one used a lot on Windows and a developer has confirmed they will be working on Linux support.</p>
<p>The launcher supports linking games from Steam, Epic, EA, GOG, Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect and other services. This includes emulation, a fullscreen mode, theme support, an extensions system and much more. It's an incredibly feature-filled app.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9684077911739185952gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Right now, there's no Linux support, but that will eventually change. They're currently waiting on <a href="https://avaloniaui.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Avalonia UI</a>, an open source framework for building user interfaces with .NET, to get some improvements though. As noted by a developer on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/59#issuecomment-2634737400" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2025 update</p>
<p>Upcoming major release (P11) will be on modern open source and multi-platform .NET runtime but will still use Window only WPF based UI. This is for several reasons, one of the main ones being that Avalonia's developer experience is not, in my opinion, good enough to be used in project like Playnite. Playnite heavily depends on community made extensions and themes, often developed by hobbyist developers, not professionals, and Avalonia is simply not user friendly as much as I would like it to be for us.</p>
<p>We are 100% moving to Avalonia at some point in future, it's just not going to be with Playnite 11 release.</p>
<p>So current plan is to release Playnite 11, continue developing it for Windows only and once Avalonia's DX improves (they are promising major tools improvements with their upcoming Accelerate program), I will start porting P11 to Avalonia.</p>
<p>Once we have polished Windows version of Avalonia based Playnite, I'll start working on Linux version. I don't want to make just straight port of Windows version, that wouldn't be good enough. I would really like to have Linux specific feature available on release, like Wine/Proton specific features, Epic and GOG plugins using Legendary and heroic-gogdl respectively, stuff like that.</p>
<p>To sum this up, Linux version is definitely something I plan to work on in future, it's just going to happen later than originally planned.</p>
<p>As far as macOS version, no idea about that. It's definitely not something I would look into sooner than having Linux version more or less done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Really great to see more and more support for Linux everywhere.</p>
<p>If you need an alternative right now on Linux / Steam Deck the most comparable would likely be Heroic Games Launcher and Lutris.</p>

      <title>Blender Studio announced Project DogWalk, a &#34;Micro-Game&#34; made with Godot</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blender Studio, the creative unit of the free open source Blender project, recently announced work has begun on their second video game with Project DogWalk. It's going to be a small one, made to be playable in a single sitting, so they're calling it a "Micro-Game".</p>
<p>This is something I missed from <a href="https://studio.blender.org/blog/announcing-project-dogwalk/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">back in January</a>, thanks to a tip in <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Discord</a> (there's a dedicated suggested news channel for me to pick things from you!). With it being a small game they said it's going to be centred around these points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A playtime of a single sitting.</li>
<li>Oriented around a single mechanic.</li>
<li>Extended primarily via replayability and player expression.</li>
<li>Reliant on a reusable &amp; modular asset library.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a "papercraft" art style, it will take place in a small snow-covered woods. As they explained: "You play as an adorable big dog who, together with their kid owner, is trying to decorate a snowman with the best things they can find nearby" they continued "While you are a force of nature that the environment cannot stop from exploring, your little companion is very easily dragged and flung around and might get stuck. It's about whacky slip-ups and building a relationship".</p>
<p>Since the Blender Game Engine they used in their first game, Yo Frankie!, no longer officially exists they're going with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> this time around.</p>

<p>Godot already has pretty good support for importing from Blender, but part of this development will also allow the Blender Studio team to "research how this can be improved even further". </p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for your next coffee break is The Campsite, a short but sweet modern point and click adventure that looks to be worth your time. It has a Native Linux version available.</p>
<p>From developer Guillem Espias they said "If you have a passion for graphic adventures but never find the time to play, this might be exactly what you’re looking for". It's about an hour long, good for casual gamers and a great starting-off point for adventure games. There's even a bit of a plot twist to make it stick in your mind after you finish.</p>
<p>More about it: "An enthusiastic adventurer is about to embark on a special mission: leading a chaotic team of unruly members in the hunt for a mysterious treasure. A vibrant night in the woods awaits, unveiling a memorable adventure, but beware—the shadows conceal a watchful presence. They are not alone..."</p>

      <title>Commandos: Origins gets an April release date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Commandos: Origins from Claymore Game Studios and Kalypso Media is set for release on April 9th, where you get to see the beginning of this legendary elite force. I'm actually quite excited about this one. I spent more hours than I probably should have in the original Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, back in the 90s.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/101002351739182280gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release: “The Green Beret couldn’t have said it better with his iconic phrase ‘Consider it done,’” said Jürgen Reusswig, Studio Director at Claymore Game Studios. “After more than four years of setting up a new studio, design and development and the invaluable community feedback from various playtests, operation ‘Release’ is a go for Commandos: Origins. We are proud and excited that players will now be able to experience the origins story of the elite unit which started this legendary franchise.” </p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Challenging Real Time Tactical Stealth Gameplay:</strong> Make the best use of your Commandos’ <strong>unique abilities</strong>, infiltrate enemy facilities, and hit them where it hurts most before disappearing into the shadows. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An extraordinary team:</strong> Featuring <strong>6 infamous characters</strong>, each with their own storied history, banding together to form an extraordinary fighting force – the Commandos: Take control over Jack O’Hara “the Green Beret”, Thomas “the Sapper” Hancock, Francis T. “the Sniper” Woolridge, Samuel “the Driver” Brooklyn, James “the Marine” Blackwood, and Rene “the Spy” Duchamp and lead them to success.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Many paths to victory:</strong> The detailed, varied, and interactive environments offer <strong>multiple approaches</strong> to reach your goal. Sneak, climb, <strong>drive in various vehicles</strong>, or hide and creep your way to mission success! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>On your mark:</strong> A modern user experience with <strong>precise and intuitive controls</strong> enables you to control the commandos with expert precision. <strong>Coordinate complex actions simultaneously</strong> to overcome heavily fortified targets. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fight on all fronts:</strong> Play through <strong>more than 10 missions</strong> in historically authentic <strong>WWII</strong> environments, spanning from the barren Arctic to the African desert, with a range of core and voluntary objectives that will require your <strong>full tactical expertise</strong>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There is no I in team:</strong> Take on missions with a friend in the <strong>2-player cooperative multiplaye</strong>r mode, either <strong>online</strong> or via <strong>local split-screen</strong>.  </p>
</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your modern point and click adventures? Paranormal point-and-click adventure Slender Threads from developer Blyts looks like a good one. From the same team as Kelvin and the Infamous Machine, it promises a much darker and more ambitious tale but still features plenty of humour.</p>
<p>Fully voiced too featuring a cast some might recognise from the likes of Hades, Telltale's The Walking Dead, Unicorn Overlord, and many more. More about it: "Haunted by a prescient nightmare, traveling salesman Harvey Green wanders the peculiar seaside town of Villa Ventana in a desperate attempt to stop a series of shocking deaths—before he's next."</p>
<p>The Prologue, that's still free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1682490/Slender_Threads_Prologue/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, had a lot of positive user reviews.</p>

      <title>Early Access wasn&#39;t enough for Alterium Shift so it&#39;s now on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by classics like Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, and Final Fantasy - Alterium Shift entered Early Access in 2023 but it's now back on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drattzygames/alterium-shift/description" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. Seems the Steam release simply wasn't good enough, so they're asking for more funds to finish the game.</p>
<p>From the Kickstarter: "We’ve already made great strides in Early Access, delivering 50% of the core game. But now, we need your support to bring the full vision of Alterium Shift to life, complete with enhanced combat, expanded content, and exciting new features. Together, let’s craft a JRPG that blends the charm of the past with the innovation of today."</p>
<p>They're hoping to raise at least $50,000, with over $40,000 pledged at time of writing and still 24 days to go. So it's quite likely this will get fully funded.</p>

      <title>Decky Loader for Steam Deck gets a store upgrade to show currently installed plugins clearly </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>With the 3.1.3 stable release out now: when you go into the store it will actually properly show you what you already have installed, which it didn't do well before. Plugins you have installed will have their button state <em>Reinstall</em> if you already have it, along with a tick on the current version you have installed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14983166681739121089gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14983166681739121089gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>If you pick a different version, it will then again change the button again to note the current status like if you're going to do a <em>Downgrade</em> or <em>Update</em>.</p>

      <title>Valve ban advertising-based business models on Steam, no forced adverts like in mobile games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: 10/02/25, 11:29 UTC</strong> - Turns out this was actually <em>already</em> a rule that Valve had (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhsxkmaj7c2c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). It was listed on their <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/pricing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pricing</a> page but this change has made it a lot more visible with its own dedicated section. Still, good to have a reminder this awful practice isn't allowed on Steam.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Valve have updated the developer guidelines for releasing a game on Steam, making it clear that the scourge of mobile gaming advertising-based business models are not going to work on Steam.</p>
<p>There's a new <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">advertising page</a> in the public Steamworks documentation that goes over what is and isn't allowed. What's allowed is as you might expect like games can have real-world product placement, cross-promotions with other games are fine and paid advertising outside of Steam is also fine.</p>
<p>What they've done here is completely ban paid advertising getting in your way inside the games. As their rules state now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not Supported</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising. If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase "paid app," or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/microtransactions" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Microtransactions</a> or <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc//store/application/dlc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Downloadable Content (DLC)</a>.</li>
<li>Developers should not use advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game.</li>
<li>Developers should not charge other developers for access to Steam features. These include sale pages, bundles, store pages, franchise pages, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">onboarding</a> page has also been updated to add "Applications with advertising-based business models" to the list, which also includes their previous ban on "blockchain technology that issue or allow exchange of cryptocurrencies or NFTs" <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/10/valve-banning-games-that-allow-exchanging-cryptocurrencies-or-nfts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that came in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>What this doesn't do is stop developers throwing up a big advert for another of their games, that's fine, this is specifically about the business model you often see on mobile platforms. Imagine when you go into a game, want to unlock a feature or do anything, but it tells you to watch an advert first before you can proceed. That's what Valve are putting a stop to here.</p>
<p>I've never personally experienced a game that did that on Steam, although I'm sure some developers have tried it. But it's a huge and annoying thing in mobile games. Glad to see it just won't ever be a thing on Steam.</p>
<p>Valve have done a lot of really consumer-positive changes over the last few years like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-games-will-now-need-to-fully-disclose-kernel-level-anti-cheat-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">making sure developers note kernel-level anti-cheat</a>, a recent change of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-now-warns-on-steam-pages-if-an-early-access-game-hasnt-been-updated-in-a-long-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting Early Access games that aren't being updated</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/steam-getting-proper-season-pass-support-with-clearer-guidelines-and-refunds-for-cancellations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proper Season Pass system that includes more complete info</a> and refunds for missing DLC content and more.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-24 released with a new save game detection feature (and now GE-Proton 9-25 too)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 10/02/25</strong>: something that happens quite often with GE-Proton, a quick hotfix release is out with <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-25</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOTFIX:</p>
<ul>
<li>update Dragon Age Inquisition xinput patch introduced in GE-Proton9-11 to fix a regression that caused performance issue in Black Desert Online and possibly other games: <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4676" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">doitsujin/dxvk#4676</a> (thanks loathingKernel and Blisto)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>GE-Proton 9-24 is out now bringing with it the usual assortment of fixes, plus as interesting change that will help games detect saves from other games.</p>
<p>This new save detection feature helps with the likes of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered and others that can use save data from a previous game either for sequels or new editions. It does this by scanning and reading through all Steam Library folders for a correct app ID to link them up. This was included in an update for <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-protonfixes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">umu-protonfixes</a>, part of a database of specific game fixes for running Proton inside and outside Steam (like with Heroic / Lutris).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other changes for GE-Proton 9-24 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added patch that adds PROTON_PREFER_SDL option. If <code class="inline-code">PROTON_PREFER_SDL=1</code> is set proton will not prefer hidraw and instead will expose both sdl and hidraw. it can fix input in a few games when not using steam input</li>
<li>Added patch that adds PROTON_NO_WM_DECORATION (and WINE_NO_WM_DECORATION) option. If <code class="inline-code">PROTON_NO_WM_DECORATION=1</code> is set, it sets <code class="inline-code">WINE_NO_WM_DECORATION=1</code> which will disable window decorations. This can fix an issue where if clicking on a window border in some games in borderless window mode it would click through the border straight to the desktop. By disabling the window decorations it removes the pixel offset caused by them, which is what causes the mouse click confusion.</li>
<li>Removed previously disabled nvidia latency reflex patches as they have now all been merged with the exception of the winevulkan patches. Winevulkan patches are now applied -- nvidia latency reflex should now work where available.</li>
<li>updated wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d to latest upstream</li>
<li>updated dxvk-nvapi to latest upstream</li>
<li>import steamclient changes from upstream</li>
<li>import vrclient changes from upstream</li>
<li>import proton changes from upstream</li>
<li>fixed configure script issue with autodetection of podman or docker not working, --container-engine option no longer needs specifying during building</li>
<li>ccache enabled by default in configure script, --enable-ccache option no longer needs specifying during building</li>
</ul>

      <title>Everwarder is a fresh tower defense roguelite hybrid about clearing the darkness</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Everwarder asks: how long will your light last? Not very long in some of my attempts. It's a fresh feeling spin that merges tower defense with a bit of roguelite action together, as you attempt to break through the darkness.</p>
<p>You assume the role of a mystical guardian charged with protecting a crystal that houses their trapped friend. Darkness expands, enemies emerge and it's up to you to sort out the defences. It's not a plain tower defense game, since you have direct free movement to float around and explore too. You're also not just protecting this crystal but trying to expand through a changing map.</p>
<p>As the developer explains: "Every run presents unique challenges and evolving mechanics, ensuring no two sessions feel the same. Players unlock new abilities, artifacts, and tools, with opportunities to create overpowered builds. Each decision—whether upgrading units, collecting resources, or combining artifacts —matters. Failure is simply another step forward in the game’s overarching progression system, where resources earned unlock new unit tiers, artifacts, and upgrades, allowing players to return stronger and last longer against the darkness."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cpq3nv2fLdQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64ef86587cdd9c610b568497d93df1be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cpq3nv2fLdQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a really vibrant neon-infused style, with a nice little intro to pull you in and after the tutorial it really opens up into something you'll likely end up spending quite a number of hours in. The way you mine through the darkness to reveal enemies and progress through the map is pretty fun, as is dealing with the different enemy types with their strengths and weaknesses requiring some good planning to deal with.</p>
<p>The upgrade system is an interesting one here too. You get to upgrade towers directly during a run when you build up enough resources, you also get the meta spiritual limbo world inside portals you find to upgrade various things further and then there's another layer on top of that where you collect enough of a certain resource to evolve yourself. The evolving system gives you a choice of three cards to buff a particular type of tower, but it will also help affect other types on future evolutions. There's so many things going on in this one. Enemies evolve too, the longer they're going and the more time they have to get to you, the stronger they will end up as they too can transform into a stronger tier.</p>
<p>While you can upgrade your "towers", you also get overall upgrades</p>
<p>While quite simple in terms of the style, what the developer has achieved with it is impressive. Thanks to some wonderful music and sound effects for everything plus lots of little animations going on, it really all flows together nicely that it's real joy to watch when it gets going.</p>
<p>"With Everwarder, I wanted to create something that breaks away from the static nature of traditional tower defense games,” said Oleh, the solo developer of qLate. “The core of this game is that you control the flow of enemies, making it entirely your responsibility if they overwhelm your defenses.”</p>
<p>I would say they've succeeded on their vision here.</p>
<p><em>The Linux version tested works perfec</em>tly.</p>

      <title>Please don&#39;t distract me I&#39;m trying to dig a big hole over here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Can you truly call yourself a "gamer" if you haven't at least spent a good few hours doing nothing but digging a hole? I have answered the call and my hole has been dug.</p>
<p>I am of course talking about A Game About Digging A Hole that just today released on Steam from developer Cyberwave, who is also currently working on Solarpunk.</p>
<p>With your battery-powered shovel in-hand, you begin — very, very slowly. Tap tap tap, dig dig dig and away you go digging your little hole. Just uh, don't ignore those battery warnings like I did as a test, say goodbye to your ore and health. It's a game after all, the developer had to gamify basic digging right? There's no great big special hook here, you really are just digging a hole in the back garden of your newly purchased house. Although, there's apparently some buried treasure there and perhaps something you might wake up that's a little spooky.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4pCvvyzFlXA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/908945083bd531db8f2cbf966e6eae91.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4pCvvyzFlXA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I can already feel your judging eyes as you read this. Is this a time where I should be reconsidering some life choices? Sat here just clicking away digging a deep dark hole. I'm getting flashbacks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/please-save-me-i-have-discovered-leaf-blower-revolution/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Leaf Blower Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>What is it about games doing some of the most boring things that we end up spending our time with? It reminds of PowerWash Simulator as well, a game I've spent far too much time on. I could clean my own house and garden, but no — it's a video game so it's somehow entertaining! Here I get somewhat similar feeling with the repetition of digging, grabbing ores, selling ore, upgrading and repeat. Progress!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14052217321738932601gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Progress is good! After a bit you get to upgrade your shovel so it makes bigger holes, and you can get a bigger battery to dig for longer, a bigger backpack for more ore. Yes! I am a digging maniac. Rock and stone! Then you get your jetpack, and suddenly it feels that little bit more fun, but drains your digging battery too — dammit. I need to dig more!</p>
<p><em>At least here there is an ultimate goal: finding out whatever the heck is at the bottom. Wait, is there a bottom?</em></p>
<p>Hold on, now my little radar is pinging something, I'm getting close to something, how exciting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16705103411738932755gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It was a bag of money! Excellent! Now I can upgrade my bag to collect more ore, sell it all to upgrade again and then dig some more. Clearly I am but a simple creature because this is has grabbed my full attention.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell it works perfectly on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest stable Proton 9.0-4</a>. See you in the hole, watch your step.</p>

      <title>Cast n Chill is a gorgeous looking pixel-art idle fishing game coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Revealed in a press email today is Cast n Chill from developer Wombat Brawler. A game where you explore serene lakes, rivers, and oceans. Catch rare fish, upgrade your gear and reel in legendary catches - with your loyal pup by your side.</p>
<p>I don't play too many games like this, as idle games aren't usually my cup, but some of them are genuinely great to kill some time with. Cast n Chill caught my attention with the really lovely artwork plus it has both active and idle modes so you can do as much or as little as you want to chill with it.</p>
<p>Their first announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="R1W0HcyuQAk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5a6160e4b001dd6814593ea85ac3634.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/R1W0HcyuQAk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrade:</strong> Catch fish, sell for profit and <strong>upgrade your gear to catch rarer fish species.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Explore: </strong>Relax at your favourite fishing spot.</li>
<li><strong>Modes:</strong> In <strong>active mode</strong>, cast and reel in quicker to speed up production.</li>
<li>If you'd rather Cast n Chill you can let <strong>passive mode</strong> take over and return when ready to see what your catches of the day were (with <strong>offline progression</strong> too).</li>
<li>Cast n Chill on a second monitor or use the <strong>resizable window</strong> for single monitor setups.</li>
<li><strong>Collect:</strong> Complete your collection of 100+ common, rare and legendary fish species including fresh and salt water.</li>
<li><strong>Pupper! </strong>Don't forget to bring your loyal pup along for the ride!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This was revealed as part of the ongoing Steam Idler Fest that runs until February 10th, and is apparently a hit across Japanese social media according to the developer.</p>
<p>You'll need Proton to run it on Linux but I don't foresee any issues there. The developer said it's set to release in June.</p>

      <title>BAFTA-nominated narrative adventure Vampire Therapist gets a Couples Therapy DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Therapist is a narrative adventure / visual novel with a sprinkle of dark comedy that was nominated for a BAFTA in 2024, and now it's expanded with the Vampire Therapist - Couples Therapy DLC. The game has Native Linux support, and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Therapist: Couples Therapy</em> will explore themes of revolt, duty to humanity, and the complications that can arise from age gaps. What's a few hundred years between lovers? Well, as you can imagine it can cause all sorts of problems and that's what you'll be dealing with here. You slip back into the role of Sam Walls, a reformed cowboy turned accomplished therapist.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xjVPzVaSWVI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/acdcda4efdd3e55725678efa159b15e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xjVPzVaSWVI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about the content:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam has his work cut out for him as he seeks to help two vampires, battling with both domestic and personal struggles, as well as social discontentment following their demises during bloody revolutions in France and Iran. </p>
<p>But that’s not all! This juicy new helping of content takes place during the annual Bachfest in Leipzig — home of Johann Sebastian Bach— where a ghost of Leipzig haunts the streets. It’s Sam’s job to track down the troubled soul between therapy sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In a time of political turmoil, we hope <em>Vampire Therapist: Couples Therapy </em>will help players process difficult questions about the citizen's role in civil society and find a little respite in love and compassion. And if all else fails, we have vampire fart jokes.” said Cyrus Nemati, Creative Director of Little Bat Games. </p>
<p>The DLC is to launch today for £2.49 / €2.99/ $2.99.</p>

      <title>A deck-builder for busy people, Bramble Royale: A Meteorfall Story plans full Steam Deck support for launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Slothwerks have announced their upcoming turn-based card-battler Bramble Royale: A Meteorfall Story will have full Steam Deck support at launch. It's a faced-paced deck-builder for busy people apparently. <em>Did they make this for me?</em></p>
<p>Here's what they said on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2372950/Bramble_Royale_A_Meteorfall_Story/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the goals during development was to have a quality Steam Deck implementation right at launch, instead of being added on after the fact. That meant rethinking some of the UI and putting in hours of play on the Steam Deck to iron our potential issues: small text, missing support, etc... The result is a polished implementation that quickly became one of our favorite ways to play.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have a Steam Deck or prefer to play with a gamepad - let us know what you think later this month during Steam Next Fest! You'll have the opportunity to try a brand new Bramble Royale demo with full Steam Deck support then.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="R1t0fevRNJ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb474b823d425476912ee0ede818489f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/R1t0fevRNJ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: Play cards, maneuver your allies, and brawl in fast-paced battles.</p>
<p>Winning the Bramble Royale isn't about fighting fair - it's about winning. The crowd demands spectacle! Take advantage of Wild Cards to change the rules of the brawl, exploiting them to your advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix-and-match multiple upgrades on a single card to build overpowered combos.</li>
<li>Impress the crowd and power-up in battle by completing challenging feats.</li>
<li>Build your dream team of 3 heroes (from a pool of 8), each with their own unique set of cards.</li>
<li>Discover more than 200 cards to turn the tides of battle in your favor.</li>

      <title>Take-Two CEO believes AI will actually increase employment and productivity</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You have to hand it to the people in suits at the top, they all sure do love AI, and the latest to be bullish about it is Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry</a>, Zelnick was asked a few general questions but AI bit was saved for last.</p>
<p><em>It's important to understand that Take-Two are a big name considering they own the likes of  Rockstar Games, Zynga and 2K.</em></p>
<p><strong>GamesIndustry asked: </strong>"Another hot topic at the moment, and you've mentioned it in the past, is AI's role in the industry. What role does it play in Take-Two's strategy going forward and are there any guardrails you think the industry needs to be considering in terms of AI?"</p>
<p><strong>Zelnick replied: </strong>"Artificial intelligence is an oxymoron, there's no such thing. Machine learning, machines don't learn. Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever. I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment.</p>
<p>To the contrary, the history of digital technology is that technology increases employment, increases productivity, increases GDP and I think that's what's going to happen with AI. I think the video game business will probably be on the leading, if not bleeding, edge of using AI.</p>
<p>But in terms of the guardrails, if you mean, you know, not infringing on other people's intellectual property by, you know, poaching their LLMs, yeah, we're not going to do that. Moreover, if we did, we couldn't protect that, we wouldn't be able to protect our own IP. So of course, we're mindful of what technology we use to make sure that it respects others' intellectual property and allows us to protect our own. Apart from that, I really can't think of any new guardrails that need to be implemented."</p>
<p>Like it or not, this appears to be where the industry is going. So much so that since January 2024, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve now require AI disclosures from developers</a> on Steam. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/gdc-2025-survey-shows-pc-game-development-growing-with-lots-interested-in-valves-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GDC 2025 survey</a> gives us some interesting insight though, noting that 52% of developers survey noted they're working for companies that have implemented generative AI</p>
