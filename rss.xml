      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It took quite a while for the issues to be figured out but Halo: The Master Chief Collection (MCC) now has improved Steam Deck support. This should also mean it works better on desktop Linux too.</p>
<p>While the game did somewhat work for a while, you weren't able to play fully online with others due to problems with Easy Anti-Cheat. Whatever the issues were have been <em>partially</em> solved now so players on Steam Deck can jump into EAC enabled games in multiplayer matchmaking and the Custom Game Browser. In a <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/14589112499348" target="_blank">support post</a> on the official site, the developers said that future updates will "continue to improve Steam Deck compatibility as well".</p>
<p>Testing it myself and yup — playing online works just fine:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3426247311680725846gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3426247311680725846gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>There's some known issues though, like the launch options being <em>backwards</em>, that you need to keep in mind for now until future updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When launching Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Steam Deck, selecting one of the available Anti-Cheat launch options will result in the game launching with the opposite launch option. For example, selecting “Anti-Cheat Disabled” will result in MCC launching with Anti-Cheat enabled.
<ul>
<li>Until this issue is resolved in a future update, players on Steam Deck must select the “Anti-Cheat Disabled” launch option to access multiplayer matchmaking and the Custom Game Browser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shortly after being removed from or leaving a party with other players via the Roster menu, players on Steam Deck may experience Halo: The Master Chief Collection freezing or crashing.</li>
<li>Players on Steam Deck are unable to play <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403583912084" target="_blank">Campaign Co-op or Spartan Ops</a> with players on PC or Xbox consoles. Attempting to do so may result in players accessing gameplay, however, all sessions will eventually experience a “Connection Interrupted” error or a similar disconnection.
<ul>
<li>Campaign Co-op and Spartan Ops will function as expected if all players in the group are playing on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>By "PC", they of course mean specifically Windows in the above quoted list.</em></p>
<p>For people trying it on Steam Deck for the first time, just be aware it won't automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard to sign in. You need to press STEAM + X to have it appear, and it may take a few taps in the input box to have it actually get focus from the keyboard. Hopefully they work on that too.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky gets another huge update with Interceptor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No Man's Sky works great on Linux desktop and Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> and now I need to jump back in because the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/interceptor-update/" target="_blank">Interceptor update</a> sounds great. <em><strong>Update</strong>: a small patch went up in version <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2023/04/interceptor-4-20-1/" target="_blank">4.20.1</a> shortly after, to fix issues on Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>Some of what's in the update includes: the new procedurally generated Sentinel Interceptor ships you can salvage to add to your collection, corrupted planets to visit full of strange things to discover, VR interface improvements, system authority ships now get procedurally generated, multiple new special corrupted enemies to fight, some enemies can now use cloaking, a new type of jet-pack, new ship components, Sentinel quadruped combat units got a big scary overhaul, new multi-tools, new sentinel capital ship battles and the list goes on…</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the Stellaris 16 (Gen5) for people with money to burn</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have some spare cash and in the market for a pricey and powerful Linux laptop? TUXEDO would like a word with you for their Stellaris 16 (Gen5). For those of you who want desktop-class performance in something easier to move around, perhaps it might be interesting.</p>
<p>This upgraded model now includes the ability to spec it up to a RTX 4090, which is pretty ridiculous to have in a laptop. It also has a Cherry MX ULP keyboard for much improved typing, although they offer a cheaper silent option too. It has a 240Hz G-SYNC 2560 x 1600 screen and 16GB DDR5 RAM at a minimum too. When it comes to the base configuration you'll get an Intel Core i9-13900HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 2 x 8 GB DDR5-5600-MHz and a 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1195649991680708672gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1195649991680708672gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Connectivity plenty too according to the specs sheet as it comes with a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, Microphone-in, Headpone-out, a SD/SDHC/SDXC card reader, Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4 Gen 3, HDMI 2.1, 2.5Gbit LAN and even space to hook up their TUXEDO Aquaris water cooling system.</p>
<p>They seem to be especially hyping up the cooling system on this one, noting it has "6 heatpipes" with a "liquid metal thermal compound on the CPU and GPU" that allows it to hit top performance and stay there claiming it's "superior to the one of typical thin-and-light gaming notebooks and allows for comparatively higher performance or alternatively quieter operation" to provide "outstanding performance for content creation or gaming".</p>
<p>Pricing starts at €1763.87 EUR (excl. VAT). They expect it to become available at the end of April, with pre-orders live now.</p>

      <title>Fanatical and JSAUX team up for Steam Deck game and dock discounts</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fanatical and JSAUX have done a little <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1643526757461512192" target="_blank">teaming up</a> between a Steam Deck bundle of games and and some Docking Stations. What's the deal? Well if you shop with either of them, you'll get a voucher for the other.</p>
<p>On the Fanatical side it's on their <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100721639-13797872?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-play-on-the-go-bundle%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3DPTW" target="_blank">Play On The Go Bundle</a> where you can buy 3, 5 or 8 games together from a selection and get them cheaper and then you'll get a discount voucher to use on a JSAUX Docking Station (models HB0604 or HB0702). The game bundle has these options:</p>
<ul>
<li>198X</li>
<li>Creepy Tale 1 &amp; 2 Double Pack</li>
<li>Cyber Hook</li>
<li>Dead Island: Riptide Definitive Edition</li>
<li>Door Kickers: Action Squad</li>
<li>Evan's Remains</li>
<li>Ghost 1.0</li>
<li>Gone Home + Original Soundtrack</li>
<li>Horizon Chase Turbo</li>
<li>Hunted: The Demon's Forge</li>
<li>Iconoclasts</li>
<li>Legends of Kingdom Rush</li>
<li>Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix</li>
<li>PC Building Simulator</li>
<li>Pile Up! Box by Box</li>
<li>Snooker 19</li>
<li>Speed Limit</li>
<li>Splasher</li>
<li>Thunder Wolves</li>
<li>Totally Reliable Delivery Service</li>
<li>Youtubers Life</li>
</ul>
<p>The other side is JSAUX where you can grab either the <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/m-2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0604" target="_blank">HB0604</a> or <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">HB0702</a> Docking Station, and then you'll get a discount voucher to spend at Fanatical (both sides give 10% off). So if you're in need of new games and potentially a Docking Station for the Steam Deck, this might be a good little deal to grab.</p>

<p>What have you been playing recently? I've been blasting through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379720/DOOM/" target="_blank">DOOM</a> (2016) and I'm very close to finishing it. The Steam Deck has been great for getting me to go back through my vast Steam Library. Going to need a break after that though, it's quite intense so I'll perhaps jump into something a bit less full-on for my next game.</p>

      <title>System76 CEO teases in-house Linux laptop code-named &#39;Virgo&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux hardware vendor and creator of the Pop!_OS distribution, <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a>, have made their own desktop for a while now but they're moving onto a custom laptop next. Something they've been planning for some time, as they've gradually scaled up their in-house manufacturing. </p>
<p>On <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141037787618107" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, System76 Founder and CEO Carl Richell, showed off two photos of the panel for the LCD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Virgo” is the code name for the laptop we’ll manufacture at our Denver factory. This is the LCD “A” panel milled from thin 6061 aluminum bar stock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12049056341680633701gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12049056341680633701gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14465118761680633703gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14465118761680633703gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click above to enlarge the photos - credit to Richell</em></p>
<p>Clarifying some more details in a reply to a <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@serebit/110141401345257994" target="_blank">question</a> from Budgie desktop developer Campbell Jones, Richell <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141775241580126" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There wouldn't be an ODM or OEM involved in this case but some outside suppliers would make parts for us that we design. We don't have SMT machines for PCBs for instance but we do the EE work. We have laser, mills, brakes, 3D printing, paint, fastener machines and other machines and techniques in the Denver factory. There's a video on our desktops page that shows some of them. <a href="https://system76.com/desktops" target="_blank">https://system76.com/desktops</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, they'll be <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@carlrichell/110141779272995706" target="_blank">going with</a> the keyboard design from their <a href="https://system76.com/accessories/launch" target="_blank">Launch</a> keyboard too, so the Launch must have been quite popular for them to stick to the rather different layout.</p>

      <title>Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments releasing May 11th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive confirmed today the Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments DLC will release on May 11th along with a major free update for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ATwJhpy_FQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4737c3f817906b7ddede7299a897f9cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ATwJhpy_FQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main highlights of the DLC include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Grand Tournaments: Host a grand demonstration of feats of arms, attracting nearby nobles and wandering knights. Choose the events, set the destination and use the tournament to improve your social standing or military prowess.</li>
<li>Grand Tours: Take a trip through your realm to take stock of your vassals, gifting them with your benevolence or extorting them for higher taxes.</li>
<li>Grand Weddings: Save your gold for an elaborate ceremony that centers the real meaning of marriage - politics. Honor your in-laws, cater to your vassals and demonstrate your power.</li>
<li>Travel System: Plan your route to these great activities, choosing safety through civilized lands or risking everything for a more direct route through dark forests or dangerous mountains. Ease your way with a large entourage that marks your importance or travel light so you can get down to business.</li>
<li>Knightly Accolades: Honor your best knights with special titles and accolades that will give bonuses to them and the armies they lead.</li>
<li>New Armor Designs: New historical armor designs from across the centuries, integrated with the new Tournament and Accolade systems.</li>
<li>New Western Clothing: New art for clothing designs will show how fashions changed and evolved in Western Europe from the time of the Carolignians to the closing of the medieval era.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Paradox have also given out some info about "Chapter II", a planned series of extra content coming which you can purchase that will include all of these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments</strong>: Join great adventures and activities. Take a tour of your realm to check in on your vassals face-to-face. Host grand tournaments to demonstrate your wealth or military prowess. Impress your friends and rivals with great royal weddings. But, no matter the activity, keep an eye out for schemes, as nothing is better than a party to cloak ill-intentions.</li>
<li><strong>Wards and Wardens</strong>: In this pack, new events add greater depth and interaction to the challenges of raising and educating children. Whether parent, tutor or warden, the personalities of the child and the adult may clash as headstrong or determined children resist the knowledge of their betters. Strong guidance, however, can lead to a lifelong bond across the generations.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy of Persia</strong>: This forthcoming addition for Crusader Kings III lets you relive the dramatic struggle for survival and empire in the lands between the Euphrates and the Indus. With special attention to the culture and history of medieval Persia, Legacy of Persia introduces new systems for Clan government rulers, and expands on the Islamic and Zoroastrian religions dominant in the region at the time.</li>
<li><strong>Elegance of the Empire</strong>: You can dress your Central European characters in the finest of finery with this clothing pack exclusive to owners of Chapter II for Crusader Kings III. Inspired by the historic regalia of the 11th century rulers Emperor Henry II and Empress Cunigunde of the Holy Roman Empire, this pack includes not only new robes and dresses, but historically appropriate crowns and other regalia.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By itself Crusader Kings III: Tours and Tournaments costs $29.99 / £24.99 / €29.99 or you can buy Chapter II for $34.99 / £29.50 / €34.99 to get all of it.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us now Unsupported on Steam Deck, bad look for Valve and Naughty Dog</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's official, Valve put The Last of Us Part 1 through Deck Verified and gave it an Unsupported status on Steam Deck. Not really a good look for either Valve or Naughty Dog.</p>
<p>Before release, Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said pretty clearly on <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1601694903724953600" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that "Ellie and Joel will grace the Steam Deck… don’t worry!". However, Druckmann didn't exactly say when, so I suppose the statement isn't exactly false just yet? Worse though, is that Valve began using it in their Steam Deck clips on the official Steam Deck <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and it's even still showing it today:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12472031531680608102gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12472031531680608102gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pretty misleading isn't it? While it only shows briefly, it's a very well known scene in the game (and the TV show…), that plus Druckmann's statement together aren't great, no doubt some people pre-ordered it based on the hype surrounding it. Especially a nuisance given how specifically on Steam Deck, half the refund window was taken up by it doing the shaders.</p>
<p>Personally, I've been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/the-last-of-us-on-steam-deck-is-not-great/" target="_blank">rather disappointed</a> with the situation. It's not just the Steam Deck performance though, the game as a whole had a really rough launch on PC in a clear case of another game just being released too early. There's been quite a few bigger games launching in a state over the last year but at least they weren't being hyped up for the Steam Deck in the way this was. Hopefully both Valve and Naughty Dog will reflect on this.</p>
<p>Naughty Dog have said on <a href="https://twitter.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1643025458232180737" target="_blank">Twitter</a> yesterday, April 3rd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reminder that we will have a new hotfix live for The Last of Us Part I on PC tomorrow, and a patch on Friday.</p>
<p>We will share patch notes when the hotfix is live, and let you know some of what to expect in Friday's patch ahead of its launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the follow-up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And while we know many of you would like to play The Last of Us Part I on Steam Deck, we are prioritizing fixes and patches before submitting it for verification.</p>
<p>We will keep you updated of its Steam Deck status as we continue to improve the PC version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Kinda amusing their note about verification but Valve ran it through anyway…</em></p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.7.0 is out now for Epic Games and GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher has a brand new release available for helping you manage Epic Games, GOG and more on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Easily one of my favourite open source projects! It doesn't just help you deal with Epic and GOG though, since you can add anything else into it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14072729971680606812gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14072729971680606812gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main new features in Heroic version 2.7.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Auto Install UbisoftConnect when running UbisoftConnect games.</li>
<li>UI improvements on the GamePage to make it cleaner and organized.</li>
<li>Library render improvements and download GOG game images in the background.</li>
<li>Improve <code class="inline-code">pc/applegamingwiki</code> accuracy and add <code class="inline-code">gamesdb</code> info.</li>
<li>Improvements on Epic Login.</li>
<li>macOS binaries now are signed with an Apple Developer certificate.</li>
<li>Translations update.</li>
<li>Show game logs from the card's context menu.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Numerous bug fixes were also included like a fix for shortcut names, Discord integration, auto-enabling anti-cheat runtimes, properly stop all Wine processes when closing a game and more.</p>
<p>See all on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.7.0" target="_blank">release page</a>.</p>
<p>It can also be used on Windows and macOS and even <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/heroic-games-launcher-vs-epic-games-launcher/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> seem to love using it, noting how they're enjoying it on Steam Deck and how it loads so much quicker than the official Epic Games app on Windows too. Nice to see many more people appreciate open source projects like this.</p>

      <title>Hell Let Loose planning Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The hardcore FPS Hell Let Loose had a 2023 roadmap reveal, and they've confirmed they're planning to add Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>It uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which has been the problem in running it currently as developers need to manually enable it for Linux / Steam Deck. Even though Valve worked with Epic Games to ensure both the newer EOS version and the older version of EAC are supported, it's not always as easy as just hitting a button and making sure things are in the right place. As we've seen from Halo MCC and others, sometimes it just doesn't work, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>At least in this case, Steam Deck support is firmly on their roadmap, which a target for September:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9451743611680600045gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9451743611680600045gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So I'll be following it along, to keep you informed on any developments there. No doubt it will use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> (not Native). September is still a while away so it gives them plenty of time for testing and figuring out any problems and gives Valve even more time to improve Proton further too.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck mention is at about 6:26:</p>

      <title>Asus announce the ROG Ally gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More companies are beginning to see there is a market for a PC gaming handheld, with Asus planning to release the ROG Ally. Initially, this seemed like an April Fools joke but it turned out to be real.</p>
<p>For the GamingOnLinux readership it might not be exactly what you're going to instantly sign up for, since it will be coming with Windows 11, but it's interesting to see more companies jump in and no doubt after a while Linux drivers will appear like they do for pretty much everything. We may even see Valve support it with their <em>eventual</em> release of SteamOS 3.</p>
<p>Coming in a bit smaller than the Steam Deck with no touchpads, it will limit what you're able to play a bit more but it will have a 16:9 1080p display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a custom AMD APU they claim is the "fastest yet", a dual-fan design and eGPU support. Asus claim it will offer double the performance on the Steam Deck but they're not giving out any tech specs or battery life details.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s5lq4Q7YAjE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e691c224fbd3dd63c8be4bd4164aed6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s5lq4Q7YAjE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Asus are a much bigger name than the likes of AYANEO, GPD and Onexplayer so they could potentially offer prices a bit lower since they're likely able to take on a bit more of the costs. Naturally though, they will still have to price it at a point where it makes enough money to be profitable to a point where it makes sense, so I still expect it to be a fair bit higher than the Steam Deck pricing since they can't make up for it by the 30% cut Valve get from Steam games.</p>
<p>LinusTT and Dave2D managed to take a look at it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="drLZxyv79Oo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/abc0e73469cb3db8d4d5986fe53c3846.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/drLZxyv79Oo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S9a3oAiN2ik"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/243875d4adfc1aadff50ec7a660ba827.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S9a3oAiN2ik" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They're only prototypes right now, so there's of course every chance that Asus <em>don't</em> actually end up releasing it but given how far along it is, I imagine they will. You can follow it on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus/learn-about-rog-ally/pcmcat1678398541884.c" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> if you want to be notified of when it's available, no word yet on availability in various regions.</p>
<p>Given how Valve have clearly said there's no planned Steam Deck refresh for some time, as they're waiting for it to be truly worth it, this is the closest I've been to believing it has some <em>real</em> competition. It all depends on the price.</p>
<p>What do you think about this?</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 23.04 &#39;Lunar Lobster&#39; Beta released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next major update for Ubuntu Linux is about to arrive, with the Beta of Ubuntu 23.04 'Lunar Lobster' now available. With the final release scheduled for April 20th, this will be one of the last times you can test for issues before the main release.</p>
<p>One of the major changes is their new installer, which is a Flutter snap, although the original installer is still around for people that have issues with the new one.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20386171871680539634gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20386171871680539634gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The majority of the user-facing changes are from their <a href="https://release.gnome.org/44/" target="_blank">GNOME 44</a> upgrade though, so you should hopefully get a better performing desktop, along with the enhanced Quick Settings menu and lots more. My favourite feature there is that after years of waiting, there's finally thumbnails in the GNOME file picker (if the app is using GTK4). Hopefully more applications will upgrade to take advantage of the upgraded file picker.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21441431141680540592gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21441431141680540592gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Of course there's lots of other updated software included like Linux kernel 6.2, Firefox 111, LibreOffice 7.5.2, Thunderbird 102.9, BlueZ 5.66, NetworkManager 1.42, Pipewire 0.3.65, Poppler 22.12 and xdg-desktop-portal 1.16. They're also still testing their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/canonical-want-help-testing-their-steam-snap-package-for-ubuntu/" target="_blank">new Steam snap</a>.</p>
<p>You can download the Beta below, depending on which you wish to test:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/23.04/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/releases/23.04/beta/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Budgie</a></li>

      <title>Couch gaming Linux distro ChimeraOS 41 out now, better AYANEO and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a PC hooked up to your TV or need a Linux distribution that might work better on a handheld PC? A new release of <a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> is here, and it's a necessary upgrade. Think of it a bit like SteamOS with fancy extras.</p>
<p>ChimeraOS 40 and 41 released quickly after are needed, because the boot system has changed and if you don't update to it, you <em>won't</em> be able to update to ChimeraOS 42 when it comes out. The developer also mentioned that if you're on a BIOS/legacy boot, to do a fresh install for the new bootloader.</p>
<p>ChimeraOS 41 uses a Linux kernel version 6.1.21, Mesa version 22.3.4 (patched for ANV compatibility with Gamescope) and NVIDIA driver version: 530.41.03.</p>
<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switched to the systemd-boot bootloader for new installations. BIOS/legacy installations are no longer supported.</li>
<li>Added a migrations framework to the system updater in preparation for migrating existing installations to systemd-boot in a future release.</li>
<li>Switched to PCSX2 emulator core for PlayStation 2 games. A BIOS file is now required.</li>
<li>Added support for Super Game Boy and Atari 7800 games.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Deck failing to boot.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam Deck audio.</li>
<li>Added full controller support for AYANEO 2 and AYANEO Geek models via HandyGCCS.</li>
<li>Reduced network timeouts in the game configuration downloader to avoid connection hangs in poor network conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed automatic disk mounting in desktop mode.</li>
<li>Wake on USB will now be automatically enabled when a gamepad is plugged in.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where session changes would not persist after a reboot.</li>
<li>Added an Xorg desktop session option.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where game configuration tweaks were not being applied on first boot.</li>
<li>Added the ability to override the exe file used to launch GOG games. WarCraft II now works.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam failing to start with some displays at 4K when using AMD GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed formatting and mounting of secondary storage devices in Steam.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Windy Meadow expands on the fantastic text-adventure Roadwarden this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roadwarden is a really quite fantastic illustrated text-based RPG, and now the world is set to expand in a big way with Windy Meadow - A Roadwarden Tale. They're going with a completely different style this time though, and it appears to be far less text-heavy while still blending in elements of an illustrated visual novel. Seems like it could be interesting.</p>
<p>The story: "Over the course of three interwoven stories, players will be introduced to protagonists Vena, Fabel, and Ludicia, three citizens of the sleepy and serene village Windy Meadow, as they navigate grand life choices regarding their futures. </p>
<p>Will talented huntress Vena depart the harmonious but harmless village and leave her family behind in pursuit of riches with a merchant guild? Can Fabel finally embrace his talents, ditching the figurative shackles of his difficult past as he chases his dream of becoming a famous bard? And will outsider and herbalist Iudicia take hold of her love life, choosing not to marry a man she doesn’t really love at the risk of leading a lonely future?"</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Story Unfolds: </strong>Unlike most visual novels, Window Meadow replaces the majority of narration with animated character sprites. More than 99% of the in-game text represents dialogues.</li>
<li><strong>Three Protagonists: </strong>Follow three very different protagonists and uncover their problems, fears, and the challenges they face. Their varying personalities make for interesting and complicated relationships with the multitude of moody side characters.</li>
<li><strong>Choices Matter: </strong>From the seemingly small to the life-changing, choices players make can affect dialogue options, NPC feelings, and game endings.</li>
<li><strong>(Mostly) Harmonious Living: </strong>Enjoy a serene storyworld rich in gorgeous views, gentle rivers, fertile lands, and welcoming forests. In Windy Meadow, even the beasts and dragons tend to keep their distance. But raiders, on the other hand…</li>
</ul>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Epic Online Services for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah yes, launchers and external online services, what a nuisance they can be for Steam Deck and Linux desktop players. Thankfully, Valve keep working away on Proton to fix up issues. Remember <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/prepare-to-see-a-lot-more-of-epic-online-services-with-epics-new-self-publishing/" target="_blank">recently I wrote about</a> how you might see a whole lot more games using Epic Online Services? Well, like what happened with the EA App breaking lots of games, it happened to EOS too.</p>
<p>Valve put up an update to <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">Proton Experimental</a> on March 31st with these fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix EOS services failing to update for Fall Guys, Returnal and other games. This may require Proton prefix to be re-created.</li>
<li>Fix recent experimental regression that made THE KING OF FIGHTERS XV start to a black screen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted above, you may need to re-do the Proton prefix for the EOS fix. On Steam Deck, you can do this by picking a game in your Steam Library going into Properties -&gt; Developer -&gt; Delete Proton files. On Desktop Linux, you'll need to find the game's ID in the steamapps -&gt; "compatdata" folder to remove it. This can potentially cause a loss in save files though, if games don't sync online.</p>
<p>For an explanation of all the different Proton versions see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my original guide on Proton</a>. Proton Experimental gets automatically installed if Valve set it on a game, or you can just search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library (<em>not</em> the Steam Store) to install it. </p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f1GvONkE9S0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6bb07ac6333f611978e50464915ff76b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text guide</strong></p>
<p>Change it per game (Steam Deck)</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included gets a new animated short, plus fun with Meteors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oxygen Not Included is a space-colony builder and probably one of the best. Space is dangerous and of course there's going to be Meteors but now you can have a bit more fun with them.</p>
<p>Not only have they now included options to let you adjust Meteor Showers, so you can adjust their intensity, you can now also construct a building to that will blow them up when they get close. Of course it needs ammo too, so you have to create projectiles for it too. A new long-dead critter has been introduced too in the form of Fossils, so it seems we'll need to be careful when going digging now and you can assemble the full skeleton to unlock a big cache of resources.</p>
<p>There's also weekly blueprint drops, that will unlock during gameplay. The developer said you should get everything included in ~6 hours play time. Check out the new animated short too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lJPAdlLMU6w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ec1b804ea6a4d04739a7c261dcf9961f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lJPAdlLMU6w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can buy Oxygen Not Included on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version and it is Steam Deck Verified. Think I might have to spend a whole lot more time with this, having it working so well on Steam Deck is awesome.</p>

      <title>Humble has a bundle of Survivors-Like games, including Boneraiser Minions (a favourite)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's your chance to jump into the Survivors-Like games phenomenon, so I guess that's what we're calling games like Vampire Survivors now? Survivors-Like? Humble Bundle <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/best-survivorslike?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">has some good picks here</a> but I do find it mildly amusing they didn't manage to pull in the game that started the recent trend for a "best of" bundle.</p>
<p>Going over each title I'll give you the support status across Steam Deck and Linux desktop (either Proton or Native Linux). Here's what you get:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Boneraiser Minions <em>(personal favourite)</em></p>

<p>Overall, a pretty great bundle of games for the price, one not to miss out on in my opinion. Sure is a lot of these games coming along, although we might not yet agree on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">what to call them</a>. You can see a previous video I did on Boneraiser Minions below:</p>

      <title>Stop an organism spreading and protect humanity in Xenospore, now with a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free game Xenospore sees you try to stop the spread of a strange and deadly organism and there's a big upgrade out now. At a very basic level it sort of reminds me of Into the Breach because of the small tile-based world, and the alien stuff. It's very different though. Mentioned here on GamingOnLinux back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/defend-humanity-from-an-alien-organism-in-puzzle-game-xenospore/" target="_blank">September last year</a>, it's come a long way.</p>
<p>You go through 40 levels destroying world tiles to prevent the organism spreading, and then cleansing tiles that have been infected before they become food. It has some great looking pixel-art and the atmosphere on it is perfect. In the new 1.1 version out now the developer added in 15 new levels, 12 new tiles, improved graphics, new game mechanics, various improvements to the gameplay feel and more that you can see in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DNQpdL0iaFc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b262290796174ebd9d0803b8491ae688.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DNQpdL0iaFc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Quite a big fan of this one. Looking forward to seeing more from it!</p>
<p>Available with Native Linux support and it's <a href="https://avivlevy.itch.io/xenospore" target="_blank">free on itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Dark sci-fi roguelike Deadnaut: Signal Lost looks great and it&#39;s out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deadnaut: Signal Lost from the developer of Deadnaut, Zafehouse Diaries and Fear Equation is officially out now with Native Linux support. A game that was mentioned here on GamingOnLinux just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/developer-of-deadnaut-signal-lost-requests-linux-testers/" target="_blank">recently</a>, as the developer was looking for Linux testers. As they promised, a proper demo is also now available along with the full release.</p>
<p>"In this slick, fast-paced roguelike you’ll take control of a single Deadnaut, unlock suit upgrades and abilities, fight cosmic horrors, and investigate drifting wrecks and abandoned moons. But remember: your Deadnaut is not your friend – earn their trust, do your job well, and they might return the favour."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="b0pswW5arCQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e8a1e69d3e1571b743c942fc51b2fca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/b0pswW5arCQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FAST ROGUELIKE GAMEPLAY - Guide your Deadnaut through procedurally generated missions, from floating cryoships and freighters to abandoned settlements, equipping them with a wide array of weapons, upgrades and gear. Fight when you can, run when you must.</li>
<li>TRUST ISSUES - Keep your Deadnaut loyal or force compliance. Pay them off or turn them into a mindless space golem if necessary, but remember: <em>everything comes at a price</em>.</li>
<li>FIVE DISTINCT SUITS AND PLAYSTYLES - Select from five suits, each with dozens of unique skills and abilities. Customise your Deadnaut with weapons, sensors, shields, cloaks and hack tools. Choose from the heavy-duty Labour suit, the ghostly Sensor suit, or the gravity-bending Energy suit, or other playstyles to match your preferences.</li>
<li>TACTICS, UPGRADES, AND CUSTOMISATION - Develop your Deadnaut and maximise their potential by discovering powerful combinations and synergies among 180+ upgrades. Tailor your armour and damage to face the challenges that await you in the twisted depths of the Rip.</li>
<li>THE HUNT IS ON - Stay one step ahead of the Benefactors, an enigmatic enemy in relentless pursuit, determined to stop you from reaching the Rip's source. Armed with advanced tech, weapons and cunning, you'll need to keep your wits about you to evade their grasp.</li>
<li>CREATE YOUR OWN DEADNAUT - Get started with a premade Deadnaut or create your own unique character. Adjust their stats and even import your own photo to truly make your Deadnaut your own.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Really loving the presentation on this one, giving you a claustrophobic feel that heightens the tension and reminds me in a way of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/05/space-sci-fi-drone-sim-duskers-hits-five-years-dev-talks-sales-and-returns-to-indie/" target="_blank">Duskers</a>.</p>
<p>Deadnaut: Signal Lost is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801410/Deadnaut_Signal_Lost/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari DLC releases April 13th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As if it hasn't sucked away enough of our free time already right? Vampire Survivors: Tides of the Foscari is arriving on April 13th. Giving you a bunch more content at a small price of $1.99 / €1.99 / £1.59.</p>
<p>This is the second DLC for the ridiculously popular auto-attacking action survival game, with the first DLC Legacy of the Moonspell being thoroughly well received by players.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9188860131680284014gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9188860131680284014gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"Nestled deep within a continent-sized forest is Foscari Academy, a school where the elite of the world train their children for careers as powerful wizards, indefatigable generals, and expert spies. The Academy is divided into three houses, a premise hitherto untouched in all of fantasy fiction. Three students, one from each house, brave the journey into a forest stuffed with mythological creatures, all to have a jolly adventure, with absolutely nothing interrupting the whimsy. This is all mind-blowingly original stuff, we know, but it only gets better folks."</p>
<p>What to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>8 allegedly never seen before characters.</li>
<li>13 new weapons between base versions and evolutions. Including the sword, the arrow, and the magic.</li>
<li>1 large stage: a forest called Lake.</li>
<li>7 brand new music tracks.</li>
<li>21 achievements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2iZVpnu5Dmc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/daaa9d7bcd634abc08b0e4519ae29312.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2iZVpnu5Dmc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers are still working away on their port to Unity, which is now available in an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1794680/discussions/3/5769714637082190371/?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank">opt-in Beta</a>. Looks like the Native Linux build is there and up to date too. This should hopefully solve some of their performance problems, along with giving them a solid foundation to keep building on and make porting easier in the long run.</p>

      <title>GOG giving away Deep Sky Derelicts during the finale of their Spring Sale</title>

<p>GOG sorted a whole bunch of games into popular and interesting categories to help you find something including:</p>

      <title>Vulkan gets a new extension to improve shaders with help from Nintendo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is a fair bit unexpected. As happens quite often there was a specification update to the Vulkan API, and with it came a brand new extension to help with shaders — which Nintendo contributed towards.</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/developers-developers-developers/" target="_blank">blog post</a> from driver developer Mike Blumenkrantz, and also a full <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/you-can-use-vulkan-without-pipelines-today" target="_blank">announcement</a> from The Khronos Group who oversee the Vulkan API. The official Vulkan announcement post was even written by a developer from Nintendo. Notes from the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, Khronos® is releasing a new multi-vendor Vulkan® extension that aims to radically simplify how applications specify shaders and shader state while maintaining Vulkan’s ethos of being a highly performant “API without secrets.”</p>
<p>This extension is <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_shader_object.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_shader_object</a>. It introduces a new VkShaderEXT object type which represents a single compiled shader stage, along with 4 new functions to manipulate and use VkShaderEXT objects.</p>
<p>Shader objects serve a role similar to pipelines but expose a simpler, more flexible interface designed to empower applications whose architectures and/or needs for “dynamism” might have previously made the use of pipelines difficult. In environments where VK_EXT_shader_object is supported, applications can choose to use only pipelines, only shader objects, or an arbitrary mix of the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post goes into details on what it does, and how it's the "culmination of years of work to bring Vulkan developers ever more powerful and easier-to-use ways to manage shaders and state". They're urging developers who overlooked Vulkan in the past due to being intimidated by it to perhaps give it another look.</p>
<p>And according to the blog post from Blumenkrantz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a very cool extension for Zink. Effectively, it means (unoptimized) shader variants can be generated very fast. So fast that the extension should solve all the remaining issues with shader compilation and stuttering by enabling applications (zink) to create and bind shaders directly without the need for pipeline objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like it's going to be a big win overall, and could result in performance gains in some cases and less stuttering.</p>
<p>To go along with it, NVIDIA already have a new <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Driver</a> available with support added.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA release details of security issues and release new drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA issued a new Security Bulletin, to advise you to update your GPU drivers due to multiple security issues discovered. This bulletin went out today with the email arriving in my inbox moments ago, so here's the details of the issues that affect Linux.</p>
<p>Firstly all driver versions <em>below</em> these are affected: 530.41.03, 525.105.17, 515.105.01 and 470.182.03. So make sure you upgrade if you're on a driver below the version number listed there in each series. The driver actual series doesn't matter, they fixed it it all listed.</p>
<p>Here's what issues affected just Linux or Windows and Linux together:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2023-0189 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.;</li>
<li>CVE‑2023‑0184 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, which may lead to denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.</li>

<li>CVE-2023-0191 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an out-of-bounds access may lead to denial of service or data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0183 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer where an out-of-bounds write can lead to denial of service and data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0180 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in a kernel mode layer handler, which may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0185 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where sign conversion issues may lead to denial of service or information disclosure.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0198 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer can lead to denial of service, information disclosure, and data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0187 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an out-of-bounds read can lead to denial of service.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0199 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an out-of-bounds write can lead to denial of service and data tampering.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0190 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer, where a NULL pointer dereference may lead to denial of service.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0188 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer handler, where an unprivileged user can cause an out-of-bounds read, which may lead to denial of service.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0194 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer driver, where an invalid display configuration may lead to denial of service.</li>
<li>CVE-2023-0195 - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer driver, where an invalid display configuration may lead to information disclosure.</li>

      <title>Stories from the Outbreak, a zombie roguelike RPG out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stories from the Outbreak from Coldwild Games, an indie game development company from Latvia, creators of "Merchant of the Skies", "Luna's Fishing Garden" and the "Lazy Galaxy" series hits Early Access.</p>
<p>The game is set in 2020, with a new disease sweeping through the world (huh — sounds familiar). Zombies rise up, attack and you get the rest, everything goes to hell. You wake up and hear on the radio there's one last ferry to get away, and so it begins.</p>
<p>With it now in Early Access (along with Native Linux support), the developer mentioned the current version has a shorter scenario than what will be featured in the full game. You'll get to see 11 unique characters, more than 15 enemies, and three expansive maps to explore. Planned features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Form a team of survivors, hoping to escape the doomed city. Decide the fates of your team members as you go.</li>
<li>Characters talk between themselves, showing polarization in views. Not every team is going to reach the ferry, but their stories matter. Will different views prevent them from reaching their goals?</li>
<li>Escape the dying world: traverse the area maps in search of shelter and supplies.</li>
<li>Fight zombies when necessary: there are more than 15 unique enemy types in the game.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Europa Universalis IV: Domination releasing April 18th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox has confirmed the Europa Universalis IV: Domination expansion is now releasing on April 18th. This is a full add-on too, not a small story pack.</p>
<p>In this add-in for the popular grand strategy game you will get a bunch of additions for some of the most popular and powerful nations available. This includes entirely new mission trees, historical government reforms, estate challenges and units to add greater variety and sometimes, tough choices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Some of what's new:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Ottoman Empire: </strong>A revised conquest tree with new rewards for pushing Ottoman dominance, including expansion through the new Eyalet system, and new internal changes, such as the new Janissary estate, the new Ottoman Decadence mechanic, and the ‘Ottoman Power Struggle’ disaster.</li>
<li><strong>China: </strong>Different mission trees for the Han Ming and invader empires like the Qing. Choose between expansion and Inward Perfection, and counter the power of the Eunuchs to build a more stable empire.</li>
<li><strong>Japan: </strong>Unite Japan as you deal with the power of the Shogun and the independent Daimyos. Choose to open the country to foreign influence or keep it isolated, while deciding upon different paths of expansion and reform.</li>
<li><strong>Russia: </strong>Free your country of the Tatar Yoke, and transform it into a Great Empire. Choose the path of Peter’s reforms to modernize the state, so your mission tree as well as your mechanics will change and evolve as the game progresses. Use the power of Cossacks and Streltsy to expand your Empire to East and West.</li>
<li><strong>Spain: </strong>Expanded mission trees for Castile and Aragon, with different paths to form Spain, a new mechanic available for the new ‘System of Councils’ government, and decisions about the Army and Navy to get the mighty Tercios and Spanish Armada.</li>
<li><strong>France: </strong>Fight the end of the Hundred Years War, centralize France into an absolute monarchy while dealing with the Wars of Religion, expand into Italy and the Holy Roman Empire, and lead the Revolution through an expanded mission tree.</li>
<li><strong>Great Britain: </strong>Separate paths for either a British Empire or an Angevin Britain, as well as a deeper internal gameplay, with unique features for the English Parliament  and changes to the English Civil War disaster.</li>
<li><strong>Minor nations: </strong>Mission changes, new government mechanics and expanded flavor for Prussia, Portugal and Korea.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Retro racer Super Indie Karts got upgraded with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Super Indie Karts already had Native Linux support, it's nice to see another developer making improvements for Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>More about it: "Super Indie Karts is a classic retro '90s style karting game featuring a large curation of Indiegame karts and Indiegame themed race tracks, in both the 16-bit flat Super style and the 64-bit low poly Ultra style. With Time Trials, Grand Prix, Splitscreen GP, Quick Race, and a few Battle Modes.. there's plenty of ways to tackle the tracks!"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20751910441680176570gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20751910441680176570gol1.jpeg"/></a>Screenshot of me testing it on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>In their March 2023 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/323670/view/6383330087928345070" target="_blank">update</a> the developer made these improvements and it's now Steam Deck Verified too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 16:10 ratio resolutions to the settings, giving a better view on devices such as Steam Deck.</li>
<li>New resolutions include: 640x400, 960x600, 1280x800, 1440x900, 1680x1050, 1920x1200, 2560x1600, and 3840x2400.</li>
<li>Added Steam Deck controller glyphs.</li>
<li>Improvements to First Person View giving much tighter feeling of control.</li>
<li>Moved camera a little further away from kart in mode7 tracks, less cramped feeling now.</li>
<li>Added more freedom to the splitscreen cameras so multiplayer feels more like single player again, still more work to do here on drifting.</li>
<li>Fixed rapid selection problem changing resolution from settings menu in races.</li>
<li>Fixed some navigation help in TeslaTowerII.</li>
<li>Fixed TeslaTower64 being near impossible on 200cc.</li>
<li>Fixed lighting issues in TeslaTowerII and Burrito Bison's Candyland Arena.</li>
<li>Added colour navigation hint to stairwell windows in BattleMania track FourFloors.</li>
<li>Raised/lowered music volume level in a few tracks.</li>
<li>Fixed trophies not having reflections in their material on the podium screen.</li>
<li>Various under-the-hood bug fixes, far too many to mention.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's actually available for the next 6 days in the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/kart-racers-games-bundle?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Kart Racers Humble Bundle</a> too.

      <title>The Pale Beyond sold 10% of copies on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's an interesting data point for you, The Pale Beyond a polar exploration game set in an unforgiving frozen wasteland managed to do well on the Steam Deck. Released back in February from Bellular Studios, it is Steam Deck Verified and on desktop Linux it has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1266030" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>Not seen it before, do check out their trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PvvkUPPJc_E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/43b8bf455e2b842c9ddac4ce293696c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PvvkUPPJc_E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about the game: "When its sister ship failed to return from a dangerous polar expedition, a crew is assembled for a perilous rescue mission aboard The Temperance. When the Captain mysteriously disappears after the ship becomes stuck in the ice, players will be forced into Captaincy and manage the 24 crewmates (and 12 sled dogs!). Keeping the crew and sled dogs safe, fed, and warm is key. However, surviving the ice will matter little in the face of mutiny. Every vote will count, so keep the crew on your side."</p>
<p>They also run the Bellular News YouTube channel, where they talk about the gaming industry. In a video posted up on March 29th, a section talked a bit about the game and mentioned clearly how it had sold 10% of copies on the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck part starts at 5:10 to quote: "I can actually give you a very interesting number from our game, The Pale Beyond and it really shocked me. So 10% of The Pale Beyond sales are actually Steam Deck".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e3sZRzUHbPc?rel=0&amp;start=312"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3516fc8230b94ca9b269c828d8f39ea1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e3sZRzUHbPc?rel=0&amp;start=312" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Certainly looks interesting, going to have to take a look at this one myself!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm not big on life sims personally but add creature collecting into the mix? I'm there. Moonstone Island looks sweet. Set in an open world where you have over 100 island to explore, it certain sounds like it's overflowing with content. Make friends, brew potions, collect spirits and go through various card-based encounters.</p>

The Steam page shows Linux support, and the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/Moonstone_game/status/1641136618634371074" target="_blank">confirmed</a> it too. After scrolling through the info on it and checking out the videos, it didn't take long to sell me on it. Gimme.</p>

      <title>Blender 3.5 is out now with fancy new hair</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to show how great open source is, the Blender team have released <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-5/" target="_blank">Blender 3.5</a> with some really fancy new features. Blender is used across many different industries from games to films and more.</p>
<p>This release massively advances the curves-based hair system they released originally with Blender 3.3, bringing with it a whole bunch of built-in assets for modellers to play with. Not just for human hair either, they said it can be used for all sorts like fur and even grass. From what they explained it allows you to do some really varied styled with it thanks to being able to manipulate hair rather finely.</p>
<p>Check out this fancy new system in their official video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_-d0HaT5f1g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b75a14a4486d5d8b78eb5945447bf015.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_-d0HaT5f1g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Various other feature highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cycles now uses a light tree to more effectively sample scenes with many lights. This can significantly reduce noise, at the cost of a somewhat longer render time per sample.</li>
<li>Open Shading Language (OSL) can now be used with OptiX on the GPU, in addition to existing support with CPU rendering.</li>
<li>A new GPU-based compositor backend, so you do modelling while the compositor and effects are on. Sounds and looks like a huge advancement!</li>
<li>UV Copy and UV Paste support added.</li>
<li>Support for importing and exporting with USDZ.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements for glTF 2.0 support.</li>
<li>Loads more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Full release <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Reference/Release_Notes/3.5" target="_blank">notes here</a>.</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 29.1 Beta 1 brings AV1 / HEVC over RTMP</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team working on the free and open source video recording and livestreaming software OBS Studio, have released the first Beta for version 29.1 with a big new feature.</p>
<p>With this being the first that supports the AV1 and HEVC over RTMP, currently just for streaming to YouTube. This is a big step, because there's a huge amount of interest in the likes of AV1 as it can provide better quality with a lower bandwidth cost.</p>
<p>Here's what else is new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a DLL blocking feature for Windows. This allows OBS to block problematic DLLs from attaching to OBS and causing freezing or crashes, for example 3rd party overlay hooks and outdated video capture devices. [notr1ch]
<ul>
<li>This blocks old versions of popular VTubing software virtual cameras that are known to cause freezes when accessing video capture device properties. If you are affected, please update to the latest version of your VTubing software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Update Channels on macOS and updated Sparkle for smaller and faster updates going forward [derrod]</li>
<li>Added settings to select the audio encoder for streaming and recording [tytan652]</li>
<li>Added an option to preload media sources used in Stingers to memory, to avoid frame skips during transitions [Jim]</li>
<li>Added compatibility notices in the Window and Game Capture sources for Windows [derrod]</li>
<li>Added the ability to zoom browser docks with Ctrl - and + and the right click menu [WizardCM]</li>
<li>Added a setting to record in fragmented MP4 and MOV formats [derrod]
<ul>
<li>These offer greater compatibility than MKV while providing similar resilience against data loss due to crashes, running out of space, etc.</li>
<li>Fragmented MP4 and MOV files can be remuxed to regular MP4/MOV in cases where the former may not be read correctly (e.g. in older editing software)</li>
<li>The default recording format has been tentatively changed to fragmented MP4/MOV, please submit your feedback on Discord or the Forums if you run into any issues!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for surround sound for AJA capture cards [paulh-aja]</li>
<li>Added ProRes 4444 (XQ) support for VideoToolbox encoder on macOS [jpark37]</li>
<li>Added lossless audio recording options (FLAC/ALAC/PCM including 32-bit float) [derrod]</li>
<li>Added indicator if an audio source is unmuted, but not assigned to any audio tracks [derrod]</li>
<li>Added support for multiple audio tracks in Simple output recording [pkv]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16797869911680106410gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16797869911680106410gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's various other general improvements and fixes, like these for Linux specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improve screen capture performance on Intel dedicated GPUs on Linux [kkartaltepe]</li>
<li>JACK inputs on Linux will now display "OBS Studio" in their name to clarify their origin. This may cause existing configured devices to stop working until updated by the user [univrsal]</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on shutdown with virtual camera on Linux [kkartaltepe/norihiro]</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the V4L2 source on Linux where a capture device's frame rate could be invalid, resulting in incredibly large log files [9p4]</li>
</ul>

      <title>Short underwater survival game FarSky now free on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After closing up shop back in 2022, Farsky Interactive have now revived their game FarSky and made it free on itch.io.</p>
<p>With FarSky, you take the role of Nathan who got lost in the Ocean after the crash of his submarine. You need to learn how to survive in the depths of the Ocean. Your end goal is to gather up all the pieces of your submarine, to fix it and finally reach the surface.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NzG9YqUaMCE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/10a567cefc3253f2267d4b16e6968048.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NzG9YqUaMCE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use the environment to gather resources.</li>
<li>Build a base to refill your oxygen and manage your items.</li>
<li>Craft equipment and weapons to explore and protect yourself in the Ocean depths.</li>
<li>Create an in-base farm or go fish hunting to feed yourself.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It might seem like a smaller version of Subnautica and in a way it is. So much so in fact, that the developer of FarSky publicly <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/286340/announcements/detail/3087787366398826689" target="_blank">called out</a> developers of Unknown Worlds Entertainment for pretty much poaching the entire idea, here's an excerpt:</p>
<p>"In January 2014, as I was looking for underwater inspiration visuals, I found an image on google that caught my attention. I clicked on it and was redirected to a game page called… « Subnautica ». My first reaction was to think « damn, I made a game way too closed to another one without knowing about it ». Then I realized the game was not even in development yet, there were only some concept arts and ideas. When I saw the name of the project director, I knew I saw this name somewhere … I went on my Twitter account and discovered he was following me as well as his coworkers. At that time, I was devastated. My game was not even out yet, maybe I showed it too early ? I did not expect that, and I knew I could not compete a bigger company like this one. I also found the Subnautica’s director email in the buyers of the game in Beta stage. I felt I needed to quickly finish the game. As I published the Steam Greenlight trailer on Youtube (you needed to put the game on Greenlight before it gets on Steam at that moment), Subnautica project’s leader put a comment with a link to his website. I removed that comment."</p>

      <title>The Last of Us on Steam Deck is not great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we are, another big release on Steam and sadly it's just seemingly not a good experience from my early testing. Even though it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/the-last-of-us-part-i-on-steam-deck-gets-support-from-valve-and-naughty-dog-co-president/" target="_blank">seemed like</a> we might see good support, the result is nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>Starting with the big nuisance: even though you've just downloaded it, you won't be ready to play. It will take around an hour to build the shaders on the main menu, something you'll need to do, otherwise you're likely to see worse performance. In my testing, you definitely want to wait on that being done too. Before it was done the performance was far more erratic and it ended up slowing down to a 1FPS crawl during one attempt.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it has the same issue some other bigger games have where the RAM will fill up to around 14/14.1GB as noted on the Steam Deck's performance HUD and then crash completely, often taking the Steam Deck with it for a full reboot.</p>

<p>Valve did give it a special Proton <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1888930/history/?changeid=18233564" target="_blank">Hotfix</a>, which doesn't seem to have done enough to make it properly playable or be something I can recommend at this time.</p>
<p>As for how it runs on desktop Linux? On my Ryzen 7 5800X and NVIDIA 2080 Ti (Fedora KDE), it gives an out of date driver warning that can be ignored to begin with. Then it took a good 30 minutes (almost to the dot) to do the shaders even with this clearly much more powerful system. When you only have a 2 hour refund window on Steam, that's not good. Now think about people who do genuinely swap between PC and Steam Deck, practically the entire refund window gone to see if you have issues with it.</p>
<p>For desktop though, you can of course get much better performance and at least on the Linux side, it actually seems to run reasonably well even at 2560x1440 with FSR set to Balanced it can mostly stick around 60FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4350159611680033048gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4350159611680033048gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14808559401680033049gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14808559401680033049gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Both shots were actually 60FPS, but Plasma screenshot spikes the FPS down.</em></p>
<p>Seems it's quite a problematic port overall, as the Steam user reviews instantly went down to Mixed (Edit: and now "Mostly Negative"), with many people on Windows reporting problematic performance and constant crashes.</p>

      <title>AMD RADV driver will soon stop eating RAM with some games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Mike Blumenkrantz has continued blogging about Linux graphics driver improvements, with a fix from developer Samuel Pitoiset landing to stop the AMD RADV (Vulkan) driver eating up RAM.</p>
<p>In a blog titled "<a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/oom/" target="_blank">Oom</a>", Blumenkrantz mentioned how it was discovered that Dota 2 was using far too much RAM. Using massif-visualizer and GFXReconstruct, they noticed how Dota 2 was eating up 3GB of RAM "just from the driver" and "nearly all of it just from in-memory shader IR". Turns out this was caused in part by using the new Graphics Pipeline Library, ongoing work to make games smoother using the <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library</a> extension.</p>
<p>Thanks to the effort, the issue was properly identified and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22143" target="_blank">a fix</a> for the problem resulted in an "85% reduction in memory utilization" in Dota 2 that was being tested.</p>
<p>Since this could have potentially hit other games too, and with Graphics Pipeline Library hopefully going to be enabled by default in the next major release of the Mesa drivers, it's good to see.</p>

      <title>Dolphin Emulator for GameCube and Wii is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving you another easy way to download and keep it up to date, the Dolphin Emulator for GameCube and Wii is coming to Steam. Even though it's going to be on Steam, they don't dare mention Nintendo directly on the Steam page: "Dolphin is an emulator for the big N's 6th and 7th generation consoles, featuring enhancements such as increased resolution, save states, and netplay."</p>
<p>In their official <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/03/28/coming-soon-dolphin-steam/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, they said to expect a feature article going over the features of the Steam release later, as this has been a "product of many months of work". This will make getting it on Steam Deck easier than ever, and they've even <a href="https://twitter.com/Dolphin_Emu/status/1640589915082887168" target="_blank">confirmed</a> it will support Cloud Saves too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15068793831679993069gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15068793831679993069gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Naturally, the Steam release is just the emulator, you will still need to have your own copy of games to run in it.</p>
<p>They haven't given an exact date, other than the plan is to have it in Early Access on Steam by the end of 2023. They're going with Early Access as some Steam specific features aren't finished yet, plus they want to gather feedback on what people want from the Steam release.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941680/Dolphin_Emulator/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Roguelite dungeon crawler Netherguild arrives on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now available in Early Access, if you're looking for a roguelite dungeon crawler take a look at Netherguild.</p>
<p>From solo developer David Vinokurov, Netherguild is a turn-based tactical roguelite dungeon-crawler where you play as the leader of the Netherguild - controlling your little voxel fighters in expeditions below the earth in a desperate attempt to find a cure to a strange plague. Explore, camp, and fight as far as you can before heading back to resupply.</p>
<p>The developer mentioned Early Access will continue for a couple of years, as they continue to add new content and polish the experience with community feedback. New trailer can be seen below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Sn75aKmif1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/507a358d993150406bf9b3171dbbb22e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Sn75aKmif1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn Based Combat</strong>: With no attack RNG, so you can count on your units and know when to engage enemies and when to fall back.</li>
<li><strong>Bonfires:</strong> and a food system which affects your characters with passive effects throughout their expedition.</li>
<li><strong>Oddities:</strong> random events you discover which present choices underground.</li>
<li><strong>Replay Value: </strong>with random equipment, random character backgrounds with different skills each playthrough and procedurally generated levels every time you descend underground mean that playthroughs feel different every time.</li>
<li><strong>Roguelite with Persistence and Story:</strong> Keep your characters at the end of each expedition (if they survive), equip them with powerful items and level them up over time. Netherguild's story progresses the more you explore and find out about the secrets of its world.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling Resource Management:</strong> Balance powerful abilities across long expeditions underground.</li>
<li><strong>Original Game World:</strong> Netherguild is unconventional low-fantasy; No Orcs, no Elves, and no wizards casting fireballs. Expect to find strange creatures, machines and denizens far underground.</li>
<li><strong>Cute Voxel Aesthetics:</strong> Contrasted by a story with serious themes, as you face against plague and conspiracy!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll have some proper thoughts up on it when I've had a chance to play plenty of it. I was already impressed with the early demos some time ago and it played well even then.</p>

      <title>Left 4 Dead 3 appears in Counter-Strike 2 files</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The internet is currently buzzing about mentions of Left 4 Dead 3 appearing in files for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/counter-strike-2-from-valve-releasing-summer-2023/" target="_blank">upcoming Counter-Strike 2</a>. So apparently Valve can count to 3 — not the 3 the majority of their fans will want I imagine but still, why is it there at all in a huge upgrade for CS:GO?</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/11zghe4/left_4_dead_3_spotted_in_cs2_files/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post, it shows up with some curious strings:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6494299221679917553gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6494299221679917553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>This has led some other news sites to run headlines like "Left 4 Dead 3 is a non-priority", because it makes for a great bit of clickbait, even though it also says the severity is "high". Realistically, no one outside of Valve will even know what these strings are actually doing.</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead 2 is easily one of my absolute favourites from Valve, so I'm cautiously excited over this. Clearly Valve are slowly getting back into actual games. We had the fantastic (and one of my all-time favourite experiences) with Half-Life: Alyx, Counter-Strike 2 coming this Summer and then who knows what? Valve hit a home-run with the Steam Deck as well, and clearly what has been announced for Counter-Strike 2 has a lot of people excited so it would be good to see them keep up this momentum.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? Might we get a Left 4 Dead 3 announcement at some point?</em></p>

      <title>Halls of Torment is classic Diablo meets Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah hell, going to say goodbye to any free time I had for the next month. Halls of Torment has sucked me right in being a blend of retro Diablo and Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I'm pretty sure I scrolled away from this on Steam the first time it came up, thinking it didn't look like much. Until the developer prodded me on Twitter, so I decided I might as well. Checking it out was a bad idea because I'm now going to be spending every spare moment playing the free Prelude until the main game enters Early Access later this year.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GCVIaeK504g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e30f4e84ece6af502265aab138b63ab5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GCVIaeK504g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm already a big fan of these <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde games</a> / Vampire Survivors-likes, and so far most of them have given something unique that they all become worth playing. Here, it isn't just the retro pre-rendered Diablo-like style that it has going for it, although it is pretty nice for fans of the classic.</p>
<p>You do run around auto-attacking, picking up gems and levelling up like the others but here a level up is just a stat boost. To get new abilities, you need to actually explore the map and pick up pages. On top of that, you also pick up equipment much more like a traditional ARPG. Together, it has very nicely blended two similar genres but with the now very well known theme from Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17947119051679916230gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17947119051679916230gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18376219661679916227gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18376219661679916227gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Content included in the free Prelude:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2 stages with dynamic progression.</li>
<li>3+ unique bosses.</li>
<li>15+ unique monsters.</li>
<li>3+ playable characters.</li>
<li>6+ different and upgradable abilities.</li>
<li>8+ blessings making you stronger for each attempt.</li>
<li>30+ different items to unlock and retrieve.</li>
<li>100+ traits that upgrade characters and abilities.</li>
<li>30+ quests to complete.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The boss battles are impressive too, I will admit my real surprise here facing the first big demon that appeared with it using a blend of attacks against me, caught me a bit off-guard after mowing-down a ton of skeletons.</p>

      <title>AMD detail more on FSR 3 and their new open source FidelityFX SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD had plenty to show off at GDC, and they've done a bit of a summary and some of it is quite exciting for future games.</p>
<p>FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is open source and they will be sticking to that with the MIT license, with FSR 3 getting some more early details but they said it's still too early to show a lot of it. As explained in their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/gdc-2023-fidelityfx-sdk-fsr3/" target="_blank">GPUOpen</a> post they're introducing "interpolated frames" which has allow them to get a "2x framerate boost". It's more complex though with some challenges:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>We can’t rely on color clamping to correct the color of outdated samples.</li>
<li>Non-linear motion interpolation is hard with 2D screen space motion vectors, which is why we recommend at least 60fps input.</li>
<li>If the final frames are interpolated, then the UI and all post-processing will also need to interpolated.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is good news!</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a high probability there will be at least one sample for every interpolated pixel.</li>
<li>There’s no feedback loop as the interpolated frame will only be shown once – any interpolation artifact would only remain for one frame.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19997125221679670271gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19997125221679670271gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With FSR 3 you're going to get better framerates at the cost of latency. However, they said they will be including "latency reduction techniques to FSR 3". AMD also said it should be easier to integrate FSR 3 if developers already support FSR 2.</p>
<p>Additionally they've announced the FidelityFX SDK, also open source, which combines together their multiple effects libraries giving developers an easier way to integrate it. As previously their stuff has all been spread-out, causing problems for developers with "inconsistencies in coding and documentation standards, limited platform/API support" and so this SDK is their attempt to to "do better".</p>

      <title>vkd3d 1.7 is out now for the Wine translation layer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a> team just announced the release of vkd3d version 1.7, their Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer. Not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton, Valve's own fork of it with a focus on gaming with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the main highlights of vkd3d 1.7:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for many more HLSL features and intrinsics.</li>
<li>Much improved support for the Direct3D shader model 1/2/3 HLSL profiles.</li>
<li>Public vkd3d-shader API for parsing and serialising DXBC blobs.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*** libvkd3d-shader<br/>
<br/>
- New features for the HLSL source type:<br/>
  - Support for calling user-defined functions.<br/>
  - Support for array parameters to user-defined functions.<br/>
  - Much improved support for the Direct3D shader model 1/2/3 profiles.<br/>
  - Support for the SV_DispatchThreadID, SV_GroupID, and SV_GroupThreadID<br/>
    compute shader system-value semantics.<br/>
  - Support for the optional "offset" parameter of the texture object Load()<br/>
    method.<br/>
  - Support for the all() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the distance() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the exp() and exp2() intrinsic functions.<br/>
  - Support for the frac() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the lit() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the reflect() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the sin() and cos() intrinsic functions.<br/>

  - Support for the step() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the transpose() intrinsic function.<br/>
  - Support for the case-insensitive variants of the "float" and "dword" data<br/>
    types.<br/>
  - Partial support for minimum precision data types like "min16float". These<br/>
    are currently interpreted as their regular counterparts.<br/>
  - Improved constant propagation support, in particular to constant<br/>
    propagation through swizzles.<br/>
<br/>
- HLSL static variables are now properly zero-initialised.<br/>
<br/>
- The Direct3D shader model 4 and 5 disassembler outputs sample counts for<br/>
  multi-sampled resource declarations.<br/>
<br/>
- New interfaces:<br/>
  - vkd3d_shader_parse_dxbc() provides support for parsing DXBC blobs.<br/>
  - vkd3d_shader_serialize_dxbc() provides support for serialising DXBC blobs.<br/>
  - vkd3d_shader_free_dxbc() is used to free vkd3d_shader_dxbc_desc<br/>
    structures, as returned by vkd3d_shader_parse_dxbc().<br/>
  - The VKD3D_SHADER_COMPILE_OPTION_WRITE_TESS_GEOM_POINT_SIZE compile option<br/>
    can be used to specify whether SPIR-V shaders targeting Vulkan<br/>
    environments should write point sizes for geometry and tessellation<br/>
    shaders. If left unspecified, point sizes will be written.</p>

      <title>Rogue: Genesia is another horde survivor (Vampire-like?) game worth a look</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>These Vampire Survivor-like horde survival games are still all the rage, and I keep discovering more. Rogue: Genesia is another, with Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>While the basics of the game are Survivor-like with you facing off against various waves of enemies, auto-firing weapons, picking up gems to eventually level up and pick from randomised powers / equipment it does have some major differences too. The main mode is set up more like Slay the Spire, where you pick locations to explore through a map which could be a normal fight spawning lots of enemies, a boss fight, a chest and so on. However there is also a plain endless survival mode too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8ooEvLDmViM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89d66f4c783c58b8c959b45c107f2dbf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8ooEvLDmViM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In terms of artwork it looks a lot more like the Octopath Traveler series from Square Enix. I genuinely love the style to this one, it's so different to all the rest.</p>
<p>As you go through it, you also unlock more locations and there's lots of different builds you can make. It's in Early Access so it's not finished and seems like it won't be finished for quite some time. Even so, it's a lot of fun to play through even now and worked pretty great on both Desktop Linux and Steam Deck (with settings turned down to Low).</p>
<p>I also still don't know what to call these types of games. Has the industry settled in a term for it yet? Horde survival? Vamp-like? Survivor-like? There <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">sure is a lot of them</a>.</p>

      <title>Build your own racecar in Revhead, now with added Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Revhead, a racing sim all about actually building your own vehicle, recently had an upgrade with the developer now supporting the Steam Deck. It also has Native Linux support. Not one I've actually written about at all before, somehow the original release was missed in a sea of games back in 2017.</p>
<p>About it: "Revhead is a car racing simulation game, where you have to build your own race car. You have a friend Charlie, who is busy with building race cars. He would need some help from you and he invites you to Australia. You start your journey somewhere in a small town in Australia, where the only way to get recognised if you are able to build the fastest and best racing car around. You have Charlie, his expertise and his garage. The rest is up to you!"</p>

<p>From the March 22nd patch:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added new race location to the Airport (only open at late night).</li>
<li>Added some new brand limited race for night race at Airport.</li>
<li>Fixed some AI related braking issue at drag races.</li>
<li>Fixed duplicated controller issues.</li>
<li>Fixed some localizations.</li>
<li>Game now supports Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For Steam Deck support, Valve tested it on the Native Linux build and gave it a Playable rating recently, as some text can be a bit small and you need to manually bring up the keyboard (STEAM + X).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/589760/Revhead/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Framework reveal new laptop with modular graphics, plus an AMD Ryzen model</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework Computer Inc have done it again! They've announced multiple big exciting things for their modular laptops today. Here's what's coming.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of them before, you're going to want to keep a close eye on what they're doing. Giving you a laptop that you can build and upgrade yourself, along with pre-built options and good Linux support too. They even send hardware to Linux distribution developers to make sure they get hooked up nicely.</p>
<p>Firstly, they announced today they're upgrading to 13th Gen Intel (i5-1340P / i7-1360P or i7-1370P) and​​​​ now including an AMD Ryzen (7040 series 5 / 7) option for their 13 inch model. They're also releasing an upgraded battery from 55Wh to 61Wh that's compatible with the previous models. There's a new Matte screen, improved hinges, a more powerful speaker (taken from their Chromebook model) and it will be more customizable than ever with you being able to change the frame around the screen.</p>
<p>Even more exciting is their entirely new 16 inch model, which has more expansion slots for the various modules available to slide into it. The special bit about this model: it has a whole new expansion bay that supports a <em>modular</em> GPU (amongst other things). That's right, finally a proper customizable laptop where you can slot in a new GPU easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4185922831679592591gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4185922831679592591gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20925854051679592592gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20925854051679592592gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In the shots above, the first is without the expansion, the second with it. As you can see, it gets a bit of a bigger bottom, so a more powerful GPU might extend a fair bit. They designed it this way so it's easier to replace, since it's not buried deep inside, and to allow for more space for future GPUs. They've designed the expansion modules much like the motherboard, so these expansion bay modules can be used in their own case outside the laptop for other things, including turning it into an eGPU enclosure to use on another laptop (like the newer Framework 13).</p>
<p>This larger 16 inch Framework is also even more customizable, since the whole input deck (the keyboard area) can be customized too. You could put in a numpad, have an RGB keyboard, another small display and so on.</p>
<p>Framework are also expanding shipping into Belgium, Italy, Spain, and Taiwan later this year.</p>
<p>Finally, they teamed up with Cooler Master to produce a transparent case for the Framework 13 Mainboard, so you can easily turn it into a standalone system.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/977700141679593363gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/977700141679593363gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The live <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccpsyRipHlk" target="_blank">event</a>, which really didn't have great audio and video quality, was overall fun to watch. Lots of love for Linux from Framework, with plenty of what they're doing open source for developers to work with and create things for.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 530.41.03 driver out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released their latest stable driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/200492/en-uk" target="_blank">530.41.03</a> update for Linux users, following on from the 530.30.02 Beta last month.</p>
<p>Here's everything that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Added support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.<br/>
This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Added compatibility for Linux kernels with Indirect Branch Tracking (IBT).</li>
<li>Added NV-CONTROL attributes NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_MODE and NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_VALUE to allow syncing a Quadro Sync II card to different House Sync signal rates. This feature requires firmware version 2.18 or later; to download the latest firmware version, please visit:<br/>
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/" target="_blank">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/</a></li>
<li>Added support for the VK_KHR_video_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_h264 and VK_KHR_video_decode_h265 extensions.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when resetting the display layout.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause excessive GPU power consumption at idle when driving multiple displays with a high refresh rate.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in nvidia-powerd which could cause excessive CPU usage.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which could cause applications to run at 1 FPS when using an NVIDIA PRIME Display Offload sink as the only active display.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA also recently released the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta</a> 525.47.14 and 525.47.15 for developers which include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_map_memory2.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_map_memory2</a></li>
<li>VK_NV_displacement_micromap
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Displacement-MicroMap-Toolkit" target="_blank">NVIDIA Displacement Micro-Map Toolkit</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Update VK_NV_displacement_micromap to work better on pre-Ada RTX GPUs</li>
</ul>

      <title>Xwayland Video Bridge created to improve Linux screen sharing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the move between X11 and Wayland still ongoing, and likely won't finish for years, problems keep coming up like screen sharing but <em>XwaylandVideoBridge</em> may help solve this.</p>
<p>This new tool written by Aleix Pol and David Edmundson is designed to allow much easier sharing of screens and windows between X11 and Wayland, which should help to ease the transition from X11 to Wayland. The problem is that currently in the likes of Discord, MS Teams, Slack, Zoom and others that you run through Xwayland, you may end up with a black screen and no windows listed — this should solve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119635461679584274gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19119635461679584274gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Picture credit: David Edmundson</em></p>
<p>Hopefully in future things like this won't be needed, as everything moves over to Wayland. Still, it's good to have tools available for legacy apps that won't get updated and great for the next few transition years. </p>
<p>As the developers on it say it should work "on any desktop that supports the Xdg desktop portals and pipewire streaming and have a working system tray".</p>

Having an individual with the right skills can get you into previously inaccessible places and quests.

<li><strong>Base management </strong>- You have to be wise in and out of the battle. Players can regularly update the base by unlocking new wings to the buildings, which will reward you with resources, quests, or items.</li>
<li><strong>Follow missions</strong> - In your outpost, you can plan and assign tasks to your companions. Send selected party members on an autonomic mission, in which you won't participate but will receive what they find along the way. Never forget that their lives are in your hands!</li>

      <title>XE Gen 2 Linux Laptop announced by Kubuntu Focus</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

Many of these solutions have already been upstreamed, and many more are on the way. Our team has also rigorously tested, reported, and helped fix bugs with KDE, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu. This collaboration benefits our customers and the entire community, and we thank all the wonderful people on these teams that make it all possible," stated Michael Mikowski, General Manager.</p>

      <title>Atari are acquiring Night Dive Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that is certainly unexpected news. Atari has entered into an agreement to buy up Night Dive Studios. Night Dive Studios are responsible for the upcoming System Shock remake, Forsaken Remastered, Turok and Turok 2 remasters, Blood Fresh Supply, Quake remaster and many more.</p>
<p>Atari already owned a minority stake in Night Dive and they will now have 100%.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari, commented: “Night Dive’s proven expertise and successful track record in commercializing retro IP is well-aligned with Atari’s strategy and I am confident that their combined talent, technology and IP portfolio will contribute to Atari’s future success.”</p>
<p>Stephen Kick and Larry Kuperman, principals of Night Dive commented: “Night Dive and Atari have a long history together and we know that Atari shares our passion for retro games and our focus on producing high-quality new and remastered games that do justice to the original IP. As we look to grow our business and expand our capabilities, we could think of no better long-term partner than Atari.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atari-enters-agreement-acquire-night-220300554.html" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a>, Night Dive Studios reported a revenue of $3 million USD for 2022, and Atari will acquire them for an initial $10 million USD half in cash and half in Atari shares, plus an "earn-out" of up to $10 million USD in cash over the next three years based on Night Dive's performance. <em>This means if Night Dive do well, they'll get more money.</em></p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to be completed in April 2023.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Call of Duty: Black Ops III videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh small update to Proton Experimental has landed on March 22nd, here's what's new and changed for Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix graphical issues in Call of Duty: Black Ops III while playing videos</li>
<li>Fix PooShooter: Toilet Invaders starting to a black screen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This should mean that Call of Duty: Black Ops III is truly click and play now for Steam Deck and Linux desktop — awesome!</p>
<p>I'll admit I had to look up that second one, it is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/514390/PooShooter_Toilet_Invaders/" target="_blank">real</a> game and someone working for Valve had to fix an issue for it, kind of hilarious. While funny, it's also a good example of how often Valve doesn't just focus on the biggest names in gaming to get them working in Proton. Bugs in one game, even a small game, can affect others.</p>
<p>Changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>For an explanation of all the different Proton versions see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my original guide on Proton</a>. Proton Experimental gets automatically installed if Valve set it on a game, or you can just search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library (<em>not</em> the Steam Store) to install it. </p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

<p><strong>Text guide</strong></p>
<p>Change it per game (Steam Deck)</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 from Valve releasing Summer 2023, Limited Test starts today</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has today announced Counter-Strike 2, which will be arriving in Summer 2023 and they've released some details on what's changed. </p>
<p>This will be a big free Source 2 upgrade for Global Offensive, with some of the features being announced now including responsive smoke, sub-tick updates for more responsive gameplay, overhauled maps, Source 2 tooling for the community, your whole inventory carries over from CS:GO, higher resolution models for basically everything, improved visual effects, an upgraded UI and much much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ExZtISgOxEQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad48c64e228f00c3761d26f316f219cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ExZtISgOxEQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>They're doing a Limited Test too, which is based upon invitations. Seems like they have more to announce, as the limited test and the features being revealed are "a subset of Counter-Strike 2's features, so that major issues can be resolved before the summer" and they will reveal more in "a few months".</p>
<p>As for how to get into the limited test? They will be selecting people based on recent playtime, trust factor, Steam account standing and so on. If you are chosen, you get a notification inside CS:GO, so you'll need to keep checking back with more players being added over time.</p>
<p>The limited test is Windows-only but SteamDB shows it all clearly set up for Linux and macOS too. It's likely just to get the main technical testing done they're keeping the platforms smaller to get it finished.</p>

      <title>GNOME 44 is out now finally adding thumbnails to the file picker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One thing I genuinely hated about GNOME has finally been solved with the <a href="https://release.gnome.org/44/" target="_blank">GNOME 44 release</a>. It includes some big improvements and new features.</p>
<p>As dumb as it sounds, one of the most important new features is the added grid view for the file picker. Honestly, I still can't believe it took this long but it's finally in. You can now actually see proper previews of images. As they said in the release announcement that for years GNOME users have been requesting it. Apps will need to use GTK4 though, so hopefully plenty will.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19154507471679498448gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19154507471679498448gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's also various security improvements, accessibility upgrades like redesigned settings for accessibility with these new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An over-amplification setting has been added, to increase the volume above the usual maximum threshold.</li>
<li>Under <em>Typing</em>, an option has been added to enable accessibility features using the keyboard.</li>
<li>There is now a test area for the cursor blinking setting.</li>
<li>A new setting to make scrollbars be always visible has been added to the <em>Seeing</em> section.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sound settings also got upgraded:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Volume level control has been moved into a separate window, making the more commonly used output and input controls easier to access.</li>
<li>It’s now possible to disable the alert sound, and a new alert sound window makes it easy to browse the available sounds that are available.</li>
<li>The sound test window has been redesigned, eliminating previous scaling issues when there are many outputs, and providing a more attractive interface.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Mouse and touchpad settings were overhauled, updates to the quick settings menu like being able to see a list of running apps without a window (Flatpak only for now), the GNOME Software app should be faster now and it has better Flatpak support, the terminal app Console now has a tab overview option, you can share from the Contacts app with a QR code, the GNOME Web browser was upgraded to GTK4 and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Amazon Luna cloud gaming launches in Canada, Germany and the UK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://amazon.co.uk/playluna" target="_blank">Amazon Luna</a>, the cloud gaming service has finally expanded into more territories. They're also no longer blocking Linux.</p>
<p>Previously, you needed a few tricks to get around their blocking to get into Luna, if you were in the USA where it was supported. Now though with the expansion into Canada, Germany and the UK more people can try it out. Playing it on my Linux desktop (Fedora KDE) with Chrome, it works out of the box but you just get an unsupported device warning that you can safely skip over and then the games appear to work just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4989490161679495088gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4989490161679495088gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6332424081679495372gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6332424081679495372gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“With Amazon Luna, we’re making gaming easier and more convenient by offering instant access to console-quality games on devices customers already own,” said Eric Saarnio, vice president, Amazon Devices International. “Gamers in the U.S. have been enjoying Luna for the past year so we’re thrilled to now expand the service to customers in Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>What it offers up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free games each month for Amazon Prime subscribers, rotated so you don't keep them.</li>
<li>Luna+ at £8.99 a month for access to various games.</li>
<li>Ubisoft+ at £14.99 a month for lots of Ubisoft games.</li>
<li>Jackbox games at £3.99 to access their party games.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prime members who also have Luna+ can link to Ubisoft Connect to play a select few Ubisoft games too.</p>
<p>They're going to have to do a lot to compete with Xbox Cloud Gaming and NVIDIA GeForce NOW, both much more established and both can work on Linux and Steam Deck too. Cloud Gaming is clearly here to stay, it just depends on who has the resources to keep it up initially and doesn't go with a crap business model like Google did with Stadia.</p>
<p><em>Will any of you be giving Amazon Luna a go? Are you already using it? What do you think?</em></p>

      <title>Warside is a pixel-art turn-based tactics game much like Advance Wars</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love turn-based tactics and classics like Advance Wars? You should keep an eye on Warside, as it's firmly channelling that same energy. It looks pretty great and with full cross-platform multiplayer on top of the story campaign, it's certainly piqued my curiosity.</p>
<p>"Warside is a new game that cuts to the core of what made classic turn-based tactics games so great. A great story mode campaign, unique Commanders with totally different playstyles, awesome Battle Powers, and a wide variety of terrain and units. Choose your Commander, assemble your forces, and battle your way to victory."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zqXzciBYJZE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c10752bf6c3d6d36d51a66a53d38583e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zqXzciBYJZE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive turn-based gameplay with a familiar feel for fans of the classics.</li>
<li>12 playable Commanders, each with unique passive skills and Battle Powers.</li>
<li>Control 20+ unit types. Simultaneously battle over land, air, and sea with ground forces, aircraft, and naval units.</li>
<li>Faction unique units with mechanics specific to each faction.</li>
<li>Single-player campaign with over 30 missions.</li>
<li>Forest, desert and snow biomes, plus indoor close-quarters missions.</li>
<li>Challenge friends and foes with multiplayer battles. Local and internet play are supported.</li>
<li>Design your own maps with the built-in mission editor for both single and multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can help <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lavabird/warside-a-pixel-art-turn-based-tactics-game/description" target="_blank">fund it on Kickstarter</a>. It's already hit the goal with £67,743 pledged and 23 days left so clearly there's a lot of interest in these types of games. They make it clear it will have Linux support too, and they will be supporting the Steam Deck as well. Made with <a href="http://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, so it shouldn't have many issues with Linux.</p>

      <title>Colourful retro platformer Frogun Encore announced for Summer 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Frogun Encore is the follow-up to Frogun from Molegato and Top Hat Studios, Inc. that was released in 2022, giving more family-friendly retro inspired 3D platforming. Designed much like classics from the PlayStation 1 / Nintendo 64 era, the original reviewed reasonably well, so hopefully they will be working to address any sticking points from the original.</p>
<p>According to the press release they said it will have an "expanded move-set and greater agility for our heroes" this time giving you the ability to "Catapult off ziplines, twirl and double jump, and launch yourself skywards by shooting grabbed enemies and objects downwards" — sounds like it could be fun. You also don't need to have played the original as it's a full standalone game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lGocaIO9QvM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a1bfb3b67137698c63f9d663ca3b0e78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lGocaIO9QvM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore colorful levels as you trek across the world - explore whimsical areas and environments in stylish lowpoly aesthetic.</li>
<li>Expanded fluid movement ; jump, double jump, swing on ledges and poles, grapple, and use your trusty Frogun to navigate the environment in new, unique ways!.</li>
<li>Fight big bosses.</li>

      <title>Upcoming city-builder HexLands sounds like a relaxing time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HexLands from Portgate Studios has been announced with a new Steam page live, taking inspiration from the likes of Islanders, Dorf Romantik and Sid Meier's Civilization.</p>
<p>The idea is to give you a more casual, relaxing city-builder with high replay value and randomisation inspired by roguelikes. You build up as much as you can on an island, and keep spreading out across more islands as you go through quests and manage your resources. It gets more difficult the further you go, as they become less habitable.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vSfM2zu89Eg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ece5d44ed577d1b6c867213c0a90511c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vSfM2zu89Eg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>City building on relaxing medieval islands with various environments.</li>
<li>High replay value - Explore endless procedural islands!</li>
<li>Roguelike elements.</li>
<li>Chance management.</li>
<li>Resource management.</li>
<li>Procedural perk tree, offering you customisable playstyle.</li>
<li>Speedrun and Sandbox mode, in case you crave for something different.</li>
<li>Master the game and climb the leaderboard!  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer made it clear it will have Native Linux support at release, which is planned to happen sometime in Q4 2023 with an "open alpha" starting soon.</p>

      <title>Mask of the Rose set to release on June 8th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mask of the Rose, the incredibly stylish upcoming dating sim visual novel from Sunless Skies creator Failbetter Games is set to now release on June 8th.</p>
<p>A bit of a delay, which they explained was due to the continued expansion on how players interact with it. They're working on making the narrative "far more responsive and dynamic than we initially anticipated". Thanks to playtesting, they're making it a whole lot more interesting but that will take just a bit more time. While they've already implemented the features they want, given how dynamic it now is they want more time to fix up bugs.</p>
<p>They also have a new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HCuYH-a-lfk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/128d9512144a12ad4f66a72270e282c1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HCuYH-a-lfk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>(Re)invent yourself:</strong> who were you before the Fall? Who will you be now?</li>
<li><strong>Create outfits from a selection of clothing and unusual accessories</strong> to unlock different story options.</li>
<li><strong>Fall in love with a cast of diverse Londoners</strong>, each with their own secrets.</li>
<li><strong>Matchmake among your friends, or seek love for yourself</strong> (by any definition you like).</li>
<li><strong>Write love stories in a delightful minigame</strong>, and use them to impress the new Masters.</li>
<li><strong>Pick up odd jobs to earn money and gather resources.</strong> How are you at rat catching?</li>
<li><strong>Solve the first murder since the Fall</strong>, with the assistance of the victim.</li>
<li><strong>Discover cosy, mysterious and magnificent locations</strong> in a dark and delicious version of Victorian London.</li>
<li><strong>Seek deeper and deeper secrets</strong> over multiple playthroughs.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Big Ambitions drops Native Linux support shortly after the Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being in Beta for a while for pre-orders, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1331550/Big_Ambitions/" target="_blank">Big Ambitions</a>, a role-playing business sim from Hovgaard Games (who previously developed Startup Company) launched in Early Access on Steam and then dropped Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It entered Early Access on March 10th, with an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1331550/discussions/1/3825284575364986029/" target="_blank">announcement</a> made in their Steam forum noting they "no longer offer native Linux support for Big Ambitions" but they will "continue supporting and testing against Proton" and they plan to get Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>For players who don't see Proton as an option, they said Steam will give refunds.</p>
<p>As for why? They saw a "very high amount of non-gameplay-related bugs (random crashing, high VRAM usage, file access issues, etc.)" and noted the low amount of players on Linux so they didn't think it was "fair to the rest of our player base" to spend more time on it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1hKg7q-HifU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ea7d9f891a3afdce48a752dd66ce596.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1hKg7q-HifU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a shame when this happens but thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> translation layer, it does still mean Linux players will be able to run it and in this case the developer will support it there. Unless developers have Linux expertise and extra time for the currently smaller amount of users, Proton can often just work better, because it's constantly upgraded and optimized by Valve developers.</p>
<p>They're not the first by a long stretch to do this, and they won't be the last.</p>

      <title>Girl Genius: Adventures In Castle Heterodyne has a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rain Games, developer of the Teslagrad series, World to the West and others are still working away on Girl Genius: Adventures In Castle Heterodyne and it finally has a new trailer.</p>
<p>More about it: "Discover the award winning, gaslamp fantasy world of 'Girl Genius™', experiencing Agatha Heterodyne’s story, as she navigates the hostile hallways, catacombs and kitchens of her ancestral home, Castle Heterodyne. As the Lost Heir in the family lineage, she must repair the ancient fortress to its ancient glory, and take the throne as a "True Heterodyne". Only then can she stand up to the might of the Wulfenbach Empire and the other wild forces of Europa that are trying to take control and subjugate its people. But first, she has to contend with a corrupt sentient AI controlling the castle, the very pink villain Zola Malfeazium that is intending to take the castle for herself, and spiky deathtraps and pits of doom at every corner."</p>
<p>It's been a while for this one, with the Kickstarter for it finishing back in 2020. Their last trailer was 6 months ago, but they've regularly kept up communication with their backers and provide Alpha builds to people too. Now another 6 months of work has been shown off which you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cSRddBKfEiQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/74dbe2f40fee74948e780b1d9276ae4a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cSRddBKfEiQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features Planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build tools like the Grapple Gun and the Wrencherang at the Workbench, and use your tools to explore and solve the castle’s challenges.</li>
<li>Discover numerous sights and secrets, by being perceptive and using your tools to the fullest.</li>
<li>Defeat foes in furious melee combat or with explosive gadgets, and utilize the environment to your advantage using your tools.</li>
<li>Use your trusty Dingbot minion to explore places Agatha can’t get to, by digging underground and moving in tight spaces.</li>
<li>Use the Dingbot to solve lock puzzles, and operate the internal machinery in the castle.</li>
<li>As Agatha’s power over the castle grows, command the castle AI to release traps at your foes, and activate mechanisms.</li>
<li>Use the unique “Build System”, rebuilding scrap traps into objects like the Springclank, Grappleclank and the special Rollerclank, giving the player a suite of tools for creative spatial puzzle solving.</li>
<li>Interact with several of the fantastic characters from “Girl Genius™”, like Gilgamesh Wulfenbach, Tarvek Sturmvoraus and many others.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Developer of Deadnaut: Signal Lost requests Linux testers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deadnaut: Signal Lost from Screwfly Studios is an upcoming fast-paced sci-fi roguelike with a pretty unique style. The developer got in touch, as they want plenty more Linux testing.</p>
<p>More about it: "From the developer of cult hits Deadnaut, Zafehouse Diaries and Fear Equation comes Deadnaut: Signal Lost. In this slick, fast-paced roguelike you’ll take control of a single Deadnaut, unlock suit upgrades and abilities, fight cosmic horrors, and investigate drifting wrecks and abandoned moons. But remember: your Deadnaut is not your friend – earn their trust, do your job well, and they might return the favour."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="b0pswW5arCQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e8a1e69d3e1571b743c942fc51b2fca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/b0pswW5arCQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can direct-download <a href="https://signal-lost.com/files/SignalLostTechDemo.tar.xz" target="_blank">their Linux build here</a>, and comment your thoughts either here in GOL comments or on their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801410/Deadnaut_Signal_Lost/" target="_blank">Steam</a> community. Keep in mind the Linux build offered is quite limited, as they're just after reports from various systems on how it runs (and a bigger demo will be released later on). So it's your chance to give an indie developer a little helping hand. They did mention some already known issues like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The 3D location render on the navigation screen between missions does not display correctly. It is currently disabled in the Linux version while we work on a fix, however, it can be re-enabled via the command line switch "--disable-default-workarounds" (as it might work in some configurations).</li>
<li>Screen resolution and related settings are locked during missions due to a bug in Unity 2019.4 where some render textures are not correctly reinitialised. These settings can be freely changed at any other time. Again, you can disable this lock by using the "--disable-default-workarounds" switch.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The game is built with Unity, so hopefully it won't have too many issues.</p>
<p><strong>Game Feature Highlight:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>FAST ROGUELIKE GAMEPLAY - Equip your Deadnaut with a wide array of weapons and gear and lead them through a series of procedurally generated missions, fighting where you can — and running when you must.</li>
<li>TRUST ISSUES - Your Deadnaut may not like the idea of being torn apart by unknown horrors. If you do a good job, they'll happily accompany you. If not, pay them off or turn them into a mindless space golem. But remember: everything has a price.</li>
<li>FIVE DISTINCT SUITS AND PLAYSTYLES - There are many ways to play, from weapons and sensors, to shields and hacking. Will you take the heavy duty Labour suit and slice your way through the ship, or will you slip through the shadows in the ghostly Sensor suit? Maybe you prefer you manipulating gravity, placing drones or sniping from long-range? Play the way you want.</li>
<li>HOSTILE ENEMIES, DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENTS - Encounter dozens of enemy types, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Avoid — or exploit — the security system in each level, from the Watchers that roam ships to the malfunctioning security Towers and Sentinels that guard settlements.</li>
<li>TACTICS, UPGRADES AND CUSTOMISATION - Tailor your armour and damage potential, develop your Deadnaut, and discover powerful combinations and synergies among over 180 upgrades.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Fifth Element and Crazy Taxi are both classics, so one developer decided to try and combine them together into a game. What they've done is make a modern Crazy Taxi-like experience, with the flying cars and style found in The Fifth Element movie. <u>Note</u>: the developer sent over a key for review.</p>
<p>Not exactly a game that needs a big introduction and explanation really: you choose a player, then fly around a big city picking up passengers and dropping them off, making as much money as you can against the timer. Having to fly up and down to particular levels, based on where you need to drop off adds a nice element to the gameplay and it does initially feel quite fun. Annoying your passengers as you fly through signs and other things and hearing them scream is also somewhat amusing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RQB0tHnL3qs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/51f5ad2f30db14eecef53fb720f70aa1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RQB0tHnL3qs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Offering up a few different modes to play from including Standard where you fly around and pick up who you want, Sequential where you have a specific order and Free Roam with no goal — where you just fly around to try and learn the map. Plus either Easy or Normal difficulty modes. The idea is nice, and I think on the basics it gets a fair bit right and is initially fun.</p>
<p>As great as the idea is though, it doesn't take long for the fun to wear off. I'll be clear: it's not a bad game, and if you're after something to just race around in for a while here and there, to scratch a missing Crazy Taxi fix with the added verticality you might enjoy it. Mechanically at least, it has the driving down quite well. Sadly though, I did not enjoy it and going by Steam reviews, even people that did and left a positive review, didn't play it for long at all.</p>
<p>Full of references to other movies, it doesn't exactly have much of a personality. Which, can be a bit of a problem as it comes across pretty cheesy. I'm sure some will love that but it could have done with a bit more building up on its own world for me. </p>
<p>The gameplay is overall just too simplistic, and that's the biggest problem. While it does have a few nice touches, and a little coin collecting, it's (as expected really) just about getting passengers from A to B, and after a while of looking at the same buildings and hearing the same voice lines repeated over and over — it ends up falling a bit flat. On top of that, finding pickups can be troublesome due to the vertical 3D nature of the game, and the minimap rotating made it more confusing than it should be, as I spent half the time just looking for someone to pick up.</p>
<p>You also have a certain height restriction too, and when you approach the limit the game starts flashing warnings at you. Which is fine to keep players informed, but when you're doing pickups and dropoffs right by the limit, it's just annoying.</p>
<p>It does have some other problems, like different audio lines and music all fighting for your attention often playing on top of each other that felt more than a bit messy. Overall it has a great idea, good visuals and it runs well but it doesn't fly as high as I would have liked.</p>
<p>As a solo effort, it's thoroughly commendable, and a nice twist on the classic but not a game I'm going to recommend at this time. Fun for an hour or so but not much more than that due to the limited design and the problems mentioned.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366560/MiLE_HiGH_TAXi/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Striving for Light: Survival blends popular horde survivor games with a big skill tree</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you enjoy games like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and the other horde survival games? You may want to look at Striving for Light: Survival. <u>Note</u>: developer sent a key to my <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Created by Igniting Spark Games, it's now in Early Access with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. It's actually a sort-of spin-off from their previous game Striving for Light.</p>
<p>Their idea was to blend the ideas together from the likes of other popular arena survival games (of which there's now many), while giving you a big skill tree that is procedurally generated. The result is an experience that is certainly similar to Vampire Survivors, Brotato, Soulstone Survivors, Boneraiser Minions and the list goes on and on but different enough that it's quite exciting to play. The amount of combinations you can do during a run is just ridiculous, it's a lot more like Path of Exile.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IBzyTPzB6PE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c115134795d448c018fb910e74946323.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IBzyTPzB6PE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Experiment with more than 50 skills in an procedurally expanding skilltree.</li>
<li>10 maps with different enemies, traps and multiple difficulties to unlock.</li>
<li>8 different player characters.</li>
<li>Over 30 weapons to unlock.</li>
<li>Over 20 unique enemies, over 20 unique bosses and 10 unique endbosses.</li>
<li>Use dodge skillfully to avoid and escape attacks.</li>
<li>Everything is hand drawn, self-composed soundtrack with about 1 hour playtime.</li>
<li>Compete in multiple online leaderboards with seasons and private league system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Definitely one you should take a look at, if you love repeatable games like this. It gets pretty intense. Quite a big surprise actually to me as I wasn't sold on the graphical style they went for it, but that minor point faded away very quickly once I got into the action of it and started customizing my character as I went through the skill tree.</p>
<p>At only £2.49 this is an absolute steal.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to run Diablo 4 on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Diablo 4 is currently in Beta and due to launch soon, so here's how to get it working on Steam Deck. The same steps can be used to get it working on Linux desktop too.</p>
<p>You can see the video here, with the text guide below it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ESXTxFYFa48"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4efd2a7065a2e16ad23ae13281f44a26.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ESXTxFYFa48" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text Guide</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go into Desktop Mode (Steam button - Power - Switch to Desktop).</li>
<li>Download the <a href="http://battle.net" target="_blank">Battle.net</a> launcher in your web browser (Chrome / Firefox etc).</li>
<li>Download <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">ProtonUp-Qt</a> from the Discover app.</li>
<li>Inside ProtonUp-Qt, download the new "GE-Proton7-51-diablo_4_beta". Once done, close ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Inside Steam: hit Add A Game in the bottom left, select Add a non-Steam Game and hit Browse.</li>
<li>Go into your Downloads folder in the file browser, select All Files from the bottom and then select the "Battle.net-Setup.exe" file.</li>
<li>Once added, search for the Battle.Net installer shortcut in Steam. Right click -&gt; Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box and select GE-Proton7-51-diablo_4_beta.</li>
<li>Now run it and install it. Once installed, close it, do not login.</li>
<li>Right click on the shortcut again, go to Properties, hit Browse and update the shortcut to point to the "Battle.net Launcher.exe". It's location will depend on where you installed it.
<ul>
<li><u>SD Card</u>: <em>/run/media/mmcblk0p1/Battle.net/</em></li>
<li><u>SSD</u>: <em>/home/deck/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/ (then find the most recently created id) /pfx/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Battle.net/</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you will have Battle.Net set up and you can launch it in Gaming Mode, in the Non-Steam section of your Steam Library. You may need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard with STEAM + X, and you can use a mouse cursor by holding the STEAM button and using the Right Trackpad with Right Trigger as a mouse button.</p>
<p>The Battle.Net UI is cut off, but if you click about along the top of it, the app will flicker into focus giving you the install buttons at the bottom.</p>
<p>After that, you're free to install and run Diablo 4. If you get a GPU error message, just hit OK and it will run.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This is just one possible way to do it. You could also use <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> to install Battle.Net but I personally prefer on Steam Deck specifically to keep everything inside Steam if I can.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: First Contact Story Pack and the free 3.7 update are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have released the latest DLC for Stellaris with the First Contact Story Pack, along with a free update for all players. Since this is a Story Pack, it's not a full expansion. The idea really is to give dedicated players just that little bit more, good for role-playing and for building up those stories sci-fi fans love so much. This is the kind of thing I've been personally wanting.</p>
<p>The main highlights of it are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Origins:
<ul>
<li><em>Broken Shackles: </em>You didn’t take to the stars; you were taken <em>to </em>the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?</li>
<li><em>Payback:</em> No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own - until they actually showed up. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you’re about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!</li>
<li><em>Fear of the Dark:</em> As you’ve explored your home system, you’ve always suspected you weren’t alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an “incident” a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Pre-FTL Interaction Options: What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story? New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?</li>
<li>Cloaking Technology: Nobody saw this feature coming! Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware; keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts. Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong… you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_ZyJWy2yhOI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/721683e79fb4016f754bcac4276233cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_ZyJWy2yhOI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While I am a fan, and I genuinely appreciate Paradox's commitment to the long-term support of their games, the price is a bit steep for what it offers. Enjoyable? Yes. But, I have to say that even as big a fan as I am of Stellaris, the price just doesn't feel like it matches up to the additions this time around. Origins are, for the most part, statistics tweaks and an adjustment to your start and the politics of your civ. Then we have some new interactions (which are great) for pre-FTL and then cloaking. It's not exactly a lot for £12.79, a price that could get you some entire games, and even Stellaris itself (the whole game) has been priced below that constantly and for a few pounds / dollars more you could get a full Stellaris expansion.</p>
<p>Mechanically with the theme of this DLC, it would have been a much better fit to be in a slightly bigger mini-expansion. Especially with the cloaking tech, which is a fantastic addition and one that no doubt players will love to play with.</p>
<p>Overall, this is one for the most dedicated of fans. It is a good set of additions, don't get me wrong, but not enough that I would suggest a purchase right now unless you're going to buy a bundle of this and other DLC together to get the full experience.</p>
<p>Plus the free update version 3.7 "Canis Minor" was also released.</p>

      <title>Canonical want help testing their Steam snap package for Ubuntu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you game on Ubuntu or one of their flavours like Kubuntu or Xubuntu? Canonical want your help in further testing of the Steam snap. For anyone confused: there's many different types of packages on Linux. There's deb, rpm, flatpak, snap, appimage and more. Snap is what Canonical (who make Ubuntu) are rolling with.</p>
<p>Writing on their official Discourse forum, developer Ken VanDine <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/steam-call-for-testing/34575" target="_blank">mentioned</a> they're hoping to have the snap of Steam out of Early Access soon and available to everyone.</p>
<p>In the post VanDine mentioned they've been "working feverishly to resolve issues and ensure it works well" and testing has been done across "the most popular Steam titles which should ‘just work’ based on reports on ProtonDB". But now they want more people to get involved to give their reports on how games work.</p>
<p>Details on how to get involved can be seen in the <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/steam-call-for-testing/34575" target="_blank">forum post</a>.</p>
<p>The overall feeling you get from looking online is that snaps aren't particularly popular. However, is it just a case of a few people shouting above the rest? VanDine answered a few of my questions on that and more in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/an-interview-with-ken-vandine-ubuntu-desktop-lead-at-canonical/" target="_blank">an interview with GOL last year</a>.</p>

      <title>WorldBox - God Simulator adds in alliances, ages, clans and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WorldBox - God Simulator is a fun way to spend a coffee break, giving you a world to mess about with and a big new update is out now to give it a little bit more depth. This is a great casual game that does not take any part of it seriously, it's all about doing whatever the heck you want.</p>
<p>Just recently on March 12th a major update was released. The highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Ages - seasons that last for many years and bring disasters or prosperity to the world. From nightfall to madness, there’s many surprises included.</li>
<li>Alliances - they improves diplomacy by making civilizations unite together against common foes.</li>
<li>New Wars - wars now are more detailed. And you will be able to track how long it has been going on, including the death toll, etc.</li>
<li>Clans - kingdoms can and will be ruled by bloodlines and families.</li>
<li>Plans and Plots - addition to diplomacy, for making it more transparent who’s plotting what.</li>
<li>Music - we added new sound engine. Together with music based on what you’re watching right now and many new sounds!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A game for telling stories as everything unfolds and often it's hilarious chaos. You can be really hands-off with it, or you can truly mess with everyone. In my latest game, I decided to see what would happen if I created three separate civilizations: Humans, Dwarves and Orcs. I gave them all the same opportunities, the same amount of starting people, a few cows and even a couple of cats — which the Orcs didn't appreciate, they killed them…so I nuked them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3289750131679059872gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3289750131679059872gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility and clearly I needed to step in, who doesn't like cats?</p>
<p>After that, I decided to put down a bunch of Elves in their place and let the world grow for a little while. That was, until I discovered the power to make plants come to life. It's hard to resist such a hilarious sounding power, and so I used it all around my little Dwarves. Not sure I thought that one through, the Trees went on a murdering spree.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17095282031679060406gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17095282031679060406gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>So then of course I had to deal with very angry trees roaming around, so then Napalm had to come out otherwise the trees would ruin everything my other civilizations had built up. I couldn't risk it. Am I the real monster here? No, I am God, I can't do wrong — right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3046600911679060510gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3046600911679060510gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Anyway, a good while later once things settled down, I decided to try and make it a bit more peaceful. I gave everyone some chickens and various other animals. Things looked good, they even built some farms and windmills. The world in my box here was coming together. That was, until, the Humans and Elves went to war. This isn't going to end well…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9833470801679061016gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9833470801679061016gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I think I might have to spawn a Rat King, perhaps add in a few Evil Mages and a couple Demons to see if it makes them all come together for the greater good. What could possibly go wrong? </p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1206560/WorldBox__God_Simulator/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> with Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Cities: Skylines final expansion is in May, with a bunch of stuff coming soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/paradox-cities-skylines-2-plus-the-sims-like-game/" target="_blank">Cities: Skylines 2 is on the way</a> but Paradox and Colossal Order aren't done just yet with Cities: Skylines. Multiple new content additions were just announced. They said they plan to continue to support the game for the rest of the year, but it seems like that may be it.</p>
<p>They've announced that on March 22nd three new content packs will release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Africa in Miniature</strong></em>: A new world of possibilities set in the African Continent. The first Content Creator Pack from long-time Cities fan, 3D Artist Setonji "Prince Set" Hotonu allows you to explore Africa’s exceptionally diverse architecture, vibrant colors, and unique urban mix.
<ul>
<li><em>Africa In Miniature </em>includes a total of 28 new buildings inspired by the existing urban masterpieces and unique architectural concepts. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Sports Venues</strong></em>: Sports season never ends in this Content Creator Pack by community modder BadPeanut. From unique stadiums to community sports parks, this Content Creator Pack has everything you need to satisfy your City’s needs for sports!
<ul>
<li>Watch your citizens enjoy their favorite match! All large stadiums have realistic football, baseball, and American football animation - plus some new cool stats for you to look at. Some of them also have built-in public transport options. Do you prefer smaller crowds? Try Community sports parks: they’re smaller and can be placed everywhere.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Shopping Malls:</strong></em> It’s time for some retail extravaganza! With the Content Creator Pack “Shopping Malls” by community modder KingLeno you can bring your shopping experience to the next level, adding a variety of shopping malls to your City. 
<ul>
<li>This content creator pack offers more than 60 assets, including department stores, shopping plazas, and fast food restaurants to populate your Shopping areas. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus these radio stations too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>JADIA Radio Station</strong>: The African continent is vast, and its music is diverse. JADIA Radio Station (Just Another Day in Africa) is a collection of 16 tracks from musician Wan Shey who pays homage to his country’s musical traditions, adding new vibes to Cities: Skylines.</li>
<li><strong>80’s Movies Tunes</strong>: This time we’re taking you to the movies! “80’s Movies Tunes” is a Radio Station inspired by the 80’s classics. Let’s dive into the past with more than 15 tracks and around 70 minutes of music.</li>
<li><strong>Pop-Punk Radio</strong>: We created this Radio Station for all the Pop-Punk city builders out there. If you enjoy pop-punk music, then this Radio Station is for you! With 16 tracks and more than 75 minutes of powerful, high-beat tunes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That will be in addition to a free update for all players on the same day named "Hubs and Transport", that improves the transport system for Cities: Skylines base game as well as the After Dark, Snowfall, Natural Disasters, and Mass Transit expansions. </p>
<p>More is to come after that, with a final mini-expansion and more content packs arriving in May.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9605315021679058733gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9605315021679058733gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Half-Life: MMod gets a release on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life: MMod just released on Steam, a mod for the original Half-Life that overhauls many parts of it to create something that feels fresh.</p>
<p>Keeping most changes optional, the point is just to give a slightly more upgraded experience while sticking close to the original game. The point of it really is to add into the original game, giving you more options to get through it and to have a bit more fun. So it's quite the opposite of Black Mesa. So perhaps a good choice for those who want mostly vanilla with some added spice. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ercz2xaDSL4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ebc2ff23b3e21084534b08bfc8fdf8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ercz2xaDSL4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what it provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Revised gunplay, dynamic weapon bullet spread, smooth recoil, optional non-hitscan bullets.</li>
<li>Enhanced player and visual feedback.</li>
<li>Minor AI tweaks, more reactive and responsive AI, nearly every character blinks.</li>
<li>New and extra weapon animations.</li>
<li>Built in basic chapter selection system.</li>
<li>Touched up weapon models, animated weapon screens and creature eyes.</li>
<li>New arsenal, special weapon functions ( silencers, addons, fire modes ).</li>
<li>Plenty of bug fixes.</li>
<li>VFX re-design ( explosions, bullet impacts, muzzle flashes, monster effects, etc. ).</li>
<li>Minor sound re-design, additional weapon and monster sounds.</li>
<li>Weapon foley sounds for every single weapon.</li>
<li>Restored HEV voice lines.</li>
<li>Slightly enhanced visuals, detail textures.</li>
<li>Visual, atmospheric and pacing related map tweaks and additions ( work in progress ).</li>
<li>Some additions can be toggled in special settings menu.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Spring Sale is live, Steam Deck gets a discount and startup movie customization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The 2023 Steam Spring Sale is now live, and with it Valve has put the Steam Deck on sale for the first time.</p>
<p>In all supported regions (including <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/product/steam-deck/" target="_blank">Asia</a>), you can now pick up a Steam Deck with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">10% off</a>. Just over a year since release seems like a good time for it to be on sale don't you think? On top of that, you can now officially customize your Steam Deck Startup Movie. In the Settings -&gt; Customization, with no system update needed, it's now live. You can buy them with Steam Points, and the system they built supports the custom movies you've been able to add for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17948775841678987197gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17948775841678987197gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8532096041678987186gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8532096041678987186gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>

<p>Valve also did a little birthday video for the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ELtzcpb_j38"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/059d09e632834af6b796b5c1f531fd82.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ELtzcpb_j38" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Space colony building sim Starmancer gets a huge content upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After quite a while of waiting, Ominux Games have released The Wilderness update for space colony building sim Starmancer. This is the first proper update to the game since early 2022, and it needed it because it was very Early Access, although it was clearly going in the right direction.</p>
<p>Speaking about the update the developer said: "Leave the comforts of your space station to loot asteroids and derelict ships across the galaxy. Hunt for resources, take on territorial monsters, and avoid alien… probing?! Advance your ship using your newfound space booty and experiment with forbidden technologies. You might even adopt a wandering Space Colonist - but be careful, you never know who or what you might encounter…"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8wF1qpA855A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/592458b155c278a6d369da8eaeebcc70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8wF1qpA855A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's quite a lot to the update too, they've clearly been busy. There's explorable station and asteroids spread around, lots of new enemies, you can draft a colonist to your bidding, a rebalance of many core mechanics, tons of bug fixes, more cheats and settings to customize to properly personalize the experience and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Nice to see such a big update for a promising game that has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/starmancer?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/starmancer?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062000/Starmancer/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Upcoming base-building RTS &#39;Dying Breed&#39; set after a WW2 nuclear holocaust</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in an alternate timeline where WW2 ended in a full nuclear holocaust, the classic base-building RTS named Dying Breed is worth keeping an eye on. You can even try a demo right now. The world has found peace but there's a strange new energy source emerging from underground, and so naturally a fight is brewing over it with you being able to enter the world as either human or mutant-cyborgs.</p>
<p>The gameplay is something you might have expected to see in the original Command &amp; Conquer or Red Alert — it even has some retro acted briefing videos. It's a classic on some serious steroids, as you fight across different locations simultaneously and it gives you some hero units with unique abilities too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qN-YqktN1to"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d3f5a14052b2aef0d1476fe272acdc9b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qN-YqktN1to" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm definitely keen to see a whole lot more from this one, it's nice to see there's some developers out there who will keep trying on these classic RTS experiences which I grew up playing and still very much love now.</p>
<p>Go check out the <em>two</em> demos on <a href="https://sarnayer.itch.io/dying-breed" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088550/Dying_Breed/" target="_blank">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Slime 3K: Rise Against Despot looks like a fun time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slime 3K: Rise Against Despot is a fresh announcement from Konfa Games and TinyBuild, a spin-off from their earlier game Despot's Game: Dystopian Battle Simulator that I quite enjoyed. This time it's going to be an action rogue-lite, and it could be pretty chaotic from the screenshots.</p>
<p>More about it: "In an attempt to mass produce artificial pink humans, evil artificial intelligence d’Spot’s gooey formula accidentally mutates, becoming self-aware. Humans, robots, and monsters pounce on you in an endless stream. Luckily, you can grow and develop new weapons to transform everything into mincemeat like a giant gelatinous meat grinder."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5353094001678975896gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5353094001678975896gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy. Your decision-making skills are more important than your ability to press buttons at the right time.</li>
<li>Snowball. Enemies are getting twice as strong every minute, which means you have to be even more powerful! Become the ultimate jelly death machine!</li>
<li>Rewards. A huge amount of content unlockable between sessions allows you to constantly experiment with new builds and overcome new challenges.</li>
<li>Fun. It's fun to watch little pink humans pop when you crush them!</li>
</ul>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/Despotism_3k/status/1636301125551902720" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, their confirmed their plan for Linux support on this one too.</p>
<p>“Slime 3K is the next chapter in the Despotism universe, but with a brand new twist,” said Nikolay Kuznetsov, Game Creator, Konfa Games. “We wanted to add an alternative way to explore the world of d’Spot while implementing both new and familiar mechanics to reinvigorate a chaotically compelling gameplay experience.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/556967801678975901gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/556967801678975901gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Once they released some footage for a trailer, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hitting retail in Hong Kong, Taiwan and later Japan and South Korea</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's partner Komodo has announced they've teamed up with Acer, as they're bringing the Steam Deck to retail stores in Asia.</p>
<p>This initial extra partnership focuses on Hong Kong and Taiwan with both the Steam Deck and Valve's official Docking Station hitting stores tomorrow, March 17th. They also said the Steam Deck will be available to demo at these stores too, so potential buyers can get a proper look. Here's the locations opening up for Steam Deck purchases:</p>
<p>PREDATOR Proshops in Hong Kong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Golden Computer Centre Shop.</li>
<li>K11 MUSEA Shop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acer Retail Store in Taiwan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guang Hua Digital Plaza.</li>
<li>Taoyuan NOVA.</li>
<li>Zhongli NOVA.</li>
<li>Taichung NOVA.</li>
<li>Hsinchu NOVA.</li>
<li>Tainan Rainbow.</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point in the future, Komodo will also be expanding this retail launch into Japan and South Korea. No other details on timing for that was given though.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are excited to work with Acer Gaming to continue toward our goal of delivering Steam Deck to the widest range of customers,” said Ricky Uy, CEO of Komodo.</p>
<p>“Acer Gaming cooperates with popular game industry brands to create a complete gaming life experience from offline to online," said Ting-Yang Hsu, General Manager of Acer Gaming. “Through this collaboration with Komodo, we are demonstrating the importance Acer Gaming places on the gaming market.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>Could be a very nice boost for Steam Deck numbers! As I keep saying: we need more people buying it and playing on it, to have more game developers care and support it. Having more game devs optimise directly for it would be great. We still need Valve to expand into other regions too, hopefully they will have more to announce this year.</p>

      <title>Valheim got a big patch with performance upgrades and controller improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim continues to get improvements and it's easily one of my favourite survival games, it's just fantastic with a couple of friends. This new update should make it even better.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3675538825743028462" target="_blank">latest update</a> doesn't have any major changes but it's quite an important one, as it fixes up quite a few problematic parts of it and there's some nice quality of life improvements like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added alternative controller layout and changed layout to be more readable. Build snapping is a toggle in the alternative layout, and has an icon when active.</li>
<li>Added manual save button to the pause menu that displays last save time.</li>
<li>Crafting menus and quick use bar now have cycling navigation when using gamepad.</li>
<li>You can now use the sticks to move to and from a container inventory from the player inventory directly rather than changing menu focus.</li>
<li>Crafting station is now focused when opening a crafting station.</li>
<li>Language can now be changed without restarting the game.</li>
<li>If a server is unjoinable for version mismatch or other restriction this will shown when attempting to join a game from the server list immediately rather than having to wait for the game to load.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the above, playing with a gamepad or on Steam Deck should feel a fair bit better and easier.</p>
<p>Performance can be something of an issue at times, especially for those on lower-powered devices like the Steam Deck. The good news is that they focused a bit more on it with this update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Performance of distant mountain shadows greatly increased, and added a setting to turn off distant shadows completely. (This may increase performance significantly for players with older graphic cards).</li>
<li>Performance increased while in dungeons.</li>
<li>Performance improved when using many map pins.</li>
<li>Performance improved while using the inventory with many items.</li>
<li>Network stability and performance improvements for crossplay.</li>
<li>Memory optimizations for textures and fonts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing it out once again on Steam Deck, with distance shadows turn off because honestly they're really not needed at all here and running around for a while showed a pretty nice improvement in the performance overall. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18327619901678961697gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>A whole bunch of other fixes too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Munin to Ribcage locations in Mistlands.</li>
<li>Added saving icon to HUD and delayed the "bad connection icon" when saving.</li>
<li>All game texts have been optimised for better clarity and performance.</li>
<li>Reworked button prompts to a new visual style, added some missing buttons, etc.</li>
<li>Key hints are now displayed in a horizontal line rather than vertical list and visible in all needed contexts.</li>
<li>Kicked players get a proper message.</li>
<li>Menu selection markers should now be displayed correctly in all languages.</li>
<li>Fixed several focus loss scenarios when using a gamepad.</li>
<li>Haldor’s lines are now translated correctly.</li>
<li>Build menu has been widened to avoid overlapping other interface items.</li>
<li>D-Pad should now be usable in all menus.</li>
<li>Controller and keyboard usage of menus improved.</li>
<li>Skills menu should now work correctly with gamepad and show tooltips correctly.</li>
<li>Mistlands boss should no longer escape her room during rare occasions (changes have been made to how ownership of objects work when transferred to another player; specifically checking the positions).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused projectiles to sometimes miss even though it obviously should have connected.</li>
<li>Durability bar on item in the inventory and action bar is now only visible if the item has been damaged.</li>
<li>Fixed a visual bug that showed servers that were being pinged as offline.</li>
<li>Thatch roof i-corner 45o can now support itself and will protect underlying beams from rain properly.</li>
<li>Thatch &amp; darkwood roof top 26o middle beam point fixed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Steam Deck and desktop Steam upgraded with LAN transfers out of Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh big stable update to the Steam Client has rolled out for Steam Deck and desktop Steam, bringing with it the useful LAN transfer feature.</p>
<p>This means you're now able to have a PC transfer games and updates across the network to other PCs and to a Steam Deck as well. Could be very useful for really big downloads, especially when you're on limited connections. You can set it so it's only allowed for yourself, friends only or everyone.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8233881841678960258gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8233881841678960258gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And how it looks on Desktop when doing the transfer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10442193991678960303gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10442193991678960303gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As usual, the changes between desktop and Steam Deck are largely the same since this is a Steam Client update and of course they both pretty much now use the same thing.</p>

      <title>Lancer Tactics announced adapting the tabletop roleplaying game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your mechs? Lancer Tactics was announced recently, as a video game adaption of the popular crowdfunded tabletop roleplaying game.</p>
<p>The original campaign for the TTRPG pulled in a healthy $432K, so it's not a surprise to see this new crowdfunding campaign to turn it into a cross-platform video game (Linux, macOS, Windows) has been a success already at $94K funding with 16 days left to go.</p>
<p>On the campaign the developer mentioned how they "love this system of modular mechs, and I'm sad and furious at our historical and current politics — let's make a game where you can fight imperialist land-stealing goons by being gay and doing crime in giant robots!". Worth noting this is an unofficial adaption, but approved thanks to Lancer's very easy-going <a href="https://massifpress.com/legal" target="_blank">licensing</a>.</p>

<p>Fun fact: it's being developed with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. The developer previously created <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/372030/Starship_Rubicon/" target="_blank">Starship Rubicon</a> and <a href="https://crescentloom.com/" target="_blank">Crescent Loom</a>, both of which also support Linux.</p>

      <title>Marble It Up! gets Native Linux support in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for a challenge? Marble-rolling platformer Marble It Up! just recently gained Native Linux support in a Beta.</p>
<p>Announced by game porter and FNA developer Ethan Lee on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1634632058889707520" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, you'll need to force the Steam Linux Runtime on Steam Deck to get it to download after opting into the Beta. On Desktop Linux, just installing it with the Beta selected should be fine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6vtTBc65ZVc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7de1c7440178d8e1735a64ee9276c625.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6vtTBc65ZVc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed by the minds behind the Marble Blast series, if any of you are familiar with that.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Chapters</strong> - Experience the pure joy of rolling in 60 levels filled to the brim with dangerous obstacles, mind-bending paths, brand new hazards, shifting gravity, and flexible power ups - all while taking in the beautifully intricate, geometric visuals!</li>
<li><strong>The Collectibles</strong> - Over 100 unique marbles are just waiting to be collected! Complete chapters, earn medals, find hidden trophies, and play Weekly Challenges to grow your magnificent marble collection! Play for keeps!</li>
<li><strong>The Challenges</strong> - All new game mode: Weekly Challenges. Every week, we break our own rules on a select set of maps. Low gravity? Double jump? No powerups? How about all three? Compete each week for rewards!</li>
<li><strong>The Chase</strong> - Global and friends leaderboards, replays, ghost races, and a rewindable practice mode? Say hello to all the tools you’ll ever need to become the best player in the world and top your friends list!</li>
<li><strong>The Community</strong> - The Steam Workshop is overflowing with fantastic user-made maps from our talented, passionate, and dedicated community! Over 200 levels are roll-ready and available with a few simple clicks!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently noted as Unsupported by Valve on Steam Deck, perhaps this work in the upcoming update and Native Linux port will help bring it up to Verified.</p>

      <title>Steampunk survival game Volcanoids has been invaded by drones</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I think it might be seriously time to play a whole lot more Volcanoids, with the new Ground Support update adding in special drones you can build and it looks awesome. The update also adds in new achievements, a few performance improvements, Japanese and Dutch translations, audio improvements and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<p>This is the survival game where instead of building up a big sprawling base, you have a steampunk drillship to burrow deep underground with. It's a really clever idea that they keep expanding on during Early Access. These new drones you can build can help with defence, mining and more — you can even build a little fort with them. Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x-LrzyT3sAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2dbc1c3988d1ec2b6e1f74ededbad919.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x-LrzyT3sAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Going back to it today, I'm impressed by how far it has come. Even at a 1440p resolution, it's performing so much better than it used to. Some small loading hiccups here and there but other than that, it seems to have progressed nicely. Looks a fair bit better too. If you're after a survival game that you can do in co-op, that's quite different to all the rest, it's worth a look for sure.</p>
<p>The game gets surprisingly spooky at times too. With you always on a timer before a volcano erupts, once it does and you come back up to the smoke seeing all the little lights of various enemies is quite unique.</p>

      <title>Turn-based colony builder on the red planet Terraformers is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a while in Early Access, Terraformers from Asteroid Lab and Goblinz Publishing / IndieArk is officially out now with the 1.0 update. Another great looking game that offers Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You face the challenge of turning the rather barren Mars into a lush thriving planet, capable of supporting a growing number of people. In a way it's similar to Surviving Mars, however it's turn-based instead of real-time and gives you a procedurally generated world to start anew each time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zb-xnoOt6bI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6cfcd3cadcef63178d0c9ae323f2e69c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zb-xnoOt6bI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's new in the 1.0 update include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Found new cities on the nearby moons of Phobos and Deimos.</li>
<li>Construct new buildings, complete new space projects, and research new technologies.</li>
<li>Contend with five new events, including the catastrophic asteroid event.</li>
<li>Two new leaders, each with their own background, skills, and perks.</li>
<li>Weekly Challenge mode - play a specific game each week with modifiers and test your skills in multiple difficulties while having your success streak tracked.</li>
<li>New animations to make cities more lively.</li>
<li>Earn 62 new Steam achievements.</li>
<li>Go back to different instances of your colonies with multiple saves.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Curious about this one, since I'm a big fan of strategy games and I love sci-fi themes like this, I decided to pick it up and see what it was like. I can easily see why so many people like it, it definitely gives off that feeling of needing "just one more turn" so you can keep on expanding. Even though it can be a difficult balancing act on all the resources, the support and happiness of your people and the random events, it always feels pretty chilled out.</p>
