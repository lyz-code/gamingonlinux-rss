      <title>Total War: Warhammer III cautiously builds upon a tried and true formula</title>
      <author>BTRE</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest entry in the Total War franchise was ported by Feral Interactive over to Linux last month. After spending a good chunk of time commanding armies and bringing chaos to the land, I have a few thoughts to share.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GcG6dVTsv1U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e18024e573ceb21d904fd7d83ceb0447.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GcG6dVTsv1U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Key provided by Feral Interactive</p>
<p>For those of you who might be unaware, the mouthful-of-a-name Total War: Warhammer III is the third entry in the crossover over franchises of the strategic Total War games with the setting of Warhammer Fantasy. It sees players picking between various races and factions and fighting for supremacy, either trying to save or cover the power of an imprisoned and dying god. The game mixes a strategic turn-based layer where armies are recruited and directed, cities conquered or sacked, with real-time battles where hundreds of units might be pitted against one another.</p>
<p>I’ve played a great deal of the Total War series over the years and the core formula remains more or less unchanged. The developers have gotten good at polishing the heart of things and so, even at the game’s worst, it never fails to be at least somewhat entertaining. Effort has been made in this latest entry to add unique mechanics to every faction, mainly choices that can be made every couple of turns that allow for some sort of strategic advantage or boost to units or cities. The technology trees are unique and, often, there might even be different ways to approach city construction and income generation.</p>
<p>The bloodthirsty demons of Khorne may, for example, raze a settlement upon capture, spawning a smaller army from the chaos that can then go on to cause more mayhem before dissipating a couple of turns later. They then have a chance to expand into depopulated settlements automatically, so long as they own another settlement in the region. If not, they can use their unique secondary currency, skulls, to create a settlement. These same skulls are gained from battle or by razing cities and are spent on technologies or to perform special rites that gain the player the favor of Khorne.</p>
<p>Another faction, Grand Cathay, is a Warhammer Fantasy's answer to the Chinese Empire and has it incorporates a mechanic of harmony between yin and yang, providing a bonus if your empire keeps the elements balanced. Units, buildings and commanders all are either one or the other and some building chains are mutually exclusive. So keeping an eye on the overall situation of your empire is a must. Additionally, trade caravans may be sent to far-off cities, taking several turns to reach their destination and liable to events and possible battles by hostile factions that attack it. If the caravan reaches its destination, a large return on the invested gold is given to the player.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised at how these base factions are all different, given that previous titles only really reserved these more obvious differences for the DLC factions that were added in a steady trickle after launch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12957111751658715083gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12957111751658715083gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Most of these bells and whistles are found in the singleplayer campaign, the real heart of the game. Every faction essentially competes with one another to reach the dying bear-god Ursun before it dies. While there’s a simplified diplomacy and trade system, by and large interactions with factions will inevitably end with war. To break up the usual map-painting and territory-conquering, every couple of turns portals that lead to the realm of the Chaos Gods open on the map. Factions may then venture forth in order to claim a Daemon Prince’s soul from each god, navigating the hazards of each realm in the process.</p>
<p>I think that this is a particularly good innovation compared to the previous titles, as it’s easier for the AI to keep up with the player throughout the campaign. I had to keep an eye on AI opponents’ progress and be mindful of balancing my expansion; if my main army was too far away from a portal at the wrong time it could mean the difference between snatching a soul before the AI or not. In two of my campaigns, an AI faction got all four souls before of me. I was still able to eventually win, however, as armies can be intercepted before they reach the site of the final campaign battle. Defeating a faction leader makes them lose their collected souls, and so I was able to buy myself a little time and make it myself before Ursun finally succumbed.</p>
<p>The downside to this more focused advancement is, however, that every faction’s win condition is more or less the same. The pre-scripted battles in the Chaos Realms as well as the final battle are a little underwhelming if you do them more than once. There are some faction-specific quests and expansion targets, along with some unique buildings that can be built in specific towns—if conquered—but that does little to offset the general focus. Overall, I’d take this more precise approach over the slogs that characterized the first two titles.</p>
<p>Unit rosters are fairly varied between factions, with some favoring ranged units, cavalry, special abilities, hit and run tactics and all the other things that are, by now, standard to Total War games. There ‘s still some room for experimentation within your faction’s roster, with a few alternative units and heroes potentially emphasizing certain thematic aspects of the faction more than others. For example, Kislev’s infantry tend to also have some ranged capabilities that can either be a basis for a flexible core of all-rounders or be used as distractions for powerful cavalry and ice witches to really do a lot of damage. As units unlock towards the end game, there’s still often good reason to use more basic units in your army as well, thanks to unlocked technologies and bonuses given by commanders.</p>
<p>That said, not every faction is equal. While it’s less obvious in the singleplayer campaign, during single battles with the AI or in multiplayer, these disparities become more obvious. Despite a few patches addressing balance issues, things aren’t quite all there yet. The fact remains that some factions are less competitive than others. Especially when it comes to auto-resolving combat which, again, has been addressed with patches, but still can be needlessly harsh. In a long campaign this can mean a few more hours spent winning relatively-unimportant battles manually in order to preserve the strength of your carefully-recruited armies.</p>
<p>The battle AI itself remains on par with other Total War titles. In other words, it can win against a weaker player but it is usually tactically incompetent. It is easy to flank units, bait it and otherwise apply basic counters to (usual) numerical superiority. The most interesting types of battles came about when trying to hold off a far-flung outpost against a surprise attack using only garrison troops. Part of this is due to the asymmetry but also due to the new siege battle system which allows defenders to place their own obstacles and structures according to available resources. The longer the siege (or with certain technologies unlocked), the more toys defenders will potentially be able to set. It’s a nice novelty but one that ultimately becomes less and less thrilling over the course of a campaign, let alone multiple ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10544899001658715085gol1294.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10544899001658715085gol1294.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Visually, I think that Total War: Warhammer III is generally nice to look at. The Chaos Realms are very unique and have lots of little details and animations that are worth appreciating. Other areas of the map are likewise vibrant, with their own landmarks and special features. But, sadly, all of that gets relatively little opportunity to shine. Because the main conflict will be between the various Chaos factions in the northern, icy wasteland and others, the battlefields tend to repeat themselves a lot. I couldn’t begin to tell you just how many times I fought on similar-looking snow-capped hills or in dead borderlands.</p>
<p>To be fair, this is true to the lore of Warhammer Fantasy. Still, given the ostentatiously colorful lizardmen of the previous entry with their jungle environs, the green and messy orks in the badlands or the cool dead civilization of the desert tomb lords, I can’t help but feel that fighting in predominantly icy areas for most of the game is comparatively bland. It is only in far-flung areas on the periphery of the map—where there is little reason to expand and fight—that jungle, forest, badlands and other areas can be found. An average playthrough will see little-to-no player involvement in those places as you'll be too busy dealing with the AI and the Chaos Realms to send expeditions there.</p>
<p>This particular complaint is already set to be addressed soon. The upcoming Immortal Empires update is expected the be released into beta next month and will combine the map and factions of previous games into a sort of mega campaign. Owners of previous titles will get access to this new campaign along with other free content. It’s something to be excited about and I look forward to seeing how all the disparate factions will alter the feel of the game.</p>
<p>On the technical front, Feral’s Linux port is a solid affair. It easily outperforms the Proton version of the game across the board. The difference is smallest at higher graphical settings (likely due to bottlenecking from my own hardware) but I noticed higher minimums and more higher, and more consistent, frame rates with the port. My aging RX 480 was able to hit a 60 FPS target on both the campaign map and in battles using a mix of settings, mostly in the mid range. Cranking up certain details or options short of ‘ultra’ still provided a very playable experience that staying about 30 FPS. I should also note that the Linux port also has an FSR option that’s not found in the Windows version, allowing players on older hardware to sacrifice a little visual fidelity for higher performance.</p>
<p>There are a pair of very notable drawbacks to the Linux port, however. First and most noticeable is the lack of cross-platform multiplayer. Those playing the port will be unable to play with Windows users. So if you’re into the more competitive multiplayer side of the Total War fandom, it might be best to stick with playing the game via Proton.</p>
<p>Secondly, patches are likely to be delayed for the port. Shortly after the port’s release, the game got its 1.3 update which had a few important balance and quality-of-life changes. It took several weeks for that patch, and a few hotfixes, to make it to the Linux side of things. Given that it was much the same for older releases done by Feral, I would expect that it might be a long while before Linux gamers get their hands on the hotly-anticipated Immortal Empires patch with its expanded campaign and map.</p>
<p>With all of that said, I think that Total War: Warhammer III is a fine game that is likely to get even better with time. It might stay a little close to the tried and true formula for my tastes but the things that are new, such as the Chaos Realms, are welcome attempts to shake things up a little. Elsewhere, it's pretty much just the usual Total War fare. I’m willing to overlook the weak battle AI because the general experience of trying to survive and thrive amidst the challenges from all directions is compelling enough to provide satisfaction upon the completion of a hard-fought campaign. But others might not be so generous and more hardcore players might be put off by the lack of progress on that front. Still, if it's any consolation, there is already a vibrant mod scene. The usual difficulty and balance mods, quality-of-life improvements, and ambitious overhauls and player expansions can be found in the workshop.</p>
<p>With big changes only a month away, it might be prudent to wait until then before hopping into the game for the first time. No doubt large balance changes will follow, as well the usual additional free content that Creative Assembly is known to include with big updates.</p>

      <title>DIMENSIONAL SLAUGHTER is an absolutely wild sounding fast-paced retro shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have the need for speed and love a good retro first-person shooter? DIMENSIONAL SLAUGHTER is what you should take a look at.</p>
<p>The developer calls it a "movement shooter" that has taken " the best parts of what makes both modern and retro shooters such as DOOM ETERNAL and QUAKE fun, then sticks them in a blender with fast paced Rogue-Like progression and Perma-Death, leaving for an even more intense experience with absolutely NO space for filler". I know that description will certainly pull in a few eyes. There's also "no intrusive story", it's all about the gibs.</p>
<p>It seems to do a few curious things like sending you through different dimensions with different enemies, and a unique weapon for each area. In a way, the way you progress sounds perhaps a bit like Risk of Rain 2 but the order of the areas you go is randomized. Why is it a movement shooter then? Well, everything is fast as hell and ammunition is a reward for moving around so you have to stay on your toes.</p>

<p>It's definitely not the prettiest around but I'm sure the action will make plenty of FPS fans happy.</p>
<p>The system requirements are mildly amusing too noting it needs "Sound Card: LOUDEST POSSIBLE DAMMIT", and on the macOS side "Additional Notes: shouldn't have bought a mac" — ouch.</p>

      <title>hexceed is a free hexagonal Minesweeper out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a new relaxing puzzle game that doesn't require guesswork? Recently hexceed gained a Native Linux port. While the main game is completely free, it does have paid DLC which includes a ton of extra content. The main game has a Very Positive review score on Steam so looks like another quality game to add to your collection.</p>
<p>The Linux port was noted in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1463920/view/3399672421079102870" target="_blank">news post</a>, which also went over another DLC pack that went up adding over 100 new levels to play through. I don't think the gameplay needs much explaining really, it's just an interesting small twist on the well-known mechanics of Minesweeper but looks worth a go.</p>

      <title>Free and open source multiplayer voxel RPG &#39;Veloren&#39; version 0.13 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking more promising than ever, the in-development free and open source RPG <a href="https://veloren.net/" target="_blank">Veloren</a> has a big new release out. A fully original open source game although it does take inspiration from Cube World, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20014498271658760226gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of what's new in this release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modular weapons</li>
<li>Real-time weather: rain, wind, thunder, lightning</li>
<li>Cliff towns</li>
<li>Interconnected cave networks with cave biomes</li>
<li>LoD trees (looks more visually interesting far-off)</li>
<li>More character customisation options</li>
<li>NPC personalities</li>
<li>Loot ownership for drops from mining</li>
<li>New ambience sounds</li>
<li>Slider for ambience volume</li>
<li>+ Loads more</li>
</ul>
<p>Good to see it continue to advance. It's properly playable, although a lot of the work currently is still going into the technical implementations of all the features so it's not quite a proper game yet, still somewhat fun to go exploring in though.</p>

      <title>Slay the Princess is an upcoming choice-driven psychological horror visual novel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Tabby Games have just announced Slay the Princess. It's a choice-driven psychological horror visual novel / dating sim with dramatic branching, light RPG elements and hand-penciled art. This is the same developer who created Scarlet Hollow, a popular episodic visual novel.</p>
<p>I found Scarlet Hollow to be pretty great so it's nice to see the developer do more, and with Native Linux support again. See the new reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RByDoYQpFa8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6705218599bf8407c1d6cad9042962b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RByDoYQpFa8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A princess.</strong> She's very bad and you have to get rid of her for all our sakes.</li>
<li><strong>No, the Princess isn't a cosmic horror.</strong> She's just an ordinary human Princess, and you can definitely slay her as long as you put your mind to it.</li>
<li><strong>Don't even think about trying to romance her.</strong> It won't end well for you.</li>
<li><strong>Hopefully you won't die.</strong> But if you do, you'll die a lot. Be careful and stay focused on the task at hand!</li>
<li>Time loops <strong>No time loops.</strong> Don't be ridiculous. Time is a strictly linear concept and it certainly doesn't "loop," whatever that's supposed to mean.</li>
<li><strong>A branching narrative</strong> where what you say and what you believe determines both your build and how the story unfolds.</li>
<li><strong>A new roleplaying experience from the creators of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/" target="_blank">Scarlet Hollow</a>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fully voice-acted</strong> by the impeccable Jonathan Sims and Nichole Goodnight.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Looks like upcoming brawler MultiVersus works great on Steam Deck &amp; Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/" target="_blank">MultiVersus</a> is a very exciting one that has a lot of people talking right now. It's a brawler much like Smash Bros made by Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games and it's already looking pretty great.</p>
<p>You can currently get a key by watching one hour of it on Twitch, if the streamer has drops enabled or buy buying a Founder pack. Or, just wait until July 26th when it goes into Open Beta. I managed to get a key to take a look, and it seems out of the box it just works with Proton.</p>
<p>Why are people so excited about it? Well, Smash Bros has a huge fanbase and people have been wanting something properly <em>popular</em> like this on PC for a while, plus you have a roster of rather fun characters included in this like Shaggy that appears to power up like he's in Dragon Ball — what's not to love? Since it will be free to play, there's no barrier to entry either.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WSmayHK7Nl4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13be42bdd800d8fab9b471efb1dd1b70.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WSmayHK7Nl4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>One thing I did notice when testing it on my Fedora Linux desktop with an Xbox controller, was to turn off Steam Configuration support in the Big Picture settings for Xbox controllers, otherwise the game wouldn't detect it. Apart from that, on desktop Linux it works great too.</p>

      <title>GameMode performance tool from Feral Interactive version 1.7 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode" target="_blank">GameMode</a>, the system optimization tool from Feral Interactive recently had a new small release put up.</p>
<p>What does it do? When you run games with it the tool can do things like tweak the CPU governor for performance, change the I/O priority, process niceness, kernel scheduler, inhibit the screensaver, set your GPU into performance mode, allows custom scripts and so on. The point is that it can in a lot of cases ensure you're giving a game as much power as possible but it doesn't always work so well.</p>
<p>Version 1.7 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added new utility: <code class="inline-code">gamemodelist</code> to show running processes using it</li>
<li>Run executables from <code class="inline-code">PATH</code> instead of <code class="inline-code">/usr/bin</code> to work across more distributions</li>
<li>Add a trivial <code class="inline-code">gamemode.conf</code> file, which creates the gamemode group to help control permissions</li>
<li>Various minor bugfixes and updates to documentation</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once installed to run it on specific games with Steam, all you would need to do is add this as a launch option for example:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gamemoderun %command%</code></p>
<p>Or for standalone games:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gamemoderun ./game</code></p>

      <title>You can now get Halo Infinite online to work on the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's taken quite a while but you can at least now play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240440/Halo_Infinite/" target="_blank">Halo Infinite</a> multiplayer on Steam Deck (single-player not tested). This is all unofficial right now, so try it at your own risk.</p>
<p>Thanks to the latest updates to <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> and the latest Steam Deck Beta (the <u>Preview</u> branch), you can get it to work. If you need to know how to install GE-Proton on Steam Deck, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">follow this guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the main steps to get it working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opt into the Steam Deck Preview</li>
<li>In desktop mode: download GE-Proton 7-26 using the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">linked guide</a></li>
<li>Open Halo Infinite local files and delete or rename the "videos" folder</li>
<li>Set Halo Infinite to use GE-Proton7-26. Open Halo Infinite in your Steam Library and click the little Cog Icon -&gt; Properties -&gt; Compatibility, tick the box and select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that's all done, online play with Halo Infinite on Steam Deck should just work. There's still a few lingering issues though like some audio stutter plus some textures can flash a bit but it's quite playable overall. Here's a video of the steps needed plus the settings used and some rough footage:</p>

      <title>Ex-Zodiac is a fast-paced 3D rail shooter inspired by the likes of Star Fox out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love classic 90s rail shooters like Star Fox? You should take a look at Ex-Zodiac, which just hit Early Access. Built in Godot Engine it comes with Native Linux support right away and it's looking good, it also works great on the Steam Deck too and feels like a really good fit there.</p>
<p>"Ex-Zodiac is a fast-paced rail shooter with a stylized look reminiscent of early 90's 3D games. Join protagonist Kyuu as she fights to free the worlds of the Sanzaru Star System, overrun by the intergalactic terrorist organization known as Zodiac."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I5wDKWydhjs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5fbb82c0676fd1803d614100d31b5265.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I5wDKWydhjs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A retro, colourful, low-poly visual style</li>
<li>6 main levels and 6 bonus levels currently (more than 12 will be available after full release)</li>
<li>Major bosses at the end of each level, each piloted by a member of the Zodiac</li>
<li>A 16-bit style soundtrack by +TEK combining FM and wavetable synthesis</li>
<li>Barrel rolls</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So far, I've been having a lot of fun with it. Firmly bringing back memories of playing classics like it on Sega Mega Drive, Nintendo 64 and others around that sort of time. Some of the boss battles can be quite a challenge, as is getting used to the way the ship moves all around the screen with the camera focus continue forwards. The presentation is simply wonderful too!</p>
<p>Some footage recorded on the Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lMWQc1aDq94"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e849f92459718db6b05702dd6bef21d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lMWQc1aDq94" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer thinks it will remain in Early Access for 1 year with plenty more content to come yet.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1249480/ExZodiac/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>System76 gives the Oryx Pro laptop a powerful refresh</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need a really powerful laptop with top-tier Linux support? System76 has <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/oryx" target="_blank">refreshed the Oryx Pro</a> and here's all the details.</p>
<p>This is their popular flagship NVIDIA graphics laptop that now sports a new 12th Gen Intel Core processor with the i7-12700H giving an impressive 14 cores with 20 threads. Not only that, you're also getting an open source friendly laptop too since System76 continue to support their open firmware and open source embedded controller firmware. The graphics options have been bumped up too from the previous having an RTX 3070 or 3080, users can now configure the Oryx Pro with an RTX 3070 Ti or 3080 Ti graphics.</p>

<p>For gamers, Protondb.com is a helpful resource for double-checking Steam game compatibility, and add the ProtonUp-Qt application to expand compatibility for your game library with Proton-GE.

      <title>Dell XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition gets certified for Ubuntu 22.04</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Out for a new laptop and perhaps the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/initial-thoughts-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os/" target="_blank">HP Dev One</a> didn't take your fancy? Well now the <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-laptops-and-notebooks/xps-13-plus-laptop/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/ctox13w11p1c4001u" target="_blank">Dell XPS 13 Plus Developer Edition</a> has been properly certified for Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p>Canonical announced the update today on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/dell-xps-13-plus-developer-edition-now-certified-with-ubuntu-22-04-lts" target="_blank">their blog</a>, noting that the roll-out will begin in August for those who want the up to date experience on solid hardware. As Canonical also <a href="https://ubuntu.com/certified/laptops?q=&amp;limit=20&amp;release=22.04+LTS" target="_blank">showed</a>, this is the first mainstream hardware to be certified for Ubuntu 22.04.</p>
<p>While anyone can download Ubuntu (and other distributions) and attempt to run them on various devices, the point of the official certification is so that Canonical can ensure "that all of the components in a certified computer work as expected, so the user can be sure of the best experience out of the box". Of course, buying one with Linux pre-loaded like this also shows there's a market for more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/871496121658409326gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/871496121658409326gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the XPS Plus include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>12th Gen Intel® Core™ 28W processors</li>
<li>A seamless glass touch pad</li>
<li>Improved quad speaker design resulting in incredible sound for music, movies and conferencing.</li>
<li>Up to 4K+ resolution or vivid true-to-life colour on an OLED display with Eyesafe® that reduces harmful blue light</li>
<li>M.2 PCIe Gen 4 NVMe Solid State Drive</li>
<li>Up to 32 GB, LPDDR5, 5200 MHz, integrated, dual-channel</li>
<li>Larger fans that provide 55% better airflow</li>
<li>All-new packaging is made from 100% sustainably sourced or renewable materials with paper documentation that increases its recyclability.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“XPS is an innovation portal for Dell – from its application of cutting-edge technology to experimentation of new user interfaces and experiential design,” said Jaewook Woo, Product Manager, Linux Operating System, Dell Technologies. “By bringing the enhanced performance and power management features of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to our most advanced premium laptop, Dell and Canonical reinforce our joint commitment to continue delivering the best computing experience for developers using Ubuntu.”</p>
<p>“The XPS 13 is a long-standing flagship range for Ubuntu on laptops”, said Oliver Smith, Product Manager for Ubuntu Desktop, Canonical. “It’s fantastic to see the XPS 13 Plus and Ubuntu 22.04 deliver a first-class hardware and software experience for developers, 10 years on from the start of Project Sputnik”.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21 Beta now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux Mint team are gearing up for another major release with Linux Mint 21 now available in Beta to download.</p>
<p>This is their next long-term support release, so you'll be able to continue running it until 2027 thanks to it being based upon Ubuntu 22.04. You will get Linux Kernel 5.15 and depending on which edition you go for Cinnamon 5.4, MATE 1.26 or Xfce 4.16.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8421569051658404427gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8421569051658404427gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Quite a lot is new with this release, especially with the Cinnamon desktop environment which had a huge change to the window manager to be based on a much more modern version of Mutter. Their last fork was 11 years ago, so a lot has changed in that time. Their priority has been to make them as close as possible, which should enable them to do more upgrades earlier in future.</p>
<p>They've also ported over the display settings from Gnome, plus plenty of theme tweaks to make applications match with the GTK theme.</p>
<p>Some of the other major changes includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A switch from Blueberry to Blueman for Bluetooth</li>
<li>New Xapp project called xapp-thumbnailers, providing thumbnails for many more file types</li>
<li>Upgrades to the Sticky Notes application</li>
<li>A process monitor to inform you when automated tasks are happening that might slow your PC down</li>
<li>Webp support was added to xviewer and thumbnailers.</li>
<li>The WebApp manager supports additional browsers and custom browser parameters.</li>
<li>In Software Sources, the repository list, PPA list and key list support multiple selection. This allows several items to be removed at a time.</li>
<li>Mint now uses IPP (Driverless Printing and Scanning)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus lots more.</p>

      <title>Mojang say no to NFTs and blockchain with Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hey look, some good news about NFTs for once! Mojang has put out a <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-and-nfts" target="_blank">new guide</a> on the rules surrounding NFTs and blockchain.</p>
<p>You've probably seen the ridiculous amount of scams when it comes to NFTs especially, and companies using the "blockchain" when they have absolutely no need for it. Thankfully, Mojang have listened and put out some rules and the gist is that "integrations of NFTs with Minecraft are generally not something we will support or allow" they said.</p>
<p>Their news post goes over a brief intro to what NFTs actually are and giving a brief overview of why they have rules for server owners and content creators, which in brief is to "ensure that Minecraft remains a community where everyone has access to the same content". Part of the problem is how NFTs "create models of scarcity and exclusion that conflict with our Guidelines and the spirit of Minecraft".</p>
<p>Mojang make their position firmly clear on it all stating that "As such, to ensure that Minecraft players have a safe and inclusive experience, blockchain technologies are not permitted to be integrated inside our Minecraft client and server applications nor may they be utilized to create NFTs associated with any in-game content, including worlds, skins, persona items, or other mods.".</p>
<p>This is good, because it should hopefully prevent another Blockverse, which was supposed to be a "on-chain Ethereum NFT that enables a unique P2E on Minecraft". Can you guess how it went? They took a lot of money and then <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/unofficial-minecraft-nft-game-blockverse-disappears-with-more-than-dollar1m/" target="_blank">vanished</a> with it.</p>
<p>However, they're not ruling out using blockchain in Minecraft if it might "allow for more secure experiences or other practical and inclusive applications in gaming" but they currently have no plans for it right now.</p>

      <title>GOverlay for configuring the MangoHud performance overlay new release out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud is a great performance overlay for Linux, one that's used on the Steam Deck too and GOverlay helps you configure it really easily. A new release is out with GOverlay 0.9. The developer mentioned this release was due for a while but they ended up catching COVID, lost access to their GitHub and more but it's here now.</p>
<p>GOverlay isn't just for MangoHud though, it can also help you set up the vulkan post processing layer vkBasalt and the quick video replay tool ReplaySorcery too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5132959381658400493gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5132959381658400493gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new in version 0.9:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Added frame_count option to display the number of frames since start</li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Added GPU throttling option to show if GPU is throttling based on Power, current, temp or "other" (Only shows if throttling is currently happening)</li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Selected quick layout button will keep the active color</li>
<li>NEW: Mangohud - Added Option to run vkcube with Gamescope in the Hamburguer menu</li>
<li>FIX: Removed Breeze theme dependency/style. GUI will use the current system theme but it is optimised for Breeze (QT) and Adwaita (GTK) themes.</li>
<li>FIX: Mangohud - Driverversion wasn't selected on the complete quick layout</li>
<li>FIX: Mangohud - Displayed Kernelversion will update automatically now (not attached to a text file anymore)</li>
<li>FIX: Mangohud - Notifications didn't expire, now they are transient</li>
<li>FIX: VKbasalt - Changed menu icon to standart hamburguer menu</li>
<li>FIX: Vkbasalt , replaysorcery - Display wrong hint message from the mangohud toolbox</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/releases/tag/0.9" target="_blank">download from GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Vulkan Beta Driver 515.49.10 out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released a fresh upgrade to their special developer-focused <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">Vulkan Beta Drivers</a> with version 515.49.10.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Restored old shader disk cache behavior to remain enabled even if the app uses its own pipeline cache</li>
<li>Fixed issue with optimized graphics pipeline library final link using the wrong shaders</li>
<li>Fixed issue with some fp16 shader operations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open-gpu-kernel-modules release:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.10" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.10</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the new Vulkan extension supported the description of it from the official docs reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness</code> allows users to request robustness on a per-pipeline stage basis.</p>
<p>As <code class="inline-code"><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#features-robustBufferAccess" target="_blank">robustBufferAccess</a></code> and other robustness features may have an adverse effect on performance, this extension is designed to allow users to request robust behavior only where it may be needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Reminder: This special Vulkan beta driver is where all the shiny new stuff goes in before making its way into the stable release for everyone. Really, it's mostly aimed at developers and serious enthusiasts. Unless you need what's in them, it's generally best to use the stable drivers.</p>
<p>The newest stable versions of the main NVIDIA driver for Linux are at<a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/190425/en-uk" target="_blank"> NVIDIA 515.57 </a> released on June 28, 2022 from their "Production Branch" series or<a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/184432/en-uk" target="_blank"> 495.46 </a>released on December 13, 2021 from their "New Feature" series. Confused? It's a lot of numbers to remember but both Production and New Feature series are fine for normal use.</p>

      <title>Unreal Engine 5 editor quietly gets a proper Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm not entirely sure when this went live but it appears that Epic Games have finally released a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux" target="_blank">full proper download</a> of Unreal Engine for Linux developers. Seems a lot of people noticed only today, although the page mentions the build was released Jul 12 - 2022, with GOL getting messages about it everywhere so it seems like a fair few find this quite exciting.</p>
<p>Previously, to use Unreal Engine on Linux you would need to compile it yourself from the source but now that's no longer the case. To get it you need to have accepted their EULA and be logged in with an Epic Account, once done it will offer up the ~20GB download to get you going but it mentions needing ~60GB for the full thing. Additionally, it seems their main supported Linux distribution is Ubuntu 22.04 although it appears to run just fine on Fedora 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13301450491658347635gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13301450491658347635gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can see more of the <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/linux-development-requirements-for-unreal-engine/" target="_blank">Linux requirements here</a>.</p>
<p>Considering all the issues with Unity lately from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/unity-to-merge-with-ironsource-with-a-buzzword-salad-press-release/" target="_blank">joining with ironSource</a>, their CEO <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/interview/79190/unity-ironsource-john-riccitiello-marc-whitten-merger/" target="_blank">calling some</a> game developers "fucking idiots" and when that made the news that same CEO said on <a href="https://twitter.com/johnriccitiello/status/1547734634590392322" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it was "Clickbait" only to then later <a href="https://twitter.com/johnriccitiello/status/1548326529217679365" target="_blank">apologise</a>, this might be a good time for Epic Games to push their way through to pull in even more developers into their ecosystem.</p>
<p>So much great news for Linux gaming and even Linux game development lately, it's nice to see so many moving parts.</p>

      <title>Classic inspired brawler Pulling No Punches arrives on August 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for more beat 'em up action? Pulling No Punches from developer BrainDead Broccoli is confirmed to be launching on August 10 along with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>"The game follows the fictional story of a global pandemic that engulfed the world and is being ignored by fanatics who do not believe that the disease is real. It is up to the main characters, 4 common citizens adequately protected with gloves and masks, to deal with these fanatics and solve the situation with the force of their own fists."</p>
<p>To get an idea of the gameplay you can see the below trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-mZV01C-4rA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef8aafe5e46c7b0b4876681f8f9c7190.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-mZV01C-4rA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They do have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgGlPul3Y9w" target="_blank">release date trailer</a> that's a bit newer, but due to age-restrictions you can only view it on YouTube directly. It's been in development for 2 years now and the release follows a crowdfunding campaign on the Brazillion platform <a href="https://www.catarse.me/punhosderepudio" target="_blank">Catarse</a> where they pulled in around £8,194 (around $9,816) some time ago. At release they said it will be available for $9.90.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy it on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1425760/Pulling_No_Punches/" target="_blank">Steam store</a> and there's a demo available.</p>

      <title>Epic Games now supporting the O3D Foundation and Open 3D Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://o3d.foundation/" target="_blank">The O3D Foundation</a>, who oversee the free and open source <a href="https://www.o3de.org/" target="_blank">Open 3D Engine</a>, have announced that Epic Games are now officially one of their supporters. Epic Games has joined as a Premier member joining the likes of Adobe, AWS, Intel, Microsoft and others in supporting their mission to produce a AAA FOSS game engine.</p>
<p>What we don't exactly know, is what being a supporting member actually gives the The O3D Foundation. Unlike other projects, they don't list the kind of expected resources these companies give over. What we do know at least from this one is that Marc Petit, VP of Unreal Engine Ecosystem at Epic Games, will join the O3DF’s Governing Board.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The metaverse will require companies to work together to advance open standards and open source tools, and we believe the Open 3D Foundation will play an important role in this journey,” said Petit. “With shared standards for interoperability, we’re giving creators more freedom and flexibility to build interactive 3D content using the tools they’re most comfortable with, and to bring those amazing experiences to life in Unreal Engine and across other 3D engines.”</p>
<p>“We applaud Epic Game’s commitment to the open source community and welcome them into the Open 3D Foundation as our newest Premier member, underscoring our mission in championing the deep integration of open source with commercial solutions to accelerate growth in a sustainable, balanced ecosystem that fuels the flywheel of success and innovation,” said Royal O'Brien, Executive Director of Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Games and Digital Media at the Linux Foundation. “It’s truly exciting to see how the industry is responding to the real-time 3D needs of content creators around the globe, providing them with best-of-breed tools.”</p>

<p>It will arrive with Native Linux support, although a release is a while away yet as they plan a Kickstarter next month and given how other similar games have done so well, I would expect this to get funded easily. You can see their first teaser trailer below:</p>

      <title>Visit a new dimension in the Avorion - Into The Rift expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Avorion - Into The Rift is a pretty big sounding expansion to the space sandbox game that will arrive in August. This is the second expansion, following on from Black Market released back in 2020. For those who haven't played it, Avorion is a massive space exploration game where you build your ships block by block. Think a little Minecraft in space, plus a touch of Eve Online and you sort of get some of the idea.</p>
<p>For the addon: "In this hardcore add-on you'll explore the mysterious and dangerous Rift dimension. Thanks to new technology, it is now possible to send smaller amounts of mass (i.e. a few ships) into the Rifts. Scientists are now intensively researching these Rifts - and they need your help. Travel into the Rifts and uncover their secrets. Face their dangers, complete research expeditions, and earn powerful new rewards."</p>
<p>A new trailer went live recently you can see below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ti0X9bIU23w"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19da1f5adf447c1e9f570c9bbb8c693c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ti0X9bIU23w" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DLC Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a new dimension unlike anything you've seen before in the galaxy.</li>
<li>Prepare your ship accordingly to master the dangerous new environments and uncover the secrets surrounding the origins of the Rifts.</li>
<li>Complete Rift Expeditions for the Rift Research Center, and receive new, powerful hybrid subsystems in return - or simply keep everything you find in the Rifts.</li>
<li>Remember, the deeper you venture into the Rifts, the more lucrative and dangerous they become.</li>
<li>New story campaign.</li>
<li>New captain classes.</li>
<li>+ Loads more</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Avorion on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/avorion?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/445220/Avorion/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve warns about Steam Deck temperatures, plus a Deck Beta Update out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve put up a bit of a notice / warning recently, one for those of you experiencing a heat wave and trying to game on the Steam Deck might want to keep a note of. Plus a new Steam Deck Beta update.</p>
<p>The official OnDeck Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1549467955754217473" target="_blank">said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For our friends in the midst of a heatwave, a quick note about Steam Deck in high temperatures. Steam Deck performs at its best in ambient temperatures between 0° and 35° C. If the temperature gets higher than this, Steam Deck may start to throttle performance to protect itself.</p>
<p>A bit more detail about this – Steam Deck’s APU runs well at temperatures up to 100°C. At 100°C, it will start to throttle performance, and at 105°C it will shut down. Again, this is to protect itself (and you) from damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do want to know how hot your Deck is running, that's easy enough thanks to the built-in performance overlay. If you hit the Quick Access button (the three dots) and go to the Performance menu (the battery icon) and set the Overlay Level to 3 it will show temperatures for the GPU and CPU like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16078063811658312453gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16078063811658312453gol1.jpg"/></a><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/run-around-a-cyberpunk-city-as-a-lost-cat-in-stray-out-now/" target="_blank">Game Pictured - Stray</a></em></p>
<p>As for the latest Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6272968438254558051" target="_blank">Beta update</a> here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Sucheng (Quick) keyboard for Traditional Chinese (requires Preview channel)</li>
<li>Added Achievements page to overlay (while in-game press Steam button)</li>
<li>Fixed notification for claiming digital rewards firing endlessly for some customers</li>
<li>Fixed Night Mode automatically kicking in, even if the toggle is set to OFF</li>
<li>Fixed desktop mode keyboard sometimes failing to show or dismiss</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There was also a silent Stable Steam Deck update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Stable update channel for the Steam Deck OS has just been updated with a hotfix to enable compatibility with future system and input firmware. It will download an update, but there are no user-visible changes included at this time.</p>

      <title>Run around a cyberpunk city as a lost cat in Stray - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stray, a game about a lost cat in a cyberpunk city, became something of a viral hit even before release. It's out now with a Steam Deck Verified rating from the get go. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Developed by French team BlueTwelve Studio, with this being their debut game they've hit quite a mark with it getting some pretty high scores from various other publications. So once again, it's fantastic to see such a high-profile release working out of the box on Steam Deck and Linux desktop right at release thanks to Proton.</p>
<p>Here's some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7TFpgCZbqsw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8e6c9f9ccbfd886cb2cd83d9b7d4af75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7TFpgCZbqsw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even though it has a Steam Deck Verified rating, the out of the box graphics settings for the Steam Deck aren't the best. I saw quite a number of drops well below 30FPS but after switching a couple of settings down like Textures and Mesh Quality (as shown in the video) it performed well enough. That said, like a lot of bigger 3D games, battery life is really not your friend here. Aside from that, it's a genuinely <em>lovely</em> game and one cat lovers simply must grab. Being able to be a bit mischievous knocking things off high places, and the game actually using that is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>The official bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stray is a third-person cat adventure game set amidst the detailed, neon-lit alleys of a decaying cybercity and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by curious droids and dangerous creatures.<br/>
<br/>
See the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world.<br/>
<br/>
Along the way, the cat befriends a small flying drone, known only as B-12. With the help of this newfound companion, the duo must find a way out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Stray on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Into the Breach: Advanced Edition update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Making a thoroughly difficult yet great strategy game even better, <a href="https://subsetgames.com/itb_ae.html" target="_blank">Into the Breach: Advanced Edition</a> is out now for all owners as a free upgrade. If you love turn-based strategy games, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. I both dread and love it, since it sucks away so much time as I just want another run through when I fail and then it's 2AM.</p>
<p>From the makers of FTL, you help the remnants of human civilization who are being threatened by massive creatures digging their way up through the earth. There's also a little bit of time-travel involved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e8DCsU8MJxE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c97a38e5983b47f8ff39f5c0f2a4fdc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e8DCsU8MJxE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the main bits of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>5 New squads &amp; 15 new squad achievements!</li>
<li>7 new Vek, 3 new Psions, &amp; 10 new boss battles!</li>
<li>12 new missions &amp; 3 new bonus mission goals!</li>
<li>4 New pilots &amp; 10 new random pilot abilities!</li>
<li>39 New weapons &amp; equipment!</li>
<li>2 new music tracks from composer Ben Prunty!</li>
<li>Even more challenging difficulty mode, Unfair Mode!</li>
<li>7 New Languages! (Arabic, Thai, Swedish, Korean, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, and Latin American Spanish)</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Other Changes</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Optional Content Toggles - All of the new content (enemies, pilot skills, etc) other than balance changes are possible to turn off if you would like the base-game content experience.</li>
<li>Weapon reactor usage reduced - We wanted to encourage players to immediately try out equipment they find, so we reduced the reactor power to equip most gear.</li>
<li>Store Changes - Since you can now instantly equip most weapons without needing an additional reactor core, the reputation cost to purchase weapons has increased by 1 and the store options are limited in the first 2 islands.</li>
<li>New weapon mechanic: KO effects - Certain weapons will trigger an additional effect if the primary target is killed by the attack.</li>
<li>New tile mechanic: Cracking - Certain weapons will cause the ground to crack. If the tile is damaged again, it will shatter, destroying the tile and anything standing on it!</li>
<li>New status effect: Boost - This will increase the next attack’s damage by 1. Highly effective for AoE attacks!</li>
<li>Unlocking Squads with Coins Change - The cost of unlocking squads with coins has been reduced to account for the extra squads.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a huge upgrade, especially surprising that it's free when many others would put it into a DLC. Subset Games certainly treat their players well, as they did a similar upgrade for FTL years ago.</p>

      <title>Exanima gets vastly improved Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Exanima is an unforgiving 3D isometric RPG set in an original dark, low fantasy world. Currently in Early Access, it seems the developers have been paying attention to user requests for better Linux and Steam Deck support with Proton.</p>
<p>In the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/362490/view/6277472037877215678" target="_blank">update</a> released on July 17, 2022, the developer noted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the lack of proper support some of you were already using controllers and it's a frequently requested feature. Steam Deck support was also requested and we worked on Proton compatibility, special UI scaling, control schemes and various input and performance optimisations with surprisingly good results.<br/>
<br/>
Exanima is a game that does not naturally lend itself well to controller input, some aspects of interaction by necessity remain cursor based, but we developed dedicated control schemes for all core gameplay and user interface. The game can be played fully on controller and it's quite a fun and different experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the specific changes to help include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck support, performance, UI and control optimisations</li>
<li>Proton and Linux GPU driver compatibility fixes</li>
<li>Full controller support via Steam
	<ul>
<li>Dedicated movement and aiming controls</li>
<li>Feathered object and UI cursor interaction</li>
<li>Full menu and UI navigation and interaction</li>
<li>On screen keyboard support</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's really great to see developers of all sizes and genres looking to improve Linux, Proton and Steam Deck support. The Steam Deck continues to be a huge boon for Linux gamers and controller users and hopefully this trend will continue. Curiously, Exanima was actually set as Steam Deck Verified multiple months ago even though it clearly had a number of issues that needed to be resolved so it's another case of a false-positive for the Deck Verified system — but at least now it might be accurate.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per session and global character skill progression</li>
<li>Large non-linear main game following early content</li>
<li>Build and permanently save characters by completing early content</li>
<li>New encounters, items and environments</li>
<li>Ranged combat and new close quarter manoeuvres</li>
<li>Numerous moddable thaumaturgic powers</li>
<li>More complete arena game modes featuring outdoor arenas</li>
<li>Complex NPC interactions and dialogue</li>
<li>Cooperative and competitive LAN multiplayer</li>

      <title>Tesla to demo Steam for more in-car gaming soon using Linux &amp; Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tesla and Steam? It's coming and it sounds like it's progressing nicely with a demo to come soon to show it off.</p>
<p>Something that has been in the works for a while, and we already know their entertainment software uses Linux so it will use the Linux version of Steam. This will also include the Proton compatibility tool for running Windows games as well to enable plenty more gaming in your fancy Tesla.</p>
<p>We actually saw hints of this back in 2021, as Tesla were advertising for "Linux Game Development at Tesla" position which you can see via the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211028165545/https://tesla.avature.net/Careers/Jobdetail?jobId=91676" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>. This involved working with "Linux, Mesa, Vulkan, OpenGL, Proton/Lutris, Wine, etc." so it was pretty clear where they were going with it. Add to that Elon Musk said on <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1496245381084200961" target="_blank">Twitter</a> in early 2022 that "We’re working through the general case of making Steam games work on a Tesla vs specific titles. Former is obviously where we should be long-term.".</p>
<p>Just recently on July 16, 2022 again on Twitter, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1548085294188019717" target="_blank">said</a>: "We’re making progress with Steam integration. Demo probably next month.".</p>

      <title>Hot swapping SD Cards on Steam Deck is okay but Valve plans improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been a lot of talk about the Steam Deck and SD Cards lately around hot swapping and apparently bricked SD Cards but Valve say it's fine, although improvements are coming.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that, to be blunt, there's a lot of really bad SD Cards out there that will brick themselves and while some may work properly for a while, they can die easily. Sticking with good known-vendors is always worthwhile for them. Valve has done a few upgrades to the Steam Deck and SteamOS to help, like switching to a quick format in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/steamos-32-out-for-steam-deck-m-better-fan-curves-refresh-rate-switching/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steam-deck-gets-a-lock-screen-window-switcher-and-more/" target="_blank">warning you</a> if your card isn't what's advertised and more.</p>
<p>You still see scattered reports across Reddit now about SD Cards apparently messing up, and so one user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/w1ah76/kept_seeing_conflicting_info_so_i_asked_valve/" target="_blank">decided to ask</a> Valve Support about hot swapping Micro SD cards and Valve said there that "performing a full shutdown prior to swapping out your SD cards is always best practice" and that you can also "toggle Desktop Mode, and Dolphin file explorer will allow you to eject the SD card before removing it".</p>
<p>However, Valve designer Lawrence Yang said on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1548761877462691840" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that "Ejecting and swapping microSD cards while in game mode is safe (not while running a game off the SD card though, of course). We’ll update our support agent messaging around this question." and <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1548854928814198785" target="_blank">another</a> "(Also don’t eject while writing to the microSD card, ie while moving files or downloading a game / update)".</p>
<p>Some updates will come to help though. In reply to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/w21r3i/dont_risk_hotswapping_microsd_cards_my_steam_deck/" target="_blank">post</a> about having a wrong mount-point so it wasn't detected correctly, Yang mentioned on Twitter "Thanks for the report - we'll implement a fix to prevent Deck from mounting to /run/media. We're also looking into adding a software eject button for the SD card just to be extra safe.".</p>

      <title>Relive memories of going to the arcade in Point Rescue Arcade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Point Rescue Arcade is a game that very much leans into the experience you might have had when going to a real Arcade, grabbing a big gun and sticking in some coins.</p>
<p>Developed by Magellanic Games LTD, who some might know from their various games released on <a href="https://magellanicgames.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a> over the last few years. I've quite a fan of their retro approach, having played a few of their previous games like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/office-point-rescue-out-the-office-is-a-wonderful-homage-to-retro-shooters/" target="_blank">Office Point Rescue - Out the Office</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Point Rescue Arcade hearkens back to light gun shooters of the 90's. Bright, chunky graphics and fast mindless action. Uncover the dodgy dealings of City 2 through various missions in a variety of bright and colourful environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17705922061658219536gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17705922061658219536gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19532808441658219537gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19532808441658219537gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Retro graphics</li>
<li>Body based hit detection and enemy reactions</li>
<li>Dynamic mode where you improve your weapons and each play through offers different levels.</li>
<li>Multiple weapons</li>
<li>Amateur voice acting</li>
<li>Midi-styled soundtrack</li>
<li>Support for modern light guns</li>

      <title>Dead Cells has an exciting roadmap ahead as it&#39;s far from finished</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells is the absolutely brilliant game from Motion Twin and Evil Empire. A rogue-lite, metroidvania inspired, action-platformer and it's not finished, far from it. The developers have just recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/3346754034231946658" target="_blank">revealed</a> a roadmap, that mentions how 2023 will be the "most exciting year in Dead Cells' history" which is a pretty bold claim.</p>
<p>Some players apparently thought the game was near the end after the latest big update and DLC but it's far from it. The developers mention how "we're very much in the mid-life of Dead Cells" so there's plenty yet still to come. Spoilers below on what's to come.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663054831658218963gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14663054831658218963gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So the slightly spoilery info about what's to come includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A panchaku and a new flame head outfit, based on their animated trailers</li>
<li>A ton of rebalancing and a rework of the legendaries system</li>
<li>A Soul Knight weapon and outfit</li>
<li>You'll be able to "pet the pets"</li>
<li>A Boss Rush Arena, where you get to fit all the bosses you've met so far, with plans for different modes</li>
<li>Another updated planned before Christmas but they're keeping it secret</li>
</ul>
<p>You can pick up Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Wine 7.13 rolled out recently continuing the PE conversion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fashionably late on this one. <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/7.13" target="_blank">Wine 7.13</a> rolled out just before the weekend rolled in, so here's a quick run down of what's new in this Windows compatibility layer.</p>
<p>This is the compatibility layer that allows you to run various Windows applications and games on Linux (and forms part of Steam Play Proton). Once a year or so, a new stable release is made but the development versions are usually fine to use.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gecko engine updated to version 2.47.3.</li>
<li>USB driver converted to PE.</li>
<li>Some theming improvements.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're getting close to finishing the PE conversion now, which should bring compatibly improvements. Previously Wine has built its Win32 libraries (like DLLs and EXEs) as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format" target="_blank">ELF</a> but for many reasons (like better compatibility) they've started to move them over to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable" target="_blank">PE</a> instead.</p>
<p>For bug fixes they noted problems solved with: The Witcher 3, Photoshop C 2018, CLIP Studio Paint, SnowRunner, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1, Skyrim Legendary Edition, Wizard101, Wireshark and others.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher adds GOG Cloud Saves, Epic Overlay support, anti-cheat helpers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher for Epic Games and GOG on Linux has a huge new Beta release (plus a bug fixes for the stable build) with loads of fancy new features.</p>
<p>Why should you use the Heroic Games Launcher? Well, Epic Games and GOG don't support Linux with their launchers and so playing games from them can be a bit of a nuisance on Linux and Steam Deck. This way you get a handy launcher to keep them nicely up to date. It's free and open source too, so anyone can help improve it!</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/releases/tag/v2.4.0-beta.2" target="_blank">2.4.0 Beta 2</a> release now out it adds in:</p>
<ul>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive gets procedural maps, better gameplay</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is a free and open source science-based game about evolution, currently allowing you to swim around as a little cell and attempt to survive. The latest release brings in some major improvements. It's in Early Access and they have a long way to go before it's a complete game but it's still a really interesting idea, very much like an expanded early-stage version of Spore.</p>
<p>With the latest version they've now added in procedural generation for the map, so each game will be somewhat different now instead of the same each time. This includes new settings like entering a seed to play a specific map, along with multiple other new-game options like a "LAWK" toggle (life as we know it) to be more strict to realism. Swallowing up other cells has also been made much more interesting, a new 3D editor for the macroscopic portion of the Multicellular Stage, the addition of cilia as as placeable organelles, a spawn system revamp and much more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3D3u88bSHSc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d661e31faf612fe2008c0018d4a9ee79.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3D3u88bSHSc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the next release they're hoping to continue improving these recently added features, performance improvements and continue expanding the Multicellular Stage prototype along with adding more features to bring the Microbe Stage closer to completion.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development or grab it free with the launcher on <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive-Launcher" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>iFixit have the Steam Deck Fan in stock if you&#39;re in the U.S.</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get rid of the whine that certain models of Steam Deck have with their fan? Good news, at least if you're in the USA, as iFixit have fans in stock.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the problem is that Valve use two different fans in the Steam Deck. One is like a more gentle blower sound, the other gives a thoroughly annoying high-pitch whine. iFixit are the official way to get replacement parts and they now seem to have quite a few <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Miscellanous/Steam-Deck-Fan/IF260-002?o=2" target="_blank">replacement fans</a> in stock for the US.</p>
<p>You can get just the fan for $24.99 or the full kit for $29.99 which comes with Angled Tweezers, Opening Picks and a Precision Bit Driver.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12174723901658138852gol1.jpg"/>Image Credit - iFixit</em></p>
<p>This time at least it seems they have enough stock that it didn't just vanish within an hour or two. They've remained available now for a couple of days so it appears the initial rush to buy replacements fans might be over, or with the newer fan curves and other upgrades Valve has put out for the Steam Deck perhaps it's annoying people less.</p>
<p><em>No word yet on when the fan will be back for the EU, UK and others.</em></p>

      <title>Swirl W@tch is a blindly-vibrant upcoming stealth-action rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sleeper Games have revealed their latest game with Swirl W@tch, a very colourful and bright stealth-action rogue-lite that will release later this year.</p>
<p>Coming with Native Linux support as usual from Sleeper Games, it takes place on an "over-exploited gas giant". You need to fly around and infiltrate industrial installations, evade or eliminate guard ships, commit corporate sabotage and grow the movement to unlock new gear. From what the developer said over email the setting blends a space-shooter with an arcade-style submarine-sim, wrapped up in a rogue-lite gameplay loop of randomized missions.</p>
<p>You can see the first teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2nFGIEiEVBY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ebf9ffb0fd606eb3a0d3d815cc1e6251.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2nFGIEiEVBY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looks like one to watch.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081970/Swirl_Wtch/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>fheroes2 game engine for Heroes of Might and Magic II gets even more AI upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fully playable but they're not done yet. The team behind the Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine reimplementation continue to improve it even further for playing it on modern platforms. This free and open source reimplementation is simply awesome, the best way to play the classic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17538617791658136865gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17538617791658136865gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Version 0.9.17 was released recently with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Further audio improvements: add a sound for Freeman's Foundry, fix delays in MIDI music, fix many issues and crashes related to audio</li>
<li>Expand initial Evil Interface to another in-game dialogs and elements</li>
<li>Add huge AI improvements: add Courier role for heroes, AI defend castles more aggressively and hires heroes efficiently</li>
<li>Add ability to change hotkeys within the game</li>
<li>Improve Polish, Ukrainian, French and Norwegian translations</li>
<li>Fix several places related to logic on Adventure Map</li>
<li>Over 40 bugs are fixed since 0.9.16 release</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving a little more information to us over email, one of the developers gave us a longer explanation of the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Audio was significantly improved since the previous release. The team fixed issues with MIDI music playback delays on Adventure Map, multiple possible crashes with audio synchronization, extra sounds appearance in castle's window and etc. Such cases were very rare but nobody likes a buggy game. As a bonus Freeman's Foundry now has its own ambient sound on Adventure Map. Walk your hero nearby it to hear!<br/>
<br/>
"Evil" interface finally got some proper attention. In the original game this type of interface was applied only to a limited number of dialogs. The list of dialogs was expanded and now some windows to have a proper "evil" look.<br/>
<br/>
AI has been greatly enhanced in this release. The team added a new Courier role for AI heroes to focus on supplies delivery for more stronger heroes. AI now is smart enough to use Adventure Spells efficiently and also to estimate the number of needed heroes for the kingdom. Lastly, AI will defend its castle more aggressively instead of leaving them empty and defenseless.<br/>
<br/>
As per many player requests the team added an ability to change hotkeys for in-game events within the game. Now you can set any combinations to improve your gameplay skills.<br/>
<br/>
Besides this the team fixed multiple places with logic on Adventure Map, closed some visual issues with dialogs and improved translation for multiple languages. As usual more than 40 bugs were fixed since the last release.</p>

      <title>AYANEO to have their own AYANEO OS based on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Linux is truly becoming a gaming platform for the masses now, as AYANEO are throwing their hat in the ring with AYANEO OS on their hardware with the AYANEO AIR. While their new <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-air-first-ultra-thin-oled-windows-handheld#/" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a> crowdfunding campaign focuses on it being a Windows handheld, they're also developing their own full Linux distribution for their hardware which will be available to download "in the future".</p>
<p>So that's the Steam Deck with SteamOS, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/gpd-talk-about-cooperating-with-valve-for-steamos-on-their-devices/" target="_blank">GPD looking at SteamOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">OneXPlayer also planning SteamOS</a> and now AYANEO too. Seems like AYANEO OS will go a lot further than SteamOS in some ways though, with built-in ways of finding games across different stores you own. They said it directly supports the Linux version of Steam and they talked about running both Native Linux games and Windows games through Proton too along with other stores and they sound extremely positive about the Linux experience here.</p>
<p>Not only that, it will also have integrations for retro emulation too. A special app store was talked about to download other applications like Spotify, OBS, Firefox, Discord and plenty more (much like SteamOS has access to Flathub).</p>
<p>You can see them talk about it in the below video at around 1:46:30:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eNPF_LdqT6A?rel=0&amp;start=6388"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ed5ed3e411f6742514eab6d7b1e0a86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eNPF_LdqT6A?rel=0&amp;start=6388" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely didn't imagine any of this happening a year ago, did you?</p>

<p>The latest is the <a href="https://slimbook.es/en/executive-en" target="_blank">Executive</a> model which comes with an Intel Core i7-12700H and there's two different models with a 14" and a 16" screen. The smaller of the two comes packed with Intel Irix Xe 4K while the bigger model sports an NVIDIA RTX 3050Ti. That's not the only difference, you also either get the 14" with 2880 x 1800 or 16" with 2560 x 1600 although both are 90 Hz panels with anti-glare included. You also get a minimum of 16GB RAM and a 500GB SSD NVMe drive included.</p>
<p>As for ports there's plenty including 2 x USB-A 3.2 Gen1, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen2 w/video output (DisplayPort 1.4), 1x Thunderbolt 4 w/video output (DisplayPort 1.4a) and PD charge (90W) and 1x HDMI 2.0.</p>
<p>Pricing starts at €1,299 for the 14" model and €1,599 for the 16".</p>
<p>Slimbook also recently upgraded the lower-end but still powerful <a href="https://slimbook.es/en/pro-x-en" target="_blank">Pro X</a> which is an AMD model with the Ryzen 7 5700U that you can get as either a 14" or a 15.6" model both with a 1080p IPS screen. With this you get Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, 8GB RAM on the base model, 250GB SSD NVMe minimum.</p>
<p>For the ports you get 2 x USB 3.1, 1 x USB 3.1 Type C (video out 1.4 &amp; PD Charge), 1 x USB 2.0 and 1 x HDMI 2.0.</p>
<p>On the Pro X, Slimbook say they include their own AMD Controller which enables you to get "full control over your AMD's processor performance and power consumption" along with a "firmware level performance profile (disguised as a BIOS switch) built-in that will let this power efficient U series processor reach the same performance levels from the top tier H series processors".</p>
<p>Pricing for the Pro X starts at €999.95 for 14" and €1,049 for the 15.6".</p>
<p>Looks like there's plenty of options nowadays for people after a new laptop that fully supports Linux!</p>

      <title>Yars: Recharged marks a return of the 1982 Atari 2600 classic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari continue to get their classics revamped and remade for modern audiences, with the latest being Yars: Recharged that's a reimagining of the 1982 Atari 2600 classic and best-seller Yars' Revenge in partnership with Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox the same teams behind Gravitar: Recharged and Breakout: Recharged.</p>
<p>"Yars: Recharged thrusts players to the center of a daring attack against the enemy homeworld, guarded by mechanical hives that pulse deadly cannons and emit flurries of swirling missiles. Find pockets of safety amongst the hail of incoming fire, and then dart forward in daring forays to chip away at the enemy's defenses. Gather enough energy by destroying enemy shields to power up the massively destructive Zorlon cannon, pulsing searing blasts of cosmic energy and annihilating enemies. Yars: Recharged challenges players to remain acutely aware of visual and audio cues that hint at impending danger, and master the smooth flying controls as they navigate increasingly complex levels."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ruM3x2beZhY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8455eaefac3c2c607f4ac685a98d3ba5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ruM3x2beZhY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Arcade mode: Boss rush of 30 enemies. It’s not endless, but it’s VERY difficult to get to the end of this mode. Three hits and you die, but don’t worry, that hit-count resets when moving to the next fight.</li>
<li>Missions: 30 unique, challenging bosses and only one life to beat each. Like Gravitar: Recharged, there’s one global leaderboard for mission mode, so you need to be on your game. Bosses pose a challenge, so you will need to take them head on with a barrage of bullets or start with the smaller, Minor Cores first and work your way to the boss.</li>
<li>Power-Ups: Minor Cores will drop power-ups when attached. Shoot in all directions at once, rapid fire, explosive shots, or fire a railgun – the nature of the power up is tied to the nature of the core that dropped it.</li>
<li>Co-op: Yars: Recharged is a local co-op game in both arcade and mission mode, a big change from the original and a ton of fun for you and a friend.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019990/Yars_Recharged/" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>. It releases on August 23rd.</p>

      <title>Wine manager Bottles default runner now based on Valve&#39;s Wine fork and Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bottles is a thoroughly great application for managing Windows applications and games on Linux. It's fast moving and a <a href="https://usebottles.com/blog/release-2022.7.14/" target="_blank">new release</a> is out with their new default runner called Soda, which is based on Valve's fork of Wine and Proton patches.</p>
<p>The problem was their previous runner called Caffe was based directly on Wine and moved with its updates. Given how often Wine updates, it introduced plenty of regressions so this is their attempt to provide a more stable experience. Soda actually takes Valve's Wine fork, Proton patches and updates from TKG and GE too. So it's a big mixture of things that should hopefully make running games with Bottles easier. As for the name Soda, they say "we think it will be a sparkling experience".</p>
<p>A new experimental feature added with this release is sandboxing per-Bottle. The idea is to restrict the environment and hopefully be more secure and stable with it using flatpak-spawn when Bottles is installed as Flatpak and bubblewrap for all other formats.</p>
<p>There's also a new UI for installers that looks a lot cleaner and clearer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10272487691657794397gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10272487691657794397gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>You also get a nice status bar along with info on what it's actually doing when setting up these apps.</em></p>
<p>More integrations have arrived with support for the Ubisoft Connect launcher. If you turn it on, it will list games you have installed directly in the Bottles application. They also worked to continue to improve the Library view, performance improvements, various fixes, improvements to the Epic Store integration which they say can now use "using Cloud Sync and Anti cheat", improved translations and so on.</p>

      <title>Armello removes advertising Linux and macOS support due to their party system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Armello, a grim fairy-tale board game from League of Geeks no longer advertises that it supports Linux and macOS due to their new party system that landed with the cross-play update.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/290340/view/3319732436466228376" target="_blank">news post</a> they mention how there's "No Party Functionality (including Private Games) on MacOSX &amp; native Linux. Due to the severity of this one, we've removed any advertising of support for Linux &amp; Mac from Steam (and shortly Humble Bundle), though folks can still purchase and play those versions.".</p>
<p>Giving a little more detail on their <a href="https://armello.com/partysupport/" target="_blank">official site</a> it mentions how "The service provider we use for Armello’s multiplayer infrastructure has decided to cease support for their party services on MacOSX and Linux. Unfortunately, this means that Party Functionality, including Private Multiplayer, is no longer available in Armello on MacOSX and native Linux platforms." but they don't go on to name whatever company that is.</p>
<p>For the Native Linux and macOS versions, they're still functional and up to date they just don't have the new party system or private matches. For Linux users though you can use Proton to run the Windows version, which fully works. It also has a Steam Deck Playable rating, which uses Proton now too.</p>
<p><em>This isn't the only game to go a similar route, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/ark-survival-evolved-switches-away-from-linux-native-to-use-proton/" target="_blank">ARK: Survival Evolved</a> recently putting the Linux Native version behind a Beta.</em></p>

      <title>GPD talk about &#39;cooperating&#39; with Valve for SteamOS on their devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GPD, the company behind many portable devices like the upcoming GPD WIN Max 2, made a claim about "cooperating" with Valve to get SteamOS working on their hardware. This is the same GPD that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/gpd-are-getting-quite-desperate-against-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">blocked us on Twitter</a>, after we confronted them about pinching videos that didn't belong to them.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-max-2-handheld-gaming-pc-4g-lte-amd-6800u#/" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a> crowdfunding campaign for the GPD WIN Max 2, which will be powered by a either a AMD Ryzen 7 6800U or an Intel 12th gen Core i7-1260P, they were asked in the discussions section if they had plans to integrate it with SteamOS. The two replies they gave officially are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Appreciate for your support! As earlier of March this year, Valve contacted us about cooperation proposal. But for this cooperation, Valve needs to match the appropriate Steam OS system for our 6800U handheld.We need to provide the device to Valve official, and Valve also has to improve the Steam OS system for the 6800U handheld, this process may take half year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your support! Yes, Valve has contacted us to consult if we are interested in the built-in Steam OS system, they can promote our products on the Steam official website, we will agree to this cooperation, we think this cooperation will be the best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Can't link to them directly, as IndieGoGo doesn't have direct-comment links but <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1940741661657732335gol1.png" target="_blank">here's a shot</a> I took. </em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IZjdouksgng"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/88eac53b5a0ad51b3b61908215bfdbef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IZjdouksgng" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I reached out to Valve, and today they replied and sent over a statement that said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're excited to eventually make SteamOS available for all devices, including handheld PCs manufactured by other companies. The team is still working on finalizing SteamOS, and we don't have anything else to announce today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't exactly breaking news by itself, since we already knew for a long time that Valve planned to release SteamOS fully to the public and so of course other hardware vendors would be able to use it too.

      <title>Unity to &#39;merge&#39; with ironSource with a buzzword salad press release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unity Technologies, the company behind ridiculously popular proprietary game engine Unity has announced a merger with another company called ironSource which is raising some eyebrows.</p>
<p>The first thing is that Unity has been acquiring a few other companies, but this time their wording is completely different with it being a "merger". Problem is, we don't know what that really means for Unity or game developers as their <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-ironsource" target="_blank">press release</a> was one of the biggest jumbles of technobabble buzzwords I've ever read. With this coming not long after Unity <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/unity-layoffs-game-engine" target="_blank">just sent</a> hundreds of their staff packing, it's likely not going to be received too well.</p>
<p>For those who don't know ironSource, they were behind a piece of software called installCore, an installer that bundled other apps with it. Basically, it was one of those horrible pieces of tech that looked like a proper official installer but it was pretty-much nasty adware / malware and ended up getting a poor reputation (as it was abused) and started getting blocked by Microsoft and others. It's no longer around but it does make the deal between Unity and ironSource look a bit odd. Don't take my word for it either, there's plenty of articles out there about how bad it was, a basic search for "installcore malware" and similar gives lots of details on it (<a href="https://www.benedelman.org/news-021815/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://blog.infostruction.com/2018/10/26/adware-empire-ironsource-and-installcore/" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-giving-up-its-cash-cow-paved-ironsources-way-to-nyse-1001376256" target="_blank">#3</a>).</p>
<p>I do wonder what this means for the future of Unity. If you're a game developer, maybe it's time to consider a free and open source kit like <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Just a thought.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan layer DXVK version 1.10.2 is up with lots of fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK is the translation tool used inside of Steam Play Proton that translates Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan and a new release is out now with version 1.10.2. The new release comes with a warning, that future releases will require newer Vulkan extensions so you will need very up to date drivers to keep using it. More on that on their <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Driver-support" target="_blank">driver page</a>.</p>
<p>Here's all that is new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implemented non-seamless cube maps for D3D9 using the <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_non_seamless_cube_map</code> extension if supported by the driver</li>
<li>FIxed an issue with current versions of the Nvidia Vulkan developer driver not using its on-disk shader cache with DXVK</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which would cause the state cache file to not be written properly</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where incorrect barriers would be emitted for UAV rendering</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <code class="inline-code">d3d11.samplerAnisotropy</code> option would apply to the wrong kind of samplers</li>
<li>Fixed potential issues when using state caches that were created on a driver with a different feature set</li>
<li>Fixed broken stencil resolves in D3D9</li>
<li>Fixed build issues on GCC 12.1</li>
<li>Optimized UAV clears in D3D11 to allow drivers to use image compression more frequently</li>
<li>Optimized performance of in-memory compression for SPIR-V shader code</li>
<li><strong>Beyond Good and Evil</strong>: Work around missing light shafts</li>
<li><strong>Day Z</strong>: Enabled <code class="inline-code">d3d11.cachedDynamicResources</code> option to work around performance issues</li>
<li><strong>Dead Space</strong>: Fixed shadow rendering and added 60 FPS lock to work around game bugs</li>
<li><strong>Dirt Rally</strong>: Fixed potential GPU hang due to game bugs in a shader</li>
<li><strong>Godfather</strong>: Fixed crash on systems that don't support 16x MSAA</li>
<li><strong>Limbo</strong>: Enable 60 FPS limit to work around game bugs</li>
<li><strong>Majesty 2</strong>: Work around game bugs causing issues on integrated GPUs and systems with more than 2GB of VRAM</li>
<li><strong>Myst V</strong>: Work around an issue when the word "Radeon" is not part of the device name on AMD GPUs</li>
<li><strong>Onechanbara Z2: Chaos</strong>: Fixed particle effects and UI elements not displaying properly</li>
<li><strong>Planetary Annihilation: TITANS</strong>: Fixed crash when creating swap chain on a NULL window, as well as a crash due to creating too many internal worker threads.</li>
<li><strong>Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2</strong>: Work around crash when the game detects an AMD GPU</li>
<li><strong>Return of Reckoning</strong>: Work around launcher issues</li>
<li><strong>Scrapland Remastered</strong>: Work around black screen issues</li>
<li><strong>Small Radios Big Televisions</strong>: Work around black screen issue</li>

<li><strong>Star Wars: The Old Republic</strong>: Fixed rendering issues</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<p>As a reminder: you can upgrade the version of DXVK used in Proton, without waiting on a new release. To do so you can just overwrite the existing DXVK files with the release download of DXVK 1.10.2. You can find your Proton install <em>somewhere</em> like this (depending on your Steam Library drives):</p>
<p><code>path-to-your/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Proton x.x/dist</code></p>
<p><em>Where x.x is whatever Proton version installed you wish to give a new DXVK.</em></p>
<p>Inside there you will see "lib" and "lib64", for 32bit and 64bit. Inside each of those, there's a "wine" folder and inside there is a "dxvk" folder and that's where you replace the files with new versions. Do so at your own risk but it's usually harmless. If you mess anything up, one way to ensure it gets reinstalled cleanly is just to remove the "/dist" folder.</p>

      <title>It&#39;s possible to run Doom inside of Doom</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've all seen how Doom has become one of the ways people test electronics, the whole "I got Doom to run on x" but this is something else. Running Doom inside of Doom, Doomception here we come.</p>
<p>YouTuber kgsws managed to find a code execution exploit in the original DOS version of Doom 2. As they noted it's a good thing it only works with the DOS version "as you don't want code execution exploit on modern systems" since it would open up some unfortunate issues. Here though, it means you can run Doom inside of Doom and even Heretic too.</p>
<p>Completely ridiculous of course but it's a very interesting, although very technical video. A fun point is that they're doing all this on Linux too. Not only that, they built a little cinema for it in Doom and you can even control the full game inside. This honestly blows my mind a little.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c6hnQ1RKhbo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d8ba27b2ad5ed96c348388181e4b63cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c6hnQ1RKhbo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The modder has put the source code up on <a href="https://github.com/kgsws/doom-in-doom" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for anyone interested in trying it.</p>
<p>For a bit of extra fun, I decided to see how easy it would be getting it running on a Steam Deck and it turns out it was amazingly simple. Just a case of downloading the release zip file, extracting it and putting the contents into the same folder as the DOOM2.exe file. Then you can just edit the "doom2.conf" and "doom2m.conf" files to add "-file kgdid.wad" to the end of the line where doom2.exe is listed and then it will run with the Steam release.</p>
<p>Here's just a quick take on Steam Deck:</p>

      <title>Devs are discovering the Steam Deck is good for making games too</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Part of the power of the Steam Deck is that not only is it a great portable for gaming, it's Linux and has a full desktop mode and so you can also create games with it.</p>
<p>There's a ton of game engines out there that support Linux natively including Godot Engine, Unity, Unreal, Defold, GDevelop and the list just goes on and on. Game Maker too, although they only officially support Ubuntu right now and it's in Beta.</p>
<p>YouTuber Taranasus Videos decided to actually attempt to build a game on the Steam Deck and play it on there. Obviously to do this you really would need to hook it up to a monitor, with a mouse and keyboard but the point is that it's absolutely possible to do. Not only that, it gives developers a pretty good baseline for what to optimize against too. The idea has Valve excited too, with designer Lawrence Yang mentioning on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1545846717915926528" target="_blank">Twitter</a> "Hey look, game development on Steam Deck, no other PC required! This is one of the things we were really excited about enabling with Steam Deck, and it’s awesome to see folks already getting their feet wet.".</p>
<p>Really fun to see things like this, how you can just download a game engine onto a Steam Deck and get going.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tGJmQreOJgk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a070da0023dcab6000b20b0a17ac80d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tGJmQreOJgk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I wouldn't be surprised if we see plenty more of this. We've all seen how devices like the RaspberryPi opened up a new world to people, seems like the Steam Deck could too.</p>

      <title>System76 announce the 67% Launch Lite keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>System76 have revealed the Launch Lite, a smaller version of their rather fancy and highly customizable keyboard that will properly launch for ordering tomorrow.</p>
<p>Featuring the same fancy tricks as the bigger Launch keyboard like custom multi-layer layouts, solid aluminum chassis, RGB LED patterns, magnetic angle bar and secure open source firmware. The difference of course is the size. This is a 67% keyboard and doesn't have the USB hub integrated so overall it's a bit more portable.</p>
<p>You will be able to customize the layout with the updated System76 Keyboard Configurator application allowing you to set 4 different layers, LED patterns and more with it all saved directly to the keyboard so you can take the layout with you anywhere to any system.</p>
<p>System76 say the Launch Lite comes with a "key and switch puller, as well as a few extra essential keys (Esc, Shift, arrows) in different sizes and accent colors" and in addition to the Jade and Royal switches you can also pick it up with either Silent Pink or Silent Brown switches. Additionally, the newer switch options will also be available for the bigger Launch keyboard too!</p>

      <title>43 of the Top 50 most highly-reviewed Steam games are Steam Deck Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently I went over the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/73-of-the-top-100-most-popular-steam-games-are-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">top 100 most-played games</a> on Steam by player count but what about the most highly rated games on Steam? Here's how the top 50 most positively reviewed Steam games work on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Making use of the wonderful <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">Steam 250</a> website, taking a snapshot of the titles listed on July 12, here's what you can expect to see on Steam Deck and 99% will work fine on Linux desktops too of course, since the Steam Deck is powered by Linux. For the rating, I'm sticking to Valve's official Deck Verified position for now. As a reminder though, there are quite a few that are <em>Playable</em> or <em>Unsupported</em> that really do work fine. For desktop Linux users, the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating was added too (if it's not Native) which goes Platinum - Gold - Silver - Bronze - Unsupported.</p>
<p><strong>The Numbers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>29 Verified</li>
<li>14 Playable</li>
<li>3 Unsupported</li>
<li>4 Unchecked</li>
</ul>

<p>Another interesting thing I noticed only recently, the Steam Top 250 website also has a dedicated <a href="https://steam250.com/steam_deck_verified" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified section</a> for the top 250 titles there too. That's pretty great.</p>

      <title>Valve gives the Discovery Queue a makeover to help you find your next game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Discovery Queue is a feature that many people probably miss or just don't use. I use it from time to time but it was a little basic. Valve has put live the next <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/labs/" target="_blank">Steam Labs experiment</a> to overhaul Discovery Queue.</p>
<p>With the Discovery Queue the idea is that Valve picks a bunch of games based on your interests, then you click through to see if something grabs you. It is a wonderful idea but it definitely was in need of a facelift for sure.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of their changes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Launch into the queue without leaving the page you are on</li>
<li>Simplified presentation of key details about each game to give you a taste of what that game is about</li>
<li>See why each game is being recommended specifically to you; maybe it's because you have friends who play it, or it's similar to other games you play, for example</li>
<li>Add a game to your wishlist with the click of a button or view the game's full store page for a more in-depth view</li>
<li>Ignore games that just aren't your jam. We'll make sure to hide them in the future.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also plan to add in future a new display on the Steam homepage, the ability to launch it from any store page, layout optimizations for different screen sizes and full support for the Steam Deck gamepad UI too.</p>

      <title>Veil of Dust: A Homesteading Game arrives for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Veil of Dust: A Homesteading Game is a story-driven historically-grounded homesteading game about finding your way after loss inspired by games like Don't Starve and Stardew Valley with a healthy sprinkle of fantasy elements too. Just recently they had a Native Linux version released on Steam.</p>
<p>"Veil of Dust: A Homesteading Game is an environmental exploration of what comes after devastating loss. Survive in a sparse landscape and find new meaning through your adventures. Make peace with the past and forge a new future by building relationships, creating a new home, and discovering a world beyond the veil."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="z4rS2c_B1wg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a8f3e1d9bd66870f90d541493969fee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/z4rS2c_B1wg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like quite an expansive game in terms of features. Filled full of farming, foraging and hunting but then you also have the relationships side of it, a cooking system, crafting and much more. The story sounds pretty interesting too with the blending of historical with fantastical. More about that below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our protgonists' relationship is simultaneously a rock to both of them and a source of conflict, as chaos and circumstance tests the roles laid down by their personalities, birth order, and restrictive 1860s gender roles. Shane, the older brother, is trying to be true to the directive his late father left - protect your sister from those who would find her magic frightening enough to do her harm. Áine, the younger sister, is trying to be her own person and shoulder some of the burden with her remarkable abilities. Will they come to support one another with their unique talents, or will the sudden appearance of ferocious monsters push them to the breaking point?</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Among Us modding on Steam Deck is quite easy here&#39;s a quick guide</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Among Us works quite nicely on the Steam Deck but what about if you want to get some mods going? It's actually surprisingly easy to do so here's how to do it.</p>
<p>The problem is that often games designed for Windows need certain adjustments done to work in Proton, and that's the case here although it's a single extra step and rather easy to do. Focusing on the <a href="https://docs.bepinex.dev/index.html" target="_blank">BepInEx</a> framework, with the example mod of The Other Roles in the below video I go over all the steps needed to get it working. The text guide is below the video.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5vGUqyvOUgM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07c29be13965f6757a15c1d1c91b7f45.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5vGUqyvOUgM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide, which applies to Linux Desktop too:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add this as a launch option for Among Us: <code class="inline-code">WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%</code></li>
<li>Open the Local Files, where it's installed</li>
<li>Here you <em>may</em> want to make a backup, so you can replace if needed with the original default experience</li>
<li>Head to <a href="https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles" target="_blank">The Other Roles page</a> on GitHub, to the Releases section and download TheOtherRoles.zip</li>
<li>Extract the zip file, and copy the insides into your Among Us installed folder</li>
<li>Done</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically for Steam Deck, you will want to setup Steam Input to have the Right Trackpad as a Mouse, and set Right Trackpad click as a Left Mouse Button. Otherwise, you won't able to access the extra menu items some mods like The Other Roles add into the UI.</p>
<p>Step number 1 will be needed for any mod using the BepInEx framework. You could use Proton Tricks on desktop to set it, but that never seemed to save properly on Steam Deck and simply setting a launch option is actually much simpler to do.</p>

      <title>Tiny Tina&#39;s Wonderlands out on Steam, appears to work well on Steam Deck and Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands from Gearbox has now launched on Steam with its Epic Exclusive period now over and it's looking pretty good on Steam Deck and Linux desktops. <u>Note</u>: 2K sent over a key.</p>
<p>Curiously though, the game on desktop Linux at least won't play the videos with Proton 7 or Proton Experimental so you see a test-screen instead but they do work just fine on the Steam Deck. So for desktop Linux, you're going to need GE-Proton for now (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">guide here</a>). Apart from that, it all seems to work just fine on Fedora Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>However, one big missing feature for the Steam release are cloud saves. So you will not be able to sync characters easily from one system to another. This feels like a really big thing to miss now, especially with the Steam Deck gaining more popularity and just — backups in case your system fails.</p>
<p>A look at it across Steam Deck and Fedora:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D3ObJNrBay0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c1d588b84ba06d27068b96e711d8ee1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D3ObJNrBay0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For the Steam Deck, setting into into the Medium preset with FSR 2 set to Balanced and the screen locked to 40Hz seems to give a pretty good experience. There's the usual drops and slight stutter when it's loading something new but other than that it's fine.

      <title>TUXEDO announce the Pulse 15 second-gen laptop with AMD Ryzen 7 5700U 35W</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The second-generation TUXEDO Pulse 15 is up for pre-order with shipping expected in late July, which comes with the powerful AMD Ryzen 7 5700U that TUXEDO have pushed up to 35w.</p>
<p>TUXEDO claim their Pulse 15 is one of the "most popular Linux notebooks on the market", so they made sure to keep that crown and bump up the performance quite a lot with their changes to the model in the second-gen. Coming with the Ryzen 7 5700U, which AMD state should run at 10-25W, TUXEDO did something a little more unique here pushing what's possible with the chip.</p>
<p>Not only have they bumped up the wattage to give solid performance, they're also keeping it quiet and cool with 2 fans and 2 heat pipes, which they say most vendors have only 1 of each. The result should be cool surface temps and low fan noise under full load without throttling.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8319202881657537126gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8319202881657537126gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Main Specifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>15.6 inch WQHD IPS Display (2560 x 1440 | 165 Hz)</li>
<li>Very lightweight and thin magnesium chassis</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 5700U-35W (TDP: 35 Watt!)</li>
<li>AMD Radeon RX Vega 8 Graphics</li>
<li>91 Wh Lithium-Polymer battery</li>
<li>USB-C (Power-Delivery | DisplayPort 1.4) &amp; HDMI 2.0</li>
<li>Max. 64 GB DDR4 RAM (Dual Channel)</li>
<li>2x M.2 SSD PCIe NVMe &amp; SATAIII</li>
<li>Backlit keyboard with TUX super-key</li>
<li>3x USB-A ports (2x USB 3.2 Gen2, 1x USB 2.0), LAN RJ45, a Micro SD card reader</li>
</ul>
<p>With a base price of €1,149.</p>
<p>My criticism here continues though, why do vendors keep sticking in such a low amount of RAM with obviously power-focused machines? Realistically, if you're going for such a machine, you're going to up the RAM to 16 GB minimum which brings the price up to €1,194.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TUXEDO Computers works with barebone manufacturers for its Linux notebooks and PCs, optimizing them to run flawlessly with Linux through driver and firmware adaptions, extensive "reverse engineering" and testing, as well as in-house software development, cloud services and Linux customer support.</p>

      <title>Half-Life 2 mod FIREFIGHT RELOADED gets a Native Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FIREFIGHT RELOADED is a Half-Life 2 mod that gives you fast-paced horde-mode FPS gameplay with a ton of customizations and features inspired by other Source Engine mods.</p>
<p>Just recently on July 8th the developers put up a Native Linux version of the game that's ready for some more testing. It's not advertised on Steam just yet outside the announcement, as they continue work to improve it. One known issue is that the "Killfeed" doesn't show up properly, and they suggest <em>not</em> using the Flatpak version of Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17034576651657536246gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17034576651657536246gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast-paced gameplay similar to old school FPS games.</li>
<li>Blends in gameplay elements inspired by other Source mods, like kicking, aiming down sights, bullettime and more.</li>
<li>Players can customize almost everything about the game, from changing how enemy spawners work to how much speed the player walks at.</li>
<li>Endless horde mode-style gameplay.</li>
<li>Fight vicious enemies from the past, present and future such as Bullsquids, Houndeyes, Hunters, the Cremator and the Combine Female Assassin, along with new encounters such as the Combine Ace.</li>
<li>A variety of weapons from a Crowbar to a OICW, along with the ability to add in up to 30 custom weapons.</li>
<li>A in-game store that allows you to buy weapons, ammo, and supplies with in-game currency that you get by killing hordes of enemies.</li>
<li>A brutal gore system that allows you to shred enemies with your Shotgun and RPG.</li>
<li>A whole host of add-ons and custom content created by other players on the Steam Workshop.</li>
<li>Free regular updates which add new content and features to the mod.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Play it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397680/FIREFIGHT_RELOADED" target="_blank">free on Steam</a> (as long as you own Half-Life 2).</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You need to opt into the "endgame-beta" to get access to the Linux version.</p>

      <title>Stray is the most wishlisted Steam game and it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the release of Stray on July 19th, Stray has become the most wishlisted game on Steam and it has been fully Steam Deck Verified. Good news for Steam Deck fans and Linux desktop gamers, since it should work great on both.</p>
<p>Stray has been doing headlines for quite some time since the initial trailer that was shown by Sony, as it will be coming to the PlayStation 5 too. The Steam release is what we're interested in though of course and the publisher Annapurna Interactive noted on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/A_i/status/1545198497376284672" target="_blank">Twitter</a> the Steam Deck compatibility. This is great to see for multiple reasons though, not only being Steam Deck Verified but the publisher and developer ensuring it's done <strong>before</strong> release. Hopefully more will do the same.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fOm_9N9ksBY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5cbe7e355da5fa40114eb2781162df44.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fOm_9N9ksBY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Stray is a third-person cat adventure game set amidst the detailed, neon-lit alleys of a decaying cybercity and the murky environments of its seedy underbelly. Roam surroundings high and low, defend against unforeseen threats and solve the mysteries of this unwelcoming place inhabited by curious droids and dangerous creatures.</p>
<p>See the world through the eyes of a cat and interact with the environment in playful ways. Be stealthy, nimble, silly, and sometimes as annoying as possible with the strange inhabitants of this mysterious world."</p>
<p>You can pre-order on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. I'll be taking a look at how it runs at release.</p>

      <title>Point and lick adventure Nine Noir Lives releases September 7</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cat lovers and adventure game aficionados alike may want to keep an eye on this one, as the point and lick (get it?) game Nine Noir Lives releases September 7 along with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Taking a heavy dose of inspiration from classic film noir, Shakespeare and what they say is the "absurdist comedy style of writer and director Taika Waititi", it sounds like we're in for a bit of a treat with this one. While comedy-based, they do say it does follow a serious subject matter too so my curiosity is piqued. However, curiosity killed the cat as they say, so good job we have nine lives huh?</p>
<p>"In Nine Noir Lives, players will take on the role of Cuddles Nutterbutter, a feline private investigator with a taste for solving crime… literally. Cuddles will poke, talk, and lick his way through his toughest investigation yet: a murder case that threatens to upset the tenuous relationship between the paw-erful Montameeuw and Catulet crime families. Along the way, players will interact with dozens of fully-voiced characters, beautifully hand-drawn scenes, and devious puzzles to answer the most important question of all: how many things need to be licked to solve a murder in this town?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PAqKUfJEZA0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20e2a4d0195a932c5dc7998a3fdd29a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PAqKUfJEZA0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play through a charming comedy-noir storyline inspired by every cat ever, with fewer cat puns than you might expurrct.</li>
<li>Explore the unique and intriguing city of Meow Meow Furrington across over eighty attractive, hand-drawn screens.</li>
<li>Interact with over twenty-five hilarious characters.</li>
<li>Discover a whole new dimension to everything in the game by using your wits tongue. Lick first, and ask questions later. Questions like "what did you <em>expect</em> that to taste like, Cuddles?"</li>
<li>Experience the city from two very different perspectives as you switch between Cuddles and his capable assistant, Tabby Marshmallow.</li>
<li>Laugh and learn about the world of Furth with over a hundred thousand thousand words of fully-voiced dialogue.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles both fun and fiendish - but never unfair.</li>
</ul>

      <title>ARK: Survival Evolved switches away from Linux Native to use Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You wouldn't know this looking at the Steam page for ARK: Survival Evolved but Studio Wildcard have now put their Native Linux version behind a Beta on Steam as they now prefer Linux users to play with the Proton compatibility layer.</p>
<p>They didn't announce this change on Steam, instead leaving it somewhat hidden on their <a href="https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/664670-report-steam-proton-issues-accessing-the-legacy-native-linux-version-of-ark/" target="_blank">official forum post</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Proton has been enabled by default on ARK: Survival Evolved for Steam Linux players, include complete BattlEye support. If you are experiencing any issues with the Proton version of the game, please let us know in this thread and we'll work with Valve (Steam) to get these resolved as soon as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you do, for whatever reason, wish to use their rather poorly supported Native Linux build you can access it by opting into the "linuxnative" Beta on Steam.</p>
<p>Not overly surprising. As someone who followed along ARK ever since release, their Native Linux version always had a ridiculous amount of issues and they never seemed to pay much attention to it at all. In this case, it has been preferable for quite some time to just play it through Proton anyway. Given the time and resources Valve puts into Proton, and Studio Wildcard ensuring the BattlEye anti-cheat works, it's a far better experience.</p>
<p>ARK was Steam Deck Verified some time ago, which was also using the Windows version run through Proton which you can see some footage of mine on below:</p>

      <title>Dicey Dungeons &#39;Reunion&#39; is a huge free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dicey Dungeons Reunion is a big free update for the brilliant dice-rolling dungeon crawler and it's out now. With lots of new content, it's going to suck you right back in to get rolling. A deck-builder that's like no other, Dicey Dungeons has you build up your abilities through the card system and then you roll the dice during battles to activate them. It's pretty darn clever and easily one of my favourites.</p>
<p>This major new update adds in six new episodes (one for each character), new music, new artwork, new equipment and plenty of new gameplay.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fVsWXAAccVg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a33a9ea2cbe6048fca33aa942607c4ec.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fVsWXAAccVg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Six wildly different playable classes: Warrior, Thief, Robot, Jester, Inventor and Witch.</li>
<li>Dozens of enemies, ranging from Vacuum Cleaners that want to suck your blood, to creatures from Irish mythology, to suave malevolent snowmen.</li>
<li>A catchy, upbeat and energetic soundtrack by Chipzel (previously, the musician from Super Hexagon).</li>
<li>Beautiful and adorable artwork by Marlowe Dobbe.</li>
<li>Procedurally generated for endless play-throughs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I certainly know what I'm playing through again this weekend…</p>
<p>You can buy Dicey Dungeons now on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dicey_dungeons?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dicey-dungeons?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/861540/Dicey_Dungeons/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets a big update with Valve back in action</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like Valve are really back in action on updating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2</a>, with a fresh update out now and it's quite big compared to previous patches.</p>
<p>As the bot problem continues on, Valve previously said on the official TF2 <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" target="_blank">Twitter</a> "TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things." and this is the third update released since then.</p>
<p>Thanks to the updates, the popularity of TF2 has exploded on Steam once again with it regularly seeing over 130,000 online playing together, although it's probable a good portion are bots and bot makers trying to get around the latest changes.</p>
<p>Here's what landed in the July 7th patch:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Several fixes to address exploits and stability issues</li>
<li>Added a game server setting, "net_chan_limit_msec", which allows server operators to limit amount of processing time the game server can spend on processing packets for each client per tick. Clients that send packets causing server CPU processing time to exceed configured number of milliseconds will be kicked from the game server.</li>
<li>Added a game server setting, "net_chan_stats_dump" which, when enabled, will dump statistics of each network channel when that network channel is closed. Statistics include messages, bandwidth, and CPU processing time breakdown.</li>
<li>Added a game server setting, "tf_fall_damage_disablespread", to disable random fall damage (default: 0)</li>
<li>Fixed not being able to adjust the offset for a cosmetic item's Unusual effect</li>
<li>Fixed some players seeing [unknown] for their player name</li>
<li>Fixed broken transparency on cosmetics</li>
<li>Fixed lag compensation when melee-ing teammates</li>
<li>Fixed not being able to hit a player's hitbox if it extends outside the player's bounding box during an animation</li>
<li>Fixed jiggle bones rendering in the loadout and item previews</li>
<li>Fixed the Iron Bomber's projectile collision size not matching other projectile collision sizes</li>
<li>Fixed ConVar buttons flickering after being clicked to toggle the value</li>
<li>Fixed The Shortstop shove showing as self-inflicted damage</li>
<li>Fixed Mini-Sentry guns not triggering damage alerts in the HUD</li>
<li>Fixed net_disconnect_reason affecting disconnect messages on the client</li>
<li>Fixed Medi Gun charges expiring too early if a server forces add_uber_time</li>
<li>Fixed network edicts being used for server-side-only entities</li>
<li>Updated mat_picmip to allow values below -1</li>
<li>Updated/Added some tournament medals</li>
<li>Updated the localization files</li>
<li>Updated Mann vs. Machine
	<ul>
<li>Fixed not being able to kick Spectators</li>
<li>Fixed bots not displaying the correct names</li>
<li>Fixed the loading screen backgrounds on Valve servers</li>
<li>Fixed Übercharge charge rate and duration upgrade not working for the Vaccinator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated Arena mode
	<ul>
<li>Fixed players being able to late-join the game</li>
<li>Fixed players on team Unassigned being able to kill other players</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Void Scrappers is an upcoming space horde shooter inspired by Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors has basically reignited the horde shooter genre now right? Developer 8BitSkull (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/fates-of-ort-is-an-rpg-where-time-stops-until-you-move-its-absolutely-great-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank">Fates of Ort</a>) has announced their next game with Void Scrappers.</p>
<p>They said it is inspired by Vampire Survivors but clearly they're going their own way with it. This isn't just another auto-attacking horde shooter, they've blasted off into space like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/uh-oh-gunlocked-is-like-vampire-survivors-in-space-and-just-as-absorbing/" target="_blank">Gunlocked</a>. However, unlike Gunlocked this isn't a vertical scrolling-shooter as it gives you a proper arena to fly around in.</p>
<p>"Blast hordes of alien ships into junk. Collect the scrap to upgrade your ship into an unstoppable force of destruction. Unlock new characters and weapons and upgrade your stats between runs.</p>
<p>Collect scrap dropped by your defeated enemies. Use it to upgrade your ship until it becomes unstoppable. Fight and destroy bosses and grab the weapons they drop. Blast hordes of aliens with various projectiles, explosions and kinetic orbitals. Unlock new characters with unique abilities and new weapon and upgrade types. Permanently upgrade your ship stats in between runs."</p>

<p>Just like their previous game Fates of Ort, they do plan full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005210/Void_Scrappers/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta gets scaling for external displays, new &#34;Preview&#34; testing branch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lots of goodies have arrived in a fresh Steam Deck Client Beta, along with a small update to SteamOS 3.3 Beta too.</p>
<p>Valve continued to improve how the Deck handles external displays, as they work towards getting the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-delay-the-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">delayed official Dock</a> ready to release. I think it's pretty clear the software just wasn't ready, and there's not a whole lot of point in them releasing it officially when there's still so many issues when docking but this is a good step forwards. You also no longer pick a different update channel for the Client and the OS, with the options being unified now into one.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in the Steam Deck Client Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3323108691081569180" target="_blank">released July 7th</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an option to scale the Steam Deck user interface for external displays</li>
<li>Added a toggle for automatic scaling of the Steam Deck user interface for external displays</li>
<li>Added a scheduled night mode feature, allowing players to choose if and when they’d like night mode to automatically turn on</li>
<li>Added a Japanese (Kana) keyboard option</li>
<li>Added a new Steam Deck software update channel selector – there are now three option
	<ul>
<li>Stable: Recommended experience for most users. This option will install the latest stable Steam Client and SteamOS.</li>
<li>Beta  Testing for new Steam features. Updates frequently. This option will install Steam Client Beta and the latest stable SteamOS.</li>
<li>Preview: Testing for new Steam and system-level features. Updates frequently. You may encounter issues. This option will install Steam Client Beta and the SteamOS Beta.</li>
<li>You will only see patch notes for the update channel you've selected. As this feature is in Beta, if you opt into the Stable channel, you will not see this selector anymore.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved Korean keyboard user experience</li>
<li>Improved Adaptive Brightness slider user experience</li>
<li>Fixed flatpak Chrome closing improperly when quit through Steam</li>
<li>Fixed on-screen keyboard showing up under the Steam or Quick Access menu</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1545201445716185090" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that the SteamOS 3.3 Beta had a small update that reverted the new built-in controller driver, plus there's a fix for a long-standing crash for Red Dead Redemption 2 when using Vulkan. The Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1675200/discussions/0/3410929607716145819/" target="_blank">forum post</a> mentions the controller driver is waiting on an issue with firmware updates being resolved.</p>
<p>Here's a quick run over what's new:</p>

      <title>Expansive open world country-life sim The Ranchers gets funded in less than a day</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Ranchers from French developer RedPilz Studio is a very promising looking open world country-life sim, which will be coming with Native Linux support and optimized for the Steam Deck. It recently launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redpilzstudio/the-ranchers/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with it seeing the full funding in less than a day so clearly there's plenty of people out there wanting more farming life sims.</p>
<p>With the developer being inspired by various games like Harvest Moon, The Sims, GTA, Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing they wanted to combine their many mechanics and parts they found fun into a modern game that "pushes all the boundaries of the classics" and so The Ranchers was started.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OMqDwzgYB04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6bc506d39636fce91b0542bd80bed15a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OMqDwzgYB04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to play completely offline in solo, or you can team up with four players total online to do some ranching with others in co-op. You'll be able to explore a village, buy vehicles like cars, trucks and yachts and explore a huge open world filled full of mines, shipwrecks, uncharted islands and the occasional monster encounter too. Then you add in all the main mechanics of farming, fishing, sports and much more.</p>
<p>Seems it's been quite popular on Steam too, with it getting over 225,000 wishlists.</p>
<p>I spoke with the developer, who confirmed their full Linux support plans which will happen quickly after the Windows release if they don't make it on day-1. The Kickstarter campaign additionally confirms their intention to ensure it's optimized nicely for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can help fund it on Kickstarter and follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501310/The_Ranchers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>JSAUX are filling the Steam Deck accessory gap and have a Docking Station ready</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want some accessories for your Steam Deck? Well JSAUX recently put out their Docking Station, along with some other goodies for you to look into.</p>
<p>They have two models available with the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-docking-station" target="_blank">Docking Station for Steam Deck</a> and the newer and more expensive <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/upgraded-docking-station-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Upgraded Docking Station for Steam Deck</a> which come with plenty of ports available. The main difference between the two appears to be the upgraded version having three USB 3 ports and Gigbit Ethernet, with the original having two USB 2 ports and slower Ethernet. Both also have a 4K@60Hz HDMI 2.0 output too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8902082371657203148gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8902082371657203148gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It of course also supports power delivery at 100W max, which is plenty to charge and power the Steam Deck at full speed.</p>
<p>Seems like it might be worth picking up, especially since Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/06/valve-delay-the-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">delayed</a> the official Steam Deck Dock and we have no idea when they plan to make it available as they haven't said much on it lately.</p>
<p>Additionally JSAUX also sell various other accessories like the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-protective-case" target="_blank">Silicon Protective Case for Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-screen-protector-1" target="_blank">Plain Screen Protectors</a>, <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/printing-screen-protector-for-steam-deck" target="_blank">Screen Protectors with a fancy border</a>, a <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/steam-deck-stand-protector" target="_blank">Protective Standing Case</a> and more. Perhaps there might be something you like the look of.</p>
<p>I've been told we're getting some sent over here, so I should be able to take a look at them at some point.</p>

      <title>You should avoid the stock Firefox install on Steam Deck as it&#39;s badly outdated (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I spoke with Valve about the issue and they confirmed change is coming — "Yes, we're aware of the issue and will soon be shipping an update to the SteamOS Beta to address it. After the update, Firefox will be installed as a flatpak, making it easier to keep up to date."</p>
<hr/>
<p>For all the pros of the Steam Deck like the full KDE Plasma desktop mode, there's a bit of a sore spot with Valve being too slow to update some of the included software.</p>
<p>Right now, the version of Firefox that is available on the Steam Deck is stuck at 96.0.3 even if you've opted into the very latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/steamos-33-beta-out-plus-a-steam-deck-client-update/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.3 Beta</a>. This is actually rather important, because web browsers are constantly under attack and new vulnerabilities appear all the time. With this version of Firefox, there's various flaws still present in it.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear why Valve don't just remove the Firefox package included directly in SteamOS, and have the Flatpak version installed instead like they give you the option for with Chrome with their built-in installer that keeps it up to date too.</p>
<p>For now if you want a secure browsing experience on the Steam Deck you should either install and run the Firefox version available via Discover as Flatpak or use Chrome that Valve has an easy installer for either via Discover or through the Non-Steam section in Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve directly about this, will update if / when they reply.</p>
<p>Need help installing software on the Steam Deck? See our guide example video below:</p>

      <title>Mark your calendars, Steam Next Fest returns in October 2022</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has sent word that Steam Next Fest is coming back again and it will be live on October 3rd - 10th.</p>
<p>Much like their past editions it will be filled with hundreds of limited-time demos, although plenty of them you can likely just copy out of Steam and they will continue working but of course you're not supposed to know that (shh). On top of that there will be developer livestreams which will be live on their store pages as well as the event page, allowing you to chat to devs about their upcoming games.</p>
<p>For developers to get involved they must send over the registration to Valve by Thursday, July 21st 2022. There's a few boxes they need to tick to be eligible too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Associated with a Steamworks developer account in good standing</li>
<li>Visible on Steam as Coming Soon at the time of registration </li>
<li>Includes a publicly playable demo by the time the festival begins </li>
<li>To be released after the conclusion of the fest on October 10, 2022</li>
<li>Each game can only appear once in Steam Next Fest</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to the final point, Valve said this October's Next Fest will be the final time for a game to appear in Next Fest if it did so previously. So this rule will fully apply going forwards.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">preview page</a>, which gives you the option to set a special reminder.</p>

      <title>Nomad Survival is another great cheap Vampire Survivors styled game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nomad Survival is an auto-attacking rogue-lite action game where you try to survive as long as you can, while you continue to buff up your character as you go. Works great on Linux and Steam Deck with Proton.</p>
<p>Very much the same basic mechanics as the amazingly popular Vampire Survivors, with attacks firing off automatically. The key to survival is not only your fancy finger-work on the movement but also the build you go for on what attack types and upgrades you pick on each level up. As you take down enemies, they drop little gems to pick up to increase your experience level and then on each level you get to pick from upgrades.</p>
<p>Here's a look at it running on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qzCoryEBmMo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d2f3f3d06cc58afe8513191fed280d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qzCoryEBmMo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Tested working perfectly on Fedora Linux too.</em></p>
<p>It's delightfully engrossing and if you're a fan of auto-attack games like Vampire Survivors, it's another worthy entry to stick into your shopping cart that's only £2.09 and it will only take up around 100MB or so. You've not got much to lose and plenty of fun to gain. It's currently in Early Access and so it's continually growing too.</p>
<p>This is easily going to be my next 100+ game while sitting in bed on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>3 Unique Characters (4 more which can be unlocked!)</li>
<li>17 Active Abilities and 19 Passive Abilities</li>
<li>1 Heritage (4 more which can be unlocked!) which changes the playstyle of each run.</li>
<li>2 Maps, each with 4 Boss encounters.</li>
<li>Modifiable Game Speed. Play at 150% or even 200% Game Speed!</li>
<li>79 Achievements, some of which unlock new features.</li>
<li>20 Stats to be Upgraded.</li>
</ul>

<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1929870/Nomad_Survival/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>I doesn&#39;t exist - a modern text adventure is one you need to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>doesn't exist - a modern text adventure, is an in-development game from LUAL Games KIG that's a love letter to the origins of adventures and gaming. Inspired by the likes of The Beginner's Guide, Stories Untold, Buddy Simulator and Zork it's one for those who love a classic adventure with some nice modern touches.</p>
<p>The developer is going for a modern theme with this too with it exploring themes of isolation, mental health and control. Not only that but they've introduced a clever sounding conversational AI, so you don't have to memorize and repeat exact words needed to progress.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2E074oVGPO4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/385d6d30580d63b84299ed0f39b72978.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2E074oVGPO4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the first act being like a classic text adventure much like Zork, the developer makes clear they don't want you to read endless walls of text, and they're sticking to their design rule on that plus there's plenty of great looking animated pixel-art to help convey the story to you. Plus you're also getting treated to a full musical score for it too.</p>
<p>For the second and third parts though, they plan to expand the scope and mix it up a bit noting that "the story will branch off a bit more and won't be so rule-based anymore" but they don't want to spoil the surprise so they're not going into great detail on that.</p>
<p>You can try the demo on <a href="https://lulatschia.itch.io/i-doesnt-exist" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1943420/I_doesnt_exist__a_modern_text_adventure/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>It's also seeking <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/i-doesnt-exist/i-doesnt-exist-a-modern-text-adventure" target="_blank">funding on Kickstarter</a> where the developer hopes to raise at least 10,000CHF (around £8,654.86).</p>

      <title>OpenRCT2 the re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies have arrived for <a href="https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2" target="_blank">OpenRCT2</a> the open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Although it's fully playable already, the developers of this FOSS project continue to improve it a lot. This is another project that helps to keep a real classic game alive on modern systems, while also continually improving various features to make it feel just that little bit more modern.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16287382281657102302gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of the new additions in version 0.4.1 released on July 4th include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Alpine Coaster track type.</li>
<li>Option to show ride vehicles as separate entries when selecting a ride to construct.</li>
<li>FLAC and OGG/vorbis as supported audio formats for ride music objects.</li>
<li>Add vehicles for the Hybrid Coaster, Single-Rail Roller Coaster and Classic Mini Roller Coaster.</li>
<li>More natural looking shorelines in map generator.</li>
<li>Parks can now be resized into rectangular shapes from the map and map generation windows.</li>
<li>Tree placement is more natural during map generation.</li>
<li>The maximum price for the park entry has been raised to £999.</li>
<li>Weather no longer resets when converting a save to scenario.</li>
<li>Music Style dropdown is now sorted by name.</li>
<li>Transparency can be enabled directly without needing see-through enabled first.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus around 37 bug fixes were noted to make the game much more stable overall.</p>
<p>You need the data files to play it so buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it running on Linux is nice and simple too since they offer an official AppImage and there's also a Flatpak available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Forgotten World free update out for Monster Sanctuary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The creature battling metroidvania Monster Sanctuary has an expansive new free update out with The Forgotten World which is the largest update to the game yet. Adding in a new area, skills, items, new game modes and much more.</p>
<p>About it: "Delve deep into the Metroidvania inspired world of Monster Sanctuary, explore the expansive lands and call upon your monsters to lend their aid in and out of combat! Use their unique skills to fly, ride and brute force your way through environmental puzzles and precise platforming! The world is yours to traverse as you see fit, are you ready to take on the Sanctuary?"</p>
<p>Instead of The Forgotten World being a DLC, they decided to release it free to avoid any separation of the online PvP mode (optional) between people who have it and don't. Seems like a sane idea and gives everyone a bigger and better game. They've also added a "tip jar" on the <a href="https://monster-sanctuary.com/" target="_blank">official site</a> for anyone to donate if they want to support the developer thanks to the free upgrade.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="H2e_Vw-ru3U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4354343c787cb397a973a34423efbb6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/H2e_Vw-ru3U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the full highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A new area, larger than any other area of Monster Sanctuary. Forgotten World is meant to be explored in the late game - either before you step foot in the Abandoned Tower, or after you finished the main story. You can find the entrance in the lower area of Horizon Beach. You will need a certain late-game exploration ability to enter this area.</li>
<li>Ten new Monsters.</li>
<li>Nine of them can be found in the Forgotten World. One of the ten new Monsters is a new secret Champion in Blue Cave - which might help you enter the Forgotten World earlier.</li>
<li>New Monster type: Ancient.</li>
<li>Many of the new Monsters have this type. There are also some older Monsters that have gained this type.</li>
<li>Level cap raised to 42 from 40.</li>
<li>All skill trees in the game have gained some new skill nodes. In some cases, we made extensive changes to older Monsters' skill trees.</li>
<li>A lot of new weapons and accessories.</li>
<li>Two new player costumes.</li>
<li>Some new rooms and treasure chests have been added to older areas of the game as well.</li>
<li>Some new exploration abilities have been added to the game as well. Some of the exploration abilities of older Monsters have been updated.</li>
<li>On top of three new Champion fights, there is a new super-secret Champion fight that can only be found by Keeper Masters. It is the most difficult fight in the game.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>winesapOS is another way to get something like SteamOS on desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve has still yet to produce an official installable image of SteamOS 3 for desktops, as always the community provides and another worth looking into is <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS</a>. Another <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/holoiso-brings-valves-steamos-3-from-the-steam-deck-to-everyone/" target="_blank">I covered is HoloISO</a>, which tries to stick quite closely to SteamOS 3 but winesapOS aims to be a bit more than that.</p>
<p>Originally called the "Mac Linux Gaming Stick", the aim was to give macOS users an easy bootable disk to run Linux to get expanded game compatibility but it rebranded a while ago to expand the scope for many more users.</p>
<p>From what one of the developers told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our ultimate goal is not to provide the exact SteamOS experience that the Steam Deck provides like HoloISO does. We are focused on the desktop experience and expanding support for SteamOS by making the operating system work on a wide range of hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In keeping with that goal, they have expanded hardware support on desktops / laptops and of course Apple Mac systems too. They also have much more up to date software compared with SteamOS, it supports UEFI and legacy BIOS, encrypted filesystem support, has the Pamac application for installing / updating other software and comes pre-installed with plenty of software like Steam, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, and PolyMC while still keeping the look and feel similar to SteamOS 3.</p>
<p>A big new release with version 3.1.0 went up recently with these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arch Linux packages upgrades</li>
<li>Graphics driver upgrades with support for Intel, NVIDIA and virtual machines</li>
<li>Improved controller support</li>
<li>An improved upgrade procedure</li>
<li>A fork for the PlayStation 4</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/LukeShortCloud/winesapOS" target="_blank">winesapOS on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Organ swapping FPS &#39;Wrought Flesh&#39; gets a huge free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wrought Flesh is a game where you run around and pinch the organs of downed enemies to upgrade your body. It's pretty weird and a big content update is out now.</p>
<p>"Rip out enemies organs and equip them in your own body. Fight biopunk monsters and drugged-up space bandits. You are a Gajeshian Cultist: A near-mythological being built from the bodies of long-dead saints. You have arrived on the partially terraformed planet of Chrisembourgh on a temple-ordained mission to find and kill someone. Explore the planet and trace your victims steps to the end."</p>
<p>The 'Purple Sands of Cumulun' update adds in a reworked oasis area, tons of new quests, new guns, new music, a new monster, reworked AI, new achievements and they had "an actual writer" rework the text too. Seems like a lot of work went into this update.</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Starve Together big Curse of Moon Quay update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Curse of Moon Quay is the latest major update for the Native Linux survival game Don't Starve Together and it sounds like a great one. They also updated it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/klei-fixes-up-dont-starve-together-for-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">Steam Deck support</a> recently too!</p>
<p>Easily one of the best survival games you can play on a Linux desktop or Steam Deck, as it's just such a fun game and the style of it is simply magnificent. One of the greatest games Klei has made for sure, but then I like pretty much anything Klei make.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eligdVVedDU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/813cba69f1fea5e25f29441b43ffe0c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eligdVVedDU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features includes:</p>
<div class="bbcodes_ExpandSectionBody_2sCNL">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New Moon Quay Island and inhabitants.</li>
<li>Ocean Privateers.</li>
<li>New upgrades for boating:
	<ul>
<li>Grass Boat</li>
<li>Kelp Bumper</li>
<li>Shell Bumper</li>
<li>Cannon and Cannonballs</li>
<li>Rudder</li>
<li>Trawler</li>
<li>Polly Roger's Hat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Docks</li>
<li>Nautopilot and Nautopilot Beacon</li>
<li>New perspectives on life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the new content, they also tweaked some existing features like making map controls and zooming much more intuitive and just make more sense. Zooming for example now focuses on the cursor for the map and will be smoother, rotating the map will also be done around the current location and not the player and controllers will see a better directional panning experience.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a> where it's 66% off for the 2022 Summer Sale. Absolutely worth getting.</p>

      <title>Quirky murder mystery adventure Lord Winklebottom Investigates releases July 28th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lord Winklebottom Investigates is an upcoming adventure from UK-based developer Cave Monsters, and they've recently confirmed it will release on July 28th. This game will be coming along with full Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from British literature icons such as Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes, Lord Winklebottom and his tea-drinking hippo companion Dr. Frumple will enjoy a journey full of intrigue and secrets that will apparently keep mystery fans gripped. The developer said it's a game with plenty of heart, featuring a script and setting full of bizarre characters and humour that wouldn’t be out of place in a Monty Python or Blackadder sketch.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XxxK5ygYBGo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d30f4dd2279933598095d34d70e1f01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XxxK5ygYBGo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Funded thanks to a Kickstarter campaign it's set in the 1920s where the world’s foremost detective is about to embark on his most challenging case yet. Set on an isolated island where there's a grisly murder, it's a race against time to track down the killer.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full English voice acting.</li>
<li>An original 1920s inspired soundtrack featuring live instruments.</li>
<li>Play as a gentleman giraffe!</li>
<li>Unique 2D hand painted artwork.</li>
<li>Animals of all shapes and sizes!</li>
<li>Streamlined point and click interface.</li>
<li>Collection of bizarre characters to interrogate!</li>
<li>Dozens of puzzles to solve!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1024160/Lord_Winklebottom_Investigates/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Zachtronics moving on from game development, their last game is now out in Early Access with Last Call BBS although it's actually not just one game.</p>
<p>"Boot up your Z5 Powerlance and dial into Last Call BBS, the last game from Zachtronics! The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EdU-ABucIjk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/97a32015fdc3e15f50d716593b04f14b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EdU-ABucIjk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is actually a game pack that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>20th Century Food Court:</strong> Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast!</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>STEED FORCE Hobby Studio:</strong> Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required!</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path:</strong> Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sawayama Solitaire:</strong> It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Dungeons &amp; Diagrams:</strong> Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>ChipWizard™ Professional:</strong> Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program?</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>HACK*MATCH:</strong> The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support).</li>
<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Kabufuda Solitaire:</strong> Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They will also be doing an <a href="https://askmeanythi.ng/ama/Ll5HypQmU79a" target="_blank">AMA (Ask Me Anything)</a> on Reddit on Thursday where you can fire off those burning questions.</p>
<p>It's a shame to know they won't be making any more games (it really is the last), with Zach moving onto a teaching job that was <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1454395489?t=00h12m36s" target="_blank">confirmed</a> during a recent Q&amp;A livestream.</p>
<p>Available to buy with a Native Linux version from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and soon on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/last_call_bbs" target="_blank">GOG</a> too.</p>

      <title>Feartress is a new incremental city-building RPG in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Feartress is a bit of a quirky one. Blending together elements of an idle RPG with some small city-building that sees you go through different dimensions. I'm really not sure on the best way to describe this one, it's just odd but it has a pretty nice idea to play through.</p>
<p>"A new take on the genre of incremental games where you go on a journey to collect all the 21 elemental pearls and restore balance to the universe. You build up a settlement in each world and destroy enemy structures to find loot and unlock new perks. Collect epic and legendary gear to help you venture into new worlds with increasingly powerful enemies."</p>

      <title>Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A second bundle (yes there's two) supporting people in the USA following the overturning of Roe v. Wade is live on itch.io with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1471/worthy-of-better-stronger-together-for-reproductive-rights" target="_blank">Worthy of Better, Stronger Together for Reproductive Rights bundle</a>. The other is the Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds covered <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/itchio-are-hosting-a-big-indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>June 24th, 2022 was a harrowing day for civil liberties. In the United States, basic human rights are being stripped away. It is a stark reminder that even after 50 years of legal protection, equality can be so easily lost. To say nothing of the dangerous precedent this decision sets for other civil rights protections, we believe that the right for a person to pursue safe and legal abortions is more than enough reason to stand up and take action. This decision does not only effect those capable of becoming pregnant. It is a determination of what rights we as a society choose to hold sacred. It is a question of  who is deemed worthy of protecting. The fabric of our society is woven by every single member, to erode a single thread unravels us all. We must all take a stand and demand that our rights and bodily autonomy are federally recognized</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a charity bundle as well with all proceeds being split between these two charities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://now.org/" target="_blank">National Organization for Women</a></li>
<li><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/about-us/" target="_blank">Center for Reproductive Rights</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can pay $10 (or more) to support it and gain access to 169 different items spread across games, tools and more including some gems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Away Team</li>
<li>Aground</li>
<li>Not Actually A DOS Game</li>
<li>Sally Face</li>
</ul>
<p>The bundle is up for the next 11 days.</p>

      <title>Desktopia is a city-builder that runs along the bottom of your desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Desktopia: A Desktop Village Simulator seems like quite a unique idea for a city-builder, also a fun distraction to have open on your desktop. Instead of giving you a big full-screen window, the game sits along the bottom of your screen allowing you to carry on with whatever you're doing while also keeping an eye on your little people.</p>
<p>"Like any city-builder, you get to make the big decisions, while also being able to take control of your own sword wielding character. You can join in the battles, harvest resources, put out fires, or interact with your villagers. In Desktopia, you can be as active, or as idle, as you want!"</p>
<p>You can see the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cGCWSWy4Jnk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6b5806ae2efc9f04fc8548642c6cf9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cGCWSWy4Jnk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Also, as a basic demo of how it would work on your actual desktop, they have a video on that too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uw7sz1pA9Ys"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/460346435f22a746d343f4fd4924c8c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uw7sz1pA9Ys" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A completely original approach in PC gaming: designed with functionality in mind, Desktopia allows you to use your PC for multiple purposes on a single monitor.</li>
<li>Clever UI: with resizeable pop-out windows which can be arranged anywhere on your screen.</li>
<li>A playable character which levels with your village, so you can jump into the action whenever you want.</li>
<li>Detailed logs and statistics arrayed in beautiful charts and graphs.</li>
<li>Spy Mode: focus the camera on any villager, any time, and watch as they live their life.</li>
<li>Resizeable game world, with the option to have it 'always on top' of other windows.</li>
<li>From nothing: grow a series of villages along a dangerous and treacherous road: from a single house to a bustling metropolis.</li>
<li>Construct a range of facilities (inns, libraries, post offices, temples, blacksmiths etc) and watch villagers move in independently.</li>
<li>Keep your villagers happy to collect gratitude, and use it to host festivals which bedeck your village in bunting!</li>
<li>Recruit and upgrade soldiers to defend your village from undead, bandits, fairies, and demons. Join them in battle if that's your thing!</li>
<li>Hire heroes to lead the charge against your foes and destroy their strongholds.</li>
<li>Decide on building low-tech villages with few needs, or risk it big by aiming for high-tech villages with needy villagers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Denuvo announced Denuvo SecureDLC to protect DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Denuvo is not exactly something any gamer I've ever seen be happy about and now it's growing and will likely appear in more games, with the announcement of Denuvo SecureDLC.</p>
<p>Irdeto said in the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/30/2471835/0/en/Denuvo-by-Irdeto-launches-Denuvo-SecureDLC-the-industry-s-first-solution-to-protect-downloadable-content-against-piracy.html" target="_blank">press release</a> it's "the first of its kind in the gaming market and provides opportunities to extend the revenue tail for developers and publishers past the initial launch window".</p>
<p>The main target here appears to be free to play games that offer up DLC and micro-transactions to unlock various features, cosmetics and so on with SecureDLC being positioned to protect against piracy there. So Irdeto are hoping that developers will pick SecureDLC to deal with it apparently becoming "easy to bypass the existing barriers that try to secure DLCs on popular gaming platforms like Steam and Epic" as they found "players can automatically generate and install programs that access downloadable content without paying for it".</p>
<p>According to Reinhard Blaukovitsch, Managing Director at Denuvo by Irdeto, the new technology is already being successfully used with the current Denuvo Anti-Tamper clients: “Denuvo has become a one-stop shop for game developers to ensure the safety of their game against cheating, tampering, and piracy and to protect the gaming experience. Our current clients, big and small, are ecstatic with the results and we are happy to help them maximize revenue and also enable new business models for these games they spent so much effort building.”</p>

      <title>Play as a sarcastic cow in the comedy adventure A Trail of Ooze </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Trail of Ooze is an upcoming comedy adventure where you take on the role of a sarcastic cow who attempts to find their missing human farmer. It honestly sounds quite hilarious and the story sounds like something that I feel I need to play through.</p>
<p>"Majros, the cow, lives on a small farm in the middle of the Swedish forests oblivious to the struggles of the outside world - until genetically engineered chemicals spread across the farm. All animals and plants mutate and gain human-like consciousness and the farmer, who witnessed it all, is kidnapped by agents from the evil agrochemical corporation. So, Majros sets out on a rescue mission following a trail of the chemical ooze. On her adventure she unravels conspiracies, battles social injustices and comes face to face with environmental disaster. Forced to leave her safe bubble, Majros learns that no cow or story is only black and white and that she cannot make it alone against the insidious corporation."</p>

      <title>itch.io are hosting a big Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade in the USA that threatens to remove access to abortions a bunch of indie developers have pulled together to make an <a href="https://itch.io/b/1472/indie-bundle-for-abortion-funds" target="_blank">Indie Bundle for Abortion Funds</a> on itch.io.</p>
<p>Much like itch.io did with previous charity bundles like for Racial Justice and Equality, Palestinian Aid, Ukraine Relief and others all the funds will be going to select charities and you can donate while also grabbing a big bunch of games, game assets, physical games to print and much more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>100% of the proceeds from this bundle will go to the National Network for Abortion Fund's <a href="http://nnaf.org/collectivepowerfund" target="_blank">Collective Power Fund</a>, which moves money <em><strong>directly</strong></em> to abortion funds across 20+ U.S. states, with a particular focus on the South and Midwest (where it is often most difficult to get access to abortions). NNAF’s partnerships with these abortion funds provide direct resources and funds to many of the people most impacted by Roe v. Wade, towards immediate action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of what's included is pretty great too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haque</li>
<li>Pushamo</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw</li>
<li>Bleed</li>
<li>Bleed 2</li>
<li>Buck Up and Drive!</li>
<li>Calico</li>
<li>…and the list goes on</li>
</ul>
<p>It has a minimum payment of $10 but you can donate more and they will be adding more items to the bundle up to July 6th. The bundle runs for another 9 days.</p>
