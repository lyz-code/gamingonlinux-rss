      <title>Moonring is a free Ultima-like RPG from the Fable co-creator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a really fun one I came across recently - it's called Moonring, a retro-inspired open-world, turn-based, tile RPG in the style of the classic Ultima games with lots of modern touches from the co-creator of Fable, Dene Carter.</p>
<p>Plays great on Linux with the latest Proton 8. Click and play! Seems like a really good choice if you're stuck for something to play this weekend!</p>

<p>The Story: "Five hundred years ago, the land of Caldera was plunged into endless darkness. Decades later, five moons rose in the sky, bringing light to the world and strange Gods with it. With them came the Dreams: calls to Devotion promising supernatural Gifts.</p>
<p>Thus, the new Calderan civilisation was born; a world of Devotion and Dreamers, Gods and Gifts, with a Dreamless Archon acting as the Gods' mortal representative. But Archons are not eternal, and a successor must be found.</p>
<p>You are Dreamless: free to choose your own destiny, to ask questions others dare not, or even become Archon yourself.</p>
<p>What will you do, Dreamless one?"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6220891691696605273gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6220891691696605273gol1.jpg"/></a>My character went a little bit insane…</em></p>
<p>Pretty wild that something this interesting is free. Would have quite happily paid for this. Getting quite a Caves of Qud kinda vibe from it. Retro but quite modern at the same time thanks to an easy to understand interface. Plus the setting and visuals are really great if you love the classic style of it.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large, hand-designed open world.</li>
<li>An infinite supply of dungeons generated using your character name.</li>
<li>Over 100 varied enemy types, from fodder to bosses.</li>
<li>35 unique Gifts from the Gods, their usage changing with the moon phases.</li>
<li>Sailing, ship-to-ship combat and boarding.</li>
<li>A Dungeon Synth OST with over 50 tracks, all made using retro Mod Trackers!</li>
<li>A hidden magic system and many other mysteries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373630/Moonring/" target="_blank">free on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Shadows of the Afterland looks a bit Thimbleweed Park</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looking a little like Thimbleweed Park from Terrible Toybox, the developer Aruma Studios recently announced Shadows of the Afterland, a supernatural comedy adventure about identity, courage and destiny. This is Aruma Studios' second game, with their first Intruder In Antiquonia released last year.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty wild too, could be a good one for adventure game fans: "You can’t remember your death; you haven’t even been born yet. In this point-and-click adventure, you'll switch between worlds and take possession of the living to unearth your haunting past. You'll have to confront sinister forces to find out if you are merely a pawn of fate or if you can change your own future."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QTxr7FQXTLg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/819a40f5267844954efe29702dc15365.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QTxr7FQXTLg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a supernatural murder mystery, blending themes of identity, courage, and destiny with afterlife, reincarnation, and the connection between past and future lives.</li>
<li>Take command of various playable characters using unique possession mechanics.</li>
<li>Explore the intricate stories of eccentric afterlife spirits through meaningful conversations.</li>
<li>Tackle clever and logically sound puzzles intricately intertwined with the storyline. Wield magic, navigate between both realms, and employ possession mechanics to solve them.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in meticulously crafted pixel art scenes and animations.</li>
<li>Experience an original soundtrack that enhances the game's haunting atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We're thrilled to take players on this supernatural journey, where they'll have to confront their fears and make tough decisions about their destiny”, said Rubén López, who wrote the story. "We've poured our hearts into creating a hauntingly beautiful world, with meticulously crafted pixel art and a soundtrack that will send chills down your spine", said Silvia Izquierdo, who is in charge of production.</p>
<p>They also told me over email "Of course, the new game is also being developed on Linux, and will be available for Linux.".</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506100/Shadows_of_the_Afterland/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 1+2 Gets A Steam Deck Badge and Proton Hotfix</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-shreds-on-steam-deck-but-with-two-massive-caveats/" target="_blank">recently dropped on Steam</a> this week and in our opinion it's an incredible game held back by two massive issues; an always online DRM and a bugged multiplayer on Deck and Linux. While the DRM is a feature, the broken multiplayer was an actual bug as Windows players could get online just fine while Steam Deck and Linux fans were left out in the cold.</p>
<p>Luckily, it seems Valve has <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1710091010595041306" target="_blank">listened</a> to the concerns of the community and dropped a Proton Hotfix for the game last night.  I can safely report that the multiplayer now works and you can access the games full online suite on Steam Deck. Sadly, this does not mean multiplayer for all other platforms is fixed. I was only able to test the PS5 version (thank you PS Plus) and it sadly still doesn't log in. So it appears fans on other platforms are stuck with the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-unplayable-servers/" target="_blank">awful phone fix</a> I mentioned last time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/46589331696577054gol15416.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/46589331696577054gol15416.jpg"/></a>Multiplayer Gameplay on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>If you are interested in picking THPS 1+2 up on Steam Deck, Valve has rated it as <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable now. The issues holding back full verification being the need to manually pull up the keyboard and hard to read text. It does also note singleplayer gameplay requires an active internet connection too. Maybe Activsion can fix those issues and earn a full verification badge. But given how they continue to ignore the server issue on other platforms even after a year, we shouldn't get our hopes up.</p>
<p>You can pick up Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>You can also check out Liam's video for more details and gameplay. Keep in mind that Liam made this before last night's Proton Hotfix though. So it's a tad outdated in that regard, but still worth checking out:</p>

      <title>Terra Nil gets better performance and Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terra Nil, a building game about restoring nature just got upgraded with better performance they've now officially released their Native Linux and macOS versions too. I thoroughly loved the early builds of Terra Nil before they turned it into a full game, so I will at some point soon be checking it out and it seems the waiting on it has paid off with all the improvements.</p>

      <title>Retro shooter DUSK is getting a full free HD revamp</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming around the 5 year anniversary, DUSK HD is going to be a big full visual remaster of the very popular shooter so here's what they've said about it.</p>
<p>It's a free update that will update everything including enemies, weapons, all models, textures — everything they say will be improved. Around Halloween we can expect to get a trailer showcasing an on / off comparison, with a full launch along with their modding SDK and Steam Workshop support around the 5 year anniversary which would be December 10th.</p>
<p>The good news is that it will be entirely optional as the HD content will be available via the Steam Workshop as free downloads so you can keep it as it is if you prefer it. You'll be able to use the old or new HD assets for modding too and upload your own creations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="80ZFMzXGo-k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77ba5a7ba3caa6a4a3c8ad1619f6d3fe.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/80ZFMzXGo-k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Swords of Freeport is a text-mode social RPG like retro MUDs and BBS door games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this is certainly retro that slightly older readers might be interested in. Swords of Freeport is a new text-mode social RPG heavily inspired by the style of Bulletin Board System door games from back in the '90s.</p>
<p>The developer, Elissa Black, mentions they were inspired by classics like Legend of the Red Dragon. It is part MUD and part BBS Game, without the need for a BBS. While it is a single-player game it does have some social aspects like seeing other's progress via an in-game news board, you can chat using in-game message boards in taverns, you can see when others are logged in but there's no PvP - it's all for social reasons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15516225061696512306gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15516225061696512306gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retro play once-a-day style mechanics</li>
<li>Three core starting professions with options for cross-skilling</li>
<li>A whole city and the countryside around it to explore!</li>
<li>Witty, smart humour throughout the game *</li>
<li>All 24 characters and many words of the English language are used to evoke the feeling of really being in a squalid Victorian-adjacent fantasy city!</li>
<li>Addictive turn-based gameplay which limits how much time you can sink into it</li>
<li>Look, it has the Bloatalope - you want to hunt a Bloatalope, don't you? **</li>
</ul>
<p>* This is subjective, of course. But my mum thinks it's funny.</p>
<p>** That'd be something to brag about to your friends. "Gary," you'd say. "You won't BELIEVE what I hunted last night in a text game I've been addicted to!" Gary would no doubt respond with, "My goodness, Charlene, don't tell me it's a BLOATALOPE you went hunting? That's very impressive. Let me buy you a coffee!"</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress fixes crashing on Linux, gets an Adventure Mode Roadmap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Dwarf Fortress players on Steam, as a fresh update went out recently that should stop some crashing issues on Linux and there's a roadmap for the Adventure Mode to go through. If you missed it, the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/dwarf-fortress-on-steam-now-officially-available-for-linux/" target="_blank">Native Linux version was released recently</a>.</p>
<p>Firstly for the October 3rd <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3753244909556346261" target="_blank">update</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Major bug fixes</div>
<ul>
<li>Fixed crash on linux related to game log threading</li>
<li>Fixed broken tutorial on click workshop step</li>
<li>Stopped tutorial prompt in tiny worlds where tutorial is invalid</li>
<li>Cleaned up a source of squad schedule corruption</li>
<li>Made classic graphics setting work properly on restart (hopefully for real this time!)</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Other bug fixes/tweaks</div>
<ul>
<li>Fixed potential problem with doctors vs. multiple hospitals</li>
<li>Ballista arrows etc. that chop down trees now count for treecap diplomacy</li>
<li>Image sets with non-uniform types now properly display as having a variety of types</li>
<li>Generic improvements now properly display "made a masterful improvement" in histories</li>
<li>Allowed single pair dances to generate properly</li>
<li>Fixed potential minor oddity involving animal placement</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3095254361696505624gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3095254361696505624gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the Adventure Mode, from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3753244942577557600" target="_blank">roadmap</a> it's still some ways off and they're hoping to have it out "not-too-late next year". With the new art style they're starting with the basics which will be:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Travel map - we have the world map, but sites need hundreds of sprites to match up with the ASCII that shows individual streets etc. We’ll be iterating on this until launch.</li>
<li>Main interface layout - similar to Fortress Mode, there are tile-based actions, information menus, and other actions like travel. There’s also a day-night cycle and we’ll have a minimap this time around.</li>
<li>Procedural portraits - we need to implement Carolyn’s great portraits for the humans/elves/dwarves/goblins/kobolds, and also get animal people displayed. Every animal person!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They said once they're down for the framework, they will work on supporting mouse and keyboard for all play styles. They say it will be quite challenging though, since there's so many ways people can interact with it from clicking around the play area, through buttons and hotkeys or via full lists. Several actions for each.</p>
<p>After that they also have to go through and implement a lot more like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Inventory - equipping items and containers are the trickiest parts here. You can wear multiple shirts and nest containers as deep as you like, and the new interface will have to handle this with both keyboard and mouse support.</li>
<li>Combat (striking and wrestling) - wrestling will be a bit of a doozy, as there’s a lot of physical/anatomical complexity that we’re not sure how best to communicate</li>
<li>Conversations - this includes supporting the current Adventure Mode system of interleaving speech and actions, and having three or more participants in conversations</li>
<li>Character generator - you can make a whole party in Adventure Mode and the character creation options are complex. We have to update this system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's more so read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3753244942577557600" target="_blank">roadmap</a> if you're interested. Work on the Fortress Mode also continues in parallel, as they're working on multiple big features of the game at the same time.</p>

      <title>Valve fix up more SteamVR 2.0 Beta issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After once again <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/steam-beta-and-vr-updated-its-now-safe-to-take-off-your-headset-valve/" target="_blank">making it safe to take off your headset</a>, Valve put up another SteamVR 2.0 Beta update focused on fixing up more problems and hopefully making it work better.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250820/view/3726222710133084160" target="_blank">latest changes</a> from October 4th:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">SteamVR:</div>
<ul>
<li>Show Multitasking View button on Desktop windows.</li>
<li>Fixed scaling issues with floating dashboard overlays.</li>
<li>Fix for SetSkyboxOverride always showing only the last texture.</li>
<li>Speed up initial load of all web views (settings, etc.)</li>
<li>Fix issues caused by running vrstartup from a different SteamVR install when SteamVR is already running.</li>
<li>Further laser pointer double-click refinements.</li>
<li>Laser pointer no longer jumps when you switch input devices.</li>
<li>Laser pointer is more consistent when dragging outside of overlays.</li>
<li>Typing emojis works in Desktop view.</li>
<li>Move Dashboard slightly further away.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Linux:</div>
<ul>
<li>Fix new VR gamepad UI rendering with a flipped Y-axis.</li>
<li>Fix runtime configuration to launch in Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (sniper), addressing startup issues on some systems.</li>
<li>Fix vrcompositor to launch under legacy scout runtime, addressing startup issues on some systems.</li>
<li>Fix SteamVR Home to launch under legacy scout runtime.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, their changes still don't seem to have solved SteamVR 2.0 Beta working for me, it just won't load up as noted in <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/618" target="_blank">this bug report</a>. Hopefully Valve will find the cause of what's stopping it working on some Linux systems like mine, so I can actually go through full testing of it with my Index because otherwise it's an expensive paperweight right now.</p>
<p>Is it working for you? How have you been getting on with SteamVR 2.0 Beta? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>We may see a Steam Deck refresh with WiFi 6E</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we know that Valve have said repeatedly not to expect a faster Steam Deck 2 any time soon, it appears they may still be doing some kind of refreshed Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This isn't all that surprising though as Valve have been doing a number of tweaks to the internals of the Steam Deck since the original release. We've seen the different fans with one having that annoying high-pitched whine, different types of SSDs, and even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/12oit67/pictures_of_new_steam_deck_motherboardthermal/" target="_blank">adjustments</a> to the internals.</p>
<p>Now as <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1709643696302346305" target="_blank">noted</a> on X by Brad Lynch, Valve appears to have gone through approvals for a change to the WiFi chip inside the Steam Deck with one that supports WiFi 6E with Dual Band Simultaneous (DBS) and Bluetooth 5.2. Here's two of the images mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5892309961696502546gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5892309961696502546gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8514409701696502755gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8514409701696502755gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Various documents about this can be quite easily found via search engines, <a href="https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/XMR2023FC66EB" target="_blank">like this</a> that lists plenty including the first shot above taken from <a href="https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/XMR2023FC66EB/6729320.pdf" target="_blank">this document</a>.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens here. There's so many ways that Valve could refresh the Steam Deck, without changing the main performance profile with the APU that would be worth upgrading. Imagine a better WiFi chip, a better screen, better battery, updated thermals and more — so many areas Valve could improve on for a mid-gen refresh that would be worth picking up.</p>
<p>Eventually we should find out what <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/more-teasers-appear-for-upcoming-valve-hardware/" target="_blank">Galileo and Sephiroth</a> are that was leaked before. Perhaps it's related to this? What do you think Valve are doing?</p>

      <title>Diablo 4 is coming to Steam on October 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not long after Overwatch 2 released on Steam, we now have Diablo 4 confirmed to be launching on Steam making it easier than ever to play on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. One less reason to boot up and configure Battle.net — hooray!</p>
<p>At least with it being on Steam, the install for Linux desktop and Steam Deck is about to get a whole lot easier. No more messing around with Battle.net directly, it will just be click and play on Steam thanks to Proton. If you're going to play it that is, because you're not still playing Baldur's Gate 3 right? Or Starfield? Or one of the many other interesting game launches this year.</p>
<p>What's surprising though is that Diablo 4 is coming to Steam only a few months after release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13214677671696449047gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13214677671696449047gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Perhaps this might go a little better than the Overwatch 2 Steam release, which quickly (at the time) <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/overwatch-2-becomes-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam/" target="_blank">became the worst ever reviewed game on Valve's store</a>. OW2 briefly lost the crown, but it appears according to <a href="https://steam250.com/bottom100" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a>, it is once again the #1 worst rated Steam game.</p>
<p>The Steam release for Diablo 4 will come at the same time as the Season of Blood update, with patch notes coming on October 10th ahead of the October 17th release on Steam.</p>
<p>Blizzard confirmed on Steam it will have Steam Achievements and integration with Steam Friends, so you can invite people directly to play. Doesn't seem like there's any chance of transferring to Steam if you purchased on Battle.net though, annoyingly.</p>
<p>You can see a previous video I did on Diablo 4 for Steam Deck below:</p>

      <title>EarthBound / Mother styled Dreamed Away has a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shown off during the recent "<a href="https://mother4ever.net/mother-direct/" target="_blank">Mother Direct</a>" event that pulled together various games in the spirit of EarthBound / Mother, a new fancy trailer for Dreamed Away appeared. Watch it quick before you wake up. In development by Nicolas Petton, with publishing help from Pineapple Works it will have Native Linux support at release made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dreamed Away is a story-driven action-adventure RPG with dark elements set in France in the 90s. Play as Théo, a boy lost in a mysterious world. Explore a unique reality, duel against darkness and mind your choices."</p>
<p>It does away with turn-based menu-picking combat found in many other similar RPGs, and instead gives you a fast-paced mini-game system with each enemy having different variations of dodging and time-based mini-games of increasing complexity. You have no magic, no weapons and there's no random encounters - it's all about your skill.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M_msYzID_7c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54fe9e70c188a9876e65d8e77c060476.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M_msYzID_7c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since I last wrote directly about it the developer has put up a few upgrades to the demo that's available too that adds in a new title screen, new translations, improved combat balancing, lots of bug fixes, UI improvements, dialogue improvements and more.</p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Immersive storytelling that takes you on a journey to solve Théo's dark and unsettling mystery.</li>
<li>Diverse setting: varied colors and environments that bring you from a vibrant, peaceful atmosphere to those dark and mysterious places.</li>
<li>Detailed and aesthetic pixel art setting that is worth exploring.</li>
<li>An original soundtrack by Nicolas Petton.</li>
<li>Unique skill-based combat system.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From what the developer explained previously about the inspiration for the story: Dreamed Away is more than just a game. It’s an intense reflection of the developer's own story, born at the same time as his second child. The game's world is built around the main character, Theo, and his bond with his sister Louise as well as his desire to find and reconnect with her. The story takes place in a cozy little village in Brittany, where the surroundings tell you a story about a safe, calm, and happy place. But mystery steps in. A darkness is encroaching. It's unsettled, shady. It's a game about a young boy questioning his sense of reality and sanity. While trapped alone in a world where he constantly faces his fears. Such an experience of internalizing doubts and fears is how the game was born.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Iron Roads, a train network transport sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cowleyfornia Studios who previously made Sarawak and We'll always have Paris are branching out from their adventure novel roots into a train management sim with Iron Roads. There's a new demo available and it will be released in 2024 with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Inspired in parts by OpenTTD, Mini Metro, Two Point Hospital, Lets Build a Zoo and Opus Magnum - this husband and wife team are hoping you might find their latest idea interesting. After checking the demo, I can certainly see a hint of both OpenTTD and Mini Metro inside Iron Roads.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AyUBIn83E50"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b9414cb87bb730ef0ede9f1aeb8ac58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AyUBIn83E50" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Current Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transport passengers or cargo, earn money and complete tasks</li>
<li>Enjoy a minimalistic interface that is easy to learn, but that allows for many happy hours optimising and building your networks</li>
<li>Scenarios: handcrafted maps with geographical puzzles designed to stretch your network-building skills</li>
<li>Accept contracts: scenarios come with a grant system where you can follow focussed goals if you wish to earn extra money and get the satisfaction of ticking off a to-do list</li>
<li>Performance graphs: The main goal of Iron Roads is to optimise your network, so you may wish to use the charts to analyse data relating to your finances and passengers</li>
<li>Build large, complex networks. Or small-to-medium sized networks, if that's what floats your boat</li>
</ul>
<p>Planned to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandbox mode: eventually you'll be able to generate random maps</li>
<li>Numerous scenarios: right now there are two scenarios and a tutorial in the demo. Iron Roads is being developed by only two developers, so while we’re working as hard as we can, please bear with us as we</li>
<li>Signals: Train orders such as one-way zones, non-stop zones, and waypoints replace traditional signals in Iron Roads. The idea is that you can do everything that signals can do, but without the steep learning curve</li>
</ul>

      <title>Farming sim with dinosaurs &#39;Paleo Pines&#39; is out now - Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Farming and dinosaurs, that's certainly an odd combination but Paleo Pines looks cute as heck and seems to be another nice title to add to your casual gaming collection. A sweet family-friendly game. The release comes with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>More about it: "Set off on a lively adventure with your dino pal, Lucky, who you’ve known since she was just an egg. Is she the last of her kind? The other parasaurolophus are missing, and it's up to you and Lucky to uncover their whereabouts. Explore Paleo Pines, a charming island filled with friendly townsfolk and hidden corners. Build a new home, make friends, and unravel the island's lost history. Get ready for a journey filled with delightful discoveries alongside your trusty steed Lucky!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qEafzEOzDB4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0f7e3a0b81e681bdc9b73c2e5f71964f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qEafzEOzDB4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has gained a Very Positive rating on Steam so it seems most players are really enjoying it. Good to see more developers also ensuring good Linux support with Steam Deck Verified too! I'll admit that this one somehow flew under my radar, with the release on September 26th and it seems a lot of other skipped over it too with less than 400 user reviews so far.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1202200/Paleo_Pines/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta and VR updated, &#39;it&#39;s now safe to take off your headset&#39; - Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has pushed out more Steam Client Beta and SteamVR updates, along with a funny note about the SteamVR update for a bit of a woops in the UI.</p>
<p>You see, Valve recently gave <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steamvr-20-bet-released-with-a-big-ui-overhaul/" target="_blank">SteamVR a big 2.0 Beta upgrade</a> but they forgot to add an exit button. I know, the horror right? Being trapped in VR like something out of Sword Art Online. Don't panic though because Valve has once again begun allowing you to leave the VR world as it's back in the most recent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/3726223344808421297" target="_blank">update</a> as noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">General:</div>
<ul>
<li>Support for multi-gpu system (e.g. laptops) which was causing the new Steam UI to not show up.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Steam Dashboard overlay:</div>
<ul>
<li>Filtered out vr overlay apps from recent games list.</li>
<li>Fixed auto switching to game details page on launch.</li>
<li>Never auto switch to app details page on launch for vr overlay apps.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Dashboard:</div>
<ul>
<li>Restored the dashboard button to exit VR. It's now safe to take off your headset.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18258244511696420181gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18258244511696420181gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Yes, it's a joke about classic Windows.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the recent Steam Beta Client <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3718341410781068036" target="_blank">update</a> is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">General</div>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with art for some games not properly updating. A client restart may be required for some art changes to fully appear.</li>
<li>Fixed some DLC art displaying in the wrong language.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Linux</div>
<ul>
<li>Include 64 bit openvr_api.so, enabling the new VR gamepad UI in SteamVR beta.</li>
<li>Improve screen reader support.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Steam Input</div>
<ul>
<li>Added "World Space" Experimental Gyro Conversion Mode. This modes feels similar to using a laser pointer. It monitors rotation about the gravity axis to determine both horizontal and vertical output. Some may prefer "Player Space" which is a hybrid of world yaw and local pitch.</li>
<li>Fix for "Player Space" Gyro Conversion Mode. Gravity axis is now reliable.</li>
<li>"Pixels Per 360°" Setting value is now copied within the current Action Set rather than across the entire steam input config. This is an accommodation for games with different turning rates in different gameplay states (i.e. Vehicle Mode vs On Foot mode may have a different camera turn rate).</li>
<li>Partial Regression fix for older Gyro "As Joystick" modes, but there are still known issues. Renovation is planned.</li>

<p>So now the new SteamVR UI should work properly on Linux. If you can get the SteamVR Beta to work at all that is, because for me and others it is <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/618" target="_blank">entirely broken</a> and won't launch at all now.</p>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 1+2 Shreds On Steam Deck, But With Two Massive Caveats</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In case you missed <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-finally-coming-to-steam/" target="_blank">the news</a> from last week, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 launched on Steam this week after three years in Epic Games Store limbo. While it is currently listed as unverified on Steam Deck, testing on my behalf has shown the game to run smoothly out of the box with no need to change proton version or modify launch options. Honestly I wouldn't be shocked if Valve slaps it with a Steam Deck Playable badge in the future. I would actually highly recommend THPS 1+2 for any PC Gamer or Deck owner, if it weren't for two massive glaring issues.</p>
<p>Before we get to that, we should talk about the performance on Steam Deck. Which initially worried me as the main menu hovered around 50fps. There also aren't a lot of graphical settings to change in order to optimize performance. Though the game does give you an auto-detect tool to allow the game to auto-tailor the settings to your hardware, in this case the Steam Deck. Using this gave the Deck settings almost identical to the medium preset with the exception of anti-aliasing being set to TAA as opposed to FXAA.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2562284581696376062gol15416.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="THPS 1+2's Autodetect Config For Steam Deck" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2562284581696376062gol15416.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Pictured: THPS 1+2's Autodetect Settings For Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Luckily the menu is either glitched or intentionally frame-limited, as starting a skate park run caused an immediate jump to 60fps and it didn't drop with few exceptions. Those exceptions would be Unreal Engine 4's dreaded shader compilation, though I was unable to replicate those dips on subsequent runs. THPS 1+2 ran smooth as butter afterwards and it was  basically a non-issue by the time I was ready to stress test the game on Deck.</p>
<p>For the stress test I wanted to run the Skater Heaven level that's exclusive to the remake as it is full of various effects that would surely tax performance. But that requires finishing the entirety of a Skate Tour in THPS 2, which would take too long for our purposes. So I settled for using THPS 1's Downhill Jam and hitting every valve on my way down, which causes water to come gushing out in various locations.</p>
<p>And to my surprise, the game barely dropped below 60fps. The Deck managing to maintain a lock even as I was speeding downhill with water gushing out of the walls. The only time it did drop was, you guessed it, shader compilation. The good news there being that attempts to replicate the dips proved unsuccessful so it really is just a one time thing. But it is worth being aware of.</p>
<p>Once you overcome the shader compilation, the Deck version of THPS 1+2 body slams the Switch version, which was the only portable way to play out of the box until now. The Switch couldn't maintain a 30fps lock while the Deck shreds through a 60fps lock.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6542728911696376086gol15416.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="THPS1's Downhill Jam On Steam Deck" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6542728911696376086gol15416.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Pictured: THPS 1's Downhill Jam On Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Sadly, the shader compilation is neither of the major caveats I mentioned earlier. I would be more than happy to recommend THPS 1+2 to every Steam Deck owner and PC Gamer if minor shader compilation was the only issue. No, the real issues are a constant always online requirement combined with, bizarrely enough, the fact that the actual online features for this game haven't worked for almost a year. And this isn't a PC issue either, every platforms online is broken despite the official site <a href="https://support.activision.com/fi/onlineservices.Tony%20Hawk%27s%20Pro%20Skater%201%20+%202.html" target="_blank">claiming the servers are up</a>. That's right, Activision created Schrodinger's online server; where it is both alive and dead. Although, in this case, the Steam release from Steam forum reports <em>seems</em> better (other platforms still broken) but it doesn't work on Linux / Steam Deck still.</p>
<p>The worst part is that we have a good idea as to what's causing the problem; NAT Type 2 is blocked from accessing everything but the online check in. You can get around this by doing a <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-unplayable-servers/" target="_blank">complicated maneuver on your phone</a>, which you shouldn't have to do. Honestly, this issue should have been fixed months ago and the fact that the online doesn't work for most people holds me back from a glowing recommendation. I was hoping they would fix it for the Steam release but no, it's still not fixed. Frankly, it is a massive bummer on an otherwise stellar release. Just to rub salt in the wound there's also an achievement for playing a multiplayer match.</p>
<p>If the bugged online doesn't worry you, or if it's fixed in the future, then I would highly recommend Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2. It's an excellent remake of two excellent games and on Steam Deck it is easier than ever to pick up and do a quick skate park run. THPS 1+2 has the Persona 5 Royal effect where you can quickly hop in for 5 minutes and feel like you accomplished something.</p>
<p>If you can look past its online issues, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 is a Steam Deck killer app. Pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Puny Human closing after a client &#39;refused previously agreed-upon payments&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some more sad industry news here as developer Puny Human put out a press release noting that they're closing up, citing an unnamed client that refused to pay them. They're on track to remove all full-time positions before the year is up, while also liquidating any assets left by including selling them off and open sourcing certain others.</p>
<p>Puny Human created Dystopia, Blade Symphony and Galacide. They also worked with other developers on titles including Trover Saves the Universe, Wasteland 3, The Bard’s Tale IV, Tribes of Midgard, The Callisto Protocol and <a href="https://punyhuman.com/projects/" target="_blank">various others</a>.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://punyhuman.com/closure-press-release/" target="_blank">press release </a>their CEO Mike Sanders noted how "Unfortunately, a client refused previously agreed-upon payments, which deprived us of the cash flow to fully pitch our in-progress title and triggered successive failures in our operating income. I take full responsibility for not sufficiently preparing for this outcome". The press release also notes they were looking to work on a spiritual successor to Dystopia, titled Zero Day, with hopes to "secure venture capital funding by quarter 2 of 2023".</p>
<p>Shame to see, there's been an increasing amount of companies being shut or laying off lots of staff and it seems it's set to continue.</p>
<p><em>A more <a href="https://punyhuman.com/closure/" target="_blank">personal letter</a> was also released.</em></p>

      <title>Superhero strategy game Capes has a big new demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capes is an upcoming tactical strategy game from Spitfire Interactive and Daedalic Entertainment. Due out in 2024, a new demo has been put up with expanded and improved mechanics to play through.</p>
<p>A game where fans of XCOM will apparently feel right at home, I'm certainly excited to see this and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/squad-tactics-heist-rpg-cyber-knights-flashpoint-launches-october-17th/" target="_blank">Cyber Knights: Flashpoint</a> release. The story in Capes follows on twenty years from where supervillians won, creating a dystopian city where developing superpowers is a crime and no one has dared oppose them. So naturally you're going to build a team of heroes and take back the city.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/811168531696343799gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/811168531696343799gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new demo includes 4 missions along with the ability to fast-forward gameplay during enemy turns, a quick save option, difficulty settings, improved cinematics, an improved UI, improved gamepad support and additional language support. Quite a big upgrade for it.</p>
<p>Additionally they're doing a new video series leading up to the release with the first episode out now:</p>

      <title>The explosive Ion Fury: Aftershock expansion is now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Voidpoint and 3D Realms have now released the explosive Ion Fury: Aftershock expansion, giving you more of the good stuff from the original game to blast through as Shelly "Bombshell" Harrison.</p>
<p>The release came as a bit of a surprise, only being announced during Realms Deep 2023 over the weekend to arrive yesterday October 2nd. 3D Realms sent over a key, so I've had a run through and as expected — it works beautifully on Linux with their Native Linux build. It's also rated Steam Deck Playable with the Linux version too! Featuring a campaign over half the size of the original game with new weapons, new enemies, new zones, a hoverbike and even an "Arrange Mode".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="c49Zj6E_u98"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dea6d90c4caab0eb1a04a2668ed5e457.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/c49Zj6E_u98" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Arrange Mode is an Aftershock remix of the original campaign, basically a "hard mode" where you can expect to find much more of a challenge with hectic enemies. Maps are mirrored and hand-tweaked, to adjust the progression a little too - so good fun to run through again in a different way if you enjoyed the original.</p>
<p>From what the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well it took some time but we’re finally here!</p>
<p>We’re incredibly proud of what we accomplished here by not just pushing what we could out of the engine but also utilizing all the lessons and systems we built for Ion Fury back in 2019.</p>
<p>To us it truly feels like an evolution of the ideas and mechanics along with revisiting many things we wanted to include in the game originally but weren’t able to.</p>
<p>What started yet again as a quick 5 map level pack with a few textures and a new enemy thrown in morphed into its own proper campaign with thousands of new textures, full soundtrack, plot bits and other bobs more worthy for a sequel. We’re sorry it took this long :)</p>
<p>Hope sincerely hope you’ll have a blast with Aftershock!</p>
<cite>Voidpoint</cite></blockquote>
<p>If you love your retro explosive first-person shooters, it continues to be one of the best made in recent years and this expansion is simply a must have addition to the game. Really does bring back memories of sitting at my late Grandad's PC playing through Duke Nukem and other such shooters. <em>Only now I suck a little less…</em></p>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588720/Ion_Fury_Aftershock/" target="_blank">Steam</a> with a 10% discount until October 9th. Seems the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/ion_fury_aftershock" target="_blank">GOG</a> release is delayed a bit.</p>

      <title>Creature-growing survival game Sipho 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Climb to the top of the food chain in Sipho, a game about building up a creature with zooids. After being in Early Access since late 2018 it's finally done and hit the 1.0 release. It features Native Linux support too. Inspired by real life Zooids, a complicated creature that forms up part of a colony so Sipho takes this idea and blends it into a rogue-lite underwater survival of the fittest.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7422648931696327115gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7422648931696327115gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Starting off small, you gradually grow and build up your creature with various zooids, each of them specialising in a different function. Some eat food, some help you move, some are for offensive moves and more. Naturally, there's plenty of hazards to be found, and there's always a bigger fish…</p>
<p>I've played it on and off over the years and always loved the idea, and it always worked well too.</p>

      <title>Old-school immersive sim Core Decay looks great in the new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this looks exciting. Taking inspiration from the likes of Deus Ex, the old-school atmospheric immersive sim Core Decay had a new trailer during Realms Deep 2023. Coming from Ivar Hill, Slipgate Ironworks and 3D Realms, last I heard it will have Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>More about it: "The year is 2089. For decades past, the availability of natural resources and livable conditions has declined to the point of societal collapse. Nations have made room for city-states and corporations, and the planet is on the brink of an ecological collapse that will leave nothing left alive.</p>
<p>During mankind’s last breath arises a shadowy network of conspirators, bent on saving the human species using any means necessary – even if it means sacrificing all it means to be alive.</p>
<p>Follow the trails of a mysterious organization across a dying Earth, in an atmospheric singleplayer adventure spanning seven locations across six continents."</p>

      <title>Gearbits is one to watch for mech combat fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your mech combat? Keep an eye on the upcoming low-poly indie game Gearbits. A 3D action game where you pilot a giant robot that looks very much like it's out of Gundam or Armored Core.</p>
<p>Fight off various giant insects and enemy pilots, while you also get to customize your machine. After a successful early Alpha demo on <a href="https://quackpond-games.itch.io/gearbits-test-site" target="_blank">itch.io</a> it's also coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2506580/Gearbits/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on October 10th. Have a look at the recent trailer posted below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6UNzdOsescQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fb89ca6fa85cb83b8235dd01fd8a6de2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6UNzdOsescQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast paced single player experience - Your robot has rocket thrusters that allow you to fly across the battlefield and rain fire on the enemy. But watch that you don’t overheat! You’ll be an easy target on the ground.</li>
<li>20 Mission story campaign - The story campaign places you into the far future, on a distant colony world. Enemy pilots and swarms of giant insects stand in your way, as you try to complete the various objectives along the story campaign that spans 20 missions.</li>
<li>10 Unique giant robots to unlock and play as - The game contains 10 units, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Select a machine with outstanding firepower or run circles around the enemy with your superior manoeuvrability.</li>
<li>Large weapon selection - Over 30 unique weapons to choose from. Equip a missile launcher, a rail gun or a massive beam cannon. You can build a game breaking winning combo, or set up a gimmicky loadout for a challenge run.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Tiny Atolls is a comfy and relaxing minimalist city-builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tiny Atolls is a new release from developer MONKE, this is actually the same developer as BRUTE FORCE under a different name who made the dynamic physics platformer Crumble. If you enjoyed games like Dorfromantik, this is probably your kind of jam. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "TINY ATOLLS is a minimalist building strategy game Expand across colorful islands, unlock new tiles and complete quests! TINY ATOLLS centers around the art of forging meaningful connections between different types and colors. The higher the number of connections you establish, the greater your score and the more tiles you can strategically position."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1M5FxNfhpb4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9574954a70b38c9df0615ab4cbcff986.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1M5FxNfhpb4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently, at least with an AMD GPU, the graphics are a little <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19456209621696249711gol1.jpeg" target="_blank">broken</a> on the Linux version. Forcing Proton 8.0-3 fixes it though, but since they're selling and advertising a Linux build, hopefully they will fix it. The bug has been <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246640/discussions/0/3881597253359320807/" target="_blank">reported</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully the visuals and performance with Proton are just fine, so I could go through and enjoy some time with it and it really is quite lovely. Gorgeous minimal visuals, with a peaceful soundtrack and learn as you go gameplay while you continue to place down tiles, get combinations and expand across different islands to increase your score. It definitely needs a little more guidance though, as currently it just throws you into it which the developer already confirmed a tutorial is going to be added in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13546792661696251095gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13546792661696251095gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You also can't save and continue your game just yet. So it's perhaps a little under-baked for the Early Access release, but a wonderful slice of what's to come from another great-looking casual game.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246640/Tiny_Atolls/" target="_blank">Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Thrilling shooter Selaco hits Early Access in May 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some awesome demos, the GZDoom powered shooter Selaco is coming to Early Access on Steam in May 2024 and it also has a new trailer along with info on what to expect from it.</p>
<p>More about it: "Selaco is a brand new original shooter running on GZDoom, featuring thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart AI and a fleshed out story taking place within an immersive game world. It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing traditional retro-FPS elements from QUAKE and DOOM, along with some more modern features. Together with professional artists who work in the industry, several having worked on successful throwback FPS games in the past, Selaco is a fully fleshed out world full of character, action, and mystery."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nUbF8Ytadx0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f9d495c1130ff6c161a0637adada5e7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nUbF8Ytadx0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What to expect in the initial EA launch:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>25 levels. For comparison, the demo had 3.</li>
<li>11 weapons, 10 of which will be upgradable with new stats, abilities and Alternate Fire Modes.</li>
<li>Dynamic encounters with reactive combatants.</li>
<li>Heavy emphasis on exploration and worldbuilding.</li>
<li>A large number of secrets and unlockables.</li>
<li>Intense combat and effects taking inspiration from John Woo movies.</li>
<li>A wide range of environmental variety where no two levels look the same.</li>
<li>Full modding support.</li>
<li>Gamepad &amp; Steam Deck support.</li>
<li>A synth-heavy soundtrack composed to Lawrence Steele.</li>
<li>Very kind robots who clean up your mess you've created.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See the full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/3740859408902729558" target="_blank">announcement here</a>. This will easily be one of my favourite releases next year, I absolutely loved blasting through the demo and with a <em>lot</em> more content coming it's going to be awesome. Full modding support should be fun too given how impressive the game is - can't wait to see what people add to it.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and it will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>September 2023 Steam Survey: macOS and Linux dip but Linux remains above macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for September 2023 is out now and shows that both macOS and Linux have dipped down, although Linux still remains above macOS. With this being the second month a row where the overall Linux share dipped, and September had Linux dip more than macOS even though Linux remains higher overall.</p>
<p>Latest stats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.94% +0.33%</li>
<li>Linux 1.63% -0.19%</li>
<li>macOS 1.43% -0.14%</li>
</ul>
<p>As shown on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7245415901696244521gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7245415901696244521gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>One of the potential reasons here is that Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam has risen two months in a row as well with September 2023 showing it now at 32.22% +5.36%. We often see Linux dip when there's bigger rises in Simplified Chinese.</p>
<p>The current most popular Linux distros on Steam are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 43.04% -1.14%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 8.09% +0.41%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 6.49% +3.58%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.91% -0.08%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 3.67% +0.26%</li>
<li>Other 34.79% +10.01%</li>

      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection multiplayer fixed for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After 10 days of waiting, 343 Industries / Xbox Game Studios finally again fixed up the online multiplayer for Halo: The Master Chief Collection on Linux desktop and Steam Deck after breaking it.</p>
<p>Their developers hooked up support for it originally <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/halo-the-master-chief-collection-gets-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">back in April</a>, and then broke it with the September 19th update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/halo-the-master-chief-collection-multiplayer-seems-broken-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">that I reported on previously</a>. Their official support account on X has now <a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1707796023194874102" target="_blank">confirmed</a> as of September 29th that it is fixed again and it seems they also finally after ~6 months fixed the launch options being backwards.</p>
<p>Steam Deck screenshot taken today playing online:</p>

<p>Both were using Proton 8.0-3 so it's working fine now.</p>

      <title>Snap store from Canonical hit with malicious apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical are currently dealing with a security incident with the <a href="https://snapcraft.io/store" target="_blank">Snap store</a>, after users noticed multiple fake apps were uploaded so temporary limits have been put in place.</p>
<p>A post on the Snapcraft Discourse forum <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/fake-crypto-apps/37070" target="_blank">noted</a> three "Fake Crypto Apps" had appeared on the store, with the user mentioning they "steal funds from user accounts". Canonical reacted pretty quickly removing them, and the packages get replaced with empty ones so that they get updated and removed for anyone who had them installed</p>
<p>Writing a <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/temporary-suspension-of-automatic-snap-registration-following-security-incident/37077" target="_blank">statement</a> Canonical's Igor Ljubuncic said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On September 28, 2023, the Snap Store team was notified of a potential security incident. A number of snap users reported several recently published and potentially malicious snaps.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these reports, the Snap Store team has immediately taken down these snaps, and they can no longer be searched or installed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Snap Store team has placed a temporary manual review requirement on all new snap registrations, effectively immediately.</p>
<p>If you try to register a new snap while the requirement is active, you will be prompted to “request reserved name”. Upon a successful manual review from the Snap Store staff, the name will be registered. Uploading and releasing revisions for existing snaps will not be affected.</p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our snap publishers and developers. However, we believe it is the most prudent action at this moment.</p>
<p>We want to thoroughly investigate this incident without introducing any noise into the system, and more importantly, we want to make sure our users have a safe and trusted experience with the Snap Store.</p>
<p>Please bear with us while we conduct our investigation. We will provide a more detailed update in the coming days.</p>

<p>September has come and gone, the summer season has wound down, and spooks now rule the roost. But before the spooks can take hold; Valve dropped the Top 20 Most Played Steam Deck Games for September 2023.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 has kept it's top place, but Starfield is expectedly nipping at its toes. Cyberpunk 2077 has rocketed into third place; most likely due to its 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty expansion. Leaving FromSoftware's Elden Ring and Armored Core VI comfortably within fourth and fifth place respectively.</p>
<p>The usual suspects like Vampire Survivors and GTA V are all still going steady; though Hades is dangerously close to falling out of the running entirely. Maybe October will see it fall off but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Of course, the question now is what will wind up on the Top 20 list for October 2023. Personally I have my bets hedged for either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260320/Party_Animals/" target="_blank">Party Animals</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/" target="_blank">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a>, or maybe <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440510/Forza_Motorsport/" target="_blank">Forza Motorsport</a> depending on how it performs. I think <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" target="_blank">Cities Skylines II</a> will be out too late in the month to make a dent but will show up in November: like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244090/Sea_of_Stars/" target="_blank">Sea of Stars</a> did this month.</p>
<p>Either way the Top 20 is, and can be, anyone's game.</p>

      <title>Mesa 23.2.1 drivers out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a longer period of waiting than usual, the Mesa 23.2.1 driver release is out now as the first in the Mesa 23.2 series. It's tagged as a point release, since there was an accidental 23.2.0 release done previously that was removed.</p>
<p>No actual release announcement though, other than what was said in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/mesa-232-aims-for-release-this-week-with-a-point-release-next-week/" target="_blank">the last release candidate</a>.</p>
<p>From the release notes the new features supported are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>VK_EXT_attachment_feedback_loop_dynamic_state on RADV.</li>
<li>extendedDynamicState3SampleLocationsEnable on RADV.</li>
<li>VK_EXT_dynamic_rendering_unused_attachments on RADV.</li>
<li>VK_EXT_mesh_shader on lavapipe.</li>
<li>OpenGL 3.1 on Asahi.</li>
<li>OpenGL ES 3.0 on Asahi.</li>
<li>VK_KHR_fragment_shader_barycentric on RADV/GFX10.3+.</li>
<li>VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline on RADV/GFX10.3+.</li>
<li>VK_EXT_depth_bias_control on RADV.</li>
<li>VK_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock on RADV/GFX9+.</li>
<li>VK_EXT_pipeline_robustness on RADV.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus of course lots of the usual bug fixes see the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/blob/23.2/docs/relnotes/23.2.1.rst" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all of it.</p>
<p>We should also be due Mesa 23.2.2 this week if the previous plan for a sped-up point release cycle continues. Going by their normal release calendar, we're also due Mesa 23.3 out mid-November.</p>

      <title>Wine 8.17 is out with vkd3d v1.9 and initial Wayland window management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The compatibility layer <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.17" target="_blank">Wine version 8.17</a> is officially out now that brings with it some exciting new features, along with some bug fixes so here's what's new.</p>
<p>What's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.9.</li>
<li>Initial window management in the Wayland driver.</li>
<li>SoundFont support in DirectMusic.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bug fixes include problems solved for The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, Cemu, RageMP, Dwarf Fortress (Steam) and other miscellaneous fixes. Nice to see the Wayland work continuing to progress so eventually Wine will be able to run fully native on Wayland directly.</p>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/vkd3d/-/releases/vkd3d-1.9" target="_blank">vkd3d version 1.9</a> was only released on September 21st with these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Yet more improvements to the HLSL compiler.</li>
<li>A new utility to inspect the contents of DXBC blobs.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton, which comes from Valve devs. This is the Wine project's own Direct3D to Vulkan translation library, that will focus on everything whereas Valve has a focus on gaming.</p>

      <title>AMD FSR 3 arrived today in two games - source code later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD today announced that FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3) is now available in two games: Forspoken and Immortals of Aveum but the source code isn't up yet.</p>
<p>In regards to the source code being on GitHub like they've done with previous versions they simply said it "will be made available soon on GPUOpen with a permissive open source MIT license" so it could be later today, tomorrow or next month.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20967262921696011520gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20967262921696011520gol1.jpg"/></a><em>AMD FSR 3 Data Flow, Credit: AMD</em></p>
<p>More games are planning to have FSR 3 added in like Eve Online, Frostpunk 2, Space Marine 2, Cyberpunk 2077, Squad, Crimson Desert, Avatar Frontiers of Pandora and more.</p>
<p>It's not clear currently how exactly FSR3 will work on Linux with Proton (or any future Native Linux games that get it). It's likely Proton will need some upgrades to support it properly. Testing the demo of Forspoken, which was also updated, just results in massive flickering issues making it quite unplayable and I really <strong>wouldn't</strong> recommend anyone try it as it will probably cause some seizures. As for Immortals of Aveum it seems FSR3 makes it <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7140" target="_blank">crash</a>.</p>
<p>At least once it gets fixed up properly on Linux, we might see some nice performance boosts from it.</p>
<p>See the AMD <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fsr3-in-games-technical-details/" target="_blank">blog post</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Historical 4x strategy game Old World gets an Egyptian-themed DLC on October 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The third DLC for Old World, a 4x strategy game that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/old-world-from-the-civilization-iv-designer-releases-on-steam-along-with-linux-support/" target="_blank">came to Steam with Linux support last year</a> (after being Epic exclusive) is getting an Egyptian-themed DLC on October 4th going through 400 years of Egyptian history with a new narrative campaign. <em>I was rather impressed with it when I checked it out originally.</em></p>
<p>During the story-driven campaign you'll go through the rise and fall of the Kingdom of Kemet (the old name for Egypt) from its initial founding, through its golden age and internal struggles against powerful religious factions, culminating in the Bronze Age collapse and something about "Sea People". With unique mechanics to keep you busy plus this DLC also adds Kingdom of Kush to the sandbox campaign. Overall it sounds like a great addition to the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zU_dH1jHgD4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db3d61dcd5c2140cc45dbc2c64a61a2e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zU_dH1jHgD4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>DLC Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unification:</strong> Start as a small regional power and establish one of the greatest empires of the old world. Lead Thebes against Hyksos and Kerma to unify Kemet and begin The New Kingdom Period.</li>
<li><strong>Dawn of a Golden Age:</strong> Expand your domain into the Levant, Libya, and Nubia, dotting the lands with obelisks and building the Temple of Karnak before erecting a Mortuary Temple and immortalizing your name.</li>
<li>T<strong>he Amarna Period:</strong> Engage in a unique holy war as you fight to establish the world’s first monotheistic religion – defeat cults of pagan gods and partake in battles of faith and conviction.</li>
<li><strong>The Battle of Qadesh:</strong> Play as Pharaoh Ramesses the Great and confront the Hittites in the largest chariot battle in the history of the world.</li>
<li><strong>Hearts of Kemet:</strong> Embrace the concept of Ma’at and seek victory through balance. As the High Priests grow stronger, your goal as Pharaoh Merneptah is to restore a sense of order.</li>
<li><strong>The Sea People:</strong> The Bronze Age Collapse threatens everything you have built over 300 years - how long will your empire hold against the onslaught of this previously unknown threat?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy the game on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/old-world?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/597180/Old_World/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Sadly <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/old_world" target="_blank">GOG</a> still doesn't have the Linux version.</p>
<p>The game has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a curious blend of deck-building, creature-collecting and a little sprinkle of a life-sim, Moonstone Island is a colourful and very inviting game to add to your collection. It comes with full Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified. Note: key provided by Raw Fury.</p>
<p>Taking some inspiration from Studio Ghibli classics like Kiki’s Delivery Service, Castle in the Sky and more this is a real gem for people who want a more laid-back experience.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore a Wondrous World</strong>: Travel by balloon, broom, and glider through unique biomes to reach the farthest edges of the sky.</li>
<li><strong>Settle Into Your New Home</strong>: Build, decorate and customize a cozy new home of your own on any of the 100 islands in your procedurally generated world.</li>
<li><strong>Make New Friends &amp; More</strong>: Become a true member of the community – befriend your NPC neighbors, go on dates, and fall in love!</li>
<li><strong>Discover Wild Spirit Companions</strong>: Tame and befriend wild Spirits to fight alongside you in card-based combat.</li>
<li><strong>Go Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons to earn upgrades, collect loot and uncover secrets.</li>
<li><strong>Become a Full-fledged Alchemist</strong>: Optimize your alchemist with unique skills and upgrades, and craft dozens of items and vehicles to prepare for the treacherous wilderness.</li>
<li><strong>Build Your Own Farm</strong>: Grow crops and flowers to brew potions and tame Spirits!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It works great on desktop Linux, although at times it seems the Steam Overlay refused to work. Running it with <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> seemed to get it to work though. There's also some minor stutter while exploring, which is a known issue they're working to improve. Other than that, I haven't encountered any problems so it's good to see another nice release.</p>
<p>Absolutely love the setting, it's just so ridiculously charming and sweet. The exploring is definitely interesting too, quite different to other similar games since it's all based on islands. Although, the exploration is a little slow to begin with, since after the intro you're making use of just a balloon (yes really — dangerous much?!) which also uses up your energy. But eventually you'll get more tools to explore a bit quicker.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14672921751696002675gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14672921751696002675gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3816406321696002887gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3816406321696002887gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Sure hope I don't have a bird strike…</em></p>
<p>Overall it really does seem like a lovely game that I've enjoyed exploring and finding new creatures, while going through many quests. The blending of all the different genres together is a bit odd at first but it really does work quite well. Always fun to see how other developers explore creature-collecting like this. Exactly the type of game you're going to want on Steam Deck too, with the colder months coming in - nice to cozy up with.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1092359921696003610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1092359921696003610gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>How long is it? You can expect somewhere around 40-50 hours, so it's certainly not a short game and once you finish the main story you'll be able to continue after in a more sandbox like way to just keep on doing your thing. It's a single-player game too, with no current plans to add in co-op.</p>
<p>This is one you don't want to miss out out. Wonderful.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/moonstone-island?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1658150/Moonstone_Island/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>EA expanding EA Anti-Cheat - bad news for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA (Electronic Arts) are continuing to expand their home-grown EA Anti-Cheat, with an <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/eaac-and-battlefield-2042?setLocale=en-gb" target="_blank">announcement</a> that Battlefield 2042 is also moving over to it.</p>
<p>This <em>isn't</em> actually something entirely new though, as it was given a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/ea-anticheat-could-spell-trouble-for-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">Deep Dive</a> back in 2022 and released with Fifa 23 that same year, and it's also in the newly released EA SPORTS FC 24. Battlefield is definitely not the first game to get it but it's a growing issue.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that it doesn't work on Linux / Steam Deck, with it being blocked by EA. It's a kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution, which as we've seen from other anti-cheats is particularly problematic for Linux / Steam Deck. And it's likely EA will continue to use it with new games, and potentially get other older games updated to use it too. So if they got Respawn to switch over to it, this would kill Apex Legends on Linux / Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Fifa 23 and EA SPORTS FC 24 are rated Unsupported on Linux / Steam Deck due to it, and while Battlefield 2042 previously used Easy Anti-Cheat, they never bothered to hook up support for that on Linux anyway (even though EAC supports Linux), so it's just going to continue to be Unsupported.</p>
<p>We can only hope that Valve are keeping an eye on the situation and speak to EA to eventually get support for it on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton.</p>

      <title>Epic Games sheds 830 people due to &#39;spending way more money than we earn&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recent industry news doing the rounds is from Epic Games, who yesterday <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/layoffs-at-epic" target="_blank">publicly</a> shared an email that was sent by Tim Sweeney about laying off 16% of the company. 830 people lost their job due to "spending way more money than we earn" as they continue "investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators".</p>
<p>That is a lot of people, and clearly shows that Epic Games have been relying a lot on Fortnite money. While Fortnite is "starting to grow again" Sweeney said it's being driven now by player-made content which has "significant revenue sharing, and this is a lower margin business than we had when Fortnite Battle Royale took off and began funding our expansion".</p>
<p>In the post Sweeney mentioned how Epic has been making efforts to reduce costs like "moving to net zero hiring and cutting operating spend on things like marketing and events" but all of this "ended up far short of financial sustainability" so getting rid of staff was "the only way" they could stabilize.</p>
<p>Epic is also selling off Bandcamp to B2B music company Songtradr, which they only acquired in 2022, as clearly they didn't actually have a business plan for it to sell it off so quickly. They're also spinning off most of SuperAwesome that they acquired in 2020, <a href="https://www.superawesome.com/blog/superawesome-leadership-to-acquire-company-from-epic-games/" target="_blank">who say</a> they are acquiring most of it back themselves directly.</p>
<p>Psyonix, maker of Rocket League, was <a href="https://twitter.com/FlashFerret/status/1707435527933202442" target="_blank">also</a><small>(1)</small> <a href="https://twitter.com/TedGabbard/status/1707428404822528157" target="_blank">affected</a><small>(2)</small> since Epic acquired them back in 2019 and then made it exclusive to the Epic Store.</p>
<p>The developer Mediatonic who made Fall Guys was also impacted by this, since Epic acquired them in 2021 and then made Fall Guys exclusive to the Epic Store. It's not clear how badly they've been affected but Ed Fear (Game Lead) who was laid off showed off a <a href="https://twitter.com/edfear/status/1707454892900491620" target="_blank">picture</a> on X that showed "Decimated", with many others also posting about being let go so Mediatonic appears to have been hit quite hard by this.</p>
<p>No doubt the exclusives and constant free games on the Epic Store cost a lot of monies.</p>

      <title>Check out the awesome demo of Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is an upcoming spin-off of the very popular online co-op mining action game Deep Rock Galactic, and now a public demo is up so you can try it too and you really should try this one.</p>
<p>It's taking the base mechanics and style from Deep Rock Galactic but blending it with a Vampire Survivor-like setting. So you run through a level mining, while fighting off waves of enemies. As you do this you collect gems to level-up, get new weapons, upgrade weapons and more. Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor does things just a bit differently to the rest of the VS clones though, enough to make it quite unique.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15460179691695911456gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15460179691695911456gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not only does it have destructible terrain to mine through, but you're also collecting resources here too. Once you've finished off a boss, you then get a drop-ship mine down to you that you have to make it into to finish the level. After that, you'll then get the chance to buy some upgrades with your hard-earned mined resources. This prepares you for the next level, where you'll repeat this loop a few times. In contrast to other similar titles having you go through a certain time on one single level, it's a nice tweak to the idea.</p>
<p>On Linux, it works without any issue I can see using Proton Experimental and performance seems great on my desktop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16430436161695911639gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16430436161695911639gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Meanwhile on Steam Deck testing also with Proton Experimental on SteamOS 3.5 Preview, it's also running very nicely overall. Most of the time sitting around 60FPS, with occasional dips when there's some big explosive action but it soon sorts itself back out. It also looks quite fantastic on the Steam Deck screen, this could easily be my next game to play in bed when I'm supposed to be sleeping. Text could do with being a little bigger though, which I've asked them to do.</p>
<p>Outside of the levels there's also permanent progression too, using the resources collected during a run.</p>
<p>Looks to be another good entry into the reverse-bullet hell / bullet heaven / survivor-like genre. It's due to enter Early Access later this year. The demo will be available from now until after Steam Next Fest in October, and they plan to keep it up for a week or two after it ends so you've got plenty of time to try it out.</p>

      <title>EU court upholds fine against Valve for geo-blocking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/04/the-eu-is-going-after-valve-and-others-for-geo-blocking-a-statement-from-valve/" target="_blank">Back in 2019</a> the EU went after Valve and select publishers on Steam for geo-blocking, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/valve-and-others-fined-by-the-european-commission-for-geo-blocking/" target="_blank">then in 2021</a> they were issued fines which naturally was appealed but it has been <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-09/cp230147en.pdf" target="_blank">dismissed</a> so it's likely Valve will now have to pay up.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-09/cp230147en.pdf" target="_blank">press release</a> from September 27th it notes Valve and five games publishers including Bandai, Capcom, Focus Home, Koch Media and ZeniMax infringed EU competition law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Commission found that Valve and the five publishers had participated in a group of anti-competitive agreements or concerted practices which were intended to restrict cross-border sales of certain PC video games that were compatible with the Steam platform, by putting in place territorial control functionalities during different periods between 2010 and 2015, in particular the Baltic countries and certain countries in central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Valve brought an action before the General Court of the European Union, seeking to have the decision annulled in<br/>
so far as it related to it.</p>
<p>In its judgment delivered today, the General Court dismisses the action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To sum up: Valve allowed the use of Steam keys that were locked to specific regions in the EU, preventing other regions from getting them cheaper which is a breach of EU rules. Valve did already stop doing this years ago as this happened between 2010 and 2015, so this is a more of a historical case that Valve tried fighting on copyright grounds that the EU rejected so they will have to pay the full €1.6m fine.</p>

      <title>Steam Play tool for Native Linux gaming &#39;Luxtorpeda&#39; v67 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Luxtorpeda has a new release out which is mostly upgrades behind the scenes, but worth an upgrade to get the best experience. Read on for more on what's changed and what Luxtorpeda does.</p>
<p>So what does it do? You use it in Steam Play just like you would set a game to use Proton but you set it to Luxtorpeda instead. Luxtorpeda enables you to download Native Linux game engines for various games on Steam. So it would help you get OpenMW for Morrowind, as just one example (many more <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">available</a>), directly in Steam.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in v67:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support copying steam input template from engine.</li>
<li>Update godot controller icons addon.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary code and dependency around xdg_runtime_dir.</li>
<li>Improve actions time - use built godot export &amp; actions to setup environment.</li>
<li>Build process improvements.</li>
<li>Update to Godot 4.</li>
<li>Request steam app install for steam app id dependencies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How to use it? Be sure to check <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">my previous article</a> but to save you a click here's a video from before. It works the same on Steam Deck as it does desktop Linux.</p>

      <title>Zombie survival in your city – Infection Free Zone</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What would you do if there were zombies right in your neighborhood? Would you maybe head to the closest supermarket you usually shop at, check out the old police station where your uncle used to work for some guns, or even consider hitting up that pharmacy run by the grumpy lady who always gave you the creeps? Well, that's pretty much the deal with Infection Free Zone. <em>Tested on Linux Mint with Proton Experimental.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nBbVO5tMBn0?rel=0&amp;start=0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb218ec1f5a32cbbea35bb05b2296358.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nBbVO5tMBn0?rel=0&amp;start=0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Infection Free Zone, cooked up by Jutsu Games and published by Games Operators, drops us right into a post-apocalyptic world that's been flattened by the relentless “Mad Virus”. As survivors in abandoned cities, we're tasked with setting up an “Infection-Free Zone”, repurposing buildings, beefing up our defenses, and scavenging for supplies. Every night, those infected creatures come at us, and we've got to defend our base. We can also do some research and trade with other survivors, though not everyone will be our friend.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal here is pretty straightforward yet challenging: lead our group of survivors, construct a base that can take care of itself, and fend off wave after wave of infected. In this quick look at the game's demo, I’ll delve into the gameplay and see what makes Infection Free Zone stand out.</p>
<p>Infection Free Zone is an intriguing mix of city-building and survival strategy. We're busy setting up our home base, repurposing buildings, and putting up defenses. The whole repurposing thing is a bit different from the usual city builders. Instead of just plopping down new buildings wherever we want, we've got to work with what's already there. It adds a layer of strategy, especially when it comes to defending the base. Some buildings, though, we can place wherever we like, like defense towers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13786912631695842095gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13786912631695842095gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Now, what makes this game super cool is not just how tough it can get, but also the fact that it uses real geographic data from OpenStreetMap. You can explore neighborhoods you know or discover new cities. In my test, I actually found the streets in the game also on Google Maps at the correct location.</p>
<p>When the full game comes out, you should be able to pick any city from around the world. The developers even say they've included specific buildings and their original purposes from OpenStreetMap. So, if you know where the supermarket is in your real world location, it should be right there in the game. I couldn't try this out in the demo because this function is not in the demo, though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17377409421695842150gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17377409421695842150gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>By the way, the game's main designer said in an interview that editing OpenStreetMap doesn't affect the game because the developers use their own version for it. Also, the devs promise different day and night cycles based on the city you pick and the season. It adds some variety to the game.</p>
<p>But this whole city map thing did lead to some weird moments in my test. For example, I saw German signs in a Chinese city. Still, the game's customization options are impressive, and I'd love to start in my current home base, Hanoi, or a little German town.</p>
<p>During my test in the German version, aside from those odd signs, there were some translation issues. Like when I ran out of wood, it said “draußen Holz” (lit. “outside wood”), which probably meant “out of wood”. It was a bit strange, but I think the devs will keep working on the German translation. If you play in English, I'd guess there are fewer translation problems. Either way, it didn't ruin the fun of the game.</p>
<p>And trust me, it's a lot of fun, especially because of how challenging it is. At the start, it feels like your typical strategy game. We've got a base, workers, and soldiers, but we don't directly control the workers; we give them orders, and they do their thing.</p>
<p>One downside is that in open construction projects where we're short on resources, workers tend to get stuck instead of going to get what we need. For example, I couldn't build three fields at one point because I ran out of wood. But my workers just stood there waiting for the wood instead of going to find it. I could solve it by manually moving them away, but it'd be better if they did it automatically in a game like this.</p>
<p>The day and night cycle in Infection Free Zone is super important. During the day, our workers do their tasks, and at night, they hide in our headquarters or specially converted safe houses. Same goes for our squads, these little teams of four that we move around the city during the day to find supplies. Squads also fight for us, with four individual weapons and a shared ammo pool. When that pool's empty, they switch to melee weapons. I thought the day and night cycle went by pretty fast compared to what my squads could do in a day.</p>
<p>Just like with workers, it's a good idea to get squads in a safe house at night because it gets way more dangerous when it's dark. Zombie hordes roam around our base and even directly attack it.</p>
<p>My first night was pretty quiet, but on the second night, a bunch of hordes came right at me. Overall, my first playthrough was really challenging, and I eventually lost because I ran out of ammo, leaving my base nearly defenseless. Even though my squads could fight with melee weapons, they didn't stand a chance against all those zombies.</p>
<p>Besides the tough battles, there are other things that make the game realistic. For example, having a car is super important in this world. We can use it to gather resources, get around faster, and run over enemies. When we send a squad in a car to a house, they get out, collect stuff, and stash it in the car. Same thing when they come back to base, and it all happens smoothly with minimal clicking, which is great. But you've got to be careful with the car because you'll run out of fuel, and it might need repairs. Still, having a car can be the difference between survival and getting wiped out in Infection Free Zone.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13263630641695842159gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13263630641695842159gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In terms of performance and sound, I had pretty stable frame rates, around 38 to 40 frames per second on my Linux Mint system with the game’s default settings. AMD Ryzen 5 2600 (12) @ 3.400GH / GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER.</p>
<p>It wasn't perfectly smooth, but it was definitely playable without any problems. However, I can't say for sure if this will hold up when bigger hordes of infected show up and start swarming my base.</p>
<p>The sound effects and background noises are okay, nothing extraordinary but they do the job. It's nice that all the dialogue is voiced, although it's just in English right now. As for the music, there's not much to say; it's got this eerie ambient sound that fits the game's atmosphere.</p>
<p>But here's one gripe: the wolf sounds were way too loud and not cool at all. I had to turn down the volume while playing, and that made other in-game sounds basically inaudible.</p>
<p>To sum it up, Infection Free Zone is a gripping and tough game that realistically portrays a post-apocalyptic world. Being able to pick real-world locations on the map is a cool twist, and I can't wait to play in my hometown.</p>
<p>In the full game, the devs promise over 40 buildings, different types of infected, research missions, 10 types of vehicles with upgrades, more weapons, and 30 kinds of events. That sounds like a lot, and I'm excited about the full version, though it remains unclear when the game is going to be released.</p>

<p>If you're after benchmarks, it seems they sent <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/raspberry-pi-5-benchmarks" target="_blank">Phoronix</a> an early unit. Going by their benchmarks, it really is an impressive leap over the RPi4. I'm trying to convince myself I don't need it…</p>
<p>With new hardware, comes new software, and so they will also be releasing a brand new version of their first-party Raspberry Pi OS, built on top of the most recent Debian release and that will release mid-October shortly before the RPi5 launches officially in late-October.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/" target="_blank">announcement post</a> goes over a little history, including a note about how they managed to sell over 14 million of the RPi4 which is pretty impressive.</p>

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 is out now with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Counter-Strike 2 from Valve is now officially out and comes with Native Linux support, so it's time to say goodbye to Global Offensive as it has been replaced.</p>
<p>"A free upgrade to CS:GO, Counter-Strike 2 marks the largest technical leap in Counter-Strike’s history. Built on the Source 2 engine, Counter-Strike 2 is modernized with realistic physically-based rendering, state of the art networking, and upgraded Community Workshop tools." — Valve</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nSE38xjMLqE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5ef67c9198a60b5658d8b1b551a0bc2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nSE38xjMLqE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All-new CS Ratings with the updated Premier mode.</li>
<li>Global and Regional leaderboards.</li>
<li>Upgraded and overhauled maps.</li>
<li>Game-changing dynamic smoke grenades.</li>
<li>Tick-rate-independent gameplay.</li>
<li>Redesigned visual effects and audio.</li>
<li>All items from CS:GO moving forward to CS2.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The updated Linux system requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>OS: Ubuntu 20.04</li>
<li>Processor: 4 hardware CPU threads - Intel® Core™ i5 750 or higher</li>
<li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li>
<li>Graphics: AMD GCN+ or NVIDIA Kepler+ with up-to-date Vulkan drivers. Support for VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library highly recommended.</li>
<li>Storage: 85 GB available space</li>
<li>Sound Card: Highly recommended</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the earlier upgrade to the Linux version of Dota 2, Valve also bumped it up to their latest "Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (Sniper)", which should provide a big improvement to compatibility on modern Linux systems. From what developer Timothee "TTimo" Besset said on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TTimo/111139168753296731" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, the Windows version has been thoroughly tested but significantly less on the Linux version so be sure to <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues" target="_blank">report any bugs</a> you find.</p>
<p>Note: If you find you don't have any sound there's already a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/3256" target="_blank">bug report</a> with some suggestions to try.</p>
<p>Be sure to <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">pop along to our Discord</a> to chat about it, and be sure to leave a comment for those not on Discord.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2420110/Horizon_Forbidden_West_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank">wishlist / follow on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Are you as excited as I am? Proton is already pretty amazing, but just think how many upgrades it will have between now and next year — it should run great. I'll be checking it out, will you be? I'm very curious to see how the Steam Deck and my desktop will handle it.</p>
<p>Definitely loving the recent trend of more ports coming to PC so we can all enjoy such games.</p>

      <title>MangoHud v0.7 out now adding presets support like on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a>, the awesome tool you can use to get a HUD on top of your games (included by default on the Steam Deck), has released version <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/releases/tag/v0.7.0" target="_blank">0.7.0</a> that includes many new options so here's what's changed.</p>
<p>As an example of what it can do, see the shots below playing War Thunder with MangoHud at the top:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20378186511695813255gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20378186511695813255gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20680958691695813254gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20680958691695813254gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Click screenshots to enlarge. If you like my horizontal layout it can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/LiamDawe/9dd62ccf43635c25050f3cc0e7aaf109" target="_blank">here</a>. The second shot is just "full".</p>
<p>A bunch of new parameters were added in 0.7.0 including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_fan</code> displays the gpu fan RPM, only works on AMD.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_junction_temp</code> displays the junction temperature on AMD GPUs</li>
<li>removed <code class="inline-code">io_stats</code>, just use <code class="inline-code">io_read</code> and <code class="inline-code">io_write</code> instead</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">engine_short_names</code> shortens the names of engines, e.g <code class="inline-code">VULKAN</code> becomes <code class="inline-code">VK</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">text_outline</code> adds a colored outline around all text</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">text_outline_color</code> sets the color of the outline, default: <code class="inline-code">000000</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">text_outline_thickness</code> sets the thickness of the outline, default: <code class="inline-code">1.5</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">temp_fahrenheit</code> changes all temps to fahrenheit from celsius</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">dynamic_frame_timing</code> dynamically changes the range of the frametime graph</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">duration</code> displays the time since mangohud initialized</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">gpu_voltage</code> shows the current gpu voltage, only works on AMD</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_text</code> override fps text</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">horizontal_stretch</code> sets the background to stretch across width of application (enabled by default)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">core_bars</code> turns <code class="inline-code">core_load</code> into a histogram</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">device_battery</code> Shows battery level of wireless devices, accepts <code class="inline-code">gamepad</code> <code class="inline-code">mouse</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">device_battery_icon</code> shows battery icon instead of percent</li>
</ul>
<p>A nice new feature is the addition of support for different presets, just like found on the Steam Deck in the performance menu, where you switch between different HUD layouts. Giving you the ability to set your own, and easily switch between them with a hotkey (although that switching only works on X11 right now). You need to add a <em>preset.conf</em> file to <code class="inline-code">~/.config/MangoHud/</code>. I gave an example of this in my SteamOS 3.5 Preview video (at around 05:00):</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="A7oxT6oSun0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/90715eb9d2857067cc78c8913d4414b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/A7oxT6oSun0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So you can now do the same on desktop with MangoHud 0.7.0.</p>
<p>What do you think to the new release? Do you use MangoHud? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>The Talos Principle 2 from Croteam launches November 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Croteam and Devolver Digital have announced that The Talos Principle 2 is now set for launch on November 2, and it looks to be an impressive follow-up to the previous game which is easily one of the best puzzle games ever made.</p>
<p>More about it:"Set in a distant future where humankind has long been extinct, human culture lives on through interminable robots made in our image. Embarking on a quest to investigate a mysterious megastructure, you will be confronted with questions about the nature of the cosmos, faith versus reason, and the fear of repeating humankind's mistakes.</p>
<p>Familiar puzzles will return in The Talos Principle II, accompanied by unique new gameplay including mind transference and gravity manipulation. There's also a deep character-driven story with multiple endings to lose yourself in, and a series of strange, stunningly beautiful environments to explore—including a city on the brink of a paradigm shift and an island holding the keys to the future."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2NgMGOuoAiA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d36bf836281b76d94716a61714282d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2NgMGOuoAiA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This time there's no Native Linux support, so you'll need to run it with Proton. One of Croteam's co-founders, who was involved in a lot of their Linux work also left quite some time ago, and joined Google for Stadia before its collapse. Croteam also swapped from their own tech to Unreal Engine for this one so it will be interesting to see how things have changed overall for the sequel.</p>
<p>Will you be picking it up?</p>
<p>It will be available on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-talos-principle-2?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/835960/The_Talos_Principle_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Survive The Fog is an upcoming third-person survivor-like action rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One day I may get over my fascination with anything remotely inspired by the popularity of Vampire Survivors but it is not today. Survive The Fog is another one, but this one makes it more like a third-person action game.</p>
<p>More about it: "Survive the Fog is a fast-paced action rogue-lite, with a lot of different builds for each class. The game is all about fighting massive hordes of enemies while experimenting with different combinations of powers and spells. Different characters provide you with various way to approach the battle."</p>
<p>Must admit, this looks like it could end up pretty intense! Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="s7LoGwho3LE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0e723daa442e85ae2b7fddb6124fb748.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/s7LoGwho3LE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems like it's going to have some nice variety in the runs too with different classes to play through, along with a bunch of events that happen as you progress through a run. These events include meteor showers, healing areas, gluttonous chests to chase down and more. Lots of upgrades during a run along with meta upgrades for permanent unlocks too, all the standard stuff you've come to love about bullet heaven survivor-likes.</p>
<p>When asked about Linux support on Steam, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2180250/discussions/0/3880470762777110655/#c3882722797148211305" target="_blank">confirmed</a> they plan Linux support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently only versions of Windows are supported. I have plans in the future to extend that to Linux, Mac and possibly consoles. But this wont be available on early access launch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So until they you can either try your luck with Proton at the EA launch or wait and see.</p>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 1+2 Finally Coming To Steam</title>
      <author>Smellbringer</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After almost three agonizing years of waiting, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2, the excellent remake of the first two classic Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games, has been announced for a<a href="https://twitter.com/TonyHawkTheGame/status/1706718375270138282" target="_blank"> Steam release on October 3</a>. Ever since its launch in 2020, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 has been an Epic Games Store exclusive for PC Gamers. The game never even made the jump to Activision-Blizzard's exclusive Battle.net launcher, which struck many as odd.</p>
<p>Since then though fans have been waiting for the game's great PC port to make its way to Steam and be free of the EGS exclusivity limbo. But after 3 years it'd be safe to say that many had given up hope of a re-release. Especially with the follow up, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-plans-for-pro-skater-3-4-remake-were-abandoned-after-blizzard-merger" target="_blank">canceled</a> and developer Vicarious Visions being <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23022627/vicarious-visions-merged-blizzard-entertainment-albany" target="_blank">absorbed by Blizzard</a>. So to see 1+2 come to Steam is a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/290722581695807706gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/290722581695807706gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>We know the Steam Deck can handle 60FPS in this game from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKF0Gu9dcS8" target="_blank">testing done on the EGS version</a>, and Activision's Steam Deck support has been pretty great as long as it isn't Call of Duty. So I think it's safe to expect Steam Deck support either Day 1 or Week 1, which is pretty exciting given the Switch version has a 30 fps cap and that's the only other portable version so far.</p>
<p>You can wishlist Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2395210/Tony_Hawks_Pro_Skater_1__2/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> is a Linux distribution designed for gamers, especially if you're wanting to get something similar to SteamOS on a handheld similar to the Steam Deck like the ROG Ally. The latest release ChimeraOS 44, has just gone out with improvements pretty much everywhere!</p>
<p>This release comes with Linux 6.5.3, OpenGamepadUI 0.21.7 and Mesa 23.1.7. The list of fixes for various hardware is quite long too you can expect to see improvements for the ROG Ally, AYANEO Air Plus, GPD Win4, Aya Neo 2 and Aya Neo Geek, and various Ayn Loki devices.</p>
<p>ChimeraOS also now has a dynamic swapfile, which they said "has been reported to boost a lot of games". The default is 1GB like the Steam Deck and it's compatible with tools like CryoUtilities. Their version of Gamescope will also now no longer need you to set the resolution per-game to play at resolutions over 720p. Additionally they said that AMD GPU hands / resets should now just automatically restart Gamescope instead of crashing and needing a hard reset.</p>
<p>Emulation has also been improved as they fixed saved games not working on PSP games and they adjusted settings for PlayStation 2 and Nintendo 64 to prevent some graphical issues in some games.</p>
<p>Work has also continued on <a href="https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI" target="_blank">OpenGamepadUI</a>, an alternative front-end to Steam Big Picture, which now includes Performance Profile per-game, Power Tools support for "the entire AMD 7000 APU series" along with various input improvements.</p>

      <title>Tropico 6 adds modding support with mod.io, and a new DLC next month</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tropico 6 from Realmforge Studios and Kalypso Media just had a nice upgrade that gives official modding support, with <a href="https://mod.io/" target="_blank">mod.io</a> integration. Interesting to see more games go for mod.io (from the Mod DB crew), which gives the same access to modding across all platforms and stores whereas the Steam Workshop is of course locked to Steam.</p>
<p>Nice to see, since modding support can expand the life of a game nearly forever, and we've seen truly amazing mods for other games and Tropico 6 seems like a great fit to have it. Some of the things you can do with mods:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Create your own maps - Get ready to create your own maps based on existing or randomly generated ones.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">The whole world at your fingertips - Modify, tweak or replace every asset in the game. Or create your own.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">All the debug-tools you need - Access to all debug modes that the developers are using.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">It's in the blueprints - Use Unreal Blueprints to add gameplay or new UI elements.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They have various videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLITnGW6b6ufBeXc9xVylvL_9utI6HspBV" target="_blank">YouTube</a> going over how to do the modding.</p>
<p>Additionally a new "Going Viral" DLC is planned to launch on October 12th.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2529175031695733526gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2529175031695733526gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Tropico 6 - Going Viral DLC</em></p>
<p>Going Viral DLC Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find the cure, with Tropico 6 – Going Viral: 4 different diseases</strong> hit Tropico and disrupt daily life; some may severely harm your citizens, others may be just a mild cough *cough*.</li>
<li><strong>Pull the strings &amp; keep control</strong> in a <strong>4 mission-campaign</strong> or fight the diseases on a <strong>new multiplayer map</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stay calm… or don’t!</strong> Influence the masses with the new <strong>“Panic” mechanic</strong>. The <strong>panic meter</strong> measures how the Tropican citizens feel about the diseases. High panic allows for more powerful edicts to be enacted. Should you raise the alarm in order to exploit the situation with powerful edicts, or keep the population calm in the face of a potentially deadly threat?</li>
<li><strong>Inject first, ask later:</strong> A host of <strong>16 exciting new edicts</strong> will be unlocked as your <strong>panic meter</strong> rises and will give you different ways in which to exploit the disease in Tropico: <strong>Inject first</strong>, ask questions later, mandate <strong>masks</strong>, or choose to gear up for a <strong>viral palace party</strong>, it’s all up to you, El Presidente!</li>
<li><strong>Managing the disease: 9 new buildings</strong> will change the way you manage Tropico and how you deal with outbreaks and diseases. Use the <strong>Healing Howitzer</strong> to speedily distribute the cure to your Tropicans or build the new <strong>Colossal Hospital</strong> to increase your medical capacities and place <strong>Medical Checkpoints</strong> on the streets to find infected people.<br/>
In addition, during the campaign a curious <strong>quack</strong> will also help you manage the disease in <strong>Ambrosius’ Magic Hut</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Fight the plague in style with new design options for El Presidente &amp; the palace!</strong> With new accessories like the plague doctor for El Presidente or the Medical Fencing for your palace, you'll be perfectly prepared.</li>
</ul>

      <title>2.5D puzzle platformer Seedlings has some great photography-based visuals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seedlings really is a visual treat, and quite a fun puzzle-platformer too that released on 22nd September from Bardsley Creative. If you're after something a little unusual, this is it. <em>Note: key provided by the developer to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>. Go give it a follow for game recommendations!</em></p>
<p>Not only is it a treat for your eyes, it's a treat for your ears to. The audio work on this is wonderful too. Really just beautiful, and while it is a puzzle-platformer it's surprisingly relaxing too thanks to the setting. This is the type of game where you need to grab a cuppa, get cozy and just play it through. The creature design is interesting too, with you being a seed that takes over various tree/twig-like <em>things</em>.</p>

      <title>SteamVR 2.0 Beta released with a big UI overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now released a Beta for SteamVR 2.0, which brings with it a much needed overhaul to the interface along with lots of new features. Work towards whatever <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Galileo and Sephiroth</a> are? The long-leaked Deckard probably.</p>
<p>In the announcement Valve note it's the "first major step toward our goal of bringing all of what's new on the Steam platform into VR". To access it you need to be in the Steam Client Beta and then opt into the Beta for SteamVR too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12475313341695723073gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12475313341695723073gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Image - Valve - SteamVR 2.0</em></p>
<p>This integrates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the current features of Steam and Steam Deck are now part of SteamVR</li>
<li>Updated keyboard with support for new languages, emojis, and themes</li>
<li>Integration of Steam Chat and Voice Chat</li>
<li>Improved Store that puts new and popular VR releases front and center</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8494607591695723093gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8494607591695723093gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Image - Valve - SteamVR 2.0</em></p>
<p>Here's the rest of the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>SteamVR:</div>
<ul>
<li>Floating overlay windows can now be interacted with while the dashboard is hidden.</li>
<li>Fixed crash on exit for some Unity titles.</li>
<li>Increased the system layer resolution limit. This was previously 1.5x the recommended render target scale, but is now applied to width and height independently.</li>
<li>Fix a case where controller configuration would not be localized in the user’s preferred language (as configured in Steam).</li>
<li>Added a prompt to install the Bigscreen Beyond Driver when the headset is detected.</li>
</ul>
<div>Meta:</div>
<ul>
<li>Hide the SteamVR IPD slider since Meta already shows one.</li>
</ul>
<div>Linux</div>
<ul>
<li>Transition to the Steam Linux Runtime 3.0 (sniper) for improved compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<div>Drivers:</div>
<ul>
<li>For drivers which provide a manifest but don’t specify “resourceOnly”, default to true if there is no bin directory.</li>
<li>Add a manifest entry "showEnableInSettings" which can be set to force a driver to appear in the “addons” settings even if default rules would hide it.</li>
<li>When a specific driver is forced with the "forcedDriver" setting or the VR_FORCE_TEST_DRIVER, load it even if it is disabled.</li>
<li>When a specific driver is forced with the "forcedDriver" setting or the VR_FORCE_TEST_DRIVER, only allow an HMD to activate from that driver (even if other drivers are loaded due to “activateMultipleDrivers” and they activate an HMD first). The forced driver always had the first opportunity to activate an HMD before, but now we will wait for it to hotplug an HMD rather than letting another available HMD win.</li>
<li>The “LastKnown” section in settings (which updates with the manufacturer and model of the last used HMD) now also keeps track of the “ActualHMDDriver” (e.g. “lighthouse”) that provided the HMD.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if my system is just being a special case, or if Valve forgot Linux but currently on both the Steam Client Beta and SteamVR Beta, I still see the old UI. So it may not be working on Linux right now in this first Beta. Let me know what you find in the comments if you try it too. I have a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/SteamVR-for-Linux/issues/614" target="_blank">bug report</a> up so maybe the issue can be found.</p>
<p>As for the future of SteamVR, I think it's pretty clear this is work towards a new VR kit from Valve. Why else would you continue investing in it and give it such a big overhaul to include more main Steam features directly?</p>

<p>After a new casual silly party game? Party Animals recently released from Recreate Games and Source Technology and it works pretty great overall on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Spread across around 20 maps and three different game modes, you'll be fighting off other animals across multiple rounds. The idea is similar to the likes of Gang Beasts, with wobbly creatures running around doing completely stupid things. Fight on planes, submarines, trains and more.</p>
<p>First up Steam Deck: the good news is that it runs on Steam Deck, my testing is with SteamOS 3.5 Preview and Proton Experimental. The only issue I had was setting my name at the start requiring the touchscreen and same with editing a custom game name, as gamepad input on the keyboard kept removing it. Apart from that though, it has been pretty smooth sailing.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cMSAJt9WaA8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db75749f4b16bed1c2dbd0a458571ea5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cMSAJt9WaA8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Performance on Steam Deck isn't as good as expected though, considering the pretty simple style and game mechanics. Even on Low details it wouldn't go much above 40FPS. Thankfully, it feels pretty great though and it looks just fine thanks to the cartoony style to it.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that this is an online-only game, it does not have full offline play and it does also have micro-transactions. You can earn as you play, but you can also pay to get more of the in-game currency to buy more expensive cosmetic outfits from the in-game shop. Two things that have been pulling down the Steam user review score with players not particularly happy about either. Not enough to stop people playing it though, with it being one of the most popular releases of 2023 so far (over 55,000 people played it at the same time today).</p>
<p>On desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.04) no surprises there as it works perfectly. With good <em>smooth</em> performance on max settings on my desktop at 2560x1440 - Ryzen 5800x / Radeon 6800XT.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15046566411695666520gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15046566411695666520gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A feature I especially like in Party Animals is that when you’ve been thrown out and the match is still going on, you get a few little tricks to throw into the ring like a banana peel for them to slip on or a bomb to hopefully explode them off. It’s a nice little touch that stops it being too boring when you’re waiting for the round to end while you're spectating.</p>
<p>Overall it's really fun, some properly laugh out loud moments can be had in it and across Steam Deck / desktop Linux you can have a good time with it. I would just suggest turning off voice chat, because for some reason it's on by default and open mic too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260320/Party_Animals/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fantastic Haven is an upcoming magical zoo tycoon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for something just a tad different? Fantastic Haven was announced recently that looks and sounds really unique as you explore the world, to take care of various magical creatures.</p>
<p>"In a world where magic is gradually disappearing in favor of technological advances that threaten the balance, you play the role of the Elders, protectors of the continent. While the inhabitants prefer to hunt the creatures and gradually abandon magic, your mission is to restore the balance by saving the fantasy creatures, while using diplomacy and teaching to convince people to live in harmony with them."</p>
<p>Check out the initial trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rt0-s-UPDrE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f20a93fd64244e39a6ee4aa79921832.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rt0-s-UPDrE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Establish a refuge - Choose where your refuge will be and build basic infrastructures unlocking new research and buildings, allowing you to welcome more creatures and make your refuge prosper.</li>
<li class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Welcome Creatures One and All - Bring creatures back to the refuge and rehabilitate them. Place them in proper quarantine structures, then move them to a sanctuary with other compatible creatures and their biotope while keeping them sequestered from others. When the time is right, set them back into the wild, helping to restore magic.</li>
<li class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Explore the Realm - Send out scouting parties of mages to survey points of interest and to find creatures in need and bring them back to your refuge. While exploring, be sure to collect the five types of ether to use as currency and fuel your creations.</li>
<li class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">Bring Harmony - Negotiate with hostile populations using diplomacy to form strong ties. Train your citizens to properly care for the fantastical creatures at the refuge to increase its reputation and to help bring balance between humans, creatures, resources, and magic.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It should feature Linux support at release, like many other titles published by Goblinz Publishing. We'll know more closer to release and it will also be having a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goblinzstudio/fantastic-haven" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> crowdfunding campaign in November.

      <title>Mesa 23.2 aims for release this week, with a point release next week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been quite a while overdue but Mesa 23.2 is getting set to finally released, with a fourth Release Candidate now available for testing.</p>
<p>Writing in the <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2023-September/226062.html" target="_blank">announcement</a>, developer Dylan Baker mentioned they're hoping this fourth RC is the last, with the plan to release it in full on Wednesday. However it will be released as 23.2.1, since they accidentally tagged a 23.2.0 release a little while ago that was removed.</p>
<p>Baker also mentioned that they will continue pulling in some patches, and contacting developers whose patches didn't apply cleanly, and so they're hoping for a shorter cycle to get to the next point release with Mesa 23.2.2 next week.</p>
<p>It's generally advisable to wait for the first point release, so you may want to hold off until Mesa 23.2.2 next week — if the current release schedule actually goes to plan.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 runs on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 landed recently, and now I've had time to play with it here's a look at how it runs on Steam Deck and desktop Linux after the update. The good news is: it runs out of the box with Proton. My testing has been with Proton Experimental.</p>
<p><em>Quick tip - want to skip the launcher? Add this as a Steam launch option: <code class="inline-code">--launcher-skip</code></em></p>
<p>For the Steam Deck, I've been testing it on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 Preview</a>, where it does in fact run quite well. On Low and Medium, it can for the most part stay above 30FPS and a lot of the time when you're not doing explosive action in the open world, it can even stick around 40FPS. However, even on the Low settings, intense open world action will bring it down but Medium with FSR2 keeps it pretty smooth.</p>
<p>To give you a good overview, I ran it through a bunch of benchmarks and captured some gameplay that you can view below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f0TxOgF8lYo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b3bc81a4932ad39cbb549912fd82cd4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f0TxOgF8lYo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For desktop Linux (Kubuntu 23.04) the game will run but there's one current major issue: you will probably get stuck with on-screen gamepad icons. This is a <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/pc/sp-technical/issue/2491/update-2-0-known-issues" target="_blank">known issue</a> for the 2.0 update. On Windows they say to restart the game, but on Linux that doesn't fix it. To fix it on Linux, you can edit the Cyberpunk2077.exe file which can be found here (depending on where it's installed): <code class="inline-code">.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Cyberpunk 2077/bin/x64/</code></p>
<p>After backing up your exe, you can run this command on it in terminal to fix it:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">echo '2C45C6: EB' | xxd -r - Cyberpunk2077.exe</code></p>
<p><em>Testing it myself, this done indeed fix the controls! Credit to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1091500/discussions/7/3878218563598783920/?ctp=9#c3878218563605539303" target="_blank">this Steam forum post</a>.</em></p>
<p>As for performance, it seems pretty good. When you consider we're running it through the Proton compatibility layer, it continues to be impressive for such AAA games. On the High details preset, with FSR2 Quality at 2560x1440 I've been seeing above 60FPS and it's really smooth. This is with an AMD Ryzen 5800X + Radeon 6800XT.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10182521121695651723gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10182521121695651723gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Are you jumping in again for 2.0 and the incoming DLC? Or are you about to play it for the first time? Let me know your experiences and thoughts in the comments!</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/cyberpunk_2077" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/cyberpunk-2077?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> (GOG Key) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The DLC, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, releases September 26th.</p>

      <title>Even the Ocean from Analgesic Productions has a source code release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even the Ocean from Melos Han-Tani, Marina Kittaka and Analgesic Productions recently had the source code released. This follows on from them also releasing the source code to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/04/analgesic-productions-have-opened-up-the-source-for-their-zelda-lite-anodyne/" target="_blank">Anodyne back in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>While the source code and assets are now publicly available, it's not open source since it's using a custom license, the same they used for Anodyne which was adapted from the source <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/01/vvvvvv-from-terry-cavanagh-has-the-source-code-opened-up-to-celebrate-the-10-year-anniversary/" target="_blank">code release of VVVVVV</a>. They did initially say it's open source but after feedback they've adjusted it to say it's "99%-open-sourced". As for why it's not fully open source they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Technically it is not “Open Source” because that would require me to give everything away for free. There’s a clause that prevents us from getting screwed by someone just selling the game as-is or copying it completely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Unlike other source releases, they provide the full assets so you could get the entire game free, instead of just the code.</em></p>
<p>What is the game? A physics-shifting puzzle platformer where you'll delve into dangerous power plants and massive creatures! Run into Light and Dark Energy-infused hazards to shift your movement physics to conquer each challenge. Explore towns and cities, and help a world thrown out of balance.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C4DuHzLYUMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f21a1f405f14ec674877674ad5351bc3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C4DuHzLYUMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for why they open source it they mention how they've "always been worried about its future" and that while "the toolchain to compile it is quite stable, it seems to be broken on Mac, and I can’t figure out how to compile it for Linux". The game is built with open tooling like Haxe, OpenFL, and HaxeFlixel so with the code being open it should allow anyone to tinker with it and perhaps even sort out a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Read their <a href="https://melodicambient.substack.com/p/i-open-sourced-even-the-ocean-2016" target="_blank">blog post</a> for more, check it out on <a href="https://github.com/analgesicproductions/Even-The-Ocean-Open-Source" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and the game is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/265470/Even_the_Ocean/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-16 released with tweaks for Genshin Impact, Resident Evil and Wine upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While Valve continues working towards <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/proton-80-4-is-now-in-testing-with-a-release-candidate/" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-4 that has a Release Candidate</a> available, a small but useful update to the community-maintained GE-Proton has been released. GE-Proton 8-16 is on the smaller side but contains some of the usual upgrades to various components.</p>
<p>This is the version of Proton <em>not</em> supported by Valve, so it may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do. To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea. More about Proton can be found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Proton beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>The changes in <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-16" target="_blank">GE-Proton 8-16</a>:</p>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>imported build changes from upstream proton</li>
<li>update wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>updated vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>

      <title>Mesa getting Vulkan performance upgrades for submission merging</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Mike Blumenkrantz, who is one of many under contract by Valve, has released another blog post highlighting another fun optimization from their ongoing Mesa driver work.</p>
<p>The post as usual is highly technical, so if you want to full info <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/tis-the-season/" target="_blank">give it a read</a>. The issue is with how Mesa was dealing with the Vulkan <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/site/guide/latest/queues.html" target="_blank">Queue</a> system, and what they were doing originally seemed to be a bit of a problem where it was "splitting the batched submits into individual ones, each submit also allocates a struct to contain the submit info so that the drivers can use the same interface. So it’s increasing the kernel overhead by performing multiple submits and also increasing memory allocations" with Blumenkrantz mentioning multiple tests that "showcase some driver pain points".</p>
<p>The result is a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25352" target="_blank">pull request</a> (not yet merged) that gives a performance improvement on RADV GFX11 (RDNA3) of 1000% in one case and 50% in another. An impressive win but it continues. On Lavapipe (a CPU-based Software Vulkan driver) it saw a 3000% improvement in one case and a 1000% improvement in another, Intel Arc (Intel DG2) one case saw a 5000% improvement and Turnip A740 had a 4000% improvement and a 3000% improvement for another point.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine hits over 50K euros per month in funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the big winners of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-announced-big-changes-following-the-hated-runtime-fee/" target="_blank">Unity debacle</a> is the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, which has seen its funding soar to a much more impressive level as Unity basically gave them free advertising. Certainly helps that Godot ended up launching their <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">new funding platform</a> on the same day Unity announced their hated Runtime Fee system.</p>
<p>Initially when the Godot developers announced their new funding platform they only had around €25K per month from 438 members. This has now exploded up to €50,323 per month from 1,458 members. A much better and more sustainable amount considering they're building an entire game engine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3126412501695557841gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3126412501695557841gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also recently gained Terraria developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/terraria-developer-re-logic-donates-100k-to-godot-engine-and-fna/" target="_blank">Re-Logic as a Platinum sponsor</a>, as Re-Logic donated $100K along with $1,000 a month in ongoing funding. On top of that developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/robot-gentleman-dev-of-60-seconds-blasts-unity-switches-to-godot-and-increases-funding/" target="_blank">Robot Gentleman of 60 Seconds!</a> has also upped their support of Godot and no doubt plenty of others.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is going to be a turning point, where developers look more to open source tools where feasible instead of locking themselves into proprietary game engines with predatory business practices. Unity has proven multiple times now they're willing to break developer's trust like their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-nuked-their-terms-of-service-on-github-as-views-were-so-low/" target="_blank">messing around with Terms of Services</a>.</p>

      <title>Unity nuked their Terms of Service on GitHub as &#39;views were so low&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The current saga of Unity is not quite over yet, as they're still trying to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-announced-big-changes-following-the-hated-runtime-fee/" target="_blank">clean up</a> developer concerns after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank">botched announcement</a> of the Runtime Fee. One bit currently in the spotlight is their Terms of Service and how they previously pulled the rug from developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">In a previous article</a> I touched on their TOS but to refresh - in <a href="https://blog.unity.com/community/updated-terms-of-service-and-commitment-to-being-an-open-platform" target="_blank">2019</a> they told developers very clearly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you obtain a version of Unity, and don’t upgrade your project, we think you should be able to stick to that version of the TOS.</p>
<p>In practice, that is only possible if you have access to bug fixes. For this reason, we now allow users to continue to use the TOS for the same major (year-based) version number, including Long Term Stable (LTS) builds that you are using in your project.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we will host TOS changes on Github to give developers full transparency about what changes are happening, and when. The link is <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService" target="_blank">https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They later <em>removed</em> that GitHub, stopping their transparency and entirely replaced their TOS with a newer version that completely removed that protection for developers to stick with the terms they accepted for their current version of Unity.</p>
<p>Now they are telling developers as of their latest announcement, that again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We will make sure that you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity editor you are using – as long as you keep using that version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they have now restored that GitHub page but the history on it is gone, as they've started fresh with the current terms, although we can still see previous history on it thanks to the archive on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220716084623/https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/TermsOfService" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
<p>So why did they really remove it? Their newer terms came in on October 13, 2022 so it was <em>quite some time</em> before the newer Runtime Fee announcement. So likely not <em>directly</em> related. The problem is with their promises, the "trust me bro, we really won't do it again, promise" argument they're giving. What assurances do developers actually have that they won't change the TOS on them again to remove protections? There's not really anything.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, on X/Twitter when replying to a developer <a href="https://twitter.com/IndieGameDAV/status/1705297454483095611" target="_blank">asking</a> for a clear answer on how they will guarantee this their questionable and rather laughable <a href="https://twitter.com/unity/status/1705317639478751611" target="_blank">reply</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I totally hear your frustration!❤️<br/>
Just to echo what Marc said, we are so sorry for our earlier actions.</p>
<p>Genuinely disappointed at how our removal of the ToS has been framed across the internet. We removed it way before the pricing change was announced because the views were so low, not because we didn't want people to see it.</p>
<p>And we have heard the concerns from the community about ToS loud and clear. This new Runtime Fee policy will only apply beginning with the next LTS version of Unity shipping in 2024 and beyond. And Marc's response is true, you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity you are using as long as you keep using that version.</p>
<p>We do have a fireside chat ongoing with Marc where he will answer some Q's live, if you aren't happy with my answer, we welcome your attendance and questions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyLcI5O9iUY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyLcI5O9iUY</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/561299421695462567gol1.png"/></p>
<p>I honestly can't believe this is a <em>real</em> post from Unity, but it is. They removed a clear, public and transparent legal document they weren't even hosting directly because the views were low. This isn't a YouTube video, this is legal documentation. It absolutely wasn't because they didn't want developers to clearly see the terms being changed to remove the protection of sticking with the terms of each Unity version was it? No, it <em>can't</em> be that of course, it's because views were <em>low</em>.</p>
<p><em>Don't worry, just trust Unity, they're totally not going to pull any of this again.</em></p>

      <title>Unity announced big changes following the hated Runtime Fee</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the absolute disaster that was their<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-introduces-new-fees-for-game-devs-based-on-revenue-and-game-installs/" target="_blank"> original Runtime Fee announcement</a>, Unity have now put up <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/open-letter-on-runtime-fee" target="_blank">another apology and announced</a> what the new plan is going forward.</p>
<p>Their new plan will keep Unity Personal free and there's <em>no</em> Runtime Fee for games made with it. The revenue cap there is also moving up to $200,000 and they're removing the requirement to show the Made with Unity splash screen. Additionally, no game earning less than $1 million in a 12 month period will be subject to the Runtime Fee.</p>
<p>For developers on Unity pro and Enterprise, the Runtime Fee will now only apply with the next LTS version of Unity shipping in 2024. So existing games and games with older Unity versions will not be included (unless developers choose to upgrade).</p>
<p>Unity said they will also "make sure that you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity editor you are using – as long as you keep using that version", so they won't change the terms for existing users. Although, we've heard that before and they changed their mind as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-attempt-to-clarify-new-install-fees-as-developers-revolt/" target="_blank">I noted in a previous article</a>.</p>
<p>For games that are subject to their new Runtime Fee, they will offer a choice of either a 2.5% revenue share "or the calculated amount based on the number of new people engaging with your game each month" and those numbers will be self-reported by developers and they will "always" be billed the lesser amount.</p>
<p>They're also inviting developers to a <a class="text-charcoal underline" href="https://youtube.com/live/qyLcI5O9iUY" target="_blank">live fireside chat</a> hosted by Jason Weimann today at 8 PM UTC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15736440121695404238gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15736440121695404238gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured Credit - Unity</em></p>
<p>As for how Unity will calculate the Runtime Fee from the FAQ it states: "While we always recommend you supply your own data, in the absence of that, we will use our own data from Unity services that you have agreed to integrate into your project, and readily available external data." and they also confirmed the Unity Runtime does not phone home by default unless developers have hardware stats enabled.</p>
<p>The new plan that has a <a href="https://unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">fresh policy page here</a> is a lot better that's for sure but is it enough? Their original announcement and the anger it caused for developers has broken a lot of trust.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Microsoft - keep your filthy hands off Valve, leak shows MSFT would buy Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's certainly an article title isn't it. But I mean it. Microsoft, don't you dare touch Valve. You're fat enough already and too big as it is, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/microsoft-buyout-of-activision-gets-closer-uk-cma-consulting-further/" target="_blank">Activision purchase clearly about to happen</a>.</p>
<p>"Liam, what's got you all like this?!", I hear you all asking. Well, remember that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/microsoft-leak-shows-fallout-3-and-oblivion-remasters-doom-year-zero-and-more/" target="_blank">recent Microsoft leak</a> that showed off a bunch of potential game releases? There was a lot more to the leak overall you see, and some of it a little <em>disturbing</em> for the industry. In an email from Phil Spencer spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880146/phil-spencer-microsoft-xbox-acquiring-nintendo" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, there was talk about their plans including wanting to buy up the likes of Nintendo and even Valve with Spencer noting "But our BoD has seen the full writeup on Nintendo (and Valve) and they are fully supportive on either if opportunity arises as am I" (BoD being Board of Directors).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9463520661695400942gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9463520661695400942gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Leaked 2020 email, credit to The Verge</em></p>
<p>Could you imagine the disaster it would be if Microsoft acquired Valve? There's just so many ways that would become incredibly problematic and wow — what a monopoly that would make huh? Not that Valve has <em>any</em> need at all to sell, they pretty much print money thanks to their 30% cut from most developers on Steam. Valve is also privately owned, so they can do whatever the heck they want. Valve are far from perfect, but competition is <em>good</em> and <em>necessary</em> and them joining together would really mess the industry up.</p>
<p>You might remember that "<a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2015/05/06/microsoft-loves-linux/" target="_blank">Microsoft Loves Linux</a>", but the <em>reality</em> is they like Linux when it makes them money. If the above ever were to happen, it's not really likely they would continue all of Valve's big investments into Linux given how even with the Steam Deck the market is small. After all, Valve put all these resources into Linux because they don't want to be entirely at the whims of Microsoft for their store, and Valve clearly want their own platform so Linux with Proton + Steam Deck is key to that. And maybe even more when we find out what the heck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Galileo and Sephiroth</a> are.</p>
<p>So, Microsoft, <em>please</em> continue to keep your filthy hands off Valve (but keep putting your games on Steam okay? thanks).</p>

      <title>Lies of P is running great on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for a fresh soulslike? Lies of P released recently from NEOWIZ, and thankfully it really does run nicely overall on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. <em>Note: Key provided to me by ICOPartners.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "You are a puppet created by Geppetto who’s caught in a web of lies with unimaginable monsters and untrustworthy figures standing between you and the events that have befallen the world of Lies of P.</p>
<p>You are awakened by a mysterious voice that guides you through the plagued city of Krat - a once lively place that has been poisoned by madness and bloodlust. In our soulslike, you must adapt yourself and your weapons to face untold horrors, untangle the unfathomable secrets of the city's elites and choose whether to confront predicaments with the truth or weave lies to overcome them on the journey to find yourself."</p>
<p>When it comes to the Steam Deck, plenty of new releases don't exactly run well. As we've seen with the likes of Starfield, Jedi Survivor and more — optimization on the lower-end has become a problem. So nothing is guaranteed which is why it's nice to see Lies of P not only running but being smooth too! Here's a video with a little benchmark and then some gameplay to show on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 Preview</a> with Proton Experimental:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="X0raH_1KbA4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb9a7f2d2ba87215ac78db2ee8d41488.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/X0raH_1KbA4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For Steam Deck I would <em>suggest</em> the picking the Medium preset, and you can happily bump up the Visibility and Texture Quality settings to High, keeping on FSR 2 and it runs nicely at 40-45Hz locked in the Steam Deck performance menu.</p>
<p>When it comes to desktop Linux again using Proton Experimental, AMD Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800XT with Mesa 23.1.8 on Kubuntu 23.04 it is very much click and play again. It's pretty rare for a more powerful system on desktop to have much trouble with new releases on Proton now which is a great place to be. But given how well optimized Lies of P appears given how it runs on Steam Deck - how well does it run here? Quite impressive actually.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16064783181695395169gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16064783181695395169gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2039258591695395168gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2039258591695395168gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16337840931695395166gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16337840931695395166gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13378988381695395320gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13378988381695395320gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Testing it on the "Best" graphics preset with FSR2 on Quality at 2560x1440, it's been mostly sat around 180FPS in the smaller areas dipping down to around 140FPS in more intense areas.</p>
<p>It's not often that I actually get on well with soulslike games but Lies of P feels accessible, and I actually found myself enjoying my time with the exploration and combat that I don't usually get with other similar titles. The setting is quite interesting too giving a very alternative and clever take on Pinocchio.</p>
<p>Overall I really love it and think you will too if you usually enjoy soulslikes, and perhaps even if you don't. It's certainly not an easy game though, it is designed to be challenging!</p>
<p>You can buy Lies of P on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lies-of-p?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627720/Lies_of_P" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Microsoft&#39;s buyout of Activision gets closer with the UK CMA consulting further</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The long saga of Microsoft buying up Activision Blizzard took another step forward, with the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) now consulting on remedies Microsoft put forward to address the CMA's concerns.</p>
<p>Something to be clear on though, is that it has <em>not</em> yet been approved. The CMA simply said that the changes Microsoft put down "opens the door to the deal being cleared". The main concerns from the CMA were on cloud gaming, so under the new plan Ubisoft will have the right to cloud gaming from Activision instead. From the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-microsoft-activision-deal-addresses-previous-cma-concerns-in-cloud-gaming" target="_blank">CMA Press Release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast to the original deal, Microsoft will no longer control cloud gaming rights for Activision’s content, so would not be in a position to limit access to Activision’s key content to its own cloud gaming service or to withhold those games from rivals. Unlike the remedies the CMA previously rejected, Ubisoft will be free to offer Activision’s games both directly to consumers and to all cloud gaming service providers however it chooses, including for buy-to-play or multigame subscription services, or any new model for providing content that might emerge as the market develops. The deal with Ubisoft also requires Microsoft to port Activision games to operating systems other than Windows and support game emulators when requested, addressing the other main shortcoming with the previous remedies package.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When looking into <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/650d2efd52e73c000d9426a1/Notice_of_consultation_on_undertakings_in_lieu_PDFA_B.pdf" target="_blank">fineprint</a> on the decision, even Proton got mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft must port Activision Games to non-Windows OS following a request from Ubisoft. Ubisoft may also request that Microsoft perform technical modifications, including to ensure that the Activision Games support emulators like Proton. Microsoft must carry out this work at its regular pace and at a quality and standard which is customary in the gaming industry. Microsoft can only charge Ubisoft for the reasonable costs incurred for this work. Microsoft is also required to provide Ubisoft with development and porting plans for Activision Games reasonably in advance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>They called Proton an "emulator" though…best not to argue on what exactly Proton is right now.</em></p>
<p>Why would Ubisoft want Activision games to run well on Proton? Well, that depends who they would license the games to for streaming via cloud gaming (as that's what all this is about). Some cloud gaming providers that end up working with Ubisoft to provide Activision games might run their services on Linux systems.</p>
<p>However, the CMA are not <em>entirely</em> convinced just yet. As they said while it makes "important changes" they still have "limited residual concern" that Ubisoft's streaming rights could be "circumvented, terminated, or not enforced". So Microsoft has again offered remedies to ensure this can be enforced by the CMA.</p>
<p>There's now a consultation going on until October 6th on the proposed remedies so we should hear back sometime around then on the deal finally being approved or not. The final deadline is October 18th.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Brad Smith <a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1705107310073512252" target="_blank">said</a> on X: "We are encouraged by this positive development in the CMA’s review process. We presented solutions that we believe fully address the CMA’s remaining concerns related to cloud game streaming, and we will continue to work toward earning approval to close prior to the October 18 deadline."</p>

      <title>Steam Deck and SteamOS are great for Linux as a whole - Open Source Summit Europe 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At the recent <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/" target="_blank">Open Source Summit Europe 2023</a>, Alberto Garcia a software engineer at <a href="https://www.igalia.com/" target="_blank">Igalia</a> did a talk covering Valve, Steam Deck, SteamOS and how it all helps Linux as a whole.</p>
<p>For people who understand Linux and open source, a lot of this would be pretty obvious but it's always nice to have a refresher from people who work with Valve - talking about how good it is to have all the Valve funding, and how having SteamOS Linux shipping on widely available consumer devices like the Steam Deck is great for Linux in general.</p>
<p>Giving a nice overview reminding people that SteamOS is actually a pretty standard Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, with some customizations and a full KDE Plasma desktop mode. It also goes over: Wine and Valve's funding of Proton working with CodeWeavers, Valve's funding work for Linux kernel improvements like the new futex API, work to solve filename case sensitivity in ext4 to extend it to support case insensitive like Windows (so games can work properly through Wine / Proton), various work on graphics drivers like AMD RADV, the ACO shader compiler, Vulkan Video extensions, advanced colour and HDR, better handling of GPU resets, Gamescope, supporting Flatpak by default on SteamOS and much more.</p>
<p>The main overall point is that Valve contributes a lot, it's all open source and Valve's philosophy is "upstream everything" which improves Linux for everyone everywhere.</p>
<p>The full talk can be seen below with the Steam Deck / SteamOS bit starting at 4:12:07 and ending 4:47:00.</p>

      <title>Valve overhauled Steam Deck &#39;As Mouse&#39; Gyro option in new Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even though Valve only just recently put <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 into preview for Steam Deck</a>, they're not done with improvements elsewhere with a new Beta Client release doing a bit of a Gyro overhaul to the Mouse mode.</p>
<p>Specifically it's a revamp of the Gyro "As Mouse" mode. Here's all the Steam Input changes from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/6816816781639310329?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">September 18th update</a>:</p>

<li>This is a renovation of the gyro "As Mouse" mode.</li>
<li>Expect frequent changes to UI and behavior while we evaluate this new replacement. ("As Mouse" will remain for now.)</li>
<li>Natural Sensitivity Scale: use "Pixels Per 360°" to calibrate both the Flick Stick and Gyro's real world angles into in-game angles. In this way, your Gyro Natural Sensitivity Multiplier can be consistent across games, with "Pixels Per 360°" being the isolated tuning value for each game.</li>
<li>1€ Filter: Smoothed low level gyro noise without adding delay.</li>
<li>Speed Deadzones and Precision Zones will allow you to tune preferences for hand shake during fine aim.</li>
<li>Yaw vs. Roll Blend: you can now blend between "Yaw" or "Roll" mode.</li>
<li>Gyro Momentum Option: releasing your gyro activation button can maintain some rotation from the gyro. Tune the momentum on independent axes to bias toward horizontal movement vs vertical movement.</li>
<li>Gyro sensor timestamps are now used resulting in better overall accuracy of the Gyro.</li>
<li>Gyro over Bluetooth improvements - gyro motion is extrapolated when Bluetooth packets are delayed, resulting in smoother movement. Any error incurred is corrected gradually over time, during high speed movement to avoid "Ouija effect" during precise aiming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed Roll axis on Steam Deck for legacy "As Mouse".</li>
<li>Fix delayed input when opening the standalone On-Screen Keyboard</li>
<li>Fix for Razer Wolverine V2 Pro Dualsense gyro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick follow-up release went out after that also had one change <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3741984674870616551?snr=2_9_100015_" target="_blank">noting</a> "Fix default orientation for Steam Deck and Steam Link Mobile App controllers in the new Gyro To Mouse mode".</p>
<p>Have any of you been playing with this newer Gyro mode? Let me know what you think in the comments. Gyro is one thing I just don't do on Steam Deck - as it feels like my brain just gets confused by it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck a &#39;stable target for a couple years&#39; so no Steam Deck 2 for a while</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently at the Tokyo Game Show Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais spoke to CNBC about PC gaming and Steam Deck, here's what was said during the interview.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, this was only posted to <a href="https://twitter.com/StreetSignsCNBC/status/1704971310361629080" target="_blank">X/Twitter</a> and the audio quality is not the best due to background noise and the first part the interview is simply giving an overview of what the Steam Deck can do and provide for gamers. The interesting bits come later so here's just a quick quote summary of quotes from Griffais:</p>
<ul>
<li>When talking about the power of SteamOS - "we would like to work with other hardware manufacturers, so they can adopt SteamOS in the future".</li>
<li>On VR: "for Steam Deck we don't really have a VR story to it, but it's definitely something we want to explore more in the future".</li>
<li>For the future: "we're not really seeing growth stop after COVID, so for us it's really important to keep working on the current version of the Steam Deck, put together software updates we just released a big <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/steam-deck-os-35-now-in-preview-with-hdr-vrr-and-display-colour-settings/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5 update</a> that's added new features we're going to keep doing that - but also work on the hardware side supply chain, retail presence, work with distributors to get the Deck available worldwide and expand its audience so we're going to be focusing on that short term - in the future we're looking at the PC market and where technology is going and see if there's any interesting opportunities there".</li>
<li>When asked about console cycles, games being higher-end and Steam Deck upgrades: "right now we're looking at this performance target that we have as a stable target for a couple years, we think that it's a pretty sweet spot in terms of being able to play all the experiences from this new generation and so far the new releases coming out have been great experiences on Steam Deck. We're working with developers on future releases and we're monitoring the feedback there but so far it's been pretty good on the horsepower front".</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Even though Valve say the current Steam Deck is their stable target for a couple of years, it was originally released in February 2022 so it will already be 2 years old next February. So could we potentially see a Steam Deck 2 in 2025? Seems like that might be a good time for it.</p>
<p>Clearly the current generation has a lot of life left in it and Valve plan to continue to upgrade the software and just keep expanding the availability of the current Steam Deck. And if they do get a more generic SteamOS install out, pulling in new hardware vendors would be great for consumer choice.</p>
<p>We have seen some teasers for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/linux-updates-tease-valve-galileo-and-sephiroth-steam-deck-refresh-or-new-vr/" target="_blank">Valve <em>Galileo</em> and <em>Sephiroth</em></a> though so something is cooking, although it's very likely new VR hardware.</p>

      <title>Paradox and C Prompt team up for Millennia and it looks very Civilization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Civilization is that you? No wait it's Millennia, a new 4x strategy game announced today by Paradox Interactive who have teamed up with C Prompt Games and it does look quite interesting but it's going to get heavy Civ comparisons.</p>
<p>C Prompt Games includes people who have worked on games like Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology and Starcraft II, as well as Orcs Must Die helmed by veteran strategy game developers Rob Fermier, Ian Fischer and Brian Sousa. The first announcement teaser is below but it doesn't really give you much:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vx0NBKcVlH4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a02cc8d761cdffe148b62c8988b9fbc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vx0NBKcVlH4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features of Millennia include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>History and Alternate History: Lead your people through ten historical ages, steer your timeline into the uncharted alternate history of a Variant Age or the danger and opportunity of a Crisis Age. Each Age involves unique rules, units, buildings, goods, and challenges, which can alter the path of history.</li>
<li>National Spirits: Decide what your Nation is famous for by selecting National Spirits and using the bonuses they provide to achieve your goals.  Combine multiple National Spirits as you progress through history to craft a unique civilization in every game.</li>
<li>Domains: Invest in six different Domains that influence the focus of your Nation – Exploration, Government, Warfare, Diplomacy, Engineering, and Arts.  The better you provide for each, the more your Nation can make use of unique Domain Powers.  Everything from claiming territory, to adopting new governments, to spreading religion, to reinforcing Armies flows from mastery of the Domains.</li>
<li>Deep Economy: Design your economy to support your strategy.  Gather raw materials, then build Improvements to refine basic Goods like logs or iron into lumber, paper, books, ingots, tools, or weapons – specialized products that allow you to improve and adjust your economic engine to suit whatever history sends your way.</li>
<li>Army Based Combat: Customize your approach to war by combining individual Units into powerful Armies.  Each Unit influences the capabilities of its Army, allowing you to employ a vast number of varied strategies.  Once in conflict, watch the action unfold through the Combat Viewer, where battles play out and provide details on how different Armies perform.</li>
<li>And more: discover natural landmarks, build the Pyramids, compete in the space race, finance expeditions, survive plagues, use diplomacy to your advantage, defeat barbarians, unleash innovations, deal with alien visitors, govern underwater cities, manage air combat, and master a host of other historical-themed content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The screenshots on Steam give a better look:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15871724921695325820gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15871724921695325820gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20649867231695325822gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20649867231695325822gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No word on system support yet other than "PC". Generally games outside of Paradox Development Studios directly don't do Native Linux support, so it's likely one to run with Proton.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268590/Millennia/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper gets a mod SDK and mod.io support + Shimmering Frontier update due October 4th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The wonderful mining, exploration and crafting game Core Keeper just got a big upgrade adding in modding support via mod.io, there's a new modding SDK and next month a new free expansion launches.</p>
<p>For the modding support that's out now they went with <a href="https://mod.io/g/corekeeper" target="_blank">mod.io</a>, a cross-platform solution for modding from the Mod DB crew and it's integrated into the game directly, so you can browse and install mods directly (on top of viewing via the website). As for the SDK, it's built on Unity.</p>
<p>As for the upcoming free expansion it was previously known as the Crystal Biome, but the new name is Shimmering Frontier that will arrive on October 4th. It looks like a rather blue and shiny area that will come with the new Solarite Ore to let you craft new armour, tools and equipment to expand your adventuring. There's also going to be new enemies and a whole bunch of content sprinkled throughout the game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9JUQYpWrbDY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e27e251dab80d8971f671c4b71437f91.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9JUQYpWrbDY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Developing the Shimmering Frontier has been an amazing journey for us at Pugstorm. You might remember this one as the ‘Crystal Update’ that we announced all the way back in our first Early Access roadmap, and we know that this is the one you’ve all been waiting for. This update went through plenty of designs and iterations, carefully balancing community-requested features, heaps of new content, and references to the game’s lore until we felt like it was just right!<br/>
” - Sven Thole, Pugstorm COO.</p>
<p>Core Keeper is available to buy from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/core-keeper?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The game has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Squad-tactics heist RPG &#39;Cyber Knights: Flashpoint&#39; launches October 17th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trese Brothers have now <a href="https://mastodon.social/@TreseBrothers/111103591020803596" target="_blank">announced</a> that their cyberpunk Squad-tactics heist RPG Cyber Knights: Flashpoint is going to launch on October 17th. This follows multiple impressive demos shown off during recent Steam festivals, where they were repeatedly improving it based on feedback so hopefully the full release is looking good.</p>
<p>Most recent trailer (few months old, but gives a good enough look at it) is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Zhuy_W3cAmA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fff425f315fc1414a5fe08987225a7d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Zhuy_W3cAmA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>3rd Person Turn-based Squad Tactics</strong>: The best of modern tactical RPGs—gridless movement, cover &amp; overwatch, initiative manipulation and more. Outsmart enemy security with creative stealth &amp; hacking or go loud with powerful weapons &amp; abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Cyberpunk Stories</strong>: Contacts, squad members, and world events will weave together in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1021210/announcements/detail/1701735458164171772" target="_blank">stories reminiscent of the pen and paper cyberpunk RPGs</a> we played for years while building the lore of this world.</li>
<li><strong>Thrill of the Heist</strong>: Choose your jobs &amp; work your network for advantages to pull this off. Get the crew you’ll need &amp; gear them up. Finally, look for ways to score a little more—what’s the worst that could happen?</li>
<li><strong>Power-Player Strategy</strong>: Balance factions, favors, reputation and more. Rivals, fixers, arms dealers and corporate big shots... who you work for, who you fail or betray, all of it can open and close opportunities for you. Watch your heat, and try to make sure more people owe you than the other way around.</li>
<li><strong>Endless Builds</strong>: Experiment with endless combinations of talents, multi-classing, cyberware, weapons and gear to build the perfect team.</li>
<li><strong>Safehouse Base Building</strong>: Build out your safehouse and upgrade rooms such as weapon shop, hund kennel and medical bay.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving Characters</strong>: The jobs you take have consequences for both your crew and connections. Loyalty, traits, cybernetics and escapes—you might get offworld in the end, but will any of you be the same?</li>
</ul>

      <title>MonoGame plan to create a non-profit foundation to support development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The fallout from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">big Unity mess</a> continues, with the <a href="https://www.monogame.net/" target="_blank">MonoGame</a> team jumping in to present a new plan for the future of this open-source and cross-platform framework for game developers.</p>
<p>If you've not actually heard of MonoGame you've likely still played something originally created with it including the likes of Bastion, Streets of Rage 4, Chasm, FEZ, Axiom Verge, Stardew Valley, Tooth and Tail and a great many more (although some moved to <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a>). That's just a few taking from their limited <a href="https://www.monogame.net/showcase/" target="_blank">showcase</a> page.</p>
<p>As for what they're planning: a lot! They're going to create a non-profit foundation, to ensure it remains open-source and free for all users. Their <a href="https://community.monogame.net/t/update-on-monogames-status/19457" target="_blank">statement</a> in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the light of the recent news in the game industry and to reassure the community about our commitment, the MonoGame Team would like to share its future plans. The team wishes the MonoGame Framework to become future-proof, both from a technical and governance perspective.</p>
<p>This new era of the open-source project will see the creation of a non-profit foundation to which all rights and properties will be transferred to, with the aim of ensuring MonoGame remains open-source, and free for all and any scenario, including on consoles.</p>
<p>This foundation will allow the adoption of a more sustainable model and will open MonoGame to be supported by more patrons. A new board will be created within this organization with the task to define which projects to undertake, and how they may be funded, transparently.</p>
<p>We will discuss the roadmap at a later time, but we can already state that MonoGame’s goals will be set with regard to the quality of developer onboarding for the framework, its stability and console support of the current version, and the start of a new iteration to further expand MonoGame’s reach and capabilities.</p>
<p>We will communicate the progress of this transition based on developments in future announcements.</p>
<p>We look forward to everyone joining us on this new and exciting chapter.</p>
<p>The MonoGame Team.</p>

      <title>We may see Counter-Strike 2 release next week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you ready for the next generation competitive FPS from Valve? Well, next week you might be able to jump into Counter-Strike 2.</p>
<p>On X (Twitter), the official Counter-Strike account <a href="https://twitter.com/CounterStrike/status/1704541038633959492" target="_blank">posted</a> "What are you doing next Wednesday?" (September 27th), teasing that something is coming and it's not really hard to guess what that will be.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9850484111695311434gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Likely either an open Beta of Counter-Strike 2 for anyone to jump in, or a proper release if they think it's ready enough. <em>Hopefully Valve will also properly put up the Linux version too!</em></p>
<p>Valve said originally that CS2 would release in the Summer, but they've only done a Limited Test gradually inviting more players in so far. At release CS2 will be a free upgrade and replacement for Global Offensive, which is over 10 years old at this point so no doubt many are keen to see all the improvements.</p>
<p>Recently Valve also announced CS Rating — a precise display of your skill in Counter-Strike 2:</p>

      <title>Valve put up dates for 2024 Steam sales and events</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is no wallet safe? 2024 is already looking busy on Steam, with Valve giving out dates for various events they plan to run including Steam Next Fest. Valve run quite a lot of themed events now, so they're giving developers (and your wallet) plenty of time to prepare.</p>

      <title>GNOME 45 released with dynamic workspace indicator, camera indicator and much more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GNOME 45 has just been released and overall it looks like a rather nice release for this desktop environment, so here's a short run over what's new.</p>
<p>One of the major changes is the replacement of the Activities corner button on the top bar with a dynamic workspace indicator. It's a small change but looks pretty sleek to give you an idea of where you are at a glance in your workspaces. They also improved search performance across a range of apps like Software, Characters, Clocks, Files, and Calculator. Another great addition is an indicator for when a camera is in use, so no more sneaky camera activations as it should be clearer when one is being used but it's only available for apps using the latest camera tech like <a href="https://pipewire.org/" target="_blank">Pipewire</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="47aZgF6xmS0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19415940e9ebc6b86f48993a8256fb73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/47aZgF6xmS0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some other enhancements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keyboard backlight quick setting</strong>: the quick settings menu now includes a button for controlling keyboard backlights.</li>
<li><strong>Efficient video playback and recording</strong>: when possible, GNOME will now use hardware resources when playing videos and creating screen recordings. This is faster and uses less power.</li>
<li><strong>New quick settings keyboard shortcut</strong>: you can now use the new <em>Super+S</em> key combination to open and close the quick settings menu.</li>
<li><strong>Updated pointer visuals</strong>: GNOME’s pointers (also known as cursors) have a great new look for GNOME 45.</li>
<li><strong>Light system style</strong>: GNOME has a new option to give the system a light interface style, as opposed to the default dark look. This can be enabled using <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6198/light-style/" target="_blank">an extension</a> or from the command line with:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme prefer-light</code><br/>
Further integration is being investigated for future releases.</li>
<li><strong>New wallpapers</strong>: two beautiful new images were added to GNOME’s collection of backgrounds.</li>
<li><strong>Wayland support for <a href="https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap" target="_blank">Input Leap</a></strong>: this provides a software implementation of KVM-switch like functionality, allowing multiple computers to be controlled from a single keyboard and mouse. GNOME 45 allows this software to be used with modern Wayland sessions.</li>
<li><strong>Smoother pointer movement</strong>: performance improvements mean that the pointer will move smoothly even when the computer is busy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That last one above may sound familiar, as it's something the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/plasma-6-optimized-for-wayland-gaming-plus-compositor-crash-recovery/" target="_blank">KDE team also focused on recently</a>. Having a smooth desktop under load is quite essential!</p>
<p>Of course there's plenty more — check it out on their <a href="https://release.gnome.org/45/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>When you get it all depends on what distribution you're on, as they all have different release schedules.</p>

      <title>Halo: The Master Chief Collection multiplayer seems broken on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Posted on <a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1704979565318418783" target="_blank">X</a>, the Halo Support account mentioned they're looking into it - "The #HaloMCC team is investigating reports that players on Steam Deck are experiencing Easy Anti-Cheat error messages after Tuesday's update. Stay tuned for updates on this bug investigation."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12843613521695335386gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12843613521695335386gol1.png"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>After a recent update Halo: The Master Chief Collection seems to have broken online play support for Steam Deck due to Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>If you remember, back in April they did <a href="https://twitter.com/HaloSupport/status/1643688636091863040" target="_blank">announce</a> Steam Deck support for online play and put up a <a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/14589112499348" target="_blank">support article</a> for it. This came with a few minor issues, like needing to pick the Steam launch option that actually says it's <em>off</em> (the options were backwards). Since the update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/976730/view/6739129688073805114" target="_blank">September 19th</a>, it just doesn't work with Easy Anti-Cheat errors.</p>
<p>When you go to launch multiplayer from the main menu with the option that has anti-cheat turned on you'll see an error like this when you try to go into multiplayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11659869531695236516gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11659869531695236516gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>And when picking the Steam launch option with anti-cheat off, which going by their support article is still the option to actually use to have it enabled as it's backwards, you're met with this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11933832251695236516gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11933832251695236516gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by the error messages, it seems like they may have put the Steam options actually the right way around now but broke it in the process. I've tested this myself across both Proton 8 and Proton Experimental and neither works. Restarting it doesn't change anything, rebooting the Steam Deck doesn't help either.</p>
<p>Lots of people on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/16nh6ai/why_did_mcc_suddenly_break/?sort=new" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have noticed it and report the same issue (but a few note oddly it still works for them?), so hopefully Microsoft / 343 will fix whatever they did soon. I've reached out to their teams to see what's going on - will update if I get any reply.</p>

      <title>Robot Gentleman dev of 60 Seconds! blasts Unity, switches to Godot and increases funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The fallout from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">Unity's recent ridiculous pricing changes</a> and terrible communication continues, with developer Robot Gentleman now waving goodbye to Unity and joining up with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>. Robot Gentleman created the popular 60! series like 60 Seconds!, 60 Parsecs! and 60 Seconds! Reatomized.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/robotgentleman/status/1704495631010816030" target="_blank">statement</a> posted on X (Twitter) they said (copied into text, as it's an image):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recent Unity runtime fee license change and the way it was introduced has been a shocking development for all of us at Robot Gentleman. The predatory nature of this misguided decision poses a significant threat to the work and independence of many game developers, including ourselves. We do not accept this, and we cannot simply stand by, watching this outrageous violation of trust.</p>
<p>We are bidding adieu to Unity. For good.</p>
<p>Our next project, which has been in development for 4 years, will be migrated to the Godot Game Engine. Furthermore, all our released games from the 60! series will be ported away from Unity as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But there is more. We have been supporting Godot financially since July 2022. We have now decided to increase our support to 1500$/month, effectively redirecting the value of our Unity licenses to Godot. Our engineers will also contribute to the development of the engine, as we pursue our next and future projects in Godot.</p>
<p>The chosen direction is challenging, but in the face of Unity's conduct this was the only decision to be made. This change is likely to introduce a few twists and turns and cause delays in our ongoing projects. However, once we navigate this transition, we believe we will find ourselves in a much better space to continue our independent journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot of developers looking at alternative game engines and tech now to move away from Unity. This seems to have been a wake-up call for many on how the rug can be pulled from them when relying on proprietary software. Like how Terraria developer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/terraria-developer-re-logic-donates-100k-to-godot-engine-and-fna/" target="_blank">Re-Logic just donated $100K to Godot + FNA</a> and will continue funding monthly.</p>
<p>Expect more of this to come. Even if Unity change their tune — the damage is done.</p>
<p>You can check out the games from Robot Gentleman on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/games?developers=robot-gentleman" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/search?sort=bestselling&amp;developer=Robot%20Gentleman&amp;page=1&amp;partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/RobotGentleman" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Story focused point-and-click horror adventure Somnipathy is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battle against Sleep Paralysis, Restless Leg Syndrome and Night Terrors in the story focused point-and-click horror adventure Somnipathy. Certainly sounds like a rather unusual setting, although that makes it all the more intriguing. </p>
<p>"Each night point-and-click Aggy through Somnipathy - a creepy and surreal dungeon crawling thriller -while utilizing each day to prepare. If you fail, there’s always tomorrow… right?"</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Survive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use every day to prepare for the night. Go to your job, talk to people, buy gear, and explore the world you take for granted.</li>
<li>Every night the enemy returns - avoid monsters, solve puzzles, and go a little further than the night before.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Pursue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Outsmart your pursuer - tireless and relentless, you'll need every trick in the book to defeat them.</li>

<li>Play Score attack mode. How long can you withstand sleeplessness? Be the very best... In. The. World!</li>
<li>Dive into the twisted world of Somnipathy.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2069260/Somnipathy/" target="_blank">pick it up on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and there's also a demo available, with the developer explaining they expect a full first run to take between 10-15 hours.</p>
<p><em>It was also made in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> so good to see more games release with it!</em></p>

      <title>Mortal Kombat 1 released and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mortal Kombat 1 from NetherRealm Studios, QLOC and Warner Bros. Games has now released and it has been rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve being able to do some early verification for another big game release. Interestingly, 6 days ago it was only rated as Playable. However Valve re-tested it yesterday and decided to bump it up to Verified with the currently unreleased <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/proton-80-4-is-now-in-testing-with-a-release-candidate/" target="_blank">Proton 8.0-4 that's now in testing</a>. Reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1971870?device=pc" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> for desktop Linux are also quite favourable on it! So it's nice to see another release doing well for all types of Linux gamers.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MYa7L4jp11E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/725a778ea6c3364799cc9a59533da7f2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MYa7L4jp11E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you've picked it up for desktop or Steam Deck, feel free to comment your experiences with it. Not one I'm personally interested in, fighting games like this just aren't my cuppa. Amplified by the ridiculous pricing. It's £59.99 at a minimum and that doesn't even include all the characters, it's actually £84.99 for the Premium Edition if you want more, or there's various DLC (included in Premium) adding up to £67.95 to buy separately. Two of the DLC are just single characters, each at £6.49 — it feels overly greedy.</p>
<p>So far it has gained a <em>Mostly Positive</em> rating from over two thousand user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>Available to buy from <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/mortal-kombat-1?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/mortal-kombat-1?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton 8.0-4 is now in testing with a Release Candidate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve snuck out a Release Candidate build for Proton 8.0-4 last week, which brings with it many improvements to the main stable version of the Windows compatibility layer for Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>It's in the RC stage, as Valve are looking for feedback on any issues that weren't present in 8.0-3. Currently there's not many comments, so perhaps it needs a few more eyes to test your favourite games and report back any new problems. To access it select Proton 8 in your Steam Library, go into Properties -&gt; Betas and select the "release-candidate" option.</p>
<p>Here's everything changed in it (which may be different when fully released):</p>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Have a Nice Death no longer crashes on launch.</li>
<li>Using re4_tweaks no longer breaks mouse support in Resident Evil 4 (2005).</li>

<li>Fixed videos in Empyrion - Galactic Survival not working on certain setups.</li>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7095" target="_blank">RC on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>There's no set date for Proton 8.0-4 to release for everyone. When Valve did the RC for Proton 8.0-3, it took over a month to release in full. And looking back, some previous RCs took even longer <em>but</em> then there's been other times where it was only a week. So basically "when it's ready".</p>

      <title>Terraria dev Re-Logic donates $100K to Godot Engine and FNA, plus ongoing funding</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking a firm stand against <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/unity-considers-tentative-changes-to-controversial-policies/" target="_blank">what Unity have been doing</a>, Terraria developer Re-Logic announced today they've begun funding <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> with a big donation to each <em>and</em> ongoing funding.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1704227519027651016" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (Twitter), it reads as follows (copied into text, as it was an image statement):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The team at Re-Logic has been watching the recent events surrounding Unity with both interest and sadness. The loss of a formerly-leading and user-friendly game engine to the darker forces that negatively impact so much of the gaming industry has left us dismayed to put it mildly. While we do not personally use Unity (outside of a few elements on our console/mobile platforms), we feel like we cannot sit idly by as these predatory moves are made against studios everywhere.</p>
<p>We unequivocally condemn and reject the recent TOS/fee changes proposed by Unity and the underhanded way they were rolled out. The flippant manner with which years of trust cultivated by Unity were cast aside for yet another way to squeeze publishers, studios, and gamers is the saddest part. That this move was wholly unnecessary pushes things into the tragedy category - a cautionary tale the industry will not soon forget.</p>
<p>We do not feel that a simple public statement is sufficient. Even if Unity were to recant their policies and statements, the destruction of trust is not so easily repaired. We strongly feel that it is now equally important to get behind some of the other up and-coming open source game engines. Lighting some candles in an otherwise dark moment.</p>
<p>To that end, we are donating $100,000 to each of the open source engines listed below. Additionally, we are sponsoring each of these projects with $1,000/month each moving forward. All we ask in return is that they remain good people and keep doing all that they can to make these engines powerful and approachable for developers everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17879634681695157671gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Re-Logic has always been supportive of game developers and indie studios that do things the right way. We feel that our actions in this moment are the best way to carry that mission forward - by accelerating and strengthening competing open source game engines, we hope to empower and assist studios that are struggling with how best to proceed given these recent events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's amazing to see so many people in the industry come together like this. Looking across X (Twitter), there's been a big wave of developers trying out and attempting ports to game engines like Godot so even more backing for it and other open source projects is fantastic. Hopefully this continues to be a wake up call for the industry to rely a little less on proprietary software.</p>
<p>Since the initial uproar over Unity, we've seen the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine funding</a> go from around €25K per month to €44K, which is a change from around 438 members to 1,119 members.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Beacon Patrol based on the popular board game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a planned full release in 2024, developers BrutalHack and Shapes and Dreams have put up a demo for Beacon Patrol - a relaxing game all about exploring the ocean. It's actually a digital adaption of the board game of the same name, one that's quite highly rated too.</p>
<p>You play as the captain of the Coast Guard, as you navigate the North Sea to secure its beacon buoys, lighthouses and waterways. You do so by placing down tiles to gradually expand the map to explore. Each turn you place up to three tiles, connecting to the tile your ship is currently on and then move across, with the game ending once all tiles have been played and you score points for each tile that is connected to other tiles on all four sides.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fdgT5c7BCuI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f767adcdd0ac6c285ee8ee47be8f7f9f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fdgT5c7BCuI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Beacon Patrol Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the North Sea, one tile at a time.</li>
<li>Experience the digital adaptation of the Beacon Patrol board game.</li>
<li>Team up with friends for a cooperative adventure at sea (Steam Remote Play Together supported).</li>
<li>Relaxing turn-based strategy meets calm maritime ambiance.</li>
</ul>
<p>I gave the demo a test today on my desktop and it worked great, seems like a lovely game overall to spend a little time with so be sure to give it a go.</p>
<p>At release it will have full Native Linux support and a demo is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273850/Beacon_Patrol/" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>. The developer mentioned it's planned to be priced at $11.99.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group continues cuts with Beamdog shedding 26 people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Is no studio safe from cuts? Embracer Group continues trying to reduce costs and now the latest we've seen has affected Beamdog. This news was confirmed via LinkedIn with multiple staffers (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109542735073738754/" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109561841374175232/" target="_blank">#2</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109588123667369984/" target="_blank">#3</a>) noting they had been laid off and multiple sources noting that a total of 26 people were given the boot.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Beamdog they worked on the likes of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition, Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition, Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition, Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition, Axis &amp; Allies 1942 Online and they just recently released MythForce.</p>
<p>This is all part of the immense cost-cutting that Embracer Group are doing after swallowing up absolutely loads of publishers and developers and then having a big funding deal <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/after-eating-up-lots-of-game-studios-embracer-group-set-to-close-a-bunch/" target="_blank">fail to go through</a>. Recent other reports include a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/embracers-troubles-continue-as-they-may-sell-off-borderlands-dev-gearbox/" target="_blank">possible sell-off of Gearbox</a> and they also completely <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/embracer-closes-volition-developer-of-freespace-red-faction-saints-row/" target="_blank">shut down Volition</a>.</p>
<p>What studio will be in the firing line next?</p>
<p>Once again, this massive consolidation in the gaming industry causing problems. Bigger companies keep acquiring, and then eventually getting rid of them when they're not hitting some ridiculous goals. Hopefully all of this will cause more companies to think "do we really want to do this?".</p>
