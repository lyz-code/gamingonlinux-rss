      <title>AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR3) is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As promised, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 is now open source under the MIT license and available for all developers to look into and add into their games. Currently though, this initial open source release only includes support for DirectX 12, as Vulkan support is "in development and will be released in a future version".</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3) technology uses a combination of super resolution temporal upscaling technology and frame generation to deliver a massive increase in framerates in supported games.</p>
<p>AMD FSR 3 technology extends upon FSR 2’s upscaling by adding Frame Generation – the ability to generate entirely new game frames and present those to the user to improve FPS. FSR 3 does this by adding two new technologies – Frame Interpolation and Optical Flow enhanced from AMD Fluid Motion Frames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some nice improvements arrived with FSR3 v3.0.3 including quality improvements and extends support for Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) monitors within the frame pacing logic.</p>
<p>More games are confirmed to be getting FSR3 too with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora recently released with it. Other games that will get support for it include Eve Online, Farming Simulator 22, Squad, Warhammer Darktide, Space Marine II, Starfield, Starship Troopers Extermination, Cyberpunk 2077, Crimson Desert, Black Myth: Wukong, The Alters, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and Pax Dei.</p>
<p>See their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fsr3-source-available/" target="_blank">announcement blog</a>, <a href="https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-super-resolution-3/" target="_blank">FSR3 page</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - currently FSR3 on GitHub is in its own <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK/tree/release-FSR3-3.0.3" target="_blank">special branch</a>.</p>

      <title>Death Stranding from Kojima is getting the live-action movie treatment</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Death Stranding from Kojima Productions is being turned into a movie, with A24 (Everything Everywhere All at Once) taking on the job. As one of my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/12/death-stranding-absolutely-sold-me-and-you-should-play-it/" target="_blank">favourite games</a> from the last few years, I can't wait to see!</p>
<p>This is at least the second time an announcement has been made, with the previous report in <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/12/death-stranding-film-from-barbarian-producer-alex-lebovici-in-works-1235200209/" target="_blank">late 2022</a> being from Hammerstone Studios<strong>. </strong>It’s unclear what happened there.</p>
<p>The blurb: "The film promises to delve into the mysteries surrounding the apocalyptic event called the “Death Stranding”, which blurred the lines between life and death, and brought forth nightmarish creatures into a world on the brink of collapse."</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/A24-announcement" target="_blank">official announcement</a> Hideo Kojima said: "A24 was born into this world about 10 years ago, their presence is singular within the industry, they are like no other. The films they are delivering to the world are high in quality and very innovative. I have been attracted to their creations and they have even inspired my own work. Their innovative approach to storytelling aligns with what Kojima Productions has been doing for the last 8 years. Now, we are making a Death Stranding movie together. There are a lot of 'game adaptation films' out there but what we are creating is not just a direct translation of the game. The intention is that our audience will not only be fans of the games, but our film will be for anyone who loves cinema. We are creating a Death Stranding universe that has never been seen before, achievable only through the medium of film, it will be born."</p>
<p>Are you excited? I sure am. This will certainly be a memorable experience.</p>

      <title>Mixing ideas from Chess and base-building strategy games, protect your King in Emplacement</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Emplacement is a King versus King turn-based strategy game, all about placing down tiles in a way that's a bit like Chess mixed with ideas from other more traditional turn-based strategy games.</p>
<p>Played on an isometric board, each player takes turns placing down tiles to progress towards taking down the enemy King. So you need to keep thinking and planning ahead on what tiles you want to go where, all while trying to protect your own King while also advancing on your opponent. Place down farms, barracks and more to use their productivity and gather resources and units.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Love the look of this and it has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>FOSS strategy-shooter Unvanquished update brings better bots, improved server browser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unvanquished, the free and open source strategy-shooter mix, has released version 0.54.1 bringing with it some much needed improvements to continue building on. In the <a href="https://unvanquished.net/unvanquished-0-54-1-is-here/" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers noted this technical update was to bring "various much-needed and long-overdue fixes".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6033147951702561980gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6033147951702561980gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What's changed?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some rendering fixes.</li>
<li>Some fixes for memory leaks.</li>
<li>WebP update to address a <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863" target="_blank">security issue</a>.</li>
<li>A fix for a bug affecting Windows when display scaling is enabled.</li>
<li>Better bots.</li>
<li>Translations.</li>
<li>Server browser properly displaying and parsing the server tag (things like officials and featured servers).</li>
<li>Messages telling why the user disconnected from the server.</li>
<li>Server browser properly listing servers on some mobile broadband networks which were dropping our serverinfo packets.</li>
<li>Improved performance with the ground fire effect.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also now have a Fediverse account <a href="https://idtech.space/users/UNVofficial" target="_blank">you can follow</a>. On top of that they also recently put out a <a href="https://unvanquished.net/looking-for-an-opengl-and-cpp-developer/" target="_blank">call for more developers</a> to join in and help modernise it.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of it before: It's a fork of the classic Tremulous. A free and open-source first-person strategy game shooter, pitting technologically advanced human soldiers against hordes of highly adaptable aliens. Players can choose from either team, providing for an entirely different experience on both sides, as humans focus on long-range firepower while aliens rely instead on quick movement and stealth. The goal of each match is to destroy the enemy base, preventing members of the opposing team from spawning. Upgrades for both teams are earned by a combination of individual performance and team map control, unlocking access to more powerful weapons and equipment for the humans, and larger, more ferocious forms for the aliens.</p>

      <title>Necesse a Terraria-Rimworld blend gets big update, graphics overhaul coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together elements of the likes of Terraria and Rimworld, the open world survival craft and colony sim game Necesse has a big update out now. And there's some more exciting stuff to come still.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features is an update to the graphics, and the good news there is that they've now got two full-time artists working on a huge upgrade to that! Their little gif teaser shows what kind of style to expect to come in a future update:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1953945951702559266gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1953945951702559266gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>As for this latest released update it's a big one. Characters are now separated from worlds, so you can take your character anywhere to any other player's world in what they're calling the "Necesseverse". So that works a lot more like Terraria, Valheim and other games that do the same. Solo players also get a new survival mode with food spoilage, a refined system for asking NPCs to join player parties, a reworked endgame, and snowballs. On top of that there's also a new biome featuring boss monsters and loot, as well as more fine-tuned difficulty options plus plenty of bug fixes.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator gets a free Among Us DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pine Studio are doing some great stuff with Escape Simulator. Not only did it get a Portal themed DLC earlier this year, it just got a free Among Us DLC out now. The Among Us crew love their cross-overs it seems, like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/vampire-survivors-adventures-update-out-now-plus-among-us-collab-dlc-coming/" target="_blank">Vampire Survivors DLC also coming soon</a>.</p>

<p>From the press release: "Escaping has always been part of the Among Us experience. By teaming up with the Among Us developer Innersloth, Pine Studio — a master in the art of crafting tricky escape rooms — has boarded The Mini Skeld and added its own twist to the game. Although the primary goal in Escape Simulator is solving puzzles together to escape, there is no way for us to stop anybody from playing the impostor and hindering such an attempt."</p>
<p>DLC Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand new Among Us inspired escape-room packed with original puzzles.</li>
<li>Play solo or online with friends. The DLC plays best with 1-4 players, but it’s playable with up to 10!</li>
<li>New character hats inspired by Among Us crewmates.</li>
<li>Checkpoint system so you can gradually progress through the ship.</li>
<li>Try to escape in under 60 minutes and win the trophy!</li>
</ul>
<p>Escape Simulator has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>You can buy it on:</p>

      <title>Tetris Effect: Connected adds HDR for Steam Deck OLED plus optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More HDR goodies for you to test with your shiny new Steam Deck OLED, as Tetris Effect: Connected should now work great with it. Even if you only have the original Steam Deck LCD model, this update should still improve things for you too!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1003590/announcements/detail/3896240575563765187" target="_blank">changelog</a> was short and sweet noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>[STEAM] Added an HDR option for the Steam Deck OLED. You can enable this from OPTIONS&gt;GRAPHICS&gt;HDR.</li>
<li>[STEAM] Optimized the GRAPHIC QUALITY settings for Steam Deck for better performance in SCORE ATTACK and CLASSIC SCORE ATTACK game modes. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Great once again to see more developers actually test and improve their games for Steam Deck, which should also ensure they work on desktop Linux quite nicely too with Proton! Currently Tetris Effect: Connected is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P2czq3SAbGw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2c332a4611b8f58e3704c08e16f9fe4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P2czq3SAbGw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tetris® Effect: Connected is Tetris like you've never seen it, or heard it, or felt it before—an incredibly addictive, unique, and breathtakingly gorgeous reinvention of one of the most popular puzzle games of all time, from the people who brought you the award-winning Rez Infinite and legendary puzzle game Lumines.<br/>
<br/>
Music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves—pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing, making any of the game's 30+ stages and 10+ modes something you'll want to experience over and over again.<br/>
<br/>
Plus cross-platform multiplayer modes for competitive and cooperative play!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've actually never played this one, am I missing out on something here? It has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from users on Steam so plenty of people love it. My poor poor backlog of games, is it going to grow again?</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Fortnite on Linux / Steam Deck? Not until &#39;tens of millions of users&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hoping at some point to play Fortnite on Linux / Steam Deck without the use of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/fortnite-added-to-xbox-cloud-gaming-easier-than-ever-to-play-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Cloud Gaming services</a>? Well, it's probably quite some time away, if ever.</p>
<p>While Epic Games could put it on Linux, they're currently just choosing not to. The anti-cheat is supported, and has been for some time. It uses a mixture of Easy Anti-Cheat (which Epic themselves own) and BattlEye, both are actually supported on Linux. Their own game engine, Unreal Engine, does also support Linux too.</p>
<p>Recently The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23996474/epic-tim-sweeney-interview-win-google-antitrust-lawsuit-district-court" target="_blank">did an interview</a> with Epic's CEO Tim Sweeney, and this was mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is Fortnite still not playable on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>If we only had a few more programmers. It’s the Linux problem. I love the Steam Deck hardware. Valve has done an amazing job there; I wish they would get to tens of millions of users, at which point it would actually make sense to support it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Worth noting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/09/epic-games-sheds-830-people-due-to-spending-more-than-they-earn/" target="_blank">back in September 2023</a>, Epic Games let go over 800 people.</em></p>
<p>You may remember that back in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/epic-games-ceo-says-a-clear-no-to-fortnite-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Sweeney gave a pretty clear "no"</a> to Fortnite support with <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> for Linux / Steam Deck, with Sweeney mentioning all the different Linux kernel combinations, especially with the size of Fortnite as a game it's a huge target for cheaters (and it's only gotten a lot bigger since then).</p>
<p>The other side though of course is the Epic Games Store, and how Epic sees Valve as a competitor. The issue claimed is the 30% cut that Valve take, but given how many resources Epic continue pouring into the Epic Games Store, through various exclusivity deals and free games, they're not going to turn around and put Fortnite onto Steam. Remember they actually pulled Rocket League and Fall Guys from Steam after acquiring them.</p>
<p>They wouldn't actually <em>need</em> to put it onto Steam for it to work on Linux / Steam Deck though, there's various ways to get the Epic Games Store on Linux and Fortnite already <em>loads</em> with Proton, it's just the anti-cheat blocking you actually playing it.</p>
<p>Really, the reality is simple and the quote above makes it clear. It's just a question of how much money Fortnite would make, and it would need to make a lot on Linux / Steam Deck. Once a platform is big enough, it won't be ignored. Money is the only priority, as seen when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/epic-games-are-killing-off-a-bunch-of-classics-like-unreal-tournament/" target="_blank">Epic decided to kill off Unreal Tournament</a>.</p>

<p>What have you been playing recently? I actually finally decided to jump into the first <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/108710/Alan_Wake/" target="_blank">Alan Wake</a></strong>, and I have absolutely no idea what's going on but the story seems pretty interesting! Can't wait to put some more hours into it to see what happens and so far it works beautifully on Steam Deck (it's also Steam Deck Verified).</p>

      <title>Valve upgrades the Steam Workshop, plus various Steam Deck improvements in new Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam Desktop and Steam Deck have a fresh Beta release out that overhauls some parts of the Steam Workshop. Plus there's some fixes for Linux and Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>For the Steam Workshop, Valve looked over a few parts that hadn't been updated for a while and made them better to use including these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Re-designed the Workshop subscriptions list (accessible from Game Properties). It now includes the ability to sort by subscription date, last updated, size, name, and load order.</li>
<li>Added ability to change the local load order of Workshop item subscriptions.</li>
<li>Added ability to set the local order based on any Workshop item dependencies (must be set on the Workshop items themselves).</li>
<li>Added ability to disable Workshop item subscriptions, which will hide them from the game.</li>
<li>Added the ability to filter the Workshop subscriptions list by tag name. Use the same search field for filtering items by name.</li>
<li>Show the name of the Workshop item being download in the game's tooltip on the Downloads page.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some more changes in Desktop Steam Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed "Friends who Play" section not refreshing until the client was restarted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance and smoothness when using NVIDIA hardware encoding.</li>
<li>Fixed a video freeze when moving the mouse to a monitor on another video adapter.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in "Call of Duty: Black Ops III" when switching maps.</li>
<li>Fixed situations causing the Steam client to only download the Windows version of a title and later attempting to run it without Proton.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then the changes for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the amount of black screen flashes that happen when opening the Steam interface while playing a game with a custom screen refresh rate setting.</li>
<li>Replaced Nearest scaling mode with Pixel, a pseudo-bandlimited filter for upscaling pixel art to non-integer factors without introducing aliasing. Integer scale factors will still be Nearest.</li>
<li>Fixed "Friends who Play" section not refreshing until the client was restarted</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in "Call of Duty: Black Ops III" when switching maps.</li>
<li>Fixed situations causing the Steam client to only download the Windows version of a title and later attempting to run it without Proton.</li>
<li>Reset the HDR Visualization setting to None for all users.</li>
<li>Moved the HDR Visualization setting from Display-&gt;Advanced to Developer settings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The flashing when opening the Steam UI on Steam Deck when you're running a different refresh rate was quite annoying, so it's great to see some improvements there. Hopefully they can keep improving that!</p>

      <title>Windblown is the next game from the Dead Cells team</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As a huge fan of Dead Cells, I'm keen to see what Motion Twin are cooking up with Windblown, due to release in 2024 in Early Access and it looks pretty wild.</p>
<p>Their description of it is certainly amusing too: "Windblown is what happens when a rogue-like game guzzles a whole lot of energy drinks, hits the gym, and wears treadmills on its feet. It's got combat that zips by at lightning speed, and we've tossed in some eye-popping, shiny clouds and gravity-defying islands for good measure. Think of it as Dead Cells’ hyperactive sibling, spinning in a 3D sugar rush."</p>
<p>In Windblown, players become Leapers – warriors fighting to protect their home, The Ark, from the gigantic and deadly Vortex and its Sentinel minions. Like a bolt of lightning, players will freely dash through stunning open stages where each run is teeming with secrets to uncover. Players will be challenged to overcome the odds in relentless battles against the Vortex's Sentinels, hell-bent on taking them down and starting their run anew. You'll be able to do it solo or online in three-player co-op sessions.</p>
<p>Check out their announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="shPyfu6aP58"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92aa4b3eca15c27c40708de5808491b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/shPyfu6aP58" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If a Native Linux version specifically is important for you, a developer from Motion Twin <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1911610/discussions/0/4030222029797172308/#c4030222382924945322" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Steam "Linux should come, we don't know when yet.".</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic III game engine VCMI gets some huge improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we have fheroes2 for Heroes of Might and Magic II, we also have VCMI for Heroes of Might and Magic III which also continues to advance as a free and open source cross-platform game engine reimplementation.</p>
<p>Recently the team behind VCMI released version 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 shortly after to fix up some issues. The list of what's new is…rather long. Sounds like some pretty necessary additions too including a high score screen, tracking of completed campaigns, VSync support, a tutorial, a video for winning / losing, smaller save files, mod compatibility checking when loading a save, simultaneous turns support for multiplayer, various AI improvements and <a href="https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi/blob/master/ChangeLog.md#132---140" target="_blank">so much more</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3742901841702398116gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3742901841702398116gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://vcmi.eu/" target="_blank">official site</a> and their <a href="https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>You do need the original game for the data files which you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition" target="_blank">grab on GOG.com</a>.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive has a new physics engine and big performance upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is an in-development Early Access open source evolution sim, much like life itself it continues to evolve and a new release version 0.6.4 brings changes to ensure the foundation is solid.</p>
<p>With the release the developers do say there's not a lot new to show in terms of gameplay, because it was focused on a "massive rework in the functionality of Thrive’s background processes" which includes a "brand new physics engine complete with better performance". So while they can't show much that looks new it should be "smoother sailing from here on out". Given all the changes it should provide better performance too!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TxSrcFVlqjY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/091c435a9fbf648e2247a6688f972cea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TxSrcFVlqjY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the big changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactored the entire microbe gameplay code to use an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture and a different physics engine (Jolt). This took up the vast majority of the time spent on this release. As a result of this many things in the game will feel slightly different and there will definitely be new bugs that have slipped past us. We will attempt to quickly fix any new bugs introduced with this change.</li>
<li>The game performance is now 20-100% better than before thanks to the ECS and physics rework (different benchmark parts have different improvements, and different gameplay conditions also have different performance gains).</li>
<li>Improved auto-evo performance by about 50%.</li>
<li>Added a native C++ library for Thrive that has the physics engine integration for now but we can in the future move computation heavy parts of the game there that might benefit performance.</li>
<li>Added two new context specific microbe tracks that can play instead of the normal microbe ambiance when in those specific patch types.</li>
<li>Added Thriveopedia pages for each of the organelles currently in the game.</li>
<li>Added early multicellular freebuild mode.</li>
<li>Improved the visuals of the organism statistics panel and added / updated related tooltip icons as well.</li>
<li>Added 3D panorama backgrounds for various patch types for the late multicellular underwater part. These were completed a while ago but were never accessible in game until now.</li>
<li>Various AI improvements.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
<li>+ <a href="https://github.com/Revolutionary-Games/Thrive/releases/tag/v0.6.4" target="_blank">lots more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>They're also looking to eventually port it from Godot 3 to Godot 4.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development or download it <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/" target="_blank">direct</a> or via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.revolutionarygamesstudio.ThriveLauncher" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>The Garden Path, a quiet life sim about the joy of gardening releases Spring 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Garden Path was originally due to release earlier this year, but the developer pushed it back to continue improving it and now you can again grab an early copy with a new full release window revealed.</p>
<p>While most of the content is complete, they're working out some performance kinks to ensure the release is great. So now their plan is to have it ready for Spring 2024.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11397467371702384326gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11397467371702384326gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Garden Path is a slice-of-life gardening sim that celebrates small moments. No matter how you decide to play, the garden is a tender world of familiar sights and sounds, mysteries, and friendly faces. A space to call your own, to curate, and to reflect.</p>
<p>Designed to be played in short bursts as and when you wish, time in The Garden Path runs in concert with the outside world. Stop by to wander your garden whenever the mood takes you, and find new travelers, events, activities, and distractions waiting for you each day. Take your time, play for a little while, and experience it all at your own pace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have a new trailer to mark the occasion:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IS6Iiz-Bq9A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/647746ca380f00806180420ede1d8761.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IS6Iiz-Bq9A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they've opened up a few Beta keys for purchase on their <a href="https://carrotcakestudio.itch.io/thegardenpath" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>. At time of writing there's only 184 left if you wish to support development and check it early. It gives you the full game at release, since they will just continue to update it there.</p>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release on <a href="https://carrotcakestudio.itch.io/thegardenpath" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1638500/The_Garden_Path/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 36: Entertainment for X Windows</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-35-the-new-stories/" target="_blank">Part 35: The New Stories</a></strong></p>
<p>While still being the most elaborate, <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> was far from the only shovelware set of games released for Linux, with several UNIX CD-ROM vendors such as Walnut Creek CDROM and Omeron Systems also seeking a piece of the action for themselves. These were often more spartan sets of software packages made in line with their other offerings, including not just games but also the libraries and utilities associated with them, as well as emulators, screensavers, and software toys.</p>
<p><em>Linux Games &amp; Entertainment for X Windows</em> by hemming GmbH is another such example. From 1999, it was part of a series of seven Linux software CD-ROMs on topics such as networking, multimedia, science, office, system administration, and one of just general tools. This unassuming disc promises to be easy to use three times on the case spine. This did not prove to be my experience, but in fairness, it was designed with SUSE Linux 6.1 and Red Hat Linux 5.1 in mind.</p>
<p>For some bizarre reason the CD-ROM must be mounted and explored with root permissions in order for the contents to be displayed, something which is not mentioned in the instructions printed on the inside of the jewel case insert. From there you can load either the index_e.htm or index_d.htm files in a web browser for an HTML based menu in either English or German. This takes the form of a table list of entries, with "copy program" links under them bringing up a save file dialogue.</p>
<p>Most of the games are distributed as just the raw source code archives, along with a few binary tarballs and some scant RPM packages. The bulk of these refused to build for me, and given that a great deal of the games had either been packaged with my Linux distribution already, or had superior sources available for them online, I did not feel much need to troubleshoot them. Really the main value of this set today is just as a reference for what games were floating around at the time.</p>
<p>A slew of familiar favourites such as <em>The Ace of Penguins</em>, software from Bill Kendrick's New Breed Software, <em>iMaze</em>, as well as several games from the KDE and GNOME desktop environments are included. There are also early versions of many enduring free software classics such as <em>FreeCiv</em>, <em>FlightGear</em>, and <em>BZFlag</em>. Also of note is <em>Craft: The Vicious Vikings</em>, another game which refused to build but has Linux binaries easily available as part of the craft_l35.tar.Z archive on SourceForge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9713263161702323547gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9713263161702323547gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11382696811702323548gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11382696811702323548gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Craft</em> is a rudimentary but functional real-time strategy game where you establish and then defend a Viking colony from attacks. Also on the CD-ROM is the multidirectional shooter <em>Maelstrom</em>, which again just ships by default with my Linux distribution, but is notable regardless for being an early port by Simple DirectMedia Layer creator and Loki Software lead coder Sam Lantinga. Honestly, the three games that grabbed my attention the most were three that were never finished.</p>
<p><em>Hatman - The Game of Kings</em> is an impressive but undercooked SVGAlib clone of <em>Pacman</em> which does have an RPM package on the disc but sadly had sound support disabled at compilation. There were a number of other <em>Pacman</em> clones featured, but this one had the most potential. Then there was the scrolling platformer prototype <em>The L.O.S.E.R Corps</em>, which again would not compile, but did from a later release from Tucows, which pleased me by using my MIDI synth hardware.</p>
<p>The third curiosity that I was not aware of before was <em>Tom Bombem: The Invasion of the Inanimate Objects</em> which once had the distinction of being affably rejected by Apogee Software. This would not compile for me as well, but I did discover that the game was later rebuilt using SDL, and this more modern version worked fine for me. First programmed by Vince Weaver back when he was sixteen in 1994, the game has a personality that too many of the other myriad games on the disc lack.</p>
<p>Some early 3D titles worth highlighting on this set are <em>Zarch</em>, although only the X11 variant ran, and <em>BattleBall</em>, both games where you take control of vehicles to battle human or computer players over simplified polygonal environments. An honourable mention also goes out to <em>Spellcast</em>, an X11 recreation of the pen and pencil wizard battler <em>Spellcaster</em>, which I did at long last get to compile by editing the Makefile to point XLIB to "/usr/X11R6/lib" instead of its default path. Small victories.</p>
<p>The ultimate fate of hemming GmbH was a tragic one, as the company faltered not long after the grisly murder of its founder in May 2001 near Andenne in Belgium. I do not feel it is appropriate to delve too much into the sordid details of the case here, but for those of you who are so inclined, you can add the name Olaf Hemming on to your true crime Linux bingo card alongside the likes of Hans Reiser or perhaps Ian Murdock. This is without getting into the white collar crime. Anyway, onto lighter matters.</p>

      <title>DUSK HD + SDK &amp; Steam Workshop out now - needs Proton on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>David Szymanski + New Blood Interactive have released DUSK HD as a free DLC for the retro FPS, but you'll need Proton to play it on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It's been released as a free optional DLC, so you only have to play the remastered version if you want to. From the release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/519860/view/3887232925348814769" target="_blank">announcement</a> they mentioned that DUSK HD started as "a fun way to beef up the DUSK Steam Workshop soon evolved into a full blown visual remaster thanks to the hard work of a group of very talented developers at New Blood". So now there's DUSK HD, an SDK for modders and Steam Workshop support.</p>
<p>Looks like their original Native Linux version, which is what Valve picked for the Steam Deck Verified badge, has not seen any updates. So, if you want to try out any of the fancy new stuff on Linux / Steam Deck, you'll need to manually swap the game over to use Proton. To do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the game properties.</li>
<li>Pick the Compatibility menu.</li>
<li>Select Proton 8 or Proton Experimental from the drop-down box.</li>
</ul>
<p>New trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kQx2QCmZruw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83e7cfdc7df7c11175ae8bcf8f5de515.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kQx2QCmZruw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Their modding support is still being worked on though as they had to "basically rewrite the entire game and engine from scratch" and so the <em>full</em> DUSK DDK (Dusk Development Kit) built on the new DUSK is "still a few weeks away" but once done "you will be able to play all the custom maps with both Classic or HD visuals, replace weapons, models and more". It even supports Quake and Half Life maps.</p>
<p>You can buy DUSK from:</p>

      <title>Build up and higher in Stellar Settlers a colony sim with vertical building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This one has certainly made me curious, Tinymice Entertainment emailed over info on Stellar Settlers, a space-base colony building sim with a twist - you keep building vertically. While most similar games have you spread out more and more, here you're going higher and higher again!</p>
<p>"With unique vertical and horizontal base-building gameplay, take control of a settlement, build your own thriving colony on 5 hostile planets. Earn profits, buy parts &amp; build a better Starship, colonize even richer planets &amp; REPEAT!"</p>
<p>Have a look at their recent gameplay demo:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4gXWQzu3ihc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2cf3aa13529db58fc706513fc14e5df9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4gXWQzu3ihc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer mentioned clearly they're ensuring all updates to it are thoroughly tested on Linux and Steam Deck. An Early Access release is planned for March, 2024. Initially with 5 planets, they plan to double that to 10 through 1 year of Early Access to provide regular additions to the game's content. That's on top of plans for more structures, building pods, settler characters and more.</p>
<p>Check out the demo and playtest on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628570/Stellar_Settlers/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Cassette Beasts gets a new multiplayer feature teaser - update coming early 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is probably one of the best modern creature collecting games around, and early in 2024 it's getting online multiplayer. This update was due this year but they said it needs a little more time in the oven to get it right.</p>
<p>Not heard of it before? It's a Steam Deck Verified and Native Linux game from developer Bytten Studio. Released in April 2023, it currently has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. You collect strange monsters with old cassette tapes, and use the fusion system to combine any two monsters together to make tons of different forms.</p>
<p>After getting a number of questions on the upcoming online update they've released a quick teaser on some of the features that will be added:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5Fw7ElAoyhM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d1b718a57b27236e46b7b22b1244c43.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5Fw7ElAoyhM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When playing online, you'll be able to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Party up with up to 8 friends, all visible in your world!</li>
<li>Battle your friends, and even assign custom rules to your battle such as enabling/disabling sticker attributes!</li>
<li>Trade tapes with each other!</li>
<li>Team up for raid battles against Rogue Fusions!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Something that's not entirely clear yet is if all features will allow for cross-play between platforms, they're hoping to make that more clear at some point later. Multiplayer is complicated enough for a small team even on a single platform but hopefully they will be able to do cross-play too.</p>

      <title>Tunnet has you dig deep underground while you build and debug a big network</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Build, debug and optimize a computer network in an underground facility. Tunnet is certainly something quite different and it's out now. "Have you ever wanted to be a lonely underpaid network technician who works 24/7 in an underground facility?", the developer asks. Well, I can't say I have and now there's a slightly freaky looking game for it.</p>
<p>Equipped with a drill to let you dig through tunnels to find and connect up various bunkers, you'll need to keep an eye-out for anything. Apparently things like to lurk in the dark. As you progress you'll earn more money, but it will get a bit more complicated over time with all the networking and things can (and probably will) go wrong.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6gxytilYoOM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a9f7715112a8ac041cda4349430a047.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6gxytilYoOM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Build, optimize and debug a computer network in a first-person 3D environment.</li>
<li>Dig tunnels to access the different bunkers and connect them to the network.</li>
<li>Explore the facilities and unveil the secrets of the underground complex.</li>
<li>Find a way to access the computers guarded by the creepy monsters that haunt the bunkers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://puzzled-squid.itch.io/tunnet" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286390/Tunnet/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.3 Beta out now with experimental Wayland support for Cinnamon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 21.3 is due to release soon with a first Beta now available, coming with the Cinnamon 6.0 desktop with experimental Wayland support.</p>
<p>Don't expect Wayland with Cinnamon to work all that well right now though, as they said it still lacks various features and has a few limitations but they want to ready it up as soon as possible — although still likely not planned to be default even in Mint 22.x so it's a while away to replace Xorg.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2714829391702302256gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2714829391702302256gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Cinnamon on Wayland</em></p>
<p>Cinnamon 6.0 also has various other improvements including:</p>
<ul>
<li>75% scaling is back.</li>
<li>Window opacity keybinding is back.</li>
<li>Stylus buttons can be disabled.</li>
<li>The monitor used for notifications is now configurable.</li>
<li>Menu apps can be edited with right click -&gt; properties.</li>
<li>Gestures: new desktop zoom action.</li>
<li>Gestures: You can now specify when an action is triggered.</li>
<li>Sound applet: new shift-middle click action.</li>
<li>Grouped window list: new option to not show anything when hovering an app button.</li>
<li>New "Spices" (addons) support for the right-click actions menu in the Nemo file manager.</li>
</ul>
<p>The file-sharing application Warpinator also gained some new tricks like being able to manually connect to another device by its IP or by scanning a QR code. Their Hypnotix TV viewer application also gained new features like favourite channels, create custom channels and it can update its own version of yt-dlp for YouTube changes.</p>
<p>Linux Mint 21.3 will use the kernel 5.15 and Ubuntu 22.04 as a base and receive security updates until 2027.</p>

      <title>Eviternity II is a massive 36-map megawad for DOOM II</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not enough DOOM in your life? How about trying out the massive release of <a href="https://eviternity.dfdoom.com/" target="_blank">Eviternity II</a>, a full 36-map megawad sequel to Eviternity.</p>
<p>More: "Eviternity II is a full 36-map megawad sequel to Eviternity; comprised of six 5-map Chapters, each with an additional secret level. Making extensive use of a newly updated build of the OTEX texture pack (to be released as a standalone texture pack in the future), Eviternity II’s six chapters explore a series of unique and varied themes, continuing on from where you left off after the Archangelus’ defeat!"</p>

<em>Key Artwork by Robert Sammelin.</em></p>
<p>You need to play it with the original DOOM II wad file (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">GOG</a>) and an installed recent version of GZDoom.</p>
<p>Place your wad file for DOOM II into the gzdoom config folder of a normal install like here:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>But for Flatpak / Flathub it would be here:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>Download Eviternity II from the <a href="https://eviternity.dfdoom.com/" target="_blank">official site</a>, unzip it, and place the Eviternity II RC1.wad file into the same folder as above. Then you can launch it like so:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -iwad DOOM2.WAD -file 'Eviternity II RC1.wad'</code></p>
<p>And the launch for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -iwad ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM2.WAD -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/'Eviternity II RC1.wad'</code></p>

      <title>Voxel Doom II gets updated with Parallax Textures</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing the day of DOOM announcements following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/sigil-ii-from-john-romero-out-now-for-classic-doom/" target="_blank">release of SIGIL II</a>, we also have a big update to Voxel Doom II.</p>
<p>What is it: Voxel Doom II is the follow up to 2022's award-winning Voxel Doom. This is a new graphics mod that replaces all monsters, weapons, props and items with fully 3d voxel models. It replaces all monsters from both Doom and Doom II.</p>
<p>The latest update version 2.2 released December 9th upgrades it with Parallax Textures and you can see it shown off a bit in their new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="M2MshI3Xyyg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0f84b2ec1465cfc69ff49ac741456802.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/M2MshI3Xyyg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>To play it with either DOOM (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_1993" target="_blank">GOG</a>) or DOOM II (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_ii" target="_blank">GOG</a>) you need a copy of each game for the main wad file, plus make sure you have at least GZDoom 4.10.0 or later. Place your wad file for the original game into the gzdoom config folder of a normal install like here:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>But for Flatpak / Flathub it would be here:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>Download the Voxel Doom II mod <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/voxel-doom-ii" target="_blank">from Mod DB</a>, unzip it, and then place the voxel_parallax_doomII.pk3 file into the same folder as above and then you can just run it like so for original DOOM:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -iwad DOOM.WAD -file voxel_parallax_doomII.pk3</code></p>
<p>And the launch for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -iwad ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM.WAD -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/voxel_parallax_doomII.pk3</code></p>

<p>Embark on a nostalgic nightmare: Immerse yourself in the dark, demonic world of DOOM like never before. John Romero, the original Icon of Sin, takes you on a terrifying journey to commemorate the 30th anniversary of this legendary, first-person shooter. SIGIL II is DOOM's unofficial sixth episode.</p>
<p>Upon breaching the pentagram of invulnerability in the final moments of SIGIL, Episode Five, you find yourself not on a victorious journey back to save Earth, but caught in Baphomet's cunning snare, catapulted into a new, grotesque domain of relentless torment, unending demon hordes, and an onslaught of heavy metal mayhem!</p>

<p><em>Will you be giving it a go?</em></p>
<p>To play it on Linux you need a copy of <a href="https://zdoom.org/" target="_blank">GZDoom</a> installed, along with the wad file from DOOM (<a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/doom_1993" target="_blank">GOG</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM_1993/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). You'll need to make sure your DOOM wad file is in the correct location which for standard installs will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And for Flatpak / Flathub installs it will be:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/</code></p>
<p>And then place the SIGIL II file into the same folder.</p>
<p>Then to run you via terminal (or with your favourite launcher) with a standard install:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">gzdoom -iwad DOOM.WAD -file SIGIL_II_V1_0.WAD</code></p>
<p>And again for Flatpak / Flathub:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">flatpak run org.zdoom.GZDoom -iwad ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/DOOM.WAD -file ~/.var/app/org.zdoom.GZDoom/.config/gzdoom/SIGIL_II_V1_0.WAD</code></p>

      <title>Wine 9.0 has a first Release Candidate released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The time is approaching for the next major version bump to the Windows compatibility layer Wine, with Wine 9.0 Release Candidate 1 now available.</p>
<p>With this release the yearly code freeze has begun, so no new features will be making it in after this point, only bug fixes until the main Wine 9.0 release to ensure it's as stable as possible.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/9.0-rc1" target="_blank">what new</a> in Wine 9.0 RC1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li>Support for DH encryption keys with a recent GnuTLS.</li>
<li>Keyboard layouts support in the Wayland driver.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For bug fixes they noted 42 solved as of this release including fixes for: For Honor, STEEP, Far Cry 5, Rockstar Games Launcher, GTA V, and Red Dead Redemption 2, Need for Speed: Most Wanted, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2, Eurobattle, ModOrganizer and more.</p>
<p>vkd3d is their own Direct3D to Vulkan translation layer, not to be confused with VKD3D-Proton from Valve. The 1.10 release also only went up on December 6th with these highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>libvkd3d exposes various newer Direct3D 12 interfaces.</li>
<li>The HLSL compiler supports dynamic indexing of arrays.</li>
<li>libvkd3d-utils implements various helper functions for manipulating DXBC blobs.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>

      <title>World of Goo 2 announced for release in 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2D Boy and Tomorrow Corporation are coming back for one more run, with World of Goo 2 being announced and it looks glorious. They also note it's the "biggest game we've ever made". The original was one of the earliest full indie games to be given a Native Linux version, and to this day is still one of my favourites.</p>
<p>Not much has actually been said about it yet though only that it's big. The first game came out 15 years ago so a lot has changed in that time but I'm definitely excited to learn more.</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6rGroEFNEpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5aea6a9f34c0dc1dcae48e530d3bd22.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6rGroEFNEpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now, while no platforms have been announced yet, here's a fun little titbit for you: in the YouTube trailer description, they note "Video edited with Kdenlive on Linux Mint". Just a little fun thing to see developers using free and open source tools and noting it like so.</p>
<p>It's due to release some time in 2024. Follow on the <a href="https://worldofgoo2.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

      <title>Traffic optimisation puzzle-sim GRIDROAD hits Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love a challenge and don't get your brain in a twist easily? GRIDROAD is a fun idea putting you in charge of building roads and optimizing traffic. Imagine something like the popular <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/08/mini-metro-now-lets-you-build-up-one-of-europes-oldest-metro-systems-in-budapest/" target="_blank">Mini Metro</a>, but quite a bit more puzzling as you deal directly with the exact flow of all the traffic.</p>
<p>The developer sent a key to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Steam Curator</a> and it's been making my brain sweat a bit.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bNHHniPXvCA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/201f1d98b1c222ce2f8e017db26752bf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bNHHniPXvCA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This is the first game from developer RAJACORP, and while simple it does exactly what you expect it to and the design is so clean it's great. If you love puzzle sims this is one you should take a look at and it works perfectly. Currently you'll get a couple of hours out of it but the developer has plans to expand it with a lot more levels, online leaderboards, sharing of level solutions, a custom level editor and browser, Steam features like cards and achievements and more.</p>
<p>Fantastic start for a puzzler.</p>
<p>Available in Early Access with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2677310/GRIDROAD/" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cautiously hyped for Light No Fire from the No Man&#39;s Sky team at Hello Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Light No Fire is another interesting game announcement coming from The Game Awards 2023, coming from Hello Games, the crew that created No Man's Sky.</p>
<p>What is it? A game about adventure, building, survival and exploration together. What makes it interesting, is the claim that the world is literally the size of planet Earth. An open-world survival adventure with "a scale never attempted before". The idea and style of it look pretty great:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jKQem4Z6ioQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f9170682fbf849676234d7d36979615.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jKQem4Z6ioQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm excited, but cautiously so. Since we all know by now what happened with No Man's Sky. While it's an objectively good game now, the release state was not what was expected full of over-promise and under-delivering. Hopefully Hello Games learned a valuable lesson on that one. Then again…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3086742291702035489gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3086742291702035489gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1732979907314225593" target="_blank">X/Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully like No Man's Sky it will have Vulkan API support, so that playing it on Desktop Linux or Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Valve's Steam Play Proton</a> will give a good experience!</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Multiplayer Earth - Carve a life together. Meet players from across the globe, build a life, explore and survive together. Construct persistent buildings and communities, or strike out alone to discover the world for others.</li>
<li>A Procedural Earth - A truly open world, with no boundaries at a scale never attempted before. A massively varied and dense planet filled with immersive biomes, unique enemies and valuable resources to discover.</li>
<li>A Fantasy Earth - Light No Fire presents you with an ancient earth to uncover. One where you're not the hero. Thick with lore, mystery and a constant fight for survival. Inspired by the adventure, charm and imagination that we love from classic fantasy.</li>
<li>An Unexplored Earth - Every mountain can be climbed, and below them lie endless vistas, oceans and continents perhaps no others have seen. Who will climb the tallest mountains, who will find the deepest sea? Set sail across vast oceans and rivers, ride wild beasts through fantastical landscapes, fly dragons over undiscovered landscapes.</li>

      <title>SEGA tease new Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage and Crazy Taxi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Game Awards 2023 are over and I'm going over some of the interesting bits that were announced, like SEGA deciding to just go nuts.</p>
<p>SEGA decided to come along in style and blow away all expectations announcing not one, not two — but <em>five</em> new games in development and all are modern takes on some true classics including Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0VHYLJR9pNg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1c2042a665d4f8a51fbbda73a58b13cc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0VHYLJR9pNg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“In recent years, Sonic the Hedgehog has forged new paths for SEGA, bringing the franchise to life and reaching new audiences in ways we had only dreamed of in the past. Building off that success, we are digging into our legacy and reimagining several franchises to bring these games to more audiences around the globe,” says Co-COO of SEGA Corporation and CEO of SEGA of America, Shuji Utsumi. “Today's announcement is just the start of our initiative. First and foremost, our ambition will be to create great games with memorable characters and worlds. We hope fans of all ages will look towards our future with anticipation as we release these projects in the coming years.”</p>
<p>Naturally, thanks to Valve's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, it's likely all of them will be playable on Linux / Steam Deck on or shortly after release in some form.</p>
<p>Are you as excited as I am?</p>

      <title>DOS_deck brings DOS games to your browser with a Steam Deck interface</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a fun idea for classic games. DOS_deck is a website where you can go and play some classic DOS games right in the browser with an interface much like the Steam Deck / Steam Big Picture Mode. Clever stuff making use of DOSBox thanks to <a href="https://js-dos.com/" target="_blank">JS-DOS</a>, allowing it to run games in a browser.</p>
<p>DOS_deck takes it a step further though wrapping it up in a cozy interface and brings with it controller support, automatic game saving when you quit, a virtual keyboard when you need it and of course cross-platform support since you can play it almost anywhere.</p>
<p>It's quite limited in the selection of available titles though, since they can only put up games that are verified to be either Shareware, Freeware, Demos or games that were made public domain.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12502984341702031332gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12502984341702031332gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Love ideas like this. Hopefully they will be able to keep on expanding it to include many more games.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta and SteamOS Preview fix up some annoying issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve recently put up a fresh Steam Deck Client Beta, along with a new SteamOS Preview release and together they fix some important issues that appeared.</p>
<p>The first was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3880477342183060657" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.10 Preview 'More Tangible'</a> which included a fix for "an issue introduced in a previous preview build where touchpad clicks to fail to register in some circumstances".</p>

      <title>W4 Games raises $15M to help push Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>W4 Games, the company set up by <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> veterans Juan Linietsky, Rémi Verschelde and Fabio Alessandrelli, along with veteran entrepreneur Nicola Farronato just received a rather large sum of funding.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://w4games.com/2023/12/07/w4-games-raises-15m-to-drive-video-game-development-inflection-with-godot-engine/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today it mentions they've raised $15M in "Series A funding" from a mixture of sources including "OSS Capital and Naval Ravikant (AngelList and AirChat co-founder). Other investors include Justin Hoffman (Ex Elastic), Larry Augustin (Ex SugarCRM), Alex Atallah (Co-founder of OpenSea), Thomas Dohmke (CEO of GitHub), Diogo Mónica (Founder of Anchorage Digital), Scott Williamson (Ex GitLab) and more notable founders and executives in the commercial open-source ecosystem".</p>
<p>This is a pretty impressive sum to me, but this kind of money actually gets thrown around a lot. It's notable to us here at GamingOnLinux though since this money will go into pushing the free and open source Godot Engine.</p>
<p>What will they be using the funding for? W4 Games plan to more than double their staff over the next 18 months, and they will use all of it to "strengthen our role within the Godot ecosystem by supporting its open-source development and continuing to build products and services to facilitate Godot’s expansion, such as W4 Consoles (an approved middleware console porting solution for Godot games) and W4 Cloud (multi-tenant service to support millions of users)" along with expansion plans across North America, Europe, and Asia and a new Godot education program.</p>
<p>Naturally, these type of investments depend on W4 Games having a business plan for long-term profit, since the people and companies that invest will want a return on it. With W4 Games' work on getting Godot Engine supported fully on consoles (which they can't have in the main open source code due to the secrecy of console companies), and the increasing popularity of Godot — it should be interesting to see what happens.</p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts on this?</em></p>

<p>That's on top of KOMODO also selling them online on their <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">official site</a>, where it has been repeatedly sold out. Currently still, the 512GB model is out of stock so demand is clearly there. All great news to get this Linux-powered device into more hands.</p>

      <title>Dig Dig Boom is a charming looking turn-based puzzle mining roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Turn-based puzzle mining in a highly dynamic destructible world, Dig Dig Boom looks like a charming game you should stick on your wishlist. Coming out sometime in 2024 made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it looks like a blast.</p>
<p>Making it interesting, time only moves when you move. So you get to plan everything at your own pace, and only have the game progress when you want it to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16094125261701957161gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16094125261701957161gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>"The world of Dig Dig Boom is planned to contain both handcrafted and procedurally generated content. Alongside this is a fully fledged in-game level editor, enabling player-made content. The handcrafted content functions as a controlled introduction to new mechanics. The procedurally generated caves provide a unique challenge for each run, in the style of a classic roguelike dungeon crawling game. The Roguelike aspect draws inspiration from modern roguelikes like Spelunky, Crypt of the Necrodancer and Noita."</p>
<p>Really sounds and looks rather good, and with the turn-based style to it it should satisfy explorers who like things just that little bit less chaotic.</p>

      <title>Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) announced - a game about being kind to real people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the game Kind Words? A tiny little thing that came out in 2019 that let you send letters to real people, along with listening to some chill beats. Well, it's getting an expanded sequel with Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop).</p>
<p>The first game was quite the hit with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating from over 7,000 user reviews on Steam. No doubt this one will be just as popular in the new setting. Especially since Kind Words 2 takes the original, re-makes it with lots of improvements and then expands it quite a lot and you'll be able to swap letter and stickers with players across both games. Now though it adds in getting dressed up, going to a poetry slam at a coffee shop and more.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>

      <title>Beat &#39;N&#39; Path has you combine creativity and logic to make musical machines</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beat 'N' Path sounds like a fun game for the creative mind, that has you design and build various machines to produce music across a career mode and a sandbox to create whatever you want. Coming from the same team that made Balloonatics and Groove Gunner, it looks quite the delight.</p>

      <title>You absolutely need to try Mechabellum during the Steam Free Weekend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mechabellum has sucked away more of my time than I would care to admit right now, and you too can see what all the fuss is about during the Steam Free Weekend. <em>Disclosure: my key was originally sent by TriplePoint PR.</em></p>
<p>A strategy game that doesn't take a lot of time to get through, since it's focus is the online PvP battles which generally only take a few minutes at a time. It's like a very cut-down version of Supreme Commander, with lots of explosions and varied unit types but for those who don't have hours and hours to spare constantly. It scratches an itch for me, and it really will suck you into "oh go on then, just one more game" as you want to try out a different strategy on another player.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5130095391701953434gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5130095391701953434gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Mechabellum on Linux, from a battle I had today.</em></p>
<p>It's not a traditional strategy game though. It's a round-based auto-battler. You pick your starting units and commander, and then each round you pick new units, upgrade, move things around and more. There's a lot of strategy to it, and it can take quite a while to get good at it. I just love the destruction of all the different unit types going at it. Wonderful stuff.</p>
<p>On Linux with Proton 8, it's pretty much flawless. Works great with good performance and looks awesome.</p>
<p>It will be free to try between December 7th, 6PM UTC - December 11th. They will also be running a discount on the game from December 9th - December 15th. One thing to note, is that eventually it will go free to play though with people who purchase getting some exclusive content.</p>
<p>For all the hours I have in it, I'm really happy with this one. Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors - Adventures Update out now, plus Among Us collab DLC coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is quite unexpected. Vampire Survivors is getting a new DLC later this month with an Among Us cross-over. Plus, a big update is also out now.</p>
<p>First up, the free Adventures Update which brings with it self-contained, mini story-modes that remix the game's content. They will keep expanding this but the first initial part out now adds in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">1 relic, Atlas Gate: Enables base game Adventures. Found in Boss Rash, minute 7.</div>
</li>
<li>1 new achievement for obtaining the Atlas Gate (in-game only. Will be added to the list on Steam together with the next content patch, your 100% is safe for the rest of the year!).</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">2 base game Adventures.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq">1 Adventure for the Legacy of the Moonspell DLC.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Developer poncle said part of the point is to "actually to give you an excuse to play VS when you feel like it, but have already unlocked everything the game has to offer" on top of giving you a "feeling of starting fresh, with a different set of weapons, without actually remaining behind with the progression of the base game"</p>
<p>As for the Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting DLC, they took some elements of Among Us and "freely re-interpreted them in a Vampire Survivors spin, for some outrageous, ridiculous, and hopefully fun, combinations of characters and weapons". Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1WMUJ_YMPlY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/320934630b023a6dd59bf9080b0708cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1WMUJ_YMPlY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Vampire Survivors: Emergency Meeting DLC releases December 18th for $2.49 / €2.49 / £1.99. It's pretty content packed too with multiple characters, 15 new weapons, a new stage and new music. I'm totally sold already.</p>
<p>The game has Native Linux support (still not advertised) and it is Steam Deck Verified. It's also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-november-2023/" target="_blank">regularly one of the most played games on Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>Buy it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">from Steam</a>.</p>

<li>Unify privileged group configuration between pam, systemd, &amp; polkit (<a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode/pull/375" target="_blank">#375</a>)</li>

      <title>dotAGE adds controller support - working towards Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>dotAGE is a challenging turn-based village builder, one that will suck away a lot of your time. It's a genuinely great game and it only keeps getting better! Now it has controller support, as the dev works towards being Steam Deck Verified and it already has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>"Dotage has deep worker placement mechanics inspired by board games. Build your village and assign your workers to their daily tasks, grow crops, herd animals, bury corpses, forge tools, upgrade buildings, train professionals, and produce dozens of resources. Each turn, the Domains, the forces that govern the world, will unleash increasingly powerful events on your village. From poison, to disease, to earthquakes, to kittens. Will you be able to survive them all and find out what is causing the apocalypse?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="m4crJPLWC30"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a98eac279529566d8d01ee41a4cef01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/m4crJPLWC30" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I actually missed writing it up when it released back in early October — woops! The developer did send over a key, and I've spent a number of hours with it recently and it has been quite hard to put down. You really do want just one more turn to see what it's going to throw at you next. Having proper controller support too, that's going to make staying away from it in bed with a Steam Deck quite difficult.</p>
<p>The controller support uses Steam Input, with official Xbox and Steam Deck layouts, and seamless switching between mouse/keyboard and controller along with plenty of UI improvements for controller players.</p>
<p>Other stuff that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Feature: Doomsday Mechanic</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new Doomsday mechanic. This allows snowballing runs to end sooner.</li>
<li>Doomsday Tower building is unlocked if you research the whole tree, or if you complete a game</li>
<li>Building the Doomsday Tower will trigger the Apocalypse immediately</li>
</ul>
<p>New Feature: Mini-Apocalypses</p>
<ul>
<li>Added mini Apocalypse events!</li>
<li>They work like Omens that do not increase threat level, and they come at a reduced strength (-2) compared to the current threat</li>
<li>They have effects similar to Omens, and take from their pools</li>
<li>They always happen 3 days before the corresponding Apocalypse</li>
</ul>
<p>New Buildings</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new building, Doomsday Tower, tied to the Doomsday mechanic</li>
<li>Added new building, Large Buoy, as an upgrade to Buoy</li>
<li>Added new building, Stone Toolmaker, as an upgrade to Stone Workbench</li>
</ul>
<p>New Score Formula</p>
<ul>
<li>Pips and Buildings now give 0 points for scoring</li>
<li>Protected Events now give 200 points instead of 100</li>
<li>Saved turns now give 300 points</li>
</ul>
<p>UX</p>
<ul>
<li>Added glyphs to Tutorial</li>
<li>Highscore tables are now separated per Elder</li>
<li>Revised highscore screen to support new scoring</li>
<li>Cycle pulsing now won't zoom anymore on creatures and will pulse only one at a time</li>
<li>Added "minimum font size" setting</li>
<li>Added a few controller-specific settings</li>
<li>Added several new hotkeys</li>
<li>Added hint for Doomsday Tower</li>
<li>Added new UI and text for Mini-Apocalypses</li>
</ul>

      <title>Check out the demo for Planetiles, a chilled city-builder like Dorfromantik</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enjoy games like Dorfromantik that have you build tiles and expand while mostly just chilling? Then you're going to want to look at Planetiles. Just recently the developer emailed in to notify their new demo "is 100% perfectly playable and optimised for Steam Deck and Linux".</p>
<p>You build natural habitats on remote planets to satisfy quests, and earn bonuses with strategic placement. You get various planet sizes, unlockables and the landscape changes and evolves with your choices. As you progress you'll also uncover special structures thanks to your clever tile placement choices, which can give you some special actions. So you get to turn a few trees into a big forest, and create distinct biomes. There's also no end-game, so you can keep planet hopping and building up until you want to take a break.</p>

      <title>The incredibly weird psychedelic physics game Juice Galaxy got a Steam release </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game I checked out back in 2021, Juice Galaxy (formerly Juice World), is a thoroughly odd game that is terribly hard to actually describe.</p>
<p>It's a very colourful and quirky open-world psychedelic physics game, where nothing really makes any sense. Look, I'm trying real hard to make any sense out of this one and I'm just stumped. Even the developer can't really describe it as they say "Juice Galaxy is a happy place to fly around and smack things and drink juice. And explore things. And just, flip around doing stuff. Use any of a multitude of weapons to clobber and devour the local wildlife. Gather juice to increase your power and take on more powerful enemies".</p>
<p>Take a look at the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kojcHlX3TzY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b2384f2c9fbc76697b7bea25bb8f6526.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kojcHlX3TzY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>That is indeed…a video game.</em></p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1708150/Juice_Galaxy/" target="_blank">available on Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>

      <title>Skyrim Special Edition updated with Steam Deck support, ultrawide res, bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm as surprised as you are but The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition just got a brand new update that includes Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>This update brings "<a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/52xMsb1fD2nTiNBkiWCbxq/build-share-and-find-creations-skyrim-special-edition" target="_blank">Bethesda Game Studios Creations</a>" to the Special Edition, which is a new and updated way to download community-made content in-game. Not only is this for making downloading mods easier, but Bethesda said modders can get verified through it and earn money from their creations. That's right, paid mods are coming back.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3796168831701805669gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3796168831701805669gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that there's now support for "ultrawide PC monitors, including 16:9, 16:10, 21:9 and 32:9 displays", lots of bug fixes, performance improvements, localization fixes and various in-game console improvements.</p>
<p>When it comes to Steam Deck support, they <em>don't</em> exactly say what they improved or added for the announcement. Big studios being as <em>helpful</em> as ever. In the <a href="http://bethesda.net/en/article/4ORD7tshfmHUN8H4ULSgE4/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-creations-update-patch-notes" target="_blank">patch notes</a> it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Steam Deck Support (PC)</strong></p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is now supported on Steam Deck! Whether your adventures take you on the road or just on the couch, enjoy Skyrim wherever you go with Valve’s portable PC handheld.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then under the PC Only section it just says "FEATURE: Support for Steam Deck."</p>
<p>It's <em>currently</em> at time of writing rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve, which was reviewed back in April 2022. The issues preventing it being fully Verified were needing to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard and a problematic launcher. Testing this update myself on Steam Deck and there was <em>no</em> launcher, it went straight into the game — that's one tick. And when going to name my character, the big Steam Deck <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17326071221701805617gol1.jpg" target="_blank">overlay keyboard</a> appeared — so another tick. Looks like it can be bumped up to Steam Deck Verified now.</p>
<p>That said, the trouble is, the game is old and doesn't let you change graphics settings in-game. So you're stuck with the defaults they set. If you wish to change them, setting <code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=0 %command%</code> as a launch option in the Properties will bring back the launcher.</p>
<p>Also, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition looks <em>awesome</em> on the Steam Deck OLED. I have so many other games to go through but…it's now calling to me again.</p>

      <title>Combined Arms, the big free retro C&amp;C and Red Alert combo 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Combined Arms brings Command &amp; Conquer and Red Alert action mashed together into a single <a href="https://www.openra.net/" target="_blank">OpenRA</a> powered game and the 1.0 release is out now. Probably one of my favourite standalone OpenRA games, since I grew up playing all the Westwood classic RTS games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15326411591701802208gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15326411591701802208gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Combined Arms 1.0 on Linux</em></p>
<p>The 1.0 release brings with it chapter VI of single-player campaign so there's now about 30 missions to play, they also added two new 8v8 multiplayer maps, a new music track, a new "Rhino Heavy tank (Stolen Tech - Soviet War Factory)", balanced various units and a few bug fixes.</p>
<p>Combined Arms allows you to play as Allies, Soviets, Nod, GDI and the Scrin. It takes gameplay elements from Tiberian Dawn, Red Alert, Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2 and even a little Generals. All factions have new units and the game has new artwork and sound effects too. It really is a big merging of the classics together.</p>
<p>Their download includes Linux, macOS and Windows versions. Since it's OpenRA it also has cross-platform online play.</p>

      <title>Minetest 5.8.0 is out now with improved settings, Minetest Game no longer default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minetest, the popular free and open source voxel game engine, one that can be used to play various different games (like a Minecraft clone) just released version 5.8.0.</p>
<p>There's some pretty big changes to how it works with this release removing Minetest Game from the default install. The idea seems to be a mixture of it not exactly being a good showcase, along with making Minetest itself more of a neutral game engine (and get away from all the Minecraft Clone comments).</p>
<p>Going along with that the main menu went through a redesign, prompting you to install an actual game and a much improved settings menu making it easier to use and more modern. There's also more antialiasing filters, rendering performance improvements, modding improvements and so on.</p>
<p>New settings menu layout style:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20673714061701783044gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20673714061701783044gol1.jpg"/></a>The settings menu now actually looks like it's from a modern game — hooray!</em></p>

      <title>Grand Theft Auto VI trailer is live but no mention of a PC release yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is no doubt going to be the absolute biggest release all year when it arrives in 2025, but for now Rockstar Games are only announcing it for consoles. In the <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/rockstar-games-announces-grand-theft-auto-vi-coming-2025" target="_blank">press release</a> they only mentioned PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>It's quite likely such a massive game wouldn't really run on the current Steam Deck, but for Desktop Linux we've seen Proton do some ridiculous magic to get even the most intense games working pretty well. By the time GTA VI is released onto PC, no doubt Proton would be able to run it (or soon after release as we see sometimes).</p>
<p>"Grand Theft Auto VI heads to the state of Leonida, home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond in the biggest, most immersive evolution of the Grand Theft Auto series yet."</p>
<p>Trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QdBZY2fkU-0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c8f85a91362886ad54f73692c87ea0f2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Grand Theft Auto VI continues our efforts to push the limits of what’s possible in highly immersive, story-driven open-world experiences,” said Sam Houser, Founder of Rockstar Games. “We’re thrilled to be able to share this new vision with players everywhere.”</p>
<p>Even though on Linux systems we have Proton, there's a rather big elephant in the corner, waiting to jump out and squash you with SURPRISE. That elephant's name is Anti Cheat. We have no idea what sort of tooling they're going to include with it, if they decide to go for some invasive kernel-based solution, both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux would probably be left out in the cold without a coat. Hopefully this won't happen. There's also the chance it could end up being an Epic Games Store exclusive, making it even more of a nuisance.</p>
<p>When do you think we might see an actual PC release of it? A year later?</p>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.5.9 Preview &#39;Well Paced Edition&#39; brings more fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Even more fixes are landing in Preview for Steam Deck in the SteamOS 3.5.9 Preview: Well Paced Edition update. I'm enjoying Valve giving them fun code-names too.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3870343609925005477" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graphics and Performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced stutters when the upscale filter was set to FSR or NIS under high GPU load.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue regarding frame-pacing and stutter, especially affecting some external displays.</li>
<li>Fixed display sometimes getting stuck at 60Hz after returning from sleep on the Steam UI.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a core could be stuck at 100% CPU if a game's window closed in an unclean way.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This comes shortly after the bigger <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/steam-deck-steamos-358-now-in-preview/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.8 Preview: Flatlined</a> update a few days ago, as Valve continue cleaning up issues from the rather <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steamos-355-rolls-out-to-all-steam-deck-owners-plus-new-steam-client-update/" target="_blank">massive SteamOS 3.5 update</a> that changed a ridiculous amount of the system.</p>
<p>Since it's in Preview you need to opt into it before Valve roll it out to everyone. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>Are there any particular bugs you really want to see solved right now that haven't been fixed in these two recent Preview updates?</p>

      <title>A favourite and top Steam Deck game Brotato is expanding with new content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Brotato is a great game, absolutely one of my favourites, it's also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/12/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-november-2023/" target="_blank">one of the most played Steam Deck games</a> and the good news is that it's set to expand! It is Steam Deck Verified by Valve and Platinum on ProtonDB.</p>
<p>One of the best bullet hell / bullet heaven games around and the developer just released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1942280/view/3881602608981549634" target="_blank">new update</a> fixing up a bunch of issues. However, they put the most exciting news at the top of the post confirming "Regarding the future of Brotato: New content will be coming to the game in the form of DLCs and free updates! We're excited for what's in store and will share more details as they become available.".</p>
<p>You can see a previous video of mine on Steam Deck below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="727NFQkdMBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf4ed8ef1d3451cd2081130c14178320.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/727NFQkdMBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm quite excited to see what will be coming to the game. It's already spilling with content in all the characters you can unlock, and with so many different weapons there's thousands of character build combinations to do that just makes it so entertaining to play through constantly. Seems like a game ripe for just continually adding into so I'm pleased to see more coming and and DLC will be pretty much a guaranteed purchase here.</p>
<p>Anyway, latest patch notes for now are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Added projectile and explosion opacity options to improve visibility in endless mode</li>
<li>Added option to limit FPS to 60</li>
<li>The health bar will now indicate whether tardigrades are still active in the current wave using a purple color</li>
<li>Reduced weapon cooldown variation for Multitasker with many weapons</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug preventing more than one weapon from appearing in shop on wave 3 (is now the same as waves 4-5)</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing revolver and chaingun to reset their interrupted cooldowns on stat changes</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing gardens that are far away from the player to stop spawning fruits</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing some consumables to drop outside of map bounds</li>
<li>Fixed the player HP bar being hidden by some effects</li>
<li>Fixed movement with controller D-pad</li>
<li>Fixed bug preventing crates from dropping items locked in the shop</li>
<li>Fixed bug that could cause the maximum HP regeneration rate to be linked to framerate</li>
<li>Fixed display bug preventing shop stats affected by material count from updating on reroll</li>
<li>Fixed bug that could cause effects to not be removed when weapons are combined or recycled after resuming saved game</li>
<li>Fixed bug that could cause incorrect danger level to display during run after resuming saved game</li>
<li>Fixed bug preventing boosted enemies from flashing when attacked</li>
<li>Fixed crash at wave end</li>
<li>Fixed UI bugs in options menus</li>
<li>Various performance improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Modding</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated godot-mod-loader to v6.2.0 (mod authors should check deprecation warnings)</li>
<li>Mods can now extend these classes without workarounds: Effect, EntitySpawner, ItemParentData, Weapon, WeaponStats, Shop</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also nice to see a game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> see such success with over 60,000 reviews on Steam and an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cyberpunk 2077 gets another big upgrade with a Metro System, new Accessibility options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most popular single-player games on Steam, Cyberpunk 2077 has received another big free update for all players. Cyberpunk 2077 is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve and Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1091500" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>Main new features in the 2.1 update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>V's issue with their NCART City Pass is resolved and they can now travel between the 19 metro stations located throughout Night City on 5 different lines via fast travel or riding the train itself while gazing out the window and watching the world go by.</li>
<li>V will now be able to invite their love interest to spend some time together in any of the apartments. Hangouts are a repeatable, unlimited event that become available once the romance path with a given character has concluded.</li>
<li>You can now listen to the radio while on foot (or while riding the NCART train) using the new Radioport feature. Available while you explore, it switches seamlessly to car radio whenever you get in a vehicle and turns off when quest-specific music starts playing. It is now also possible to adjust volume directly in the radio window.</li>
<li>Added replayable car races V can take part in after finishing The Beast in Me. Look for race flag icons on the map and win the races to get eddies and a discount for the Autofixer website. Additionally, we improved the racers' AI to make them more competitive and made enhancements so that the whole experience is much more fun!</li>
<li>Sightseeing binoculars in various scenic spots have been added as another way to appreciate Night City's vistas.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7B4r1jbpS2A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d7cac608c0cbdff0a2c04682dd7702ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7B4r1jbpS2A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The accessibility additions in this update will also be thoroughly welcome too with colour blind modes, text sizing options, improved subtitles, aim assist options, larger HUD options, the ability to remove HUD visual effects and more. Really nice to see these being added, although this is the kind of thing games should really have at release. I hope to see more developers add all this too to their games.</p>

      <title>EA opens up more patents for increasing Accessibility in gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA (Electronic Arts) have added a few more patents to their <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/commitments/positive-play/accessibility-patent-pledge" target="_blank">Patent Pledge</a> for Increasing Accessibility to help game developers. The idea is that game developers are free to use ideas they've patented, without fear of EA coming after them.</p>
<p>As EA say: "Through the Pledge, we share our accessibility-centered technology with the wider industry so that together we can meet the needs of our diverse gaming community. It covers some of our most innovative technologies designed to break down barriers for players with disabilities. This includes those with vision, hearing, speaking or cognitive conditions. Better yet, all this IP has been shared royalty-free, which means you won’t need to pay royalties or license fees to use it."</p>
<p>I covered some of what they did with this previously when they also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/ea-open-source-fonttik-helps-devs-check-text-size-a-contrast-m-plus-patent-pledges/" target="_blank">open sourced Fonttik</a>, but now they've added some more patents for devs to use including these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Auto-detects when a player stops interacting with a game and temporarily converts their player-controlled character to a personalized system-driven character.</em></p>
<p><strong>Patent No.: </strong><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10864446" target="_blank">US 10,864,446</a><br/>
<strong>Country: </strong>United States<br/>
<strong>Title: </strong>AUTOMATED PLAYER CONTROL TAKEOVER IN A VIDEO GAME<br/>
<strong>Date Issued: </strong>December 15, 2020<br/>
<strong>Date added to pledge:</strong> December 1, 2023</p>
<p><em>Provides guidance on performing in-game commands in a way that’s tailored to each player’s skill or play style.</em></p>
<p><strong>Patent No.: </strong><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10279264" target="_blank">US 10,279,264</a><br/>
<strong>Country: </strong>United States<br/>
<strong>Title: </strong>ADAPTIVE GAMING TUTORIAL SYSTEM<br/>
<strong>Date Issued:</strong>  May 7, 2019<br/>
<strong>Date added to pledge:</strong> December 1, 2023</p>
<p><em>Generates navigation routes and displays navigation aid lines directing players through large and complex game worlds.</em></p>
<p><strong>Patent No.: </strong><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10406437" target="_blank">US 10,406,437</a><br/>
<strong>Country: </strong>United States<br/>
<strong>Title: </strong>ROUTE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITHIN A GAME APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT<br/>
<strong>Date Issued:</strong>  September 10, 2019<br/>
<strong>Date added to pledge:</strong> December 1, 2023</p>
<p><em>Provides players a personalized, animated coach for improving their in-game performance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Patent No.: </strong><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11724201" target="_blank">US 11,724,201</a><br/>
<strong>Country: </strong>United States<br/>
<strong>Title: </strong>ANIMATED AND PERSONALIZED COACH FOR VIDEO GAMES<br/>
<strong>Date Issued:</strong>  August 15, 2023<br/>
<strong>Date added to pledge:</strong> December 1, 2023</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also put up <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/IRIS" target="_blank">IRIS</a> as open source under the BSD license on GitHub, which they say is a "solution created by EA to identify video footage that could potentially cause photosensitive epileptic risks", so it will help developers identify areas they may needs to improve / adjust as it will analyse "video content and checks for flashes and spatial patterns that could be harmful for people with photosensitive epilepsy, or cause discomfort in viewers".</p>

      <title>Adventure Mode for Dwarf Fortress arrives April 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kitfox and Bay 12 Games have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/3880475983255753766" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the new Adventure Mode for Dwarf Fortress (Steam) will arrive in April 2024 with a new trailer.</p>
<p>This is the game mode that's more like an RPG. You create a character and roam around the simulated world doing pretty much whatever you want. You can either use the world you made during the Fortress Mode or start an entirely new generated world for it. It's coming with numerous enhancements like new character faces coming with the procedural portrait system, rich conversations with character, a visual and mechanical revamp for combat with updated wrestling mechanics, plus an update to the world map to show off landmarks better.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fz1e5y4Ipzc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ef67d58d9806e309b3972c0f91894c07.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fz1e5y4Ipzc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Work on this mode is happening in parallel to the Fortress Mode, so expect more to come there too.</p>
<p>Dwarf Fortress has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Steam in Early Access</a>.</p>

      <title>Sons Of The Forest adds FSR 2.0 and better settings for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sons Of The Forest is one game that was sadly a little too much for the Steam Deck to handle at the release, but now it seems it should run a fair bit better.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/3907498306834312015" target="_blank">update</a> released at the end of November the developers not only put in some default settings for the Steam Deck and low-end PCs but they also implemented AMD FSR 2.0, so together it should give a much nicer experience on Steam Deck although you're still looking at 30FPS with drops below. Hopefully they will be able to optimize it further during Early Access.</p>

      <title>ControllerImage provides easy on-screen prompts for game developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer and game porter Ryan "Icculus" Gordon has created a new library named <a href="https://github.com/icculus/ControllerImage" target="_blank">ControllerImage</a> for game developers, with an aim to help showing on-screen controller prompts</p>
<p>Built on top of the popular <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a>, specifically SDL 3, the idea is game developers would use this to show things like "Press *controller button* to open" type of prompts in-game. No matter what controller, it would be able to show the right prompt, as long as SDL knows what that controller is.</p>
<p>As written in the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/project-93970348" target="_blank">Patreon post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something that's been bothering me for awhile is how SDL handles game controllers: you plug in darn near anything, and it can figure out what to do with it, so the developer can assume the player is using an Xbox controller even if the actual gamepad is built by Sony or Nintendo. It can sort it out whether it's a first-party controller you paid 70 bucks for, or it's something totally anonymous, bought for a few yuan at a chinese street market.</p>
<p>But all SDL does is say "I know this controller, here's where its equivalent of the Xbox Y button is" to the programmer, and not "I know this controller, here's <em>what it looks like" </em>to the player.</p>
<p>I set out to change that.</p>
<p>This is a dirt-simple library that builds on SDL's ability to detect joysticks, to provide scalable images of its buttons and other features, so you can show users instructions that match the controller in their hand, even for controllers you've never heard of, and for screen resolutions that don't exist yet.</p>

      <title>Linux share on Steam back to nearly 2% thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a couple of months of the Linux user share on Steam dropping, the November 2023 Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey shows it shooting back up again. With Steam Deck continuing to push Linux gaming. <em>See the data over time on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">the GOL Steam Tracker</a>.</em></p>
<p>As mentioned in the last article for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/october-23-steam-survey-simplified-chinese-rises-linux-and-macos-decline/" target="_blank">October 2023's numbers</a>, the issue was something we've seen quite a few times now. A sudden surge of Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam, which pretty much always brings down the Linux and macOS share. Things look back to normal again now though.</p>
<p>The current numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows </strong>96.56%</li>
<li><strong>Linux</strong> 1.91%</li>
<li><strong>macOS</strong> 1.53%</li>
</ul>
<p>When filtering just to the Linux numbers we can see that SteamOS Holo (Steam Deck) continues to be what's pushing the numbers up overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 42.99% +0.68%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.81% +0.27%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 64 bit 6.67% -0.06%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.33% -0.40%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.2 64 bit 4.25% +0.32%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.79% -0.16%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 2.68% +2.68%</li>
<li>Other 26.48% -3.33%</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck - SteamOS 3.5.8 now in Preview</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a fresh SteamOS update into Preview for Steam Deck, with SteamOS 3.5.8 out now fixing up various problems since the big 3.5 update.</p>
<p>One issue that concerned players, that was reported a lot, was the performance overlay GPU speed flipping between a low and high number which this should solve, on top of improving performance in some areas and general bug fixing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where modifying settings in the desktop partition manager could prevent the SD card from being mounted and visible in Steam</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in desktop mode where dropping a folder on the desktop would erroneously create a shortcut for every item within the folder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Graphics and Performance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay displaying GPU clock speed as an instantaneous measurement rather than an average, resulting in misleading numbers.
<ul>
<li>This matches behavior of SteamOS 3.4.11</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with elevated noise levels for trackpad pressure sensors. Affects only certain configurations.</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect colors (gamma) when using Steam In-Home Streaming.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare system crash on game exit</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in certain HDR titles wherein wiggling the cursor on the same frame as closing the game would cause incorrect colors in subsequent game launches</li>
<li>Improved a situation where a game's frame presentation could block because of buffers submitted by Steam or other windows, removing a potential source of game stutters.</li>
<li>When the frame limiter or vsync is enabled, the performance overlay now shows frame timings based on when they are flipped to the display, rather than when the GPU rendering was completed. The GPU-based timings are still visible on level four setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing stutter in certain games that buffer multiple frames in advance.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous compositor performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Roots of Pacha 1.1 adds new content and a fix for Steam Deck external controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The single-player and co-op life sim / farming game Roots of Pacha has a big update out now, with it there's plenty of new content and a nice fix for Steam Deck players docking to the big screen.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players and Linux Desktop, the game has been a bit problematic with controllers. That should be a little bit better with this update as they noted "Steam Deck now recognizes external controller and can work in docked mode". However, it's not fully fixed, as "there's still a known issue in the library we use that will prevent reconnection from a disconnected controller" but it's certainly better than it was.</p>

      <title>Story Mode for Them&#39;s Fightin&#39; Herds cancelled and active development to cease</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some sad news for fans of the fighting game Them's Fightin' Herds, as the developer Mane6 has cancelled the Story Mode and will be ceasing active development on the game.</p>
<p>This was announced on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/574980/view/3882727783056476087" target="_blank">Steam</a> in an update post going over the 5.1.0 version release that pulls in a new Armor Break game mechanic, along with various bug fixes. It also goes over a few details up an upcoming DLC character named Nidra, and teases the final DLC character Baihe. Below all that though, is a short note about the future of the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we look forward to the release of Nidra and Baihe, let's talk about what comes next.<br/>
After the Season 1 Pass is complete, we will be ceasing active development on TFH. We will still be able to release small patches to address game-breaking bugs, but no new content will be produced. Unfortunately, that includes Story Mode.<br/>
<br/>
Story Mode has always been an ambitious feature and one we truly desired to implement. We know how much our fans have been looking forward to Story Mode chapters, and we hope you understand how much we looked forward to working on and releasing them.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking for opportunities to release content that has already been produced for Chapter 2, starting with a new stage, "Restricted Section". This stage will be a part of the version 6.0 update alongside Nidra and Baihe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always a shame when long-promised features for a game don't happen, and it seems players really aren't pleased with this. Since the announcement went up on November 22nd, the recent user reviews on Steam are now Mostly Negative</p>
<p>You can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/thems-fightin-herds?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/574980/Thems_Fightin_Herds/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Demonschool, an upcoming light horror tactics RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Demonschool looks like one of the most unique tactics RPG I've seen for a while, and the new trailer that just went up really has me excited for it. Unique because of the movement and combat system, allowing for plenty of planning and experimentation — not to mention it's stylish as heck.</p>
<p>What is it: "a new-style tactics RPG where motion equals action. Defeat big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds as Faye and her misfit companions, while navigating university life on a mysterious island.". Developed by Necrosoft Games (Hyper Gunsport) and publishing help from Ysbryd Games (WORLD OF HORROR, VA-11 HALL-A). Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>Main Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tactics</strong>: Rewind any action during the planning phase and create combos to dispatch your foes.</li>
<li><strong>Story</strong>: A light horror narrative told through huge avatars with side quests aplenty.</li>
<li><strong>Schedule</strong>: Plan your school schedule to level your characters and build their skills.</li>
<li><strong>Friendship</strong>: 15 characters with whom to build relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's releasing in Q2 2024 with Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>

      <title>Huge update to Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 adds an Epilogue, new game modes and willy physics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that's quite an upgrade Baldur's Gate 3 just got, and one of my absolute favourite games of this year. Might be time to jump back in again!</p>
<p>The main headline features are all <em>great</em> like the new Epilogue, Honour Mode and Custom mode, improved inventory access and more but — there's one other little feature that they didn't seem to talk about, that plenty have been discovering to great surprise. I am of course talking about willy physics. Yes, all those people upset at release that there wasn't any wobbly bits can now rejoice. I don't think you <em>really</em> need to see it but <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/bg3willyphysics.mp4" target="_blank">video proof</a> (NSFW, obviously). Glorious.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17658034131701440859gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17658034131701440859gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The main highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Epilogue: An entirely new section at the end of the game that aims to provide a well-deserved sense of closure with your allies.</li>
<li>Two new play modes: Honour Mode and Custom Mode.</li>
<li>Many performance improvements, particularly in Act III.</li>
<li>Players playing on machines with low VRAM/RAM should see improved performance.</li>
<li>The game is now available in Korean!</li>
<li>While at camp, you can now access and manage the inventories of companions who aren't in your active party.</li>
<li>Added a brand new fight in Ramazith’s Tower.</li>
<li>Orin’s outfit now drops as loot and is wearable by anyone. We also gave it a suitably disgusting description and name.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Those performance improvements as well will be quite welcome, especially on top of AMD FSR 2.2 that was added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/baldurs-gate-3-patch-4-brings-amd-fsr-22-looking-better-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">in a previous update</a>.</p>
<p>For Linux Desktop and Steam Deck just make sure you're either on Proton Hotfix or the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/proton-experimental-fixes-baldurs-gate-3-improves-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2/" target="_blank">latest Proton Experimental</a>, as they have the needed updates to ensure the game will actually launch.</p>
<p>You can buy Baldur's Gate 3 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/baldurs_gate_iii?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6 - Beta 1 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team continue sprinting towards to finish line of the Plasma 6 release next year, with a Beta release now available for the popular Linux desktop environment which is also used on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Plasma 6 is the upcoming version of Plasma that integrates the latest version of Qt, Qt 6, the framework upon which Plasma is built. Plasma 6 incorporates new technologies from Qt and other constantly evolving tools, providing new features, better support for the latest hardware, and supports for the hardware and software technologies to come."</p>

<p>If you held off testing with the previous Alpha release, perhaps the Beta might be a good time to jump in. You can test it with a Plasma 6-powered distribution like <a href="https://neon.kde.org/download" target="_blank">Neon Unstable</a>.</p>

      <title>Battle.net broke in Wine / Proton - here&#39;s how to fix for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah launchers, don't you just love them? A reoccuring nuisance for Steam Deck and Desktop Linux gaming is that they can and will break and the latest to break (again) is Battle.net. Here's how you can fix it for now.</p>
<p>Firstly, for people just using Proton on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux direct through Steam you can use the bleeding-edge Beta of Proton Experimental. As <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1730445392058462509" target="_blank">posted on X</a> (Twitter) by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="css-175oi2r">
<div class="css-175oi2r r-1s2bzr4">
<div class="css-1rynq56 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-37j5jr r-1inkyih r-16dba41 r-bnwqim r-135wba7" data-testid="tweetText" dir="auto" id="id__kzdjjv7895r" lang="en" style="color: rgb(247, 249, 249); text-overflow: unset;">Initial Battle.net fix has been pushed to the [bleeding-edge] beta branch of Proton Experimental. Timing of mainline Proton Experimental availability is TBD.</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>How to do that? Find Proton Experimental in your Steam Library and go into its Properties -&gt; Betas -&gt; and select bleeding-edge from the dropdown box.</p>
<p>Another solution that you can try is to use this as a launch option on any Proton version in Steam:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>For people using some form of Wine / Proton in Lutris you can add WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY with a value of 1 as an environment variable in the system options inside a Wine runner you're using.</p>
<p>It can be frustrating when this happens, and it's certainly far from the first time Battle.net has broken along with EA, Ubisoft and other extra launchers. Thankfully this time it's an easy enough sort until it's fixed properly inside Wine and Proton directly.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> - 17:17 UTC: If you use Wine-GE, the latest <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-25" target="_blank">Wine-GE-Proton8-25</a> release has a fix for it.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.11 released with custom library categories</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher 2.11 is out now and brings with it an easier way to sort your game library by adding custom categories. This allows you to put your games into whatever category you want, just like you can do with the Collections feature on Steam.</p>
<p>So you would go to a game page, to the three dot menu, down to categories and then add it to an existing one or create a new one like below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11135809511701351069gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11135809511701351069gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19287417041701351068gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19287417041701351068gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Click pictures to enlarge</em></p>
<p>They developers also said "We also revamped all our filters to make it more seamless and to clean the library UI. Visual issues related to logs, dialogs, and RTL layout have been addressed, and anti-cheat runtimes are now enabled by default. We've also made several UI/UX enhancements and fixed some issues specific to macOS. Thanks to our amazing community for their contributions!".</p>

      <title>So what the heck is an &#39;indie game&#39; nowadays anyway?</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You'll have to forgive me, dear readers, because I am a little confused on what's going on at the moment. What the heck actually is an indie or independent game nowadays? Someone like <em>me</em> is probably supposed to tell <em>you</em> what it is, but honestly I'm just as confused as you are now.</p>
<p>The problem is, there doesn't really seem to actually be a good answer to this now. Game developers and publishers alike don't agree on it, and other prominent people in the industry all seem to have different opinions on it now too.</p>
<p>To add to the confusion, The Game Awards decided to put DAVE THE DIVER into the "Best Independent Game" category. A great game for sure but the problem is that while it may perhaps have the look of what a lot of people think is an indie game, in my book it's firmly <em>not</em>. You see it was developed by Mintrocket, a sub-brand of Nexon, who are a pretty big South Korean publisher that have <em>billions</em> in income. How, in any possible meaning of the term, is that indie?</p>
<p>Arguments on this have been ongoing since the nominees were announced a couple of weeks ago, and adding fuel to the fire now TGA's Geoff Keighley has given some thoughts on it during a recent <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1988267110" target="_blank">Twitch</a> (about 27:00) livestream and Keighley's response to a question on it was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look it's a great question. Independent can mean different things to different people, it's sort of a broad term right. You can argue does independent mean the budget of the game, does independent mean where the source of financing was, is it based on the team size, is it the independent spirit of a game meaning the kind of smaller game that's different. Everyone has their own opinion about this. We really defer to our jury, 120 global media outlets that vote on these awards to kind of make that determination of is something independent or not.</p>
<p>In other industries sometimes there are things like the film industry the budget can't be above this amount of dollars, some people said Larian with Baldur's Gate 3 that's an independent game, Kojima Productions with Death Stranding some people say that's an independent game and even though it's an independent studio of course it's funded by PlayStation. It's question like if you have a publisher, is that still independent or not. We also have Best Debut Indie Game, which is something I'm really proud of too, that's for teams doing it's first ever game this year, that's often really really independent studios just starting out and I love that we can recognise them that way.</p>
<p>So yeah Dave the Diver, that game is made by a group named Mintrocket, it's a smaller game from a smaller group  but it's part of Nexon which is a very large publisher so I think it's a fair debate and discussion is that game truly independent or is it not. You can kind of argue either way it's independent in spirit, it's a small game, I don't know what the budget it is but i think it's a probably a relatively small budget game but it's from a larger entity, whereas there's other games on that list that are from much smaller studios. Like Dredge, published by team17, so is that independent or not, 'coze you have a publisher. It's a really complicated thing to figure out and come up with strict rules around it, so we kinda let people use their best judgement and you can agree or disagree with the choices, but the fact that Dave the Diver was on that list meant that out of all the independent games that the jury looked at or what they thought were independent games that was one of the top 5 that they looked at this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keighley goes on to mention past game awards and games that won and how people debated this in the past, but basically sums it all up with the exact criteria being an "open debate for discussion". Seems to me that Keighley had no real answer on this. Just a lot of dancing around it, asking more questions of the category and just further adding to the confusion.</p>
<p>I get what Keighley was trying to say though, when mentioning how "it's a different set of games, and I like that we get to recognise different games in our show and not have the same 5-10 games nominated in every category". As otherwise, you likely would just get the huge publisher games filling up every year but the category itself is just not named particularly well it seems, or they need to actually properly settle on what indie actually is.</p>
<p>Certainly is an interesting debate.</p>
<p>So — over to you in the comments: what is an indie or independent game now? How would you define it exactly?</p>

      <title>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP gets a 2023 refresh and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP, originally released back in 2012, just got a fresh upgrade bringing with it some compatibility fixes and it's now also Steam Deck Verified too!</p>
<p>Not heard of it before? Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP is an exploratory action adventure with an emphasis on audiovisual style. Traverse a mythic little realm, use a sword to do battle &amp; evoke sworcery to solve mystical musical mysteries. Experience a videogame world that is affected by moon phases &amp; help a wandering warrior monk complete her woeful errand.</p>
<p>Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP features an album's worth of original music by noted composer Jim Guthrie as well as artwork &amp; designs by Superbrothers Inc, crafted &amp; engineered by videogame wizards at Capy in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15858397061701347570gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15858397061701347570gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/204060/discussions/0/6027566653454582072/" target="_blank">patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We had a lot of changes in the latest Sworcery update! Most of them are focused on bringing the game up to date for the latest operating systems and devices. This should help the game stay stable in the years to come! The biggest fix by far is the game can run on Steam Deck! After that, it's having the game run on MacOS again. Followed by better support for Linux and finally, better High DPI resolution support for Windows. We also fixed a whole bunch of little gameplay bugs, some kind of serious, some just janky, but all of them we think were pretty rare. Here's a breakdown:<br/>
 </p>
<div class="bb_h3">Upgraded:</div>
SDL 1.2 -&gt; SDL 2.26.0<br/>
FmodEx -&gt; Fmod Studio 2.2.16<br/>
Steamworks SDK -&gt; 1.57<br/>
Various Compilers -&gt; Latest/near latest Compilers<br/>
New minimum of Windows 10<br/>
New minimum of Ubuntu 18.04<br/>
New minimum of MacOS<br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Added:</div>
64bit support<br/>
Steam Deck Playable (We failed the Green checkmark due to showing some mouse icons)<br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Removed:</div>
Twitter/X support (libcurl)<br/>
Windows XP/Vista/7/8 support, Steam itself is set to remove support soon <a class="bb_link" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A" target="_blank">https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/4784-4F2B-1321-800A</a><br/>
 
<div class="bb_h3">Fixed:</div>
<p>Game running super slow on Steam Deck<br/>
Game runs on MacOS again<br/>
Fixed libcurl issues on Linux that prevented launching the game<br/>
Windows High DPI issues, game running at a resolution bigger than monitor, etc.<br/>
Plus soooo many little things, I honestly lost track!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Native Linux version was initially missing some files so it wouldn't run, so I held off on covering this until it was solved, which it now is so I can confirm it launches properly on Kubuntu 23.10 and Steam Deck now!</p>

<li>Fixed occasional "jerks" in "Gyro To..." conversion modes that used the gravity axis (i.e. Player Space, World Space, Laser Pointer modes).</li>
<li>Improved Gyro to Joystick Deflection mode's low level noise.</li>
<li>Reinstated horizontal haptics for all new "Gyro To..." modes.</li>
<li>Fixed UI: order of Steam Deck Gyro's Calibration readings.</li>
<li>Attempt to fix legacy Gyro "Joystick" mode - use the gravity orientation found upon app switch and subtract it from the live feed.</li>
<li>Added support for the NACON Revolution 5 Pro controller.</li>
<li>Fix: Nintendo Joy-Con gyro turn rates are now correctly calibrated for natural angles. Was previously at 80% real world turn rate.</li>
<li>Fix: "Gyro to..." modes jumping when adding/removing action layers or switching action sets.</li>
<li>Fix: Sony Dualshock accelerometer reading was incorrect on initial connection via bluetooth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed steam overlay causing rendering to stall in some titles (e.g. Watch_Dogs).</li>
<li>Fixed steam overlay causing crashes in some titles.</li>
<li>Fixed double click handling in steam overlay.</li>
<li>Fixed mouse clicks in the overlay for CS2.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>macOS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added "End of Life" alert for macOS 10.13 ("High Sierra") and 10.14 ("Mojave"). Steam Client support for these operating systems will end on February 15th, 2024 at 10am. See <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/743F-2E0E-C9A5-C375" target="_blank">here</a> for additional details.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam VR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop Game Theater - Only capture non-VR applications while visible in headset. Throttling will revert to default (monitor or no vsync, rather than headset vsynced) when content is not displayed in headset. This should fix most flat2vr type games, which require running the application at double headset framerate to generate stereo image pairs.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases of the VR dashboard showing itself on game start.</li>
<li>Fixed a couple cases where the dashboard was being opened when it should not.</li>

      <title>Steam Deck global top seller again thanks to cheaper LCDs and the Steam Deck OLED</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not exactly a surprise but still great to see for Steam Deck fans for the ongoing support from Valve, as the Steam Deck is now firmly the global top seller on Steam once again.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/after-over-80-weeks-the-steam-deck-leaves-the-top-10-global-sellers-on-steam/" target="_blank">I reported on previously</a>, until around the end of September 2023, the Steam Deck was consistently in the top 10 on Steam for revenue since the release back in February 2022. Revenue being the <em>key</em> word here, because Valve's lists are based on revenue as they don't give out units sold publicly. Then it dropped globally down to 11th in the week for September 26, 2023 - October 3, 2023 and hovered around 11th - 15th place.</p>
<p>Now that Valve have discounted the LCD models and released the Steam Deck OLED though, this has caused a nice spike in sales for Valve with the Steam Deck jumping up to 4th place for the week November 7, 2023 - November 14, 2023 and now the global <em>top</em> seller once again as of the week for November 14, 2023 - November 21, 2023 and it's still the top seller for the last week as well so it's firmly back.</p>
<p>Valve will of course be happy with this, as they plan to continue supporting all models, and they clearly have <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1722675542875402311" target="_blank">plans</a> for a Steam Deck 2 once the hardware becomes available that's a big enough of a performance boost. We don't know how many Steam Decks have been sold but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954205/valve-steam-deck-multiple-millions" target="_blank">it is now</a> in the "multiple millions" number.</p>
<p>When you look at <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/?lang=en" target="_blank">Komodo</a> who sell the Steam Deck across Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong they're currently listing the Steam Deck OLED models as out of stock right now too - so clearly there's healthy demand there as well.</p>
<p>Depending on availability, you may still be able to pick up a Steam Deck LCD model in 64GB or 512GB until they run out of stock as those models have been discontinued. Or you can go for the 256GB LCD model which is now cheaper, or just grab the excellent Steam Deck OLED in either 512GB or 1TB.</p>
<p>You can buy a Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">directly from Valve</a>.</p>

      <title>An Amazing Wizard is a bland name for a game but it looks like great chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Jakub Dąbrowski may need to work on their game naming, but at least the gameplay looks like it's a lot of fun in An Amazing Wizard.</p>
<p>Currently in development with a demo available on Steam (Native Linux support), it's a 2D fast-paced, metroidvania inspired rogue-lite featuring a procedurally generated world, over 250 upgrades, 7 different characters, over 100 spells to wield and going by the trailer it looks actually great with some pretty chaotic action going on. I'm getting a Dead Cells meets Skul: The Hero Slayer vibe with this one.</p>
<p>Have a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yMUFVrNXhvU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ce059a88e323ac0e95b72df458568acb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yMUFVrNXhvU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Planned Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD</strong> - Explore a unique world every time you play.</li>
<li><strong>ACTION ROGUEVANIA</strong> - This means permanent deaths where you lose everything you have found, but there are lots of permanent upgrades available.</li>
<li><strong>250+ PERMANENT UPGRADES</strong> - Upgrade your starting items or statistics, add more elements to the world, increase your chances of finding better items and many more!</li>
<li><strong>7 PLAYABLE CHARACTERS</strong> - Unlock and play as one of the 7 Elemental Wizards!</li>
<li><strong>ENCHANT YOUR SPELLS</strong> - Search for Astral Forges to add enchantments to all your Spells and Magic Weapons to add some special effects to them!</li>
<li><strong>250+ UNIQUE ARTIFACTS</strong> - Every artifact has it's own special use. A lot of them change your Basic Spell behavior or add special abilities. Literally countless combinations.</li>
<li><strong>100+ POWERFUL SPELLS</strong> - Cast Fire Balls or Tornados, Summon Creatures, Slow Time, Create Gravity Zones and many, many more...</li>
<li><strong>DOZENS OF MAGIC WEAPONS</strong> - Use one of many Magic Weapons to help you survive!</li>
<li><strong>5 NONLINEAR LEVELS</strong> - Only 5 levels? Yes, but each time you die you will respawn in one of the four nature-inspired worlds and face other enemies based on the current biome. Levels order is never the same!</li>
<li><strong>FEW DIFFICULTY LEVELS</strong> - Every time you kill the end boss, you will gain the possibility to change the difficulty level and face stronger foes.</li>
<li><strong>MANY BOSSES</strong> - After every level you will have to face a merciless boss.</li>
<li><strong>LEVEL UP YOUR CHARACTER</strong> - Gain Experience Points for killing enemies. Select one of dozens of perks after leveling up to make you even stronger!</li>
<li><strong>A LOT OF SECRETS AND MYSTERIES TO DISCOVER</strong> - No spoilers!</li>
<li><strong>HOURS OF FUN</strong> - This one depends on your skill. Something about 50 - 80 hours or even more!</li>
<li><strong>MULTIPLE SAVE SLOTS</strong></li>
</ul>

      <title>Aether combines Risk of Rain 2 with Wizard of Legend</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What do you get when you combine the elemental combat system from Wizard of Legend, with the gameplay progression from Risk of Rain 2? The result is Aether.</p>
<p>Now available in Early Access on Steam, developer ORYgames has created a rather entertaining cocktail of gameplay elements here. They sent me a key to take a look, and I have to say my initial impression is rather positive on this one, because it's a really good blending.</p>
<p>The basic gameplay loop is very much Risk of Rain 2 where you drop into a map and fight through enemies, collect relics to power up and then beat the boss to continue onto the next map. You'll do this using your elemental powers like Fire, Water, Ice and so on with one initially picked during the brief intro and the rest you can purchase as you progress through to swap between them. As you go through taking down enemies, you can then level up that element for you run to gain access to more powerful abilities.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BHkyO7bMdPg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6dd9b5ddea7065ba0f3e9f7b22bb0548.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BHkyO7bMdPg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's a new release, and Early Access, it's a little rough around the edges (especially the UI), but it shows an enormous amount of promise and it's already really fun to blast through with the different elements. If you love action rogue-lites, this is definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support built with Godot Engine.</p>
<p>Available in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2462790/Aether/" target="_blank">Early Access on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Xorg is dead, long live Wayland - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) dropping Xorg</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some interesting Linux industry news for you here, as the long road towards Wayland by default everywhere is taking another big step with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) removing the Xorg server and other X servers (except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rhel-10-plans-wayland-and-xorg-server" target="_blank">announcement</a> by developer Carlos Soriano Sanchez posted November 27th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to recognize the significant effort all these organizations and individuals have made, especially the rest of the upstream community, without whom this project would never be so mature. This effort gave us the confidence to first make Wayland default for most use cases in RHEL 8, followed up with the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/9.0_release_notes/deprecated_functionality#deprecated-functionality_graphics-infrastructures" target="_blank">deprecating</a> of Xorg server in RHEL 9, with the intention of its removal in a future release. Earlier this year (2023), as part of our RHEL 10 planning, we made a study to understand Wayland’s status, not only from an infrastructure perspective, but also from an ecosystem perspective. The result of this evaluation is that, while there are still some gaps and applications that need some level of adaptation, we believe the Wayland infrastructure and ecosystem are in good shape, and that we’re on a good path for the identified blockers to be resolved by the time RHEL 10 is out, planned to be released on the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>With this, we’ve decided to remove Xorg server and other X servers (except Xwayland) from RHEL 10 and the following releases. Xwayland should be able to handle most X11 clients that won’t immediately be ported to Wayland, and if needed, our customers will be able to stay on RHEL 9 for its <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#RHEL8_and_9_Life_Cycle" target="_blank">full life cycle</a> while resolving the specifics needed for transitioning to a Wayland ecosystem. It’s important to note that “Xorg Server” and “X11” are not synonymous, X11 is a protocol that will continue to be supported through Xwayland, while the Xorg Server is one of the implementations of the X11 protocol.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Red Hat and their engineers have their fingers in many pies across the Linux space, so this is a pretty big move, and one they say will enable them to "tackle problems such as HDR, increased security, setups with mixed low and high density displays or very high density displays, better GPU/Display hot-plugging, better gestures and scrolling, and so on" — which of course will end up benefiting everyone because that's how open source works.</p>
<p>Have you fully switched over to Wayland yet?</p>

      <title>Post-apocalyptic real-time strategy game Retro Commander is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for some more classic RTS action? Retro Commander from Noble Master is now officially released after 6+ years in development. Some of you might know Noble Master from their previous games like Age of Conquest IV and Demise of Nations.</p>
<p>You definitely get some early Westwood RTS game vibes from this like Command &amp; Conquer. The developer mentioned over email that "Retro Commander tries to emulate the classic RTS look and feel, albeit with modern day controls and elements. The game focuses on both single and multiplayer matches. A comic-based story campaign follows the footsteps of Agent Johnson, who wakes up in a futuristic wasteland. In over 25+ missions, you need to make new friends and fight against their enemies. The single player AI comes with several difficulty levels. In multiplayer games you fight co-op style with the AI and other players for ultimate victory. Players are given an ELO-like rating. The game supports cross-platform multiplayer matches against players on PC, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS.".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1zW6AUVAXlE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2c9e8508f522524c9d5c3a8632452c74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1zW6AUVAXlE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Post-Apocalyptic: Real-time strategy (RTS) played in a post-apocalyptic timeline on Mother Earth. The environment includes day-night cycles, rain, snow, wind and solar flare activity.</li>
<li>Story Campaign: Deep campaign and story line of humanity after a cataclysmic event. Factions come with their own specialized technologies such as stealth, robots, drones or shields.</li>
<li>Single &amp; Multiplayer: A challenging AI for both single and multiplayer matches with co-op play. Cross-platform multiplayer including LAN/internet. ONLINE play comes with an award and rating system.</li>
<li>Play Modes: In addition to regular skirmish matches, the game supports missions such as elimination, survival, capture the flag, defense and battle royale. Available in both single and multiplayer also are escort and rescue missions.</li>
<li>Structures &amp; Troops: Common troops for land, sea and air warfare is available to all factions. Specialized elements such as stealth, shields, EMP weapons, nukes, portals, orbital weapons, assimilator and other troops and structures provide for additional variety.</li>
<li>Research: A tech tree and research options enable to build specialized structures and troops. A Tech Snatcher can be used to steal enemy technology.</li>
<li>Modding: A map editor is included allowing for player-modded maps including player-modded campaigns. All elements including troops, structures, as well as graphics and sound effects, can be modded if desired.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just like their previous games you get a couple little tutorial levels free to play plus some multiplayer maps, and then you have to buy the rest of the game. It's a curious way to try to pull people in that not many games on Steam do. The actual full complete game can be picked up as a DLC on Steam or in-game for £16.75 / $19.99.</p>

<p>GUNHEAD is the latest release from Alientrap who also made CRYPTARK, Capsized and Wytchwood. It's also just been updated to improve it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What is GUNHEAD? It's technically a sequel to CRYPTARK but with a new perspective as a fast paced strategic roguelike FPS where you take the role of a pirate mech with a gun for a head, looting derelict spaceships filled with monstrous drones made out of bone and steel.</p>
<p>In a recent patch they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/704000/view/3889483182511062265" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We've updated to 1.44 - focused on better Steam Deck support.<br/>
<br/>
- Will default to 130% UI scale for Steam Deck<br/>
- Better scaling of the UI for different UI scales<br/>
- Larger fonts (inventory, license station)</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Seems like a good time for me to jump in and take a look! Check out the launch trailer below:</p>

<p>Ready for your next hardware purchase? How about a new Linux notebook that's all-in with AMD? The TUXEDO Sirius 16 looks delicious.</p>
<p>"Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky and a binary star system. With the new Sirius 16 - Gen1, TUXEDO is breaking new ground and launching the first and long-awaited full AMD Linux gaming notebook named after the celestial body, especially since the TUXEDO Sirius 16 is also powered by a particularly exciting binary star, consisting of the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and the AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT." — TUXEDO Computers</p>
<p>What you get here is quite the powerhouse with a 16.1 inch 2560x1440 display, with a 165Hz refresh rate. Backed up by the 8 cores and 16 threads from the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS, a large 80 Wh battery, 2x 8 GB DDR5-5600 RAM and 1x 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13466143511701093094gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13466143511701093094gol1.png"/></a><br/>

<p>As you might be able to tell from the image above it has a colour-adjustable light bar on the front edge as well as a per-key RGB-backlit keyboard for those of you who like things a little less plain.</p>
<p>Plenty of room for upgrades during configuration or <em>after</em> purchase with the ability to up it to 96GB RAM, and they say it has two easily accessible M.2 slots when you remove the base tray, which is covered by their warranty, so you can configure it up to 2 x 4TB SSDs with a fast PCIe 4.0 connection.</p>

      <title>Plasma 6 full steam ahead with only one showstopper left for Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As the KDE team continue working full steam ahead towards Plasma 6, they're now down to a single showstopping bug for having Wayland by default. Written up in a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2023/11/24/this-week-in-kde-the-plasma-6-feature-freeze-approaches/" target="_blank">blog post</a> as usual by developer Nate Graham, recent work for readying Plasma 6 sounds great.</p>
<p>The last bug considered a showstopper is "<a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444335" target="_blank">Full sticky keys functionality does not work under Wayland</a>", so once that's solved they will consider it ready to be default. There's various other bugs of course, with lots of users now testing and reporting from the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/kde-plasma-6-gets-a-first-alpha-release/" target="_blank">huge Plasma 6 Alpha release</a> but mostly minor issues.</p>
<p>Another important issue that has now been solved is that Plasma on Wayland will now actually prompt you about unsaved changes in apps, instead of just rebooting or shutting down and allowing you to lose your work. Thankfully no Wayland protocol changes were needed for this.</p>
<p>Found an app behaving badly? The "Kill unresponsive window?" is now fully online on Plasma Wayland and got a modern UI face-lift.</p>
<p>Something else that's been changed that sounds useful is that when you upgrade to Plasma 6 from Plasma 5, if there's Widgets you were using that aren't API compatible it will be shown in a "user-friendly way" so you don't think it's all just broken.</p>
<p>A reminder on the roadmap for Plasma 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>8 November 2023: Alpha</li>
<li>29 November 2023: Beta 1</li>
<li>20 December 2023: Beta 2</li>
<li>10 January 2024: Release Candidate 1</li>
<li>31 January 2024: Release Candidate 2</li>
<li>21 February 2024: Private Tarball Release</li>
<li>28 February 2024: Public Release</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to seeing everything Plasma 6 has to offer up at release next year for my desktop. And eventually on Steam Deck when Valve pull it into a future SteamOS upgrade for the desktop mode.</p>
<p>Is there anything in particular you're looking forward to in Plasma 6?</p>
