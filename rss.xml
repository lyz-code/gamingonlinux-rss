      <title>Steam games will now need to fully disclose kernel-level anti-cheat on store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a change for Steam today that will make things a lot clearer for everyone, as developers will now need to clearly list the kernel-level anti-cheat used on Steam store pages.</p>
<p>In the Steamworks Developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4547038620960934857?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> Valve said: "We've heard from more and more developers recently that they're looking for the right way to share anti-cheat information about their game with players. At the same time, players have been requesting more transparency around the anti-cheat services used in games, as well as the existence of any additional software that will be installed within the game."</p>
<p>Developers with games already on Steam will also need to do this, as it's not just for new games coming up for release, and it is also part of the release process now too. So Valve will be doing checks on games to ensure the notices are there and correct.</p>
<p>However, it's only being <em>forced</em> for kernel-level anti-cheat. If it's only client-side or server-side, it's <em>optional</em>, but Valve say "we generally think that any game that makes use of anti-cheat technology would benefit from letting players know".</p>
<p>Valve's example pictured below:</p>

      <title>KDE&#39;s end of year fundraiser is live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you appreciate the work from the KDE team on things like the Plasma desktop environment, maybe it's time to give them a little donation. KDE are looking to raise at least €30,000 with the total being updated each day.</p>
<p>This time around they've given the page a special Halloween theme with some short stories about issues with proprietary software. They're just a little reminder of what can happen like licenses being pulled away, companies using your work to train their AI, Windows updates being forced while you're working and more. Some truly horrifying stuff there.</p>
<p>From the fundraising page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're kicking off our 2024 end-of-year fundraiser just in time for Halloween!</p>
<p>Even if the spine-tingling horrors of the long dark night of Walpurgis are mostly imaginary, the sinister threats of predatory proprietary software providers remain all too real.</p>
<p>Fear not! We, the KDE community, will help you, your friends, family, company, and community banish all the creepy and insidious proprietary software that haunts your computers, phones, and household appliances.</p>
<p>But we can't do it alone! We need you to help us fight the good fight against the tech-ghouls from beyond. Use the form to donate any amount to our fundraiser (or become a regular donor to our community) and help us keep the dark forces of proprietary software at bay.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See all on <a href="https://kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2024/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their fundraising platform</a>.</p>
<p>KDE Plasma is my favourite desktop environment, I would honestly feel a bit lost without it on Linux nowadays. It's nice on the Steam Deck Desktop Mode too. I just recently updated Kubuntu from 24.04 to 24.10 as well, getting all that Wayland goodness from a much more recent Plasma version has been fun to test.</p>

      <title>Bazzite updated to Fedora 41 with expanded PC gaming handheld support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite Linux has seen an upgrade to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/fedora-41-is-out-now-with-plenty-of-enhancements-like-easier-nvidia-driver-installs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">just released Fedora 41</a>, and with it comes lots of extra enhancements to their support of various PC gaming handhelds from AYANEO, ROG Ally and others.</p>
<p>What is Bazzite? It's "a cloud native image built upon Fedora Atomic Desktops that brings the best of Linux gaming to all of your devices - including your favorite handheld". Basically, it's a SteamOS-like based on Fedora that can turn your Windows handhelds into a smooth Linux device.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the Bazzite F41 update they've got an updated Linux kernel v6.11 that includes patches for Ayaneo, OneXPlayer, Ayn, basic controller support for the MSI Claw and a whole lot more goodies. Some of these changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker patches for Ayaneo Geek, Geek 1S, 1S, 2, 2S, Kun, Flip KB, Flip DS, and Ayn Loki MiniPro.</li>
<li>Display quirks for Ayaneo Flip DS, Neo 2S, GEEK, Founder edition and Ayaneo 2.</li>
<li>ROG Ally has a new patch that "selects the correct firmware for the Ally speakers, offering superior performance for users that used the incorrect firmware previously".</li>
<li>OneXPlayer X1 and X1 Mini sensors driver updated with "support for charge limiting and charge bypass" plus allowing control of the Turbo LED.</li>
<li>The MSI Claw also had support added to the "Handheld Daemon, where the front OEM buttons and the controller will work properly in Steam Gaming Mode". Lots of work still needed there though as there's plenty missing like TDP controls and back buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of background work on the Bazzite project as a whole too. Bazzite has grown massively recently, with even the likes of Digital Foundry giving it a spin showing how it can improve on the mess of Windows on handhelds:</p>

      <title>Fedora 41 is out now with plenty of enhancements like easier NVIDIA driver installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora 41 is officially out now and brings with it plenty of upgrades for all users. Here's just some of what's new and improved.</p>
<p>If you stick with Fedora Workstation you'll get the newer <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/gnome-47-denver-released-with-accent-colours-and-various-system-enhancements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GNOME 47</a> that comes with lots of additions I covered before like accent colour customization, enhanced small screen support, an improved Files app, a better Online Accounts system and much more.</p>
<p>Specifically in Fedora 41 there's IPU6 Camera support and improvements for Traditional Chinese. A big one is support for installing Nvidia drivers with secureboot, although the process needs a few steps it's good to see it in. There's also a new terminal app with Ptyxis.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5173878781730288226gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>Fedora KDE got some nice upgrades too like<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/kde-plasma-62-released-with-improved-wayland-colour-management" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> KDE Plasma 6.2</a> that has improved Wayland colour management, lots of enhancements for drawing tablets, overhauled accessibility options and so on.

      <title>Steam Beta adds plenty of Game Recording improvements plus a Steam Play update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve rolled out another two Steam Client Beta updates recently, as they continue pushing the Game Recording system towards a stable release. The fixes are the same for Steam Deck and Desktop since it's a Steam Client update.</p>
<p>From the update on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4507632758953083307?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">October 28th</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the names of manually added or removed games not appearing in the collection filter header if the game had been removed from the user's library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced clip export/share time in many cases when exporting native resolution, codec, and frame rate.</li>
<li>Added ability to start/stop recording of a clip via manual recording shortcut key, when in background recording mode.</li>
<li>Updated desktop toast notifications during game recording to show clipping action and depict clip duration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4507632758953083387?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">October 29th</a>, which also has an adjustment of Steam Play for third party compatibility tools (like GE-Proton, Luxtorpeda and others):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed steamwebhelper deleting temp directories that it may not have previously created.</li>
</ul>
<p>Game Recording</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended the "auto" quality setting, which sets the recording bit rate based on the game's video resolution, into four levels: low, medium, high and ultra. These replace the prior fixed bit rate quality settings. See the quality setting dialog for more info.</li>
<li>Improved the speed of exporting a file in some scenarios.</li>
<li>Recording video with AMD GPUs should now use a higher H264 codec profile setting.</li>
<li>Improved navigation of Game Recording Settings in Big Picture</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend recent Steam Play fixes to third party compatibility tools.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's been a few adjustments to Steam Play recently like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-removes-option-to-globally-disable-steam-play-plus-game-recording-improvements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removing the global toggle</a> to turn it off, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-makes-a-big-improvement-for-native-linux-games-in-a-steam-beta-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using a newer container runtime</a> instead of the legacy environment for better compatibility overall.</p>
<p>How long do we think before Game Recording rolls out in a stable update? How are you getting on with it? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>Beelink have open-sourced their Multi-Functional EX Docking Station for mini PCs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor Beelink have "open-sourced" their Multi-Functional EX Docking Station that you can use to extend their GTi Ultra Series mini PCs with a full GPU.</p>
<p>I can't find anywhere that lists a <em>specific</em> license, so it may not be OSI approved "open source" by their definition of it but they are being very open about it and their promise includes the patents too. Seems like they want it to become a standard of some sort, which would benefit them too. If more and more vendors decided to use it, that would make them eventually easier and cheaper to produce with more options.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3529386751730284255gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3529386751730284255gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/Beelinkofficial/status/1849734433194283115" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on Twitter / X from the official Beelink account:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Stellaris: Grand Archive and a free update are out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox have released Stellaris: Grand Archive, a pretty fun sounding story pack for their popular sci-fi grand strategy game. There's also a free update out now as well.</p>
<p>Developed together with Abrakam (Faeria, Roguebook), with it you get access to the Grand Archive, a new megastructure where treasures found across the galaxy can be studied and displayed. Giving you a Vivarium where you can dissect and research various creatures along with two entirely new deadly forms of Space Fauna, two new origins, and a new mid-game crisis, amongst other features.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>

<p>Thankfully, this time, it seems Paradox have done quite well with it getting some good user reviews unlike Stellaris: Cosmic Storms that's currently sat on Mostly Negative. </p>

      <title>Speedollama is an ultra fast, violent and silly platformer-shooter out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming from Chaosmonger Studio who created ENCODYA, Clunky Hero, Three Minutes To Eight and other games is a new release with Speedollama. <em>Note: key provided by the developer to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>If you enjoyed games like Metal Slug, Contra and other classic action-platformers, you'll probably love this one quite a lot. It's ridiculous in all the best ways, but still very much on the simple side mechanically overall. Speedollama, as the name suggests, is all about <em>speed</em>. You race through the generated levels to collect items to unlock the exit against the timer, blowing up every single alpaca that's in your way and watching all their pixel bodies explode into tiny pieces.</p>
<p>Making you feel like a speed-runner, although with procedurally generated levels, you get to choose from 3 different characters each with slightly different stats. As you progress through you will also be able to purchase a few character buffs to make it just that little bit more crazy.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EYFWldXi1bo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd730858a46150fd1b096d0db71db9a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EYFWldXi1bo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said how it "pushes the limits of the run-and-gun genre" and they're not wrong. I had to take a few breaks, just because of the speed of it all to allow my mind to catch up a bit. Run, gun, bounce around chaotically and keep on running some more. Reminded me a fair bit of Broforce, without the environmental destruction, with the sprinkle of comedy too.</p>
<p>Speedollama is just totally absurd. You can't help but smile as you run through it.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and works great on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Procedurally generated levels offering endless replayability.</li>
<li>Vibrant, coloured pixel-art graphics with hand-made frame-by-frame animations.</li>
<li>Fantasy violence with humorous splatter scenes and gallons of pixelated blood.</li>
<li>A variety of weapons and upgrades to enhance gameplay.</li>
<li>Extremely fast-paced action for adrenaline-fueled fun.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage gets improved Steam Deck support and now rated Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ubisoft gave a very small update to Assassin's Creed Mirage on Steam and managed to get it bumped up to a Steam Deck Playable rating. <em>The rating and update went live today.</em></p>
<p>Don't expect much though, they didn't make any specific upgrades to the game. Here's what they announced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game will automatically detect your Steam Deck and will run default settings for better performances on this device. We recommend keeping using the proposed presets to smoothly experience Basim's coming of age story on your Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, this is absolute minimum-level effort stuff. They haven't announced any plans to improve it elsewhere, so that may be the best we get for it.</p>
<p>Why is it rated Playable? First up: Ubisoft Connect (that's required) has issues where you may be forced to use the touch screen and it may have small text. On top of that you will need to <em>manually</em> bring up the keyboard any time it's needed, some in-game text is too small and the game will also not exit clean so you have to force close it when you're done as you get left with a black screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19171083541730218978gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's a bit of fun behind the scenes info for you: surprisingly, Ubisoft sent a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>. However, it came with a major problem. I <em>couldn't</em> actually play Assassin's Creed Mirage at all. I'll give you one guess as to why. It was due to Ubisoft Connect — what a surprise! Did you guess correctly? I bet you did.</p>
<p>Even though Ubisoft release their games on Steam now, and will be going back to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-and-star-wars-outlaws-head-to-steam-as-ubisoft-return-to-same-day-releases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">same-day releases</a> for future titles, they still use their additional launcher. Not just that, it <em>also</em> needs a special activation code (like a CD Key). For Steam purchases this is done in the form of a DLC. For Steam Curator keys, initially this activation code DLC was <em>not</em> actually linked up.</p>
<p>I spoke to Ubisoft Support, who gave me the usual unhelpful runaround of not actually reading what I wrote. Ubisoft Press <em>didn't</em> even reply and Valve support initially gave the usual unhelpful didn't-read-it reply too. 3 days later, the activation code DLC was suddenly in my Steam Library. Steam support then replied again that same day, to note basically "you're wrong, it's there" — well of course because someone did fix it. Who? I'll apparently never know. <em>Update: Ubisoft press did reply, after the article was published, but it's solved now anyway.</em></p>
<p>Somewhat a unique situation being a Steam Curator, but just another in the list of why these extra launchers can be a nuisance. 3 days of waiting on it…</p>

      <title>Ubuntu Summit 2024 highlights - Linux gaming talks on UMU and Heroic Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Ubuntu Summit 2024 has been and gone, and with it we had a lot of good talks but with our focus on here with gaming there's two that stand out that you may wish to have a look at. <em>Currently the talks haven't been split up so they're across three big livestreams.</em></p>
<p>On Day 2 there was a <a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/580/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> from Paweł Lidwin of the Heroic Games Launcher project, a cross-platform free and open source launcher for Epic Games, GOG and Amazon Prime Games. The talk gives a brief overview on what they've been working on like UWP/WinRT in Wine, Comet for GOG multiplayer features and more. But Lidwin also does a quick little sneak peek intro on a new project called Maxima Launcher, an open source replacement for EA Desktop / Origin that will eventually get Heroic integration too.</p>
<p>Skip to 8:43:32 for the Heroic talk:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZNK4aSv-krI?rel=0&amp;start=31410"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92bd9d3153728cdc2de20533101aa2b5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZNK4aSv-krI?rel=0&amp;start=31410" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Then on Day 3 we had a <a href="https://events.canonical.com/event/51/contributions/510/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a> from Thomas Crider, also known as <em>GloriousEggroll</em>, who made GE-Proton (originally called Proton-GE) on the creation of UMU the unified launcher for Windows games on Linux. It's a nice overview for people confused on how UMU works and what it's actually for. The talk goes over how Steam actually runs games on Linux, and how UMU deals with running Proton outside of Steam along with the UMU Database that has a bunch of game-specific tweaks to run them properly.</p>

      <title>AYANEO continue teasing the AYANEO 3 Code: REVO handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While still giving us no actual details, AYANEO are hyping up the AYANEO 3 Code: REVO handheld that's due to be announced properly sometime soon. Their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/ayaneo-tease-the-ayaneo-3-as-a-revolution-and-a-completely-new-concept/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial announcement</a> was just marketing speak word-salad, and — surprise, this <a href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/857" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">latest</a> isn't really any different.</p>
<p>They're saying it's "not just a product of technological innovation, it is also an awakening of product thinking" whatever that means. And it will bring "not only hardware innovation, but also a deeper change in the way players interact with their handhelds". Once again, it's like they picked a bunch of buzzwords, put them on a board and threw darts at it to pick out things to say. They continued to note how they aren't just "looking for a faster and more powerful device" but are also "exploring the boundaries of the AYANEO handheld gaming experience". Okay then.</p>
<p>Going by the teaser pictures they included, it's very much a traditional handheld shell design, so it's not exactly that much of a revolution. But, there's only so much you can do with handheld PC designs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3797216291730197813gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3797216291730197813gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11555724631730197814gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11555724631730197814gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>From that second teaser image, it looks a lot like the Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p>They touched on how previous handhelds have "many trade-offs and compromises among portability, performance, control, battery life and experience" and claim that the "AYANEO 3 brings a new level of freedom, a technological leap, and a conceptual revolution and sublimation, allowing us to say goodbye to the constraints and welcome more possibilities".</p>
<p>Hopefully Bazzite and other Linux versions can get support for whatever it turns out to be nice and quick.</p>

      <title>90s horror adventure game Clock Tower: Rewind released outside Japan for the first time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Clock Tower released originally in 1995 for the SNES and later for other systems, but it was never officially translated and supported outside of Japan until now with Clock Tower: Rewind. You'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> to play this one on Linux systems.</p>
<p>Not one I'm actually familiar with directly so I'll let the official blurb speak: "Turn back the clock for one of the pioneers of the survival-horror genre. Translated and released outside of Japan for the first time, Clock Tower: Rewind is a revival of the terror-inducing 16-bit classic that dares you to explore the haunting confines of the Barrows family manor. As teenage orphan Jennifer, you must search every disturbing corner to find items, reveal secrets, and discover ways to evade Scissorman, a murderous, unstoppable, shears-wielding psychopath."</p>
<p>Gameplay trailer below:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The survival-horror classic, Clock Tower, officially translated and brought out of Japan for the first time</li>
<li>Choose from Original mode or Rewind mode, which features numerous gameplay additions and quality-of-life refinements</li>
<li>Run, hide, and survive as you attempt to evade the psychotic Scissorman</li>
<li>Atmospheric 2D art, detailed animations, and haunting sound effects augment the tense point-and-click gameplay</li>
<li>Multiple endings and randomized gameplay elements maximize replayability (and jump scares)</li>
<li>New animated opening, motion-comics with VO, and vocal theme song performed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn</li>
<li>Featuring an art gallery, music player, behind-the-scenes creator interview, save states, and other modern inclusions</li>
</ul>
<p>Nice to see more classics available to a wider audience.</p>

      <title>Men of War II finally gets an offline mode with a big content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Men of War II from Best Way originally released back in May, but it forced an online connection. With the Steel Rain update out now that's no longer the case. Nice to see the developer actually deliver on what they promised.</p>
<p>You can now switch between offline and online modes and additionally the developer added the ability for all single-player modes to have the option to change the game speed. They also mentioned how "the quality of the game world simulation will now improve based on the power of your PC" as well. They also said they expect almost everyone to notice "a somewhat less “arcadey” feel of the game". Online play had some tweaks too like an improved MMR score calculation, which they feel is a "significant improvement".</p>
<p>New content too like 8 new units and 3 new battalions, plus updated models for a bunch of existing ones. Some new visual effects are in, new blood effects, particle reflections in water, particles got shadows, smooth fading of light sources at a distance and lots more. There's also new and improved sound effects, unit balancing and the list goes on.</p>

      <title>Set comfort level to maximum with the Mechanism Gaming Pillow for handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You may remember Mechanism from their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original Deckmate</a> system of attachments for the Steam Deck, but they have since expanded to cover other handhelds and they also now have the Mechanism Gaming Pillow.</p>
<p>For full disclosure: the Mechanism team sent it over a while ago for review, and it has become something I now use without even thinking about — it just makes sense. If I'm not going to be docking it, and I'm sat where I can sit back and relax a bit, I will absolutely be popping the Steam Deck into it without question.</p>
<p>However, I wasn't even remotely convinced until actually getting it and using it for a while. Why? Just the very idea of a gaming pillow never really appealed much to me. I thought it would be gimmicky, or just a fancy pillow with the word gaming attached to bring up the price. Thankfully, the Gaming Pillow from Mechanism is actually a genuinely good idea.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21002292951730129889gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Image credit: Mechanism</em></p>
<p>Here's the thing: I play on my Steam Deck near-enough every day. A lot of the time, I prop my arms up with some sort of pillow underneath anyway. At times on my sofa building something resembling a pillow fort just to get properly comfy for a decent gaming session. Why? The dreaded aching arms, and slightly sore neck that can come with holding it up for a while.</p>
<p><em>Mechanism's Gaming Pillow solves the entire problem and then some. </em></p>
<p>It's super simple to attach it together. All you need for the Steam Deck is the Deckmate mount that you just slot over the top of the Steam Deck, and then you just click it into the arm mount on the Gaming Pillow. The Gaming Pillow can be purchased with a mount for the Steam Deck, ROG Ally / X, Nintendo Switch, and there's also adaptors for the dbrand and JSAUX cases plus there's a universal grip to stick it to anything else.</p>
<p>From there, you can then position it pretty much whichever way you want with the pillow sat on top of you. This is thanks to the ball socket attached to the end of the arm, allowing you to really get it where you want it. So even if you're tall, or you have short arms, or you're just generally short (hi) it's not an issue getting it into position.</p>
<p>It entirely frees up your arms to game for longer sessions without worry. Maybe you want to quickly check your phone or have a sip of your coffee or whatever without dropping the Deck itself or moving it anywhere. It will just sit there floating in the mount waiting for you. There's even an extra mount directly on the top of it for you to stick down a battery pack, a USB hub, your phone or whatever else you might need while relaxing with your handheld.</p>
<p>While I think it's great, there is <em>one</em> thing that annoys me about it. The material and coating on the top where you rest the Steam Deck (if you have it set down low) is a bit squeaky with any movement of the attachment rubbing on it. Not overly distracting, but still just a tiny bit annoying. Other than that, it's quite wonderful.</p>
<p>I would have liked to have more to say about it, but there's not a lot of extra I can add in here that wouldn't just end up as nonsense text-padding. It does exactly what it advertises, and does so very nicely. I no longer have to build up a little pillow fort under my arms to get comfy and that's wonderful.</p>
<p>You're still going to look a fair bit silly with it though but who really cares when you're the master of comfort.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://getmechanism.com/products/gaming-pillow" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the Mechanism website</a>. It's being done in batches with the next expected in November.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the few actually popular MMOs that has official Native Linux support, Albion Online has expanded again today with the Horizons update out now.</p>
<p>This sandbox MMO update brings with it a customizable HUD with a built-in HUD editor so you can move everything around to where you want it. You can also save and share your layouts with the ability to have 10 saved at a time for different activities.</p>
<p>The world should feel a bit more interesting too with dynamic encampments to find as you explore for both solo and group play with some valuable loot. You might also find a special map which gives you access to a special boss lair to fight through. There's also dynamic resource hotspots, you might now find valuable coffers to open up across the open world, a new portal system for solo players to jump to unpredictable locations for easier exploration in the Outlands and a lot more.</p>

      <title>Create completely ridiculous weapons in survive-em-up roguelite shooter NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor on the surface may look just like yet another survivor-like, but it has captured my total attention in a way not many have been able to. It's just thoroughly great. <em>Note: key provided by Fiveamp.</em></p>
<p>Much like all the others in the genre that spawned from Vampire Survivors it has the basics: repeated runs where you take down enemies, while you collect little experience orbs to level up. Here though, you're also building a gun as you go through various attachments (that they call augments). What you can end up with is totally <em>ridiculous</em> and I love the way you see your attachments represented in the weapon itself on-screen as you run around. Although I do hope they expand on this visually, as some attachments don't change the look at all. <em>A bit like how Brotato evolves your character's look as you go.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f09L7Uy5xII"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7c93de2b73a7dbde6c9b66f40615c602.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f09L7Uy5xII" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a lot that sets this apart from other games in the genre too that I'll go over a few bits of now. For starters: the level up system. Here it's not completely automatic. When you reach a level up, a pod will drop down you have to run to collect. Even that can be a little challenging at times, due to the amount of enemy swarms you might be dealing with. It's also just a supremely cool idea to have a pod drop down to buff your weapon with some new attachments.</p>
<p>When you die, the weapon you've built <em>won't</em> just vanish either. You go back to your little home base, where the weapon with all the attachments is on the floor. You can pick it up to test it again, or give it to a drone that will follow you around and the drone will level it up exactly how you made it during a run. A really clever idea that gives some extra meta progression to the game. If you decide you didn't like the weapon, you can sell it for some credits towards unlocking more weapons and attachments to use during a run. Or, you can put it on display to swap with the drone later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6061212851730120076gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6061212851730120076gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The map you drop into also needs actual exploration. You start off with a pretty blank map covered in a shroud / fog of war, which gets revealed as you run around. This exploration stays for your next run too, so you'll know more of where you want to go. As you explore you'll find various new areas with new types of enemies, along with the option to collect blueprints to unlock more weapons and attachments. <em>The map is also pretty darn big.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17355577861730120023gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17355577861730120023gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Trying to get a blueprint is quite difficult too as you need to stand in a specific area around a case, while a percentage ticks up towards 100% where you unlock the blueprint to buy it after a run. But, while you're waiting for the timer, enemies will swarm around you.</p>
<p>Quite a few different enemy types too and some entertaining boss battles as well, with each little boss getting their own fancy little mini-intro to highlight that they've appeared. Like all good survivor-likes, you unlock more of the game as you go. As you defeat these mini-bosses, more doors in the home base will be available to walk through giving you access to more features.</p>
<p>A game that continues to open up the more you play it. Through all the weapons, the attachments, new areas of the map, the drone adjustments and so much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8621063321730120224gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8621063321730120224gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Nice and accessible too with options to auto aim, auto fire your main weapon and seperately the underbarrel if needed (so you could auto fire main weapon, and have say a grenade launcher underbarrel set to manual) or you can play it like a proper twin-stick shooter. The option is yours — the perfect balance.</p>
<p>With the Early Access release there's already a <em>lot</em> of weapon types and attachments to try out many combinations with plans to add in more guns, more attachments, more enemies, more minibosses and just a lot more of everything. The developer said the current plan is to continue development in EA for at least a year, and if successful they will continue with post-release updates too.</p>
<p>Once you do die (and you will, a lot) the game over screen gives you a nice amount of details too. Showing off what killed you, how long you lasted, distanced travelled, missions completed and lots more to show off to friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21446843501730120024gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21446843501730120024gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It works thoroughly great with Proton on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck. The developer noted they put great effort into ensuring it works well on Steam Deck. While performance in some places could be improved, overall it's great. The only issues on Steam Deck are the black bars at the bottom and top of the screen, hopefully they add the proper aspect ratio to use the whole Deck screen. And some text on items is a little small, so they need some scaling there.</p>
<p>Now if you'll excuse me, duty calls, I'm off for another run in NIMRODS: GunCraft Survivor because it's just that good. It has instantly become my new go-to game for when I need to blast around in something for a while. This will keep your attention for a whole lot of hours if you wish to not only complete the missions to unlock more, but to keep trying out the hundreds of combinations of weapons you can build. Awesome. Go grab it.</p>

      <title>Portal fans may want to try the demo for Total Reload</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you loved the overall style of Portal and enjoy puzzle games, Total Reload looks like one to keep in your watch list. The developers recently updated the game to include a Native Linux demo too.</p>
<p>A strange sounding one, with a description from the developer that leaves more questions than answers. There's something wrong with the Universe itself apparently it's just one big disaster, so you're going to try and reboot it all. Well, that's certainly an idea.</p>
<p>As they said: "The game world of TOTAL RELOAD consists of many locations connected by special devices for fast movement called Quantum Transporters. Each location has different energy sources that you have to combine into a single network with Quantum Transporters. Some energy sources are located in hard-to-reach places, and to get there, you'll have to use wires to temporarily supply power to various objects: moving platforms, sensor grids, energy filters and closed doors. In TOTAL RELOAD you have to learn to “think with wires” or, in other words, understand that by temporarily supplying power to various objects you can get to previously inaccessible locations."</p>
<p>See their gameplay trailer below:</p>

<p>It's due for a full release on January 15, 2025. Sounds like the demo is worth a go!</p>

      <title>Complex 2D train management sim Iron Roads hits Early Access in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a Demo and Steam Playtest available, Iron Roads from Cowleyfornia Studios is a top-down 2D train management game that's going to enter Early Access next year. Cowleyfornia Studios mentioned the EA date is now set for January 20th.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ijQ1tREKF0s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ed343d003c868eab69afa5f6b7c46301.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ijQ1tREKF0s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iron Roads is a top-down 2D train management game for Desktop and Mobile with a focus on optimising train networks. Its minimalistic interface is easy to learn, but encourages deep and sophisticated gameplay. We’re aiming for the accessibility of Mini Metro and the depth of simulations such as OpenTTD, while also capturing the irreverent tone of games like Theme Hospital.</p>
<p>In addition to more established train management mechanics, Iron Roads explores themes surrounding sustainable development. Rather than encouraging unconstrained construction, the game reacts to the player’s actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some of the features already in include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up fast transport networks that will get erudite animal passengers to their destination on time</li>
<li>Efficient transport of goods in complex production chains.</li>
<li>A minimalistic interface that is easy to learn, but that allows for many happy hours optimising and building networks.</li>
<li>Music in Iron Roads is a combination of notes generated from trains and passengers, and authored melodies. The music generated is as unique as the layouts built by players.</li>
<li>Contracts: Scenarios come with a grant system where players can follow focussed goals to earn extra money and get the satisfaction of ticking off a to-do list.</li>
<li>Performance graphs: the main goal of Iron Roads is to optimise the train networks, so charts are available to analyse data relating to finances and passengers.</li>
</ul>
<p>With a plan to add mod support, multiplayer, weather events and more.</p>
<p>The developers mentioned to me that not only does it have Native Linux support, but it's also mostly developed on Linux. Eventually they will also be adding in full controller support so it will be a better experience on Steam Deck then too.</p>

      <title>Factorio: Space Age sold over 400,000 copies and sets a new player count record</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wube Software have announced some pretty incredible numbers after the release of the Factorio: Space Age DLC.</p>
<p>Released on October 21st, the Space Age expansion for Factorio is a truly huge addition to the game, and it's clear a lot of players are happy with it. In their latest Friday Facts <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Wube Software mentioned how they've managed to sell over 400,000 copies.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing numbers for a game that's a good few years old now. Not just that, but the player numbers have absolutely rocketed upwards with it hitting a peak of 118,674 about 15 hours ago. For comparison the previous peak was "only" 34,700 all the way back in 2020.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution survival sim Thrive v0.7.1 is a feature-filled release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is an open source evolution sim that has continued to impress me, and the latest release version 0.7.1 is nice and feature-filled.</p>
<p>Some nice improvements to the visuals in this release too, it's not just about new features. The world backgrounds are now much more dynamic with new effects like bubbles and distortions with various layers. The developers added a bloom effect, membranes are now fully 3D to make cells look more realistic, new ice chunks and more work to bring up the visual assets in the later stages of the game.</p>
<p>A major new game mechanic with oxygenation has been implemented too. With this you now initially spawn on a world without oxygen, but the world will evolve with you and oxygen will slowly be produced by various lifeforms and so you'll need to deal with the new systems revolving around that. As a whole the game is just a lot more dynamic now. </p>

<p>There's more to the update including a rework of the auto-evo reports, giving you a better understanding of what exactly is going on in the world. Plus there's now a Food Chain tab, so you can see the distribution of organisms across different levels of the chain.</p>
<p>Thrive has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.

      <title>Check out the classic CRPG inspired Passageway of the Ancients out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now with Linux support from Passageway Games, a new retro-styled RPG is here for you to sink some hours into with Passageway of the Ancients.</p>
<p>With gameplay and a visual style clearly inspired by many of the great early CRPGs like Neverwinter Nights and Baldur's Gate, this might be quite the treat for fans of the genre. This is a game that very much feels like a blast from the past right down to spending an age customizing your character.</p>
<p>The character creator is a bit of an odd one. It has lots of customization for body parts size like upper arm mass, triceps tone, breast size, belly girth, the size and shape of your hips and so on. Lots of individual bits, but then it skimps on things like hair colour with only a couple of options. Either way, you're going to be there a while. Look at the options for just your nose:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16522720701729964350gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16522720701729964350gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>I won't say how long I was there, but it was a while…</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Passageway of the Ancients takes you to the world of Aieryon – the galaxy’s sole remaining magical planet – where you explore the city of Ithgar to solve an unspeakable crime. Beset with grief, you’re tasked with surviving deadly creatures lurking behind every door while gathering clues, managing your party, and leveling up your characters. You also must pick locks and solve Runic puzzles to gather the best loot."</p>
<p>Certainly a peculiar mix this one. Giving you somewhat tactical real-time combat with pausing, along with a strange dual personas system. At the start you pick your <em>public-facing</em> race, but you also have a special "Dragonkindt" form that you develop simultaneously. There's also a few different necessary options to tweak for the combat. Like melee for example lets you pick your attack form, attack height, stroke type and so on. Then magic allows you to tweak a few different things too like your vocal energy put into it, complexity of the spell mechanic and more that all together change how fast you cast and how much damage you'll do — it can be a little confusing to get into. <em>So many options.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3UIFoiGnd9o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/183f3737ba1a5ff801d548843546449d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3UIFoiGnd9o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you want an RPG that's clearly designed with love for the classics, but also tries to do its own thing this is definitely one for you. Passageway of the Ancients will have you ending up getting totally absorbed by it for a whole lot of hours as you explore the world, especially while hunting for some good loot. I'm certainly looking forward to more from Passageway Games!</p>
<p>“Releasing a game like Passageway of the Ancients in 2024 feels like going back in time – back to the days of 40+ hour campaigns with no microtransactions ... just a straightforward, polished experience you can enjoy free of interruptions. We sincerely hope gamers give our little CRPG a chance. It’s packed full of everything we love about the classics: a feeling of adventure, plenty of danger, interesting characters, and challenging scenarios. It’s the game I’ve been dreaming about making for decades.” – Jon Grierson (Creative &amp; Technical Director, Passageway Games)</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engage in Turn-Based &amp; Real-Time Combat: Use both turn-based and real-time elements – drawing on real medieval weapons and tactics.</li>
<li>Unleash Your Dragonkindt Nature: Develop your character’s two personas simultaneously – a hidden “Dragonkindt,” and a public-facing race of your choosing.</li>
<li>Sharpen Your Wits &amp; Make Strategic Choices: Manage battle spoils, solve puzzles, adjust the frequency of special activities, choose interactions, and gather clues.</li>
<li>Wield Powerful Magical Items: Carefully equip items affecting intelligence, will, and other character attributes.</li>
<li>Customize Your Character: Choose your character’s alternate persona, appearance, and gender as Dwarf, Elf or Human.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support which as far as I could tell works really nicely.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta removes option to globally disable Steam Play plus Game Recording improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh Steam Client Beta for Desktop and Steam Deck fixing up some bugs, plus some improvements for Game Recording.</p>
<p>There's one fix that's specific to the Steam Deck that Valve noted: "Fix overlay hanging for some games in Desktop mode after the game restarts itself". Plus one just for the Desktop client: "Fix a case where the wrong DPI scaling factor would be used for systems using a non-gnome based session with an active gnome-desktop-portal service."</p>
<p>As for the rest it's the same across both Desktop and Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix progress bar not updating during game update and move operations involving large files</li>
<li>Fix overlay hanging in some games on macOS and Linux after the game restarts itself</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game Recording</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for automatic gain control for recording microphone</li>
<li>Added support for forcing microphone input to mono for misconfigured stereo mic setups</li>
<li>Fixed a bug preventing loading of additional programs to record audio at client start time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Big Picture Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix keyboard input dialog in-game failing to close/re-open properly if Steam Overlay is toggled while visible</li>
<li>Fixed multi-line mode support in the dialog shown by the ShowGamepadTextInput API call in Steamworks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always allow the Steam client to fallback to X11 when SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER/SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER is set to wayland.</li>
<li>Remove the UI toggle to disable Steam Play globally, correctly reflecting that Steam Play is always enabled on Linux. Steam Play was always partially active even when set to off in the UI as it is a requirement for Steam client operation.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS released and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SEGA fans might want to check this one out. SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS has arrived and it has already been Steam Deck Verified by Valve. This means you should be good to go on desktop Linux too with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a>, which is what Valve set for it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>More about it: "Shadow the Hedgehog is back with Classic and Modern Sonic in SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS, an all-new collection featuring two unique experiences!</p>
<p>Play as Shadow in a brand-new story campaign featuring never-before-seen abilities that prove why he’s known as the Ultimate Life Form! Speed through iconic stages from Shadow’s history, discover hidden secrets in an expansive hub world, and unlock new powers to take on Black Doom and save the world.</p>
<p>SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS also includes a complete remaster of the highly acclaimed SONIC GENERATIONS, a time-traveling adventure featuring a greatest-hits collection of 3D and 2D Sonic stages, now with upgraded visuals and new bonus content."</p>

From here, you can upgrade characters, craft and customize weapons, take on side missions, and build shops to buy and sell items. Upgrade these shops to unlock even better equipment and weapons. Make your Hideout a home by building structures and other cosmetic items.</li>
<li>Gather Loot - Survive the island one day at a time by looting its valuable resources for weapons, medical supplies, ammo, blueprints and more. Sell looted items at the shops or use them on yourself. Make sure to return to the Hideout safely after gathering loot because items are lost upon death.</li>

<p>I spoke with the studio co-founder, Justin Miersch, who confirmed today they still plan to have Linux support at release. Good news for shooter fans!</p>

      <title>Rockstar Games Launcher (GTA V, Red Dead Redemption) gets updated for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rockstar Games released an update to the Rockstar Games Launcher which actually includes an improvement for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Even though they're still <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blocking GTA Online in GTA V</a> for Linux platforms like Steam Deck (single-player works) and claiming they never supported it anyway, they're still improving things for Steam Deck players elsewhere.</p>
<p>The update for the Rockstar Games Launcher for October 24th <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/34741693164819/Rockstar-Games-Launcher-Title-Update-1-0-97-2200-Notes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[October 24, 2024] - Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that resulted in the Rockstar Games Launcher not resizing when maximized.</li>

<li>Improvements have been made to how titles are launched on Steam Deck.</li>

      <title>Deadlock from Valve gets 6 new experimental heroes and new stylized rendering of heroes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continue expanding their upcoming game Deadlock, the online third-person MOBA shooter. The latest update is quite a big one too.</p>
<p>The first major addition is the inclusion of 6 new heroes in the Hero Labs, a new experimental matchmaking mode. Valve said the goal is to get early feedback on these newbies, whose names aren't final but for now they are: Holliday, Calico, Wrecker, Fathom, Viper and Magician.</p>
<p>Additionally, Valve also completely changed how they actually render the heroes. Using a brighter and more stylized display to improve visibility. As their example shows it's quite an improvement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20123320511729858213gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20123320511729858213gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Numerous other changes were added too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Commends. You can commend players you've enjoyed playing with during the game or in the post-game scoreboard (same places you would report). The number of commends you've received on each hero will be displayed in your profile.</li>
<li>Added sequential kill streak music cues.</li>
<li>Added keybinds for "Fly Up" and "Fly Down". Used for flying abilities like Ivy's Air Drop and Vindicta's Flight</li>
<li>You can now drag and drop build categories to move them around</li>
<li>Added quick-selection for favorite builds. Clicking on the name of your currently active build in the shop will bring up a dropdown that lets you switch between favorited builds for that hero without opening the build browser.</li>
<li>Various new sound effects.</li>
<li>Lots of gameplay and hero balancing changes.</li>
<li>Some map changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See the <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/10-24-2024-update.40951/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>You still need an invite to access it and to run it on Linux you need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. It's not clear if Valve will add a Native Linux version or not and not likely until much closer to the main release if so.</p>

      <title>That&#39;s the weekend sorted! Brotato adds 4 player local co-op and Abyssal Terrors DLC out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My favourite top-down arena shooter rogue-lite, Brotato, has a free update and big new DLC out now with Brotato: Abyssal Terrors. It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>For everyone you get local co-op for up to 4 players, 4 new characters, 5 new weapons, 15 new items, new music, new accessibility options and more. By itself that would be quite a decently sized addition to the game, and free too so you certainly can't complain.</p>
<p>The co-op trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0cJ5DvHwnBE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/871e914ea3ef3cd464f7ed4a48f88f08.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0cJ5DvHwnBE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>But then there's also the Brotato: Abyssal Terrors DLC that adds in a new map with 20 waves of new enemies, elites and bosses! Plus 14 new characters, 16 new weapons, over 30 new items, new game mechanics, new music, new achievements and so on.</p>
<p>DLC trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VSFmHdk9WAI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d0dc40420ebf580e28681bafcebcf92f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VSFmHdk9WAI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For £3.39 the DLC is very reasonably priced considering the extra content, plus the free update - an easy purchase.</p>
<p>I've sunk lots and lots of hours into this one, and now it's about to absolutely destroy my time once again. Definitely looking forward to some co-op chaos. Absolutely wonderful. If you've still not picked it up you're really missing out.</p>

      <title>Slay The Princess Review: As Pristine As The Blade Cuts Deep</title>
      <author>alexa_bement</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One year later, the path in the woods has been well-traveled, the Princess has been slain or saved many times over, and at the end of that path is the Pristine Cut major free update, the expansion on the base game that aims to fill in what's missing and bring the game to a completed state.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l9S92mzFAkw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ea2a5d242a6a4ceba95d5c33b09b6899.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l9S92mzFAkw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Now that it's out, did the Pristine Cut elevate the already masterful base game to new heights? Let's find out what's in the cabin in chapter two:</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style="color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic">The Story --- No path in the woods left untraveled</h3>
<p>The characters and themes of Slay The Princess were some of the strongest points of the original release. With the Pristine Cut additions, I can safely say my minor complaints of feeling some routes had more depth than others have been fixed. Everything that was expanded upon in the Cut adds to the overarching theme by exploring the nooks and crannies left out. With the new full game, you see every part of the theme at hand play out, leaving you with no stone unturned to understand the story. You will also get to see a few 'what if' scenarios play out that I didn't even think the game was willing to explore. All of the characters, who were already deep to begin with, gain even more depth in the extended cut. Most of the Voices have new avenues of their character explored, with situations that make you see them for what they truly are. None of them are fully just the adjective that describes them, and I love to see that nuance from them. The Narrator in particular shocked me by showing me there is even more to him than I thought possible. And of course, we get to see even more of how the Princess feels and thinks, but the Hero is shown in new lights as well. We took for granted what he is and how he works.</p>
<p>At the end of this, I am satisfied with what I saw. I feel Slay The Princess has told its story to completion, and anything that was left murky with the original release is explored with the depth that allows you to understand everything the game is. The new chapter three from the Damsel route in particular hit as hard emotionally as the golden ending of the original game. The cacophony of emotions I felt watching that play out will stick with me.</p>
<p></p>
<h3 style="color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic">The Gameplay</h3>
<div>While virtually unchanged from before, there are a couple new details I appreciate the addition of. The cursor now changes even more depending on what's going on in a route, and there's a new icon for situations where you no longer have a hand to hold anything with. Just as before, I appreciate the level of detail present in the game. There's also a new gallery of still art unlocked as you go along finding each outcome, a welcomed and valuable addition to make it easier to find and appreciate all the frames that went into this masterpiece.</div>
<h3 style="color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic"></h3>
<h3 style="color:#aaaaaa; font-style:italic">Conclusion</h3>
<p>With the Pristine Cut additions, I can officially say Slay The Princess elevated itself to a 10/10 experience. The routes no longer feel uneven, the story is even deeper and more beautiful, anything that was missing has been added, you have the TAB key to skip dialogue you've seen before, and just about all of the minor route logic errors have been fixed over time. Slay The Princess is a masterpiece, plain and simple, one that will leave you satisfied with this horrifically beautiful love story. The team set out to make it even better, and they most definitely made it even better. This free DLC gives the game the complete package it deserved. The Pristine Cut sends this absolute labor of love off with a beautiful waltz out of the cabin.</p>
<p>So open up your game and get ready to walk down the path in the woods again- there's more Princesses to slay and save, and a lot more to learn about yourself and the Voices in your head. We're sending off one of the best indie horrors with a final bow and a closing of the pages.</p>
<p>Slay The Princess has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>Pristine Cut Review Score: <strong>10/10</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/argonaut-games-announced-a-return-with-a-remaster-of-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in August</a> I reported on the new remaster of the classic Croc Legend of the Gobbos, and today it has been revealed it will be a <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> exclusive on PC. The release will have both the classic version and the remastered version available on GOG.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Wsd8f6P4uJA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/252304dc1454571f901355204ab3d18e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Wsd8f6P4uJA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Remaster</strong><br/>
<br/>
With enhanced HD graphics, modern control mechanics with an updated camera, retro video modes, and the same delightful gameplay that charmed all of us in the 1990s, you’ll dive into a beautifully recreated world filled with vibrant colors, captivating landscapes, and playful challenges to ignite your imagination. The remaster offers a true blend of nostalgia and modern gameplay, ensuring an authentic experience that pays homage to the original while inviting a new generation to discover its timeless magic.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Classic</strong><br/>
<br/>
While we suspect that the original Croc needs no introduction, here’s how it was described to gamers all the way back in 1997:<br/>
<br/>
<em>Croc's Got The Moves!<br/>
<br/>
Help Croc, the humble little green crocodile, rescue his peace-loving Gobbo friends from the grasp of the evil sorcerer Baron Dante. Guide him through a beautifully-rendered 3D world on a free-wheeling, free-roaming adventure against Dante’s impish assistants the Dantinis!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>5 different 3D worlds to explore including volcanoes, ice glaciers, and underwater caves</em></li>
<li><em>Free roaming, stunningly rendered real time 3D gameplay lets you go anywhere as you run, jump, climb, swim…</em></li>
<li><em>More than 40 levels, enemies galore, and bosses to keep you busy!</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: “The Croc remaster aims to reignite the imaginations of players with its enhanced HD graphics, updated modern controls, and an authentic gameplay experience that will transport players back to the golden age of gaming,” said Jez San, Argonaut Games’ founder.</p>
<p>“Croc Legend of the Gobbos is both a nostalgic return for retro-gamers and an exhilarating new adventure for first-timers. We have dedicated ourselves to bringing this remaster to as wide an audience as possible so that fans of PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC on GOG can experience the magic and enjoyment of Croc," added Jez San.</p>
<p>“Croc represents the heart of our mission: preserving and celebrating the legacy of gaming. By offering both the classic and the remastered versions in one package and keeping all our games DRM-free, we’re ensuring that players not only relive the magic but have the true sense of ownership, as well. We’re the ultimate destination for gamers who want to experience timeless classics as they were meant to be played, and we couldn’t be happier for Croc to become a part of this adventure,” said Bartosz Kwietniewski, Head of Business Development at GOG.</p>

<p>So with that you'll need some form of Wine / Proton to run it on Linux / Steam Deck. My favourite being the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>

      <title>AYANEO tease the AYANEO 3 as a &#39;revolution&#39; and a &#39;completely new concept&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unlike Valve who confirmed again recently they are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-still-waiting-on-a-generational-leap-for-steam-deck-2-but-its-coming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waiting for a generational leap for a Steam Deck 2</a>, AYANEO are doing yet another handheld with the AYANEO 3.</p>
<p>A few days ago AYANEO put up a <a href="https://ayaneo.com/article/855" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> full of fancy marketing wording like how it's a "revolution in AYANEO's product definition, changing gamer's imagination of handheld consoles" and that it's "not only a technological leap, but also a completely new concept, which to some extent foreshadows the future possibilities of handheld devices".</p>
<p>The marketing speak continues with zero actual details on, well — anything at all really. They're really hyping this one up though claiming it "symbolizes the new direction of gaming handheld" and that the "future has arrived". <em>Okay then. Whatever you say.</em></p>

<p>Obviously it will ship with Windows, just like all their previous handhelds, but it likely won't be too long after release until it's supported by the likes of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steamos-alternative-bazzite-adds-support-for-onexplayer-plus-improvements-for-rog-ally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">popular SteamOS alternative Bazzite</a> which supports lots of different handheld gaming PCs. AYANEO did try for Linux once, and then promptly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">backtracked on that</a>.</p>
<p>What to expect? Good question. Most likely is AYANEO adding in the latest generation of AMD chips inside to give it another boost in performance. Aside from that? Well their marketing lingo makes it sound like it might have a new shell design. Who knows, I guess we'll find out soon won't we.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jackbox are trying something a little different with their latest party game, that uses answers from everyone to make it constantly unique in the The Jackbox Survey Scramble. A collection of survey-based games that starts off with four game modes at launch, with plans to add more game in modes in free updates.</p>
<p>It supports 2-4 players with no special controller required, just a phone or tablet will do like their other games. All modes in this one support English, French, Italian, German, Castilian or Latin American Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese. Jackbox also said they'll be ensuring localised answers are available for the UK and Australia.</p>
<p>As usual for Jackbox, it has full Native Linux support. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oPqck0NjkPs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/371743c1b66bcd7a2527ff1f2351d9fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oPqck0NjkPs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">The currently included game modes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hilo: Can you guess the most popular one-word cat names? How about the least? In Hilo, compete to find the most and least popular answers to a wide variety of questions. The rankings may surprise you! It turns out a lot of people named their cat Frank. That's a freebie.</li>
<li>Speed: In the fast-paced Speed, think on your toes to uncover as many answers on the list as possible, as quickly as possible. It’s everyone for themselves in a race against the clock! Each round the points increase, and the stakes get a little higher! Can you handle it?</li>
<li>Squares: Two teams compete to claim three squares in a row on the grid. Guess popular choices for the first squares, semi-popular choices for the middle squares, and least popular choices for the final squares. We guarantee, you've never had a more heated argument over attractive fictional characters than you will playing Squares.</li>
<li>Bounce: In Bounce, two teams control a paddle that sits on a scale between most popular-to-least popular answers. Work with your team to guess an answer that puts your paddle in the right place to intercept a bouncing ball and stop your opponents from scoring a goal! But be careful! The ball gets faster with each answer!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Personalized experience: Customize your game with content filters, streamer settings, or accessibility options.</li>
<li>Endless replayability: Every guess everyone submits is sent to a database and inputted back into the game as an answer, so each time you play will be an updated experience.</li>
<li>A game for everyone: Multiple family-friendly modes mean that there’s something to enjoy for every type of party game player.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Which Way Up: Galaxy Games is a gravity-bending party platformer inspired by Mario Galaxy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gravity-bending party platformer Which Way Up: Galaxy Games from Turtle Flip Studio plans to release in early 2025 with a demo available and it's crowdfunding on Kickstarter to help it expand. Inspired by Mario Galaxy, you compete in various acrobatic gravity events in this low-gravity platformer.</p>
<p>More about it: "Perform graceful gravity gymnastics, sprint away from the relentless pull of a black hole and launch your competitors into space as you battle through round after round in this gravity-defying party game! Keep playing to unlock new events! Cherry-pick your favourites for a winning edge.</p>
<p>Which Way Up gives you a unique freedom of movement not frequently felt in platformers. Experience running on walls and ceilings, orbiting around planets, or falling across an entire level by manoeuvring through gravity fields. The varying designs of the levels &amp; game modes can make you feel like you are enclosed in a small room or that you might float away into the emptiness of space. Each game mode has different objectives, creating many opportunities for chaos, sabotage and mischief."</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/turtle-flip/which-way-up-galaxy-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a>, the campaign looks to fund support in its leadup to launch, as well as being able to fund additional platforms, more content, and more stretch goals to be revealed.</p>
<p>It will have full Native Linux support, with a demo available to try. They also plan to ensure it's optimized for Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi launch their own SSDs and SSD Kits, along with SD Cards</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Raspberry Pi have recently expanded their hardware offerings with their own SSDs and SSD Kits, plus they're also selling their own SD Cards now too. Giving you some more chances to turn your Raspberry Pi 5 into a full-blown desktop at a low cost with good performance.</p>
<p>Earlier this month they <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/sd-cards-and-bumper/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> branded SD Cards and the silicone Raspberry Pi Bumper you can just snap onto the board to protect it. The SD Cards were made in partnership with Longsys, so you at least know they're going to be legit and work properly. These are available across 32GB, 64GB and 128GB.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12307269521729762475gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>And just this week they've also now <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-ssds-and-ssd-kits/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">launched</a> Raspberry Pi SSDs and SSD Kits. Available across 256GB and 512GB these use the M.2 2230 form factor. You can buy the SSDs separately, or you can buy them as a kit with the also newly launched Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT+ to actually plug them in. Making it super simple to get started.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets a big change for video playback in games on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new update to Proton Experimental with a big change for how they handle video playback, and hopefully give a nice compatibility boost for Windows games on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The update released today, October 23rd, has a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> that notes fixed or improved video playback for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gal*Gun 2</li>
<li>SOULCALIBUR VI</li>
<li>Call of Cthulhu</li>
<li>All-Star Fruit Racing</li>
<li>Greedfall</li>
<li>Onimusha: Warlords</li>
<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</li>
<li>Indigo Park: Chapter 1</li>
<li>Agony Unrated</li>
<li>TELEFORUM</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/857883721729708099gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Call of Cthulhu</em></p>
<p>In the linked GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8186" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> developer Arek Hiler mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Living true to its name <em>Proton Experimental</em> will serve as a vehicle to <strong>roll out and test a new implementation of media source</strong>. While it improves video playback in many games and enables us to fix even more things in the future, the change is substantial and may cause regressions.</p>
<p>We've done extensive internal testing and made the changes available via the bleeding-edge beta branch already. Now it's time to push this experiment even further - into the default Proton Experimental.</p>
<p><strong>In case of regressions in video playback please report them here.</strong><br/>
There's a beta branch named <code class="inline-code">old-media-source</code> (select Proton Experimental in your Steam Library -&gt; cog icon -&gt; Properties -&gt; Betas -&gt; and select the branch from the beta participation drop-down).</p>
<p>If you face any issues please make sure that they are not present with <code class="inline-code">old-media-source</code> before reporting them here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">While the above list notes improved games, there's also some games with known issues right now with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resident Evil 7 videos fail to play.</li>
<li>Resident Evil Village videos fail to play.</li>
<li>Quantum Break videos have green flashes and intermittent crashes.</li>
<li>Shin Megami Tensei III has intermittent video playback failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's changes like this that's why I always advise you to stick to the main versions of Proton, the latest being Proton 9, unless you specifically need Proton Experimental - as it can come with breakage.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA detail new GPU driver vulnerabilities in their October 2024 Security Bulletin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released a security bulletin to detail new security issues, so it's time to update your GPU driver once again.</p>
<p>There's six vulnerabilities being disclosed today, although the date stated is October 22nd, they only emailed it today. Only <em>one</em> of the issues noted actually affects the Linux display driver (and Windows), the rest are <em>just</em> for Windows. Here's the note on the one for Linux:</p>
<p>CVE‑2024‑0126 - "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability which could allow a privileged attacker to escalate permissions. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering."</p>
<p>If you're on driver versions 565.57.01, 550.127.05, 535.216.01 or later you're secure. Otherwise, you should probably go and update. So that explains the tiny one-liner update I covered for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nvidia-565-57-01-beta-has-wayland-and-hdr-improvements-plus-dxvk-and-vkd3d-optimizations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.127.05 release yesterday along with the 565.57.01 Beta</a> that was also released at the same time.</p>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5586" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security bulletin</a>.</p>

      <title>The Rogue Prince of Persia now Steam Deck Verified with a big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming in a day late for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-verified-round-up-your-late-october-2024-highlights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my recent Steam Deck Verified round-up</a>, The Rogue Prince of Persia from developer Evil Empire and publisher Ubisoft is now Steam Deck Verified with a big update out.</p>
<p>More about it: "Experience a fast-paced, challenging but accessible roguelite as you master acrobatic moves and flow seamlessly between platforming and combat. Find new weapons, equip trinkets with special effects and upgrade them to make your own builds. Discover new characters, information and areas as you try to find a way to save Persia from a Hun invasion and become the hero you have always wanted to be."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What to expect from the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 new Medallions with an all-new system.</li>
<li>The Book of Heads: more secondary objectives.</li>
<li>The Rescue levels: more platforming challenges.</li>
<li>Tons of tweaks, fixes &amp; polishing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Speaking in a post on Twitter (X), the developer <a href="https://x.com/Studio_Evil/status/1849107939576971713" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since the last update, The Rogue Prince of Persia is Steam Deck verified!</p>
<p>A few notes though :<br/>
1. We will continue improving performance throughout Early Access.<br/>
2. The hub and later biomes may experience occasional drops in frame rate.<br/>
3. We still recommend setting the FPS to 30max in the options."</p>

<p>This comes at the same time as news that Ubisoft has disbanded the team behind Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0j8p8l26pgo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BBC</a>). However, there were no layoffs this time around, instead developers have been moved to other projects.</p>

      <title>Get your own UFO in the latest No Man&#39;s Sky update during a really weird Expedition</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games have updated No Man's Sky again, bringing with it a reality-bending new Expedition with The Cursed.</p>
<p>Unlike some previous updates, this doesn't include some major new features elsewhere, as it seems firmly focused on this new Expedition that runs for the next two weeks. There are of course plenty of bug fixes across the whole game though.</p>
<p>So what's The Cursed all about then? Taking place in a "sort of twilight realm, straddling the boundary between one reality and the next", here the very boundaries of reality are crumbling and things will start getting pretty weird. During it you can get a few new items like an exclusive jetpack customization and the Boundary Herald Starship which looks very much like a classic UFO blended with a Millennium Falcon,</p>

      <title>EA Anti-Cheat arrives for Battlefield 1 breaking it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here. EA Anti-Cheat has now been rolled out into Battlefield 1, breaking another multiplayer game on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>We've known it was coming for a little while <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/battlefield-1-gets-ea-anticheat-in-september-will-be-left-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as I reported back in August</a>, EA were planning this roll-out originally for September, but it seems it was later delayed until a day ago where it's only just now become live. Battlefield 1 joins the likes of Battlefield 2042, Battlefield V, EA SPORTS WRC and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 that added EA Anti-Cheat <em>after</em> release and <em>all</em> now broken on Linux platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7736225661729686272gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They aren't the only games completely unplayable for Steam Deck / Linux as this EA Anti-Cheat is also in EA SPORTS FC 25, EA SPORTS Madden NFL 25, F1 24 and EA will continue using it for future multiplayer games so we can expect them all to be unplayable at release. </p>
<p>How long until they roll this out into Apex Legends to replace Easy Anti-Cheat? It must be only a matter of time now.</p>
<p>Anti-Cheat continues to be the biggest issue for gaming on Steam Deck / Linux, like how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V is also now broken</a> due to adding in BattlEye with Rockstar refusing to enable it for Proton.</p>

      <title>Creepy retro horror game Fear the Spotlight is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fear the Spotlight from Cozy Game Pals and Blumhouse Games is a retro-styled horror game that looks like it would fit right in on the original PlayStation. It's just be re-released on Steam with Linux support. <em>Note: key provided by fortyseven.</em></p>
<p>Originally released last year, the developers took it off Steam to expand it a little with new content and fix up various reported issues. The result? A seriously tension-filled love letter to PS1 survival horror, with little nods to Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and a perfect fit for your 2024 Halloween to get in the mood.</p>
<p>Starring a bit of an odd couple, Vivian and Amy, who are very much the opposites in terms of style and personality. One night they decide to break into their high school to find a spirit board to hold a séance, and as you might expect from a horror game — it doesn't exactly go to plan.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cEo__9Fd3w8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0abbe577f8a7f351f1dfca18e1358807.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cEo__9Fd3w8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's quite interesting is that you get to play through two different stories here. The first one that serves up as an intro into all the game mechanics, the setting and the atmosphere and then a few hours in once you finish the main story it will flip (in a way I won't spoil) so that you get a taste of things from another perspective.</p>
<p>It's not a particularly scary game (although definitely creepy) that relies on the atmosphere and not jump scares or combat. Fear the Spotlight is all about hide and seek from enemies, and all the disturbing sounds to make your heart race a little. There's plenty of puzzles to do as well, which will change how you interact with the game from the third-person exploration into more of a point and click interface that nicely splits up the exploration (and gives you a chance to breathe a little easier). The puzzles aren't particularly challenging either, so overall it's one that would be quite a nice entry into the genre and for perhaps a slightly younger adult / late teen audience to appreciate.</p>
<p>As long as you can stand the retro visuals, you're in for a bit of a treat. Visually, I think the retro look works a lot better with these types of horror games than it does other genres, it just seems more fitting somehow and Fear the Spotlight really does look and feel the part. Not an overly long game either that you can likely finish between 5-6 hours, so it won't take you forever to get through either (which works in its favour).</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support. Although, the Native Linux version has an issue where the audio will go to the wrong output (a bug that happens on Steam Deck too). So you have to manually switch it over in your system settings. Another bug I encountered was the Linux version repeatedly locking itself to 20FPS. Neither bugs are present when playing the Windows version with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux (UMU) v1.1.3 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to improve compatibility with Windows games on Linux outside of Steam, the Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux (UMU) has another release out now.</p>
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/unified-linux-wine-game-launcher-umu-gets-a-first-official-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first official release in early October</a>, this release focuses on various bug fixes and ensuring it works well for Lutris and the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>A refresher on what it is: forming part of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Open Wine Components</a>, it's <em>not</em> a launcher in the sense of it being an app like Steam, Heroic Games, Lutris, Bottles, Legendary and so on. Instead, it's a tool that various apps can use to run Windows games on Linux, acting as a copy of the Steam Runtime Tools and Steam Linux Runtime that Valve uses for Proton to allow Proton to properly run <em>outside</em> of Steam. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/zoom-platform-store-announces-new-tool-to-run-windows-games-on-linux-with-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Zoom Platform store have begun using it</a> too.</p>
<p>From the v1.1.3 <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/releases/tag/1.1.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that prevented heroic and lutris from using UMU as a game installer instead of wine</li>
<li>Fixed issue where sometimes DISPLAY envvar would get lost between handoff from umu to pressure vessel</li>
<li>Refactor/cleanup of window management code under gamescope -- both lutris and heroic can fully install and run games inside gamescope while both inside or outside of flatpak now.</li>
<li>Winetricks is now fully useable through UMU and GE-Proton/UMU-Proton</li>
<li>Updated apparmor bwrap permission profile to recommendations from upstream apparmor folks</li>
<li>Added a basic shim script to allow performing modifications inside the pressure vessel container after UMU handoff has happened.</li>
<li>Cleaned up standalone flatpak script to prepare for submission upstream</li>
<li>Fixed a few places that needed lock files in place to prevent prefix corruption if multiple instances are running</li>
<li>Missing 32 bit dependencies added for Nix packaging</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're still working out github task attachments for releases being automated. For now we're manually attaching from the latest 1.1.3 builds in the actions section. Thanks for baring with us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A refactor was submitted to Lutris to allow full UMU functionality on the lutris side:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/commit/3a45272a35dd61f32bd164660d670f9737c4146a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lutris/lutris@<tt>3a45272</tt></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lutris and Heroic also should be receiving the permissions they need in flatpak soon if not already:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint/commit/7aa23001f49beb946a58ecfd445e66d7e0349637" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint@<tt>7aa2300</tt></a></p>
</li>

      <title>Escape Simulator gets a free Talos Principle DLC out now, plus a paid DLC in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape Simulator from Pine Studio continues doing some really cool additions, with The Talos Principle getting a little free crossover DLC out now. As long as you have the base game, you can grab this DLC for nothing (permanently).</p>
<p>It's a one room pack, although they said it's bigger than the standard ones and take you around 45 minutes to finish it. It also looks really great and fitting with the style of Talos. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oRum0CDytOQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/84b189f2c38efc3d8a10a8b2b85fd73f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oRum0CDytOQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said: "As huge fans of the series here at Pine Studio, we’ve worked hard to capture the essence of its deep philosophical themes, mind-bending puzzles, and breathtaking environments. In this DLC, players will face a series of intricate puzzles and challenges inspired by The Talos Principle universe. Whether you are a veteran of Escape Simulator or a fan of The Talos Principle, we believe this room will offer a unique, engaging experience that bridges the gap between these two beloved puzzle game worlds."</p>
<p>Additionally an Escape Simulator: Mayan DLC will release on December 5th with four new rooms, new outfits, a new soundtrack a more:</p>

      <title>Science fantasy roguelike epic Caves of Qud releases December 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Freehold Games and Kitfox Games have announced the thoroughly strange and unique science fantasy roguelike epic Caves of Qud is leaving Early Access on December 5. A day I've long been waiting for to really fully dive into the world, especially so with the refreshed tutorial and the finished up story.</p>
<p>A fresh Beta release is available right now that has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Repolished the tutorial with new graphics, some new dialog, and several bugfixes.</li>
<li>Added a tutorial sequence to teach resting until healed.</li>
<li>We did a big refactor of the options menu, cleaning up option categories and text, gating advanced options behind a checkbox, and deleting some deprecated options.</li>
<li>We did a refactor of the control bindings menu, cleaning up binding categories and text and deleting some deprecated bids.</li>
<li>Stunning Force now deals damage in up to 3 increments based on proximity to the center of the blast, as it's supposed to.</li>
<li>Fixed several small bugs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>1.0 release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="87TKcq4tcJ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52258000d8bb63ab7374b84c18b68a7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/87TKcq4tcJ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The price will be going up in a week too, so grabbing it right now would be a good idea. At the release they'll also be putting out a "Dromad Deluxe edition" that will include the game, an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack, with in-game companions for your character. The DLC includes pets that were originally exclusive to their Patreon supporters plus some new ones too.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 565.57.01 Beta has Wayland and HDR improvements, plus DXVK and VKD3D optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today released two new Linux drivers. The big one is the NVIDIA 565.57.01 Beta, along with a one-liner update in the stable 550.127.05 release.</p>
<p>The stable release driver <strong><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/233004/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">550.127.05</a></strong> mentions "Fixed a bug which could cause applications using GBM to crash when running with nvidia-drm.modeset=0".</p>
<p>While the bigger NVIDIA <strong><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/233008/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">565.57.01</a></strong> Beta includes various new features and fixes I've split below for easy reading.</p>
<p>New Features &amp; Improvements</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Re-enabled GLX_EXT_buffer_age on Xwayland. This extension had been previously disabled on Xwayland due to a bug which is now fixed.</li>
<li>Added support for mmap of exported DMA-BUF objects.</li>
<li>Added several new per-plane and per-CRTC vendor-specific properties to nvidia-drm. These properties may be used by Wayland compositors to program the GPU's color pipeline for HDR hardware acceleration.</li>
<li>Introduced a driver optimization to mitigate the performance loss from the 'd3d9.floatEmulation' option in DXVK.</li>
<li>Updated the framelock settings page of the nvidia-settings control panel to use the GTK3 theme text color rather than defaulting to white for the text color, improving legibility with some themes.</li>
<li>Implemented support for VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control.</li>
<li>Reduced some cases of stutter with OpenGL syncing to vblank while using GSP firmware.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug Fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause suspend/resume to fail when using the NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations option: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the cursor image to be truncated on Gamescope: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused FarCry 5 running through DXVK to display a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed some performance regressions that were observed with Vkd3d 2.9.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause flickering in some applications when using Unified Back Buffer (UBB).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause incorrect and/or washed out colors to be displayed with HDR scanout: <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780</a></li>
<li>Implemented support for VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause applications using GBM to crash when running with nvidia-drm.modeset=0.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause kernel crashes upon attempting KMS operations through DRM when nvidia_drm was loaded with modeset=0.</li>

<p>BORE BLASTERS developer 8BitSkull have announced their next game, Skull Horde, which will be released in 2025 with Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>In Skull Horde you play as a flying skull necromancer as you raise an ever-growing skeletal army and battle through procedurally generated dungeons, collecting casket-loads of boons and loot and unlocking powerful perks to upgrade the your little horde and achieve each soldier's fullest necrotic potential. </p>

      <title>AutoForge is Terraria mixed with Factorio, devs plan Steam Deck and controller support soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending the mining and side-scrolling from Terraria, with the building and automation from Factorio — AutoForge looks interesting. Maybe this will scratch an itch you didn't know you had.</p>
<p>More about it: "A 2D automation sandbox adventure. Build an automated factory with Mana-powered machines, progress through an expansive tech tree, explore a vast and wonderful world, upgrade yourself with ancient technologies, and defend it all from invasions."</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access since March, the developer released a new trailer and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1960480/view/4552668120494283642" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of what's to come next. For players who like to kick-back and relax there's good news as right up next on their list is Steam Deck support, controller support and UI improvements. After that they're planning a whole lot more extra content and eventually mod support too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5c8jg3Qt7hM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/61bf9433f6c07840ccf6c1dbac2cd3b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5c8jg3Qt7hM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently it has a Steam Deck Playable rating, so hopefully it can get bumped up to Verified. It has a Silver rating on ProtonDB but a lot of the reports are old.</p>

      <title>Get over 60 games free with Prime Gaming right now - many work on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another round up of some free games you can get to play on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux thanks to Prime Gaming. You just need to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then you can head over to Prime Gaming to redeem them all.</p>
<p>Trying a slightly different format to last time sorting them into a nice table for you. Hopefully you find this useful. I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play.</p>
<p>Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Portal 2 project lead wants Valve to return to single-player games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During PAX Aus 2024 not only did we get the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-officially-comes-to-australia-in-november/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck for Australia</a> announcement, but the project leader on Valve's own Portal 2 did an interview with KIWI TALKZ.</p>
<p>The interview goes over many things about what it was like at Valve, scepticism around the original release of Steam itself, there's a Q&amp;A section and so on. One bit that sticks out is how even the lead on Portal 2 really hopes that Valve return to more single-player games.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from what Josh Weier said in reply to a question that brings up how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/risk-of-rain-creators-hopoo-games-join-valve/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Risk of Rain creators Hopoo Games joining Valve</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been out of Valve for 7 years now. So I don't really have a lot of insight into what they're doing. When I left the company had certainly shifted away from thinking about single player and they were very interested in VR and they were very interested in the counter-strikes and DOTA and kind of more games of service. That never resonated with me, I'm a single player person, I don't care for games as a service, I don't want to do that so that was a big reason I was like eh I'll go do something else. I'd love to see them get back to those roots because obviously that's the thing I think they did incredibly well. And I want to play that as a customer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Full interview video is below, the particular section above is about 53:00 in:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="t9K83HkJb3k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2e374fb124f5ae788418459d83ca104.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/t9K83HkJb3k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Always good to hear more behind the scenes from people who used to work for Valve. You don't get this kind of insight too often, with Valve continuing to be a pretty tight-lipped company.</p>
<p>What single player game would you have as your number 1 for Valve to bring out next?</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania DLC arrives for Halloween</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania is the latest expansion to the smash hit survivor game that started it all, and it's coming on Halloween. This is their third collab and it's a huge one too.</p>
<p>The developer said "Vampire Survivors would have been a very different game hadn't it been influenced by Castlevania in the first place, so this is straight up the definition of a dream coming true". You can expect to see over 20 characters, over 40 weapons, 1 new huge stage, over 30 music covers and much more.</p>
<p>With the new stage they said it's the biggest one yet, with multiple biomes to battle through, with special icons on the map to help you get through it. There's also going to be a free 1.2 update patch that will include zooming on the map, performance improvements, a UI revamp for picking music and more.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Developer poncle also confirmed more free updates are coming.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors is rated Steam Deck Verified. It has a Native Linux version too although not advertised. The DLC will be $3.99 / €3.99 / £2.99 at release.</p>

      <title>Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak from Remedy aims for Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is excellent news. I'm a big fan of Control and the world of Remedy Entertainment games and their new multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak should get Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>So what is it? "FBC: Firebreak is a cooperative first-person shooter set within a mysterious federal agency under assault by otherworldly forces. As a years-long siege on the agency’s headquarters reaches its boiling point, only Firebreak— the Bureau’s most versatile unit—has the gear and the guts to plunge into the building’s strangest crises, restore order, and blast their way back from the brink."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tBO__RWUbKM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad752c97232dfe49479e60b152b2c76b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tBO__RWUbKM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will be released on Steam in 2025 and in their official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2272540/discussions/0/4695657408664075439/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> post they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you know Remedy’s games, they tend to look amazing but have high PC requirements. With this game, while the graphics will be great, we want to ensure that more people can play, so we are going to aim for a wider range of PC hardware, <strong>including Steam Deck</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours.</em></p>
<p>Anti-cheat is still a constant source of problems for Linux / Steam Deck gaming, so hopefully being a co-op shooter they might not even need any. Although some other co-op games do have it, it all depends what their plans are, but at least the Steam Deck is already firmly in their minds to support.</p>
<p>Nice to see that Steam won't be seeing a delayed release here either, no Epic exclusive deals like with Alan Wake 2, which Epic Games were the actual publisher of.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cleared Hot looks like the nostalgic helicopter shooter I need</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With fond memories of playing the likes of Desert Strike for endless hours, Cleared Hot looks exactly what I've been wanting in a modern take on it. Developed by Cfinger Games and now MicroProse Software are jumping in as publisher it's sounding really promising.</p>
<p>In Cleared Hot, players step into the cockpit of a fully upgradeable attack helicopter. You get the classic arcade shooter action blended nicely with modern physics-based mechanics. Players will shoot, dodge, and use creative tactics to move squads across dynamic battlefields while using an innovative rope and magnet system to interact with the environment. From picking up vehicles and redirecting heat-seeking missiles to throwing rocks at enemies, the game offers a truly unique and emergent take on how players can achieve battlefield control.</p>

      <title>In snake-like PAKO Caravan you build up a huge conga line of trailers with a wobbly car</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is quite a funny one. Taking the basic idea of snake where you're constantly growing, but you control a wobbly car that can jump.</p>
<p>Due to the controls and the level layouts, it's actually a lot of fun and surprisingly challenging once you get a really long line going. The added little challenges are nice, from what little there was in the demo its really promising and I definitely can't wait to see more from this for a bit of casual fun. Worth keeping an eye on for sure.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SoX7F1SmdUU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2581b6e8dcf588174c2633f0e06491be.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SoX7F1SmdUU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Addictive Gameplay: Build the longest caravan, use jumping to make your line even more complex!</li>
<li>Unique Levels: Specific cars, tricks and missions in each level — no two drives are the same!</li>
<li>Colorful Cartoon Style: Enjoy colorful, retro-inspired graphics with a playful vibe and music to match it!</li>
<li>Endless Fun: Compete for high scores and see how long you can keep your caravan intact!</li>
<li>Over 100 missions to complete.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3171910/PAKO_Caravan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It's due for release later this year with Linux support. There's a demo that went up for Steam Next Fest but it's not clear if the demo will stick around. </p>

      <title>Duake puts the Doomguy in Quake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mashing two of the greats together, Duake brings the Doomguy along with their full arsenal into the classic Quake. Created by a modder with a slightly amusing name, Magic Nipples, this isn't just some basic mod that just dumps a Doom model into Quake, it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Doomguy, and his arsenal of weapons (duh).</li>
<li>Added 2 HUD types for the full Doom hud and a Doom 64 like minimal HUD.</li>
<li>Added the rifle to replace the nailgun.</li>
<li>Completely redone episode 1 of Quake with colored lighting, colored water, new props, enemy placement, and the inclusion of some episode 2-4 enemies on hard difficulty.</li>
<li>Added a new wall demon enemy as seen above.</li>
<li>Added a spectre mode for the Fiend.</li>
<li>Reworked some of the enemies to have different attacks or adjusted attacks.</li>
<li>Reworked the Chthon fight to be much more interesting.</li>
<li>Added a few new secrets here and there.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer even made a trailer for it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tVOYmYUWkmE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa785f07b3c66ab2fa1683643773c06d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tVOYmYUWkmE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For it you do need to own a copy of Quake as it uses the PAK files from it. There's also currently only a downloadable Windows build, but I've verified that it seems to run nice with Wine.</p>
<p>Could be your fun distraction for the week.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/duake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mod DB</a> along with the instructions. The source code is also up on <a href="https://github.com/Magic-Nipples/duake" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Free and open source strategy-shooter Unvanquished 0.55 brings big enhancements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unvanquished is having a bit of a big moment, with some fresh coders doing some great work on this strategy-shooter that's similar in basic idea to Natural Selection. <em>This project was originally forked from the classic Tremulous.</em></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://unvanquished.net/unvanquished-0-55-awesomeness-has-arrived/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> announcing the release of Unvanquished 0.55 they've overhauled quite a lot of the visuals which includes fixes to some long-standing bugs, while also doing some <em>huge</em> optimizations.</p>
<p>There's a <em>lot</em> of really technical stuff most users likely won't understand from a new skybox that made the sky rendering go from 1000 triangles on the CPU every frame to just 12, to screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO) optimizations and doing more precompute with shaders rather than doing things every frame. The gist, as the developers say, the "engine and the game are now much more faster than ever".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19032581121729503147gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19032581121729503147gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9644015541729503145gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9644015541729503145gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Unvanquished 0.55 on Linux, click to enlarge the pics.</em></p>
<p>They dropped the requirements to run it down to OpenGL 2.1 and mentioned even a "Raspberry 3B+ can sustain up to 60 FPS on the lowest preset". Quite impressive really.</p>
<p>Not just performance work they've also fixed up and improved many parts of how the game looks like new weapon models, fixed fog, fixed various sprite rendering, dynamic lights are now less blocky, a fix for a 9 year old soft particles bug where some visuals didn't even show and improvements to the user interface.</p>
<p>There's also some new graphical toys included to modernize the look and rendering of the game with OpenGL 4.6 in an experimental stage like reflection mapping, plus a material system that will bump a lot of the rendering from the CPU to the GPU. Also AI improvements, lots of translations work and there's more to come now this release is out.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 comes to Steam in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Excellent news. PlayStation Publishing, Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software are bringing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 over to Steam on January 30, 2025. However, as with seemingly all Sony PC ports now, it will require a PlayStation Network Account despite being a single-player game and so will lock out various regions where the PSN is not supported.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wOJaeD0Si04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/974f5b363179323d38796366ea145b17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wOJaeD0Si04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Bringing Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales to a new audience on PC together with Insomniac and Marvel Games has been a great experience for us at Nixxes,” says Julian Huijbregts, Community Manager at Nixxes. “We are excited to continue this collaboration and bring Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to PC with a suite of enhanced features, including enhanced ray-tracing options, to take full advantage of a variety of setups and configurations. Stay tuned for more details on features and recommended specs closer to launch.”</p>
<p>It will come in two editions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Edition:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The complete game</li>
<li>All the latest updates since Marvel Spider-Man 2’s PS5 launch, including:</li>
<li>14 new suits</li>
<li>New Game+</li>
<li>Ultimate Levels</li>
<li>New Symbiote Suit Styles</li>
<li>Time of Day options</li>
<li>Post-Game Achievements</li>
<li>Action Figure Mode in Photo Mode</li>
<li>Screen Reader and Audio Descriptions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Deluxe Edition:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The complete game with updates listed above</li>
<li>5 exclusive suits for Peter Parker</li>
<li>5 exclusive suits for Miles Morales</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Arachknight Suit (Peter)</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Shadow-Spider Suit (Miles)</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Web Grabber gadget</li>
<li>+5 skill points </li>
<li>Additional Photo Mode items</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They haven't yet revealed all the usual PC extras, which will no doubt come in a future blog post when they continue their marketing towards release like they've done for previous PC ports.</p>
<p>Okay, now I really need to actually play through Miles Morales…but I think a replay of the first one is also due.</p>
<p>How do we think this one will run on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite adds support for OneXPlayer plus improvements for ROG Ally</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite is a SteamOS alternative that just keeps getting better. So while Valve have yet to release the Steam Deck version of SteamOS for others, Bazzite could be one of your best choices for Linux on handhelds.</p>
<p>The latest release has been <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-update-onexplayer-support-ally-goodies/4517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> under a new versioning scheme. They're no longer doing versions like Bazzite "3.8" (which this would technically be) instead matching the upstream Fedora versioning so they say this is "Stable (F40.20241013)" and the last before they swap over to the newer Fedora 41 for the base of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, what's new?</strong></p>
<p>Say hello to Bazzite on OneXPlayer devices like the X1 (AMD), X1 Mini, OneXFly variants and Mini Pro. They say it includes "full RGB support, back buttons, turbo button and a lot more custom features for them such as choosing what the turbo button and keyboard button do". Although there's still "a long way to go" with features missing like "fan curves, battery capacity limits, and vibration intensity + some other minor issues".</p>
<p>The fun part? OneXPlayer will be helping out as they said "we are proud to state that OneXPlayer will be helping us on that journey".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6159632261729273405gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - OneXPlayer X1 with the new Steam Controller emulation</em></p>
<p>They've also hooked up support for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hori-announced-a-special-gamepad-for-steam-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new HORI Steam Controller</a> too. Still haven't seen word on a release for it outside of Japan though, annoyingly!</p>
<p>Owners of the ROG Ally and Ally X will also be happy with this update as they've improved their "Modern Standby patch series" to <em>eventually</em> make it possible to allow background game downloads. As for what's updated for right now: it includes fixes for controller issues and sleeping, and hopefully it also fixed a bug where the Ally gets stuck at 6W after sleeping. Other improvements for the Ally series include "the frame limit slider to include all framerates from 12hz to 120hz AND to work while VRR is on or off" which is the code done in Gamescope <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/gamescope-gets-improved-rog-ally-support-hinting-at-more-progress-for-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I previously reported on</a> - so it was actually for Bazzite. On top of that they said there's a fix for "the VRR toggle to work alongside the framerate limiter".</p>
<p>Sounds like Bazzite development is going really well.</p>
<p>Be sure to see more on the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> to try it.</p>

      <title>Drova - Forsaken Kin is an impressive pixel-art action-RPG for you to check out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Drova - Forsaken Kin from developer Just2D and publisher Deck13 was released recently, and if you love action RPGs it's one you need to check out. <em>Note: key provided by Deck13.</em></p>
<p>A grim dark fantasy pixel-art action-RPG that has gameplay inspired by Gothic and Morrowind where it won't hold your hand, with visuals inspired by Baldur's Gate 2 (so the publisher tells me). Very much its own beast though, one you're going to need to slow down and spend a bit of time with to take it all in, so it's great that it has such a good atmosphere that you won't want to put it down. That intro section especially really suckered me right in, I just wanted to know more and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ov9kmm4TM94"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94774606b1e336051d35187885d47263.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ov9kmm4TM94" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the combat, I have no doubt there will be a few soulslike comparisons to it. I would understand <em>why</em> if others said so, as the combat can be a little bit on the punishing side. There's a lot of game mechanics going on to understand too.</p>
<p>You have single and double-handed weapons (both melee and ranged), off-hand weapons, spells you get from scrolls, you have to dodge enemy attacks and watch for their tells to not get stomped, combo moves if you time things right and more. Weapons have to be drawn out to attack as well, or put away to actually inspect or interact with the world. <em>I've been genuinely surprised by how good Drova is.</em></p>
<p>Enemies don't scale to your level either, so if you get lost (and you probably will) you're going to need to be careful. Walk off too far before you're ready, and something will probably make a meal out of you.</p>
<p>I like the exploration side of it too, where you go into a special inspect mode to be able to see a bit more, although you cannot attack while you're doing so. But, it enables you to often find certain items and enemies hidden away by trees, bushes and more. Speaking of exploration and its inspiration, prepare to get lost. The map system is deliberatly rubbish, with the map just being pretty basic and you need to manually place markers with ink purchased from vendors. So you need to stock up and pay attention while exploring, and remember to mark your map.</p>
<p>Since it's an RPG, it does have a level system too, however, you need to find certain NPCs to sort through your skills and abilities.</p>
<p>There's a few silly English grammar errors here and there in the writing but it doesn't really distract from the experience, not as much as some of the "hmms" and grunts from random NPCs while you're around them – that's quite annoying to hear repeated in the background.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>30 - 40 hours of playtime.</li>
<li>An interface which doesn’t tell you what to do.</li>
<li>Flow based combat system with multiple weapon classes and magic.</li>
<li>Tailored story based on your actions and dialogues.</li>
<li>Join one of two factions to survive in this world.</li>
<li>Unique pixel art style.</li>
<li>Seamless open world with no loading times attached.</li>
<li>Multiple possible endings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is playable on the Steam Deck although no rating from Valve yet. On Steam Deck it felt pretty good, and performed well in the sections I played. One problem was naming my character, with the keyboard needing to be manually pulled up and it didn't take the input correctly so hopefully they solve that.</p>
<p>Overall, a fantastic entry into the action-RPG genre worth exploring. Having a lot of fun with it and I think you will too.</p>

      <title>Russian roulette with a shotgun, Buckshot Roulette will add multiplayer on October 31</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Buckshot Roulette is a clever game putting a spin on the lethal game of Russian roulette but with a shotgun and items to help you along the way. At the end of October you'll be able to betray your friends too.</p>
<p>I was absolutely hooked on this when it came to Steam, and now perhaps I will be again. The short rounds mixed with the tense atmosphere — it's great. The multiplayer update lands on October 31st with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New items for strategic mutual annihilation. No pills included.</li>
<li>Round customization from more health points to item load outs for your convenience.</li>
<li>Brand new music from Mike Klubnika.</li>
<li>A bunch of new faces kindly provided to us by Volta Standard Electronics.</li>
<li>And the special sting of betrayal from your friends and loved ones.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unknown Worlds and KRAFTON, Inc. have officially revealed Subnautica 2, the full sequel to the incredibly popular open-world ocean survival game. Their plan is to launch it in Early Access sometime in 2025 and it's confirmed for Steam.</p>
<p>An exciting addition for this one will be the four player co-op so you can explore and build a base together! Unlike Subnautica: Below Zero, Subnautica 2 is set on a whole new world as it's an all-new adventure. What to expect from it? All new biomes, new creatures, new everything and lots more of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Expanding on what fans loved about the previous games in the series, Subnautica 2 will deepen the experience with new biomes, from towering underwater cliffs to lush coral fields, each filled with unique creatures and hidden mysteries. As players dive deeper, they will uncover the secrets at the heart of planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the initial teaser trailer:</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment hits 1 million sales - more free updates planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Halls of Torment has been a great hit for developers Chasing Carrots, with it hitting 1 million sales on Steam. So great to see another game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> doing so well, especially nice that it is Steam Deck Verified and has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p><em>What is it? Imagine Vampire Survivors and the original Diablo had a baby. It's a little like that.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2218750/view/4512135723845697648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they said "It’s a great achievement for us so close after the release, and we’ve decided our journey won’t end here. We want to move further after leaving Early Access. We are currently working on some additional free content, fixing more bugs, and improving the game’s performance.".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JdQweTEsOUE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12e755eacdb544b3aa69cb5d13f9b108.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JdQweTEsOUE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they have a little <a href="https://open.codecks.io/hot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of some things they're working on. Plus they want to make a Supporter DLC that will include "character and UI skins, the soundtrack, and maybe an additional surprise" which they will use as a sort of test for DLC integration and if things go well they will use it to properly extend the game (along with free updates).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Red Rogue Sea looks like a deck-building pirating version of FTL: Faster Than Light</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I adored FTL: Faster Than Light and Red Rogue Sea looks like a sweet evolution of the gameplay with pirates and deck-building. Announced yesterday by Firemage Studios this is one to stick on your watch list for sure, I can easily see myself spending hours and hours in this one.</p>
<p>"Red Rogue Sea is a roguelike strategy game that puts you in the shoes of a pirate captain and their crew. You will manage your vessel as you sail through the treacherous waters of the archipelago, interacting with the scum that inhabits it. Make decisions that impact the outcome of various events and the overall narrative."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L4Ib1sWZqQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1682230db33b979365b5505ebaf07605.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L4Ib1sWZqQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlock your fleet: Gain access to new ships and factions enabling the use of diverse strategies to outwit the fleet of the fearsome Admiral White.</li>
<li>Manage Your Own Vessel: To survive events and battles, you’ll need to command your crew with a firm hand and ensure that all ship systems and resources are used in the most optimal way. Prove that you’re a natural-born strategist!</li>
<li>Build Your Tactical Deck: In the heat of battle, you’ll command your crew to execute various actions through a deck of tactic cards that you can build and upgrade, gradually adapting it to your playstyle.</li>
<li>Immersive Narrative: Red Rogue Sea features a complex archipelago of islands inhabited by adventurers, wrongdoers, fortune seekers, and of course, ordinary folk. You’ll sail from island to island, interacting with different events and learning more about the place, its people, and the tales of legendary treasures sought by generations of pirates. Your actions will shape the course of your own story, leading you down different—and dangerous—paths.</li>
<li>Pirate’s Nest: In each game, you’ll create a unique captain and choose a ship to command. These seas are dangerous, and it’s likely your greed will eventually lead you to a watery grave... but that won’t stop you from trying again with another pirate captain!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3200220/Red_Rogue_Sea/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> - it releases sometime in Spring 2025. Going by the Steam page it will have Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage arrives on Steam as Ubisoft return to Valve&#39;s store</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Things are not going exactly well for Ubisoft right now, and so they continue returning to Steam with Assassin's Creed Mirage released today. This follows on from its release a year ago where it was only available via the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>If you missed the news recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-and-star-wars-outlaws-head-to-steam-as-ubisoft-return-to-same-day-releases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft are moving back to same-day releases</a> on Steam! We have Star Wars Outlaws to come in November, and Assassin's Creed Shadows later since it was delayed.</p>
<p>As usual though it does use Denuvo with a machine activation limit, so if you're playing on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck, you'll want to be careful on switching around <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> versions for it otherwise you'll get locked out for 24 hours. On top of that it also uses the Ubisoft Connect Launcher, which at times had some issues in Proton but it should work mostly fine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IRNOoOYVn80"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/147bd1bbb109d0c60bb21b8a3e63e29c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IRNOoOYVn80" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for Steam Deck compatibility? No official Valve rating yet but Ubisoft stated in a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3035570/view/4509883924033497574" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> it will get a "Playable" rating soon with an update planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is playable on Steam Deck. While it is currently displayed in the “Unknown category”, the “Playable” Steam Deck label will be coming in the next few weeks through a new update.<br/>
This next update will allow to launch the game on Steam Deck with low settings by default to best optimize the experience.<br/>
Note that applying higher settings may impact the experience and lead to instability when playing on Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035570/Assassins_Creed_Mirage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">50% off on Steam</a> until October 24th.</p>

      <title>Valve makes a big improvement for Native Linux games in a Steam Beta update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new update to the Steam Client Beta for Steam Deck and Desktop, with some Steam Input changes and some improvements for Linux too. It's the same across Desktop / Deck since it's a Steam Client update.</p>
<p>The changes for Steam Input include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Always show the controller tab in app properties for non-Steam shortcuts.</li>
<li>Added Invert X and Invert Y to Mouse Regions.</li>
<li>Scroll Wheel mode can now be chosen from the dropdown in SIAPI games (Inside of Edit Loadout, not Quick Settings).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More interesting for us are the Linux-specific changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam developers can now select which Steam for Linux runtime to use for native titles. Please consult the partner site for more details.</li>
<li>Native titles will execute in 'Steam for Linux runtime 1.0 (scout)' by default, instead of the legacy runtime environment.<br/>
	This behavior is consistent with Steam Deck and promotes better compatibility across all Linux desktop distributions.<br/>
	Note that this new feature can be turned off globally with "-compat-force-slr off" on the Steam client command line.</li>

<p>What exactly is the Steam for Linux runtime? From the <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/blob/main/docs/slr-for-game-developers.md" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official guide</a> (linked from <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/platforms/linux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamworks</a>): "A collection of container environments which can be used to run Steam games on Linux in a relatively predictable container environment, instead of running directly on an unknown Linux distribution which might be old, new or unusually set up."</p>
<p>This way developers can ensure their Linux games run the same across different distributions. Now having Desktop Linux match Steam Deck by default, and letting developers pick, just seems like a thoroughly great change to me.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods new cross-platform app adds support for Heroic Games Launcher and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer in-development open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app just expanded, and it's sounding awesome. Much easier modding is coming for Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is <em>not</em> finished (nowhere near done) with the amount of games supported right now being limited, but they do keep gradually expanding it. Like with the version 0.6.2 release that's out now for testing, which has added in support for modding Baldur's Gate 3! That's in addition to Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>For Linux desktop and Steam Deck modders you'll be pleased to know this release also now supports the Heroic Games Launcher. This means games installed via Heroic from GOG can now be modded via this Nexus Mods app, although in this case the REDmod for Cyberpunk 2077 via Heroic was disabled but you can <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/Cyberpunk2077/#automated-deployment-for-redmods" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sort that</a> inside Heroic itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21406310501729174236gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus Mods app on Linux</em></p>
<p>There's also been some UI improvements, and they're starting to show when a mod needs an update in the app too. On top of that there's some bug fixes like using the correct Wine prefix on Linux.</p>
<p>Really exciting to watch this app grow so we can finally have really easy multi-game modding on Linux / Steam Deck through a supported app. For now though, each update does need you to wipe things so it's more about testing and giving feedback to help shape the future but it's certainly getting there.</p>
<p>Just imagine in say a year or so when someone asks about modding on Linux / Steam Deck, and all you have to say is "use the Nexus Mods app" and away they go. Every little wall being smashed to make it easier will get more people to stick.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.6.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all the details and the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App" rel="noopener" target="_blank">main GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Play Golf as household objects in the challenging House Hopper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>House Hopper instantly reminded me of WHAT THE GOLF?, taking the basic idea of Golf and turning it into something totally absurd.</p>
<p>In this one you're inside a house taking on the form of a household object, starting off as a dish scrubber and you have to flip yourself all around the house, across different surfaces and just attempt to keep going. It's basically a 3D physics platformer with the levels being the house itself. It's as funny as it is frustrating and with the demo live on Steam you should definitely give it a go.</p>
<p>The controls are a little funky to get used to, and there will be many mishaps where you've launched yourself just that bit too short or too far, and end up somewhere annoying — which is all part of the fun here. As you go through you also get to unlock more objects to become, each with their own unique shape that will change how you flip and land.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing more from this game and from the developer Random Games Generator.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2209890/House_Hopper/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version. The full game is due to release on November 8th.</p>

      <title>Melt Them All is a bit like a retro action rogue-lite Factorio with tower defense</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stripping down automation sims to the basics, adding in some tower defense and a little rogue-lite action with retro visuals and you have Melt Them All. Combining all the fun elements of each into a tiny package that's good for short bursts, and it's incredibly cheap too. <em>Note: this was a personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that you can make fuel out of aliens, but you first have to destroy them and then mine away at their little bodies to get the ore. You have to drag around a cart to pick up the ore, and then gradually expand a production chain with lots and lots of conveyor belts.</p>
<p>There's a little survivor-like flavour here too with character buffs to unlock as you go as well, or perhaps a new item to be able to build to spend all your credits. A great distraction when you don't want something too in-depth but with fun game mechanics to keep you wanting to play more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TW9-Cfr2E5A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11d388befe37ab2ac08add560e986ef7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TW9-Cfr2E5A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The tutorial isn't particularly great but easy enough, and the mechanics are all pretty simple so it doesn't really take long to understand everything you're doing.</p>
<p>Like a lot of smaller games on Steam, it's been a bit buried with only two user reviews. But it's a nice little mix-up on all the survivor-likes coming out lately.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252500/Melt_Them_All/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Goeland is like Untitled Goose Game but you&#39;re a seagull in a town that&#39;s a bit too peaceful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving off some early Untitled Goose Game vibes, Goeland is a non-linear open-world adventure where you're one of the most annoying birds on the planet - the seagull. <em>You can tell I live near the sea right?</em></p>
<p>Created by indie dev Bryan Martinet, you play as a mischievous seagull in a small sandboxy open world, interacting with characters and environment to solve enigmas, achieve quirky goals or take on self-imposed challenges and of course — poop on everyone.</p>
<p>In an email Martinet mentioned: "Earlier this year, I lost my job in the AAA game industry (Eidos Montréal) due to the waves of layoffs hitting the industry. I took it as an opportunity to create this game on my own. It’s been a challenging yet rewarding experience, handling every aspect of game development."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2sD3nLCHg4E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d74005a54abe8f258f01bbb87ef33fed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2sD3nLCHg4E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems like a fun idea! After playing a bunch of the demo I'm looking forward to seeing what other chaotic things the developer adds in. Being able to fly around and having a lot of freedom to explore will be great. The demo area is of course limited, but this small slice is promising.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as a mischievous seagull wreaking havoc on a quiet island.</li>
<li>Engage in open-ended, sandbox-style gameplay.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and complete objectives using stealth, creativity, manipulation.</li>
<li>Interact with various items and NPCs to cause chaos and amusement.</li>
<li>Shape and transform your surroundings based on your actions.</li>
<li>Help adorable stranded animals find their way to the ocean.</li>
<li>Enjoy charming visuals and a delightful, whimsical and dynamic soundtrack.</li>
<li>Experience dynamic reactions from the environment and characters.</li>
<li>Explore multiple areas within the island, each with its own unique challenges.</li>
<li>Interact with charming characters and assist them in their quests.</li>
<li>Enjoy relaxing gameplay with no time limits or pressure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo has a Native Linux version that works great. Have a look and try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531840/Goeland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> now. The full game release date has not yet been announced.</p>

      <title>Dunebound Tactics really is one to watch for strategy fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dunebound Tactics has been announced by Terahard Studios and if you're anything like me and love your strategy games, this looks like one to watch for sure.</p>
<p>After reading up on it and checking out the trailer I'm getting a sort-of Sunless Sea / Sunless Skies vibe from this with the exploration and interactions, except you're in some sort of sand-crawling ship and there's the addition of turn-based tactical combat with plenty of destruction.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v1YgHbn-ye8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1849f0a2d4712b93b2182b76af0218cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v1YgHbn-ye8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Personally, I'm a huge tactics fanatic. We built our very own tactics engine with RPG elements from the ground up for Dunebound Tactics! I'm excited both for the technical innovations as well as the freedom we gave our game designers to create an amazing experience. The art in this game is the best we've managed so far connecting all the little details to squeeze performance and quality." — Aris Tsevrenis, CEO of Terahard Studios</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Each Run a Stepping Stone -</strong> Your previous mishaps, crushing defeats or triumphs will contribute to your next run, either in the form of modules, or potentially even survivors, as you find the previous caravan’s wreck.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic world generation</strong> <font color="#e0e0e0"><strong>-</strong></font> Whether in combat or roaming through the sands - battlefields, locations or quests will challenge you in new and unexpected ways, making each run unique.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Turn-Based Combat -</strong> Manipulate a fully destructible and reshapable terrain to mold the battlefield and seize the advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Friends -</strong> Rescue &amp; recruit lost souls to bolster your numbers, but remember, your caravan has limited seats. With a roster of 15 distinct classes and 16 unique traits that enhance skills, stats, or add abilities, every run offers a fresh experience.</li>
<li><strong>Fuel</strong> - Decide whether to heal your wounded in the infirmary after battle takes its toll, or extract the Elios from their bodies, leaving them mere husks, to fuel your ambitions or power the caravan’s engine.</li>
<li><strong>Foes</strong> - Between the Imperials and the Arcanists, your party must face 40 enemy classes in a desperate fight for a better tomorrow.</li>
</ul>

      <title>TRON: Catalyst announced from Bithell Games and Big Fan Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/devolver-launch-big-fan-games-a-label-for-indie-devs-to-work-on-licensed-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Devolver Digital announce Big Fan Games</a> to get more games made from major licenses (tv, movies, comics etc) and the first is TRON: Catalyst.</p>
<p>This debut project from Big Fan Games brings in Bithell Games to make it who also worked on Thomas Was Alone, John Wick Hex, Tron: Identity and others. Set in the same world that Bithell Games created for Tron: Identity, it's a standalone game though that you can enjoy without playing Identity.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Disney TRON: Catalyst, players are introduced to Exo, a highly resilient and resourceful program with an incredible ability to initiate time loops. With this newfound power, Exo takes on the overlords of a crumbling Grid all while evading Conn, a malevolent agent of CORE. Exo must gain control over her mysterious abilities and uncover the unexplained ‘Glitch’ that threatens the Grid.</p>
<p>As Exo, players will battle on-foot and on Light Cycle to complete missions and gain crucial insights that will help them on their quest. While learning from her mistakes, Exo ​ will also need to navigate warring factions to unlock new paths and uncover the secrets of the Arq Grid."</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-16 released with mod support for various Bethesda games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're modding Bethesda games on Linux / Steam Deck, GE-Proton 9-16 could make things a little easier for you.</p>
<p>As your reminder: GE-Proton (or Proton-GE) a community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons), and sometimes other special additions, but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>In GE-Proton 9-16 one of the main additions is a change to how Bethesda games will launch like the Fallout series, Skyrim, Oblivion and Starfield. If GE-Proton detects a known mod executable for these it will launch that <em>instead</em> of the original - something that will just save players a fair bit of messing around. Seems like a nice change!</p>
<p>Another addition is that games run with UMU (Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux), for using it outside of Steam like in Heroic Games, is that games will now have the <code class="inline-code">/mnt</code>, <code class="inline-code">/run/media</code> and <code class="inline-code">/media</code> and the user's home folder added as drives that games can see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7527689401729065035gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Skyrim</em></p>
<p>There's also a few other game-specific fixes, and the usual additions of new code from the official upstream projects.</p>
<p>Here's the full <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>import upstream makefile changes</li>
<li>import upstream proton changes</li>
<li>import upstream steam_helper changes</li>
<li>import upstream vkd3d-shader changes</li>
<li>update wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>update vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>update dxvk-nvapi to e4bad70</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed issue with game_titles not being pulled correctly for UMU</li>
<li>game_titles are now looked up as part of included umu-database csv instead of trying to send online website api call</li>
<li>games run with UMU will now have /mnt,/run/media,/media/, and the user's home folder added as drives u:,v:,w:,x: respectively inside the prefix if they are not empty. This is to allow users to install or import games outside of the prefix more conveniently. A typical scenario for this would be if you have your games pre-installed on a different mounted drive, or somewhere else in your home folder outside of the prefix and you want to add them without reinstalling the game, OR if you want to install the game to one of those mounts instead of the C:\ drive inside the wine prefix. With steam, users don't really have to worry about this because steam handles the drive mounts and the install locations, however we found that outside of steam users were trying to use the Z: drive (which is symlinked to root (/)) -- which is of course containerized and read only, and therefore also unable to provide a proper drive size, resulting in users being told they don't have enough space. With the new drives added into the prefix it should fix this, allowing users to access their mount locations or existing game folders for installation or importing via the new drives instead of Z:.</li>
<li>Mod support for various bethesda games has been added (Thanks Root-Core). If a mod executable is found for bethesda games it will launch the mod executable instead of the original:<br/>
	mapping = {<br/>
	'22380': ('FalloutNV.exe', 'nvse_loader.exe'), # Fallout New Vegas<br/>
	'22370': ('FalloutLauncher.exe', 'fose_loader.exe'), # Fallout 3<br/>
	'377160': ('Fallout4Launcher.exe', 'f4se_loader.exe'), # Fallout 4<br/>
	'22330': ('OblivionLauncher.exe', 'obse_loader.exe'), # Oblivion<br/>
	'72850': ('SkyrimLauncher.exe', 'skse_loader.exe'), # Skyrim<br/>
	'489830': ('SkyrimSELauncher.exe', 'skse64_loader.exe'), # Skyrim SE<br/>
	'1716740': ('Starfield.exe', 'sfse_loader.exe') # Starfield<br/>
	}.get(game_id, ('', ''))</li>
<li>protonfix added for metal gear solid 2 (thanks FranjeGueje)</li>
<li>protonfix for Kindom Hearts HD Remix added for steam version (already existed for egs version) (thanks Internetbestfriend)</li>
<li>protonfix added for Gothic Playable Teaser (thanks Root-Core)</li>
<li>Star Citizen protonfix updated (no longer requires EAC workaround)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 1 source code released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Legacy, a rogue-lite from Cellar Door Games, that originally released in 2013 has now had the source code released. The game has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/CellarDoorGames/status/1846246914406195662" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Twitter / X the developer noted they've been working with game porter and FNA developer, Ethan Lee, to make this happen who will be maintaining it going forward.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8915973611729018609gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game is <u>not</u> open source though, to be completely clear on that. It's source available under a <em>custom</em> license with certain restrictions, much the same as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/01/vvvvvv-from-terry-cavanagh-has-the-source-code-opened-up-to-celebrate-the-10-year-anniversary/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VVVVVV</a> and is actually based on the license that Terry Cavanagh used for it. This is also only the source code, it does <em>not</em> include the assets - so you still need to own a copy of the game.</p>
<p>In their own <a href="https://x.com/flibitijibibo/status/1846249473741410725" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Ethan Lee posted on Twitter / X that they intend to take on community contributions to it, and they're in progress on upgrading it to use SDL 3 that's currently in Beta.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3823223841729018862gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Really great to see more developers open up the code for their older games. This way they can practically live on forever. It would have been even better if it was fully open source, but having it open like this is still a great resource for developer curious on what goes on behind the scenes to learn from as well.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/flibitijibibo/RogueLegacy1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GitHub</a> for the source code.</p>
<p>You can buy the game from:</p>

      <title>Intel and AMD join up to form the x86 ecosystem advisory group to shape the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems AMD and Intel may be feeling the pressure from Arm? Today both companies announced the forming of a new x86 ecosystem advisory group to help shape the future of the platform.</p>
<p>It's not just them though they've pulled in Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) and Tim Sweeney (Epic Games), along with companies including: Broadcom, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Red Hat as founding members.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are on the cusp of one of the most significant shifts in the x86 architecture and ecosystem in decades – with new levels of customization, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future customer needs,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “We proudly stand together with AMD and the founding members of this advisory group, as we ignite the future of compute, and we deeply appreciate the support of so many industry leaders.”</p>
<p>“Establishing the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group will ensure that the x86 architecture continues evolving as the compute platform of choice for both developers and customers,” said Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. “We are excited to bring the industry together to provide direction on future architectural enhancements and extend the incredible success of x86 for decades to come.”</p>
<p>Their plan is to come together to find new ways to expand the x86 ecosystem with their intended outcomes to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing customer choice and compatibility across hardware and software, while accelerating their ability to benefit from new, cutting-edge features.</li>
<li>Simplifying architectural guidelines to enhance software consistency and standardize interfaces across x86 product offerings from Intel and AMD.</li>
<li>Enabling greater and more efficient integration of new capabilities into operating systems, frameworks and applications.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Valve still waiting on a &#39;generational leap&#39; for Steam Deck 2 - but it&#39;s coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve gave us the strongest wording yet that a Steam Deck 2 is actually real, although it's still clearly going to be some time away before there's enough of an upgrade.</p>
<p>Recently we had the news that the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-officially-comes-to-australia-in-november/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck is finally going to release in Australia</a>, and so now Valve have another market opened up for future hardware launches. So, a few Australian websites managed to get Valve to open up a little to discuss the future and it's sounding good.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reviews.org Australia</a> here's what Steam Deck designer Lawrence Yang said about a Steam Deck 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to us, and we’ve tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence. We’re not going to do a bump every year. There’s no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that’s kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that’s only incrementally better. So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we’re excited about and we’re working on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also mentioned in the interview is how they really love seeing all the devices from other companies, even if they're not a fan of the constant device refreshes. There's plenty of other good stuff mentioned in the full interview so be sure to go give it a read.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the freshest news though if you've been following along, since I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously covered Valve's little handbook for the Asia launch</a>, that did make it seem pretty clearly like more was planned. Still, Valve reiterating it so <em>strongly</em> is a great sign.</p>
<p>Until then we've still got plenty to look forward to like the final release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6</a> (it's in Beta) which will bring another big lot of system improvements. And, whatever this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ARM64 and Android stuff</a> is for (likely a new VR set).</p>

      <title>Survival game Valheim adds a new feast mechanic and The Bog Witch in testing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
