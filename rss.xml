      <title>Vampire Survivors started a craze and the 1.0 release is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors is a time-survival <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde game</a> that started something of a craze, with many games copying their blueprint and now Vampire Survivors 1.0 is out.</p>
<p>With an Overwhelmingly Positive user review score from over 100,000 people, it's clearly hit the mark and it's easy to see why. With simple pick up and go gameplay, and the still low price at the 1.0 release — it's an ideal game to sink some time into regardless of it being on a coffee break or half your evening.</p>
<p>In the 1.0 release they've added quite a lot including a new event stage, new character art, a new weapon, a new B-side soundtrack, lots more translations, Twitch integration, an "Inverse Mode" that flips the maps, an Endless Mode that gets progressively more difficult forever and lots more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aS7JqyHdQQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b0d16ad23a843acd6bd4e927d422e7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aS7JqyHdQQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Going by their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/vampire-survivors-10-coming-october-20th-seems-a-linux-port-is-still-planned/" target="_blank">previously announced roadmap</a>, they're still working on a game engine port along with a supported Linux version once that's done.</p>
<p>For such a simple game, I've sunk a surprising amount of hours into it. With the 1.0 release, no doubt I will be playing plenty more of it, although it has to compete with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/brotato-is-going-to-be-my-next-horde-survival-arena-shooter-obsession/" target="_blank">Brotato</a> for my time which is very similar and also great. I really do love just how insane these games get once you've put a few minutes into them, with the screen covered by enemies as all your abilities are flying around.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2777375981666285538gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2777375981666285538gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Vampire Survivors 1.0 - my first run today</em></p>
<p>There's just something about these simple games I can't get enough of. I can easily recommend you go and pick this one up, lots of replay value and plenty to unlock as you go through it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>An interview with the creator of Deckmate, the Steam Deck attachment system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you seen the <a href="https://deckmate.me/" target="_blank">Deckmate</a> yet? I'm a big fan and use it quite often. A thoroughly useful attachment system for the Steam Deck and I had the chance to speak to the creator about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16919121991666208578gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16919121991666208578gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Q: First of all, can you introduce yourself?</strong></p>
<p>"My name is Siri Ramos. Mechanical engineer by trade, maker/designer also by trade, DIY home renovator by night."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get started making things like the Deckmate?</strong></p>
<p>"Surprisingly, it’s only recently that I started to make the connection between my childhood desires and my current skill set. I always watched How it’s Made on the Discovery Channel with intense fascination and was endlessly entertained by gadgets and product design. Looking back now it seems like destiny that I ended up doing what I do.</p>
<p>It was only by pure chance that I ended up in my field. I didn’t even know it existed until I was a junior in college. I stumbled across it during a career fair while I was searching for my first internship. Another coincidence: I studied the exact right discipline that would land me a job in this field.</p>
<p>Once I discovered Product Design Engineering, my entire focus landed on getting that first job in the field. I took design for manufacturing classes, my senior thesis was a product idea I wanted to make, I delved into the world of startup design. The field seemed endless at the time, and I was at just the right school to tackle it, Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>By the time my curriculum was complete, I had one big choice to make. On one hand, I had landed an incredible job offer from Apple as a Product Design Engineer. On the other hand, we were getting some traction with some seed round investors on our senior thesis idea to redesign the Epipen to be flat packed as an iPhone case.</p>
<p>The choice boiled down to: Do I venture out and make my own product, or do I accept the job offer from Apple?</p>
<p>In my young naivete, I turned down the Apple job.</p>
<p>We got a seed round of funding, and we all aligned our lives to try and make a brand new medical device. 3 broke and inexperienced college kids taking on one of the most complex type of product design that exists. Medical devices, in hindsight, was one of the worst entry points to release a product. Regulatory compliance, high cost of failure (people dying!), and very little money add up to a company that was doomed to fail from the very start.</p>
<p>Needless to say, less than a year later we were even broker and at each other’s throats as founders. I made the tough decision to leave on a Friday morning in October.</p>
<p>That afternoon, I emailed the hiring manager at Apple that had previously offered me the job. Tail sheepishly tucked back, I asked if he still had a role open for head count.</p>
<p>What happened next honestly astonished me. He called me immediately after opening my email saying the team was off the following Tuesday to all fly to China for work. He asked if I could come in and interview with the team on Monday before everyone flew out. Of course I said yes.</p>
<p>After a whirlwind of flights and interview prep, I arrived on Monday morning semi-ready for a full 8 hour day of back to back technical interviews. By the end of the design challenge around 4pm, my new manager walked me out and offered me the job. I had the  job offer in hand less than 1 business day after I had quit my startup.</p>
<p>I learned everything I know at Apple. From design for manufacturing to how things are actually made, I consider Apple to be my university for product design. This is where I learned how products are truly made. Not in theory, but in practice and at MASSIVE scales. I was single handedly designing products that were being manufactured at a peak rate of 1 million units per day. Needless to say the engineering side was technical, and it had to be perfect.</p>
<p>I chugged along designing stuff for other companies and startups for over 10 years. It’s only recently that I decided to delve fully  into a little side project I designed called Deckmate."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nl2o0mFkLzA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4addbdfd5d591374080bb47cc64e8957.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nl2o0mFkLzA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get the idea for the Deckmate? Why did you make it?</strong></p>
<p>"Honestly, I got the idea because the Steam Deck needed it. Some things you use and the design is begging for a slight modification. This is what happened to me and the Deck. Within one day of using mine (got an early unit around April), I knew it needed a kickstand at the very least. Then it got my design brain thinking about everything else it could do. It really made me want to have a quick system that could interchange and morph into exactly what I needed based on how I was using the Deck.</p>
<p>After posting the rough idea on Reddit, I got feedback and ideas for other use cases. This is how the VESA mount was born. To be honest this is my favorite mount of all. My Steam deck lives essentially permanently above my PC on a monitor arm unless I’m using it to go.</p>
<p>There are tons more mount ideas in the works, and the system will expand to far more devices as well. My intention is to make Deckmate the Quad-lock for video games. Every mount to fit your needs on any device you own."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you tell us a little about <em>how</em> you actually make it? What’s your process like?</strong></p>
<p>"It all starts in a software program called CAD. I use a professional grade CAD program by Siemens called NX.</p>
<p>The process goes a bit like this: </p>
<ol>
<li>Sit back and process what idea you want to make.</li>
<li>Start modeling in CAD and solidify how it will work</li>
<li>3D print a prototype</li>
<li>Repeat 50 times</li>
</ol>
<p>The modeling in CAD is where a lot of the experience comes in. As you model you need to not only know how to use the program to effectively model what you want, but you need to keep in mind all the constraints that you’ve learned over the years. Everything from manufacturing limitations and cosmetic concerns, to strength and product reliability must be kept in mind when modeling.</p>
<p>It’s very easy with 3D printing to design something that you can print. This is because 3D printing has relatively few manufacturing constraints. When you are designing for Injection molding, the parts have wildly different constraints. This is the big reason the molded parts are different from the 3D printed parts that you can download on the website.</p>
<p>Once you’re happy with the design, you reach out to molding suppliers and start a process called DFM (design for manufacture). They process what it will be like to actually make in the mold. Everything from where the material shoots into the empty cavity, where the cooling lines in the steel are, how the plastic flows across the cavity, temperatures and pressures, etc. This is where the really technical stuff gets done and determines how your final product comes out and how reliable it is. Here are some screenshots of that process:"</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16018594201666208307gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16018594201666208307gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Q: Had any weird attachment requests from customers?</strong></p>
<p>"The one I always find a little different is people asking about a way to mount a screen above the Deck. It’s a very interesting application, but I don’t think Deckmate is the right solution for it unfortunately. With the spring system in the Deckmate, having a screen mounted wouldn’t do well with vibrations."</p>
<p><strong>Q: It’s been out for a little while now, has it been a success?</strong></p>
<p>"I would say it has been a phenomenal success! I’ve now shipped almost 3,000 orders with only 4 people who wanted to return it. That’s a phenomenal return rate.</p>
<p>More importantly, I get people messaging me every day how much they love it. And that’s my main motivator. I want to make things people love and that can make their lives easier. My biggest indicator of success came when I got an email from a customer who was using their Deckmate system to allow them to mount their Deck to their leg. It honestly melted my heart and it made me feel the most success over anything."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17664763191666208350gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17664763191666208350gol1.jpg" style="width:80%"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Q: Any plans for more Steam Deck accessories? Or perhaps you have some more attachments for the Deckmate planned?</strong></p>
<p>"There are so many more mounts that I want to tackle: Car mount, airplane mount, ¼-20 camera/tripod mount, etc.</p>
<p>There are also a ton of other devices I want to make grips for: Nintendo switch, All the Aya devices, etc.</p>
<p>With those two approaches together I think Deckmate can become a pretty powerful mounting system for video games!"</p>

      <title>Someone released the FOSS RTS 0 A.D. on Steam without speaking to the developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve has now taken it down.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here's a "fun" one for you. The developers behind the free and open source RTS named <a href="https://play0ad.com/" target="_blank">0 A.D.</a> (pronounced “zero-ey-dee”) have announced that someone (they don't know who) has put it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2158440/0_AD_Empires_Ascendant/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>This is sometimes the perils of open source, as there's a lot of people out their looking to make a quick-buck and they don't care who they burn in the process. To be clear, the version of 0 A.D. that has released on Steam (with it missing the second dot in the name), is not actually from the people who make the game — even though Wildfire Games are listed as the developer on Steam it's not them. Confusing right? Valve allowed it and approved it, so it does make me curious what legal checks are even done for this to happen.</p>
<p>I was notified of this on Twitter, with the official 0 A.D. account <a href="https://twitter.com/play0ad/status/1582881816062873600" target="_blank">tweeting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turns out the only reason <a class="css-16my406 css-18t94o4 css-4rbku5 css-901oao r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-bcqeeo r-poiln3 r-qvutc0" href="https://twitter.com/YouTube" target="_blank">@YouTube</a> added the game back is because somebody uploaded 0 A.D. to  <a class="css-16my406 css-18t94o4 css-4rbku5 css-901oao r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-bcqeeo r-poiln3 r-qvutc0" href="https://twitter.com/Steam" target="_blank">@Steam</a> without our consent. It also explains the typo in the name…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/play0ad/status/1583100868236546050" target="_blank">tweet</a> sent today by the 0 A.D. team:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT: The person who released the game on steam today is charging 8€ for it. Please do not buy it. The game is free and always will be. It might contain viruses and other malware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine it doesn't have anything nefarious inside it, otherwise you really would have to wonder what Valve are doing…</p>
<p>Looking on the official game forum <a href="https://wildfiregames.com/forum/topic/96792-will-0ad-be-released-on-steam/" target="_blank">there's a topic</a> asking about it, the developers seems to be at a loss as to what is happening.</p>

      <title>AMD to fully reveal next-gen AMD Radeon RDNA 3 in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A short but sweet announcement was sent out by AMD today, as they've now set a date for when they will fully reveal AMD Radeon RDNA 3, their next-gen GPU architecture. Something we had a very brief teaser of when <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/amd-announced-qzen-4q-with-ryzen-7000-series-rdna3-teased/" target="_blank">they announced Zen 4</a>.</p>
<p>Their "together we advance_gaming" event will be livestreamed on November 3rd at 1PM PDT / 8PM UTC. As the press released noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced “<strong>together we advance_gaming</strong>,” a livestream event to unveil the next generation of AMD Radeon™ graphics. AMD executives will provide details on the new high-performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA™ 3 architecture that will deliver new levels of performance, efficiency and functionality to gamers and content creators.</p>
<p>The show premieres at 1:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday, November 3, on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AMD" target="_blank">AMD YouTube channel</a>. A replay can be accessed a few hours after the conclusion of the event at <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/graphics/radeon-rx-graphics" target="_blank">AMD.com/Radeon</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are <em>you</em> really hoping for from AMD RDNA 3?</p>
<p>For me: I'm hoping for power requirements that aren't completely ridiculous (hi NVIDIA), along with cards that don't just serve the top-end. It's not much to ask really is it?</p>

      <title>Silent Hill 2 remake announced and coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A much loved action-horror classic Silent Hill 2 is getting a modern remake and the good news is that it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. So it will most likely run in some form on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet and it's likely a good while off, so it gives Valve (and their partner CodeWeavers) plenty of time to keep on improving the Proton compatibility layer to ensure it's ready for more big hits like this. The Silent Hill 2 remake is being developed by Bloober Team SA, who are known for Layers of Fear, Blair Witch and The Medium.</p>
<p>I remember trying to play the original and "noping" out of it pretty quickly. Scary stuff back then.</p>

      <title>UNCHARTED is great on Steam Deck! Here&#39;s how to fix it on Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection out now and Steam Deck Verified, I've been able to see that it does work great! However, it requires some very small tweaks to get it working on a normal Linux desktop.</p>
<p>No doubt at some point Valve will get these fixes into the Proton compatibility layer directly, but until they've sorted it (which could be weeks / months) here's what to do. Thankfully on the official Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6246" target="_blank">bug tracker</a>, users have been reporting the issues and coming up with solutions.</p>
<p>For <strong>AMD</strong> GPUs you need this Steam launch option set:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">WINEDLLOVERRIDES="amd_ags_x64.dll=b" %command% </code></p>
<p>For <strong>NVIDIA</strong> GPUs you need this Steam launch option set:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 PROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU=0 %command%</code></p>
<p>If you don't know how to set a launch option: right click the game in your Steam Library, go to Properties and the General tab has the text box at the bottom:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14900158671666270888gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14900158671666270888gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That should be all you need to do, then the game should load properly on a normal Linux desktop / laptop. On the Steam Deck though, it's click and play. I've been thoroughly impressed with the Steam Deck experience overall, apart from an initial Deck-specific hiccup I experienced that needed a reboot. I seemed to catch a rare bug where Steam Input just stops working but all good after a reboot, so not a problem with the game but a random bug on the Steam Deck itself.</p>
<p>Here's some footage below on Medium (the default) and then later on High settings:</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

<p>Lutris, the open source game manager that can help you keep together all your games from various services on Linux and Steam Deck has a new Beta release fixing some big issues. The release in terms of changes is quite small but still an important one to keep it running smoothly.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in version 0.5.12-beta1:</p>
<div class="markdown-body my-3" data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true">
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix authentication issue with Origin.</li>
<li>Fix authentication issue with EGS.</li>
<li>Fix authentication issue with Ubisoft Connect when 2FA is enabled.</li>
<li>Add Discord Rich Presence integration.</li>
<li>Add ability to extract icons from Windows executables.</li>
<li>Re-style preference dialogs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6499202761666199359gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6499202761666199359gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Lucy Dreaming is a quality point and click adventure with great British humour</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You know a game is going to be good, when you're already chuckling away in the first few minutes. Point and click adventure Lucy Dreaming is out now.  Note: the developer sent a key over.</p>
<p>It's a good time to be a point and click adventure fan right? With the likes of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/return-to-monkey-island-gets-a-linux-beta-version/" target="_blank">Return to Monkey Island</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/foolish-mortals-is-an-upcoming-spooky-point-and-click-adventure/" target="_blank">Foolish Mortals</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/sweet-point-and-click-dino-adventure-zid-journey-is-up-on-kickstarter-with-demo/" target="_blank">Zid Journey</a> all mentioned here recently. Anyway, this time it's Lucy Dreaming. Influenced by the classics from the 90s from the pixel-art style to the silly humour, it's a great little game worth your time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OEpatYJIG4M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63608b3708efd8f7b7bc4baaa1a6b6c8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OEpatYJIG4M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The humour might perhaps not be to everyone's tastes though, considering the very Britishness of it and some of the jokes might fly over your head a bit. I certainly appreciated it though! Some pretty clever and very funny references throughout, like the "Now That's What I Call Chill" tape that reminded me of all the classic TV adverts for the music CD collections and the "Sorny" laptop. The references keep going, even in the first room there's a good few to spot but I don't want to spoil it all obviously.</p>
<p>If you usually like these types of point and clickers, you can't really go wrong with it. Plenty of logical puzzles and item hunting, with combining various items and an unusual way to dry your clothes. Lucy Dreaming didn't have a big budget, it was a tiny team that made it and yet it's quite a memorable little experience.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a wide variety of detailed dreams and real-world locations from a neon-lit comedy club with an unusual clientele to a post-apocalyptic boulangerie<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Encounter a cast of characters from Lucy’s maniacal brother to a giant duck with a bread problem.</li>
<li>Explore rich environments with an abundance of witty retorts to almost everything you can point your cursor at.</li>
<li>Reveal hidden Easter eggs and pop culture references.</li>
<li>Enjoy the distinctive and beautifully realised voice acting (English)</li>
<li>Travel instantly between scenes with a double-click.</li>
<li>Having trouble? Just hit the space bar to get a sneaky peek of each scene’s hotspots.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532710/Lucy_Dreaming/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and <a href="https://tallstorygames.itch.io/lucy-dreaming" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>FIFA? Nah, give me more of Pixel Cup Soccer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need more Football in your life? Yes, I said Football, get over it. Pixel Cup Soccer - Ultimate Edition is officially out now along with Native Linux support. This game took over from Pixel Cup Soccer 17, which the developer unlisted on Steam, as this big new version is quite different as the developer said "the essence of the new game is the same, the technological differences are huge".</p>
<p>It recently left Early Access and it is also Steam Deck Verified, so could be a good one to look at for you sports fans, especially with the latest FIFA being unsupported (and it has a Mostly Negative rating). This definitely looks promising with a Very Positive user rating too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n17quOCXIeU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eda3299ac9f58669b513ab40dc311552.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n17quOCXIeU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Simplified Controls For Casual Players.</li>
<li>Easy to pick up and enjoy, with clean and challenging gameplay.</li>
<li>Retro-style art resembling old games and evoking nostalgia.</li>
<li>Women’s Soccer.</li>
<li>Penalties, Free Kicks.</li>
<li>Fouls, injuries, yellow and red cards.</li>
<li>Tactical and Strategy panels, to manage player substitutions, team formation, and attitude.</li>
<li>Deep gameplay mechanics: short pass, through pass, lob pass, aiming when shooting, controlled shots, player skills, super shots, etc.</li>
<li>Lots of Animations (overhead kick, scorpion kick, scissor kick, diving header, etc.)</li>
<li>Challenging AI. Teams with very different playing styles (ie: Catenaccio like Italy or Tiki-Taka like Brasil).</li>
<li>Many game settings, including Zoom Level, VSync, Slow motion, Assisted mode, Language Selection, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Growing up playing the likes of Sensible World of Soccer on the Amiga, this game definitely ticks a lot of nostalgia boxes for me.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620540/Pixel_Cup_Soccer__Ultimate_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There is also a demo available too!</p>

      <title>GB Operator is a fun gadget for Game Boy fans tested on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/play-real-game-boy-cartridges-on-steam-deck-linux-with-gb-operator/" target="_blank">Recently</a> I mentioned <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/" target="_blank">GB Operator</a> a little USB gadget that reads cartridges of the Game Boy, Game Boy Colour and Game Boy Advance. After giving it a go myself (personal purchase), I'm impressed and a little in love.</p>
<p>The idea is that it allows you to play games from cartridges directly using a built-in emulator with their Operator app, along with the ability to back up to roms to have your own private collection that you can then use in whatever emulator you want. You can also mess with save files, allowing you to back them up (say if your cart won't save properly) or edit them for your own entertainment.</p>
<p>Here's a first look at the device with a Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZMxK3SK30Dc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/70610e4edfbb125415326b9c9c90918b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZMxK3SK30Dc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As mentioned in the video it's not perfected yet. They need an easy way to cleanly exit the cart on Steam Deck, with it currently relying on keyboard ESC which doesn't work properly. It also sometimes won't open the Operator app, unless you unplug the device and plug it back in. Some small quirks that can probably be fixed quite easily but overall a pretty fun experience to begin playing with.</p>
<p>If you're a collector of retro games, this is great. Awesome for game preservation too and the fact that it works on Linux so easily, that's another big tick in the box.</p>
<p>Once I've had more time to play with it, I'll have a lot more thoughts but if you do have any comments or questions do let me know.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck adds External Display Safe Mode setting, 30 second boot videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now the official Steam Deck Docking Station is out, a lot more people are testing the Steam Deck on external displays showing up numerous issues so Valve has added a little something to help.</p>
<p>In true Valve style when it comes to the Steam Deck, they released a Beta and then only a few <em>hours</em> later put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3414317363006517615" target="_blank">stable release</a>. They sure do love pushing things out early. This does pull in the changes from a bunch of recent other Beta versions too so here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div class="bbcodes_Bold_1opdq"><strong>General</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>The Quick Access Menu will now open to the notifications tab when you have new friend chat messages, game invites, or voice chat invites</li>
<li>Notifications for Game Invites in the Quick Access Menu now have an option in the footer to accept them without having to navigate to the chat window</li>
<li>Added External Display Safe Mode to developer settings. When enabled, the next time an external display is plugged in Steam Deck will pick a low resolution configuration, which may help in some cases where the external display has issues.</li>

      <title>Sweet point and click dino adventure Zid Journey is up on Kickstarter with demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your point and click adventures and want to see more? Zid Journey is a new one from the team behind Zniw Adventure. It's a classic 2D point 'n click adventure game, developed in a tiny team from Poland. Just like the first game, it will have full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Zid Journey tells the story of Zid, and focuses on his quest of reuniting a little Daspletosaurus hatchling with its lost parents, while also trying to uncover his own mysterious origins. The developers said that their first game, Zniw Adventure, was "welcomed with enthusiasm and enjoyed by many players" and so this encouraged them to continue making more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EvwbdgQBDas"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6f857bc201c59a1bf820bc716d08782.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EvwbdgQBDas" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A relaxing point 'n click with an cartoon/comic-book aesthetic and familiar prehistoric world.</li>
<li>Charming visuals featuring cartoony art style, hand-drawn backgrounds, and frame-by-frame animations!</li>
<li>Over 20 dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures to meet during your journey.</li>
<li>Visit new places, landmarks, and settlements in the lore-rich, prehistoric world of Polisemia!</li>
<li>Seveal unlockables, including dinopedia pages and bonus content!</li>
<li>A safe adventure for everyone - no gore, blood, or bad language.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their Kickstarter campaign only has a small goal of €8,000 which has already been hit. A very small goal to make a game with, and it seems like it's mainly to hire a little help to get it across the finishing line.</p>
<p>Fund it on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/azuremountain/zid-journey" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and try the new demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1814690/Zid_Journey/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Theme park building sim Indoorlands is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indoorlands, a somewhat unique theme park building sim has left Early Access as a finished game ready for you to get clicking around. What's the different about this one then? Well, as the name hints towards, you're building everything inside. An indoor amusement park, that you build up using these massive connected rooms. It comes with Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e80MfXtOiO8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fd005c31ed7194a446d4750cf4f60eda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e80MfXtOiO8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>As a <strong>manager</strong>, you have to build and expand your park, analyze and satisfy your guests’ needs, research attractions and buildings and keep the economy running.</li>
<li>Place <strong>research </strong>centers to generate research points and unlock more attractions, restaurants, shops, halls, and rides. Research points can also be spent on general park improvements.</li>
<li>Thrill rides take center stage: As a <strong>ride operator</strong>, you realistically control your rides and record unique ride programs that put a smile on your guests‘ faces.</li>
<li>The ‘<strong>Create Your Ride</strong>’ tool even offers the ability to construct your own, completely unique rides and share them via STEAM workshop.</li>
<li><strong>Roller coasters</strong> attract visitors. You can construct your own tracks and use different types of gondolas and stations. Of course, blueprints and the Steam workshop can also be used here.</li>
<li>Different <strong>visitor types</strong> have different demands and desires. Attention should be paid to this as new types of visitors arrive at the park over time and certain buildings should be built accordingly.</li>
<li>There is no limit to your creativity: Over 1000 <strong>decoration</strong> objects from various themes to choose from. All themes and objects are freely combinable, so each hall is unique due to the individual design choices. </li>
<li><strong>Blueprint System</strong>: Show your creativity &amp; share your hall interior designs, and ride and coaster creations with other players via STEAM Workshop integration.Planning the park architecture is a challenging task.</li>
<li>Space is expensive and maintenance buildings like toilets should be built apart from the <strong>flow of visitors</strong>. Different tools like the feedback report, heatmaps, and individual visitor details provide all the information needed.</li>
<li>React to <strong>special events and temporary trends</strong>. Choose and fulfill contracts to receive rewards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Leon Jeutter, Community Manager of Pixelsplit Simulations, says: “What a ride this has been - our great community supported us all the way through Early Access. Now the game is ready we are excited to present Indoorlands to players worldwide in the form it was meant to be played, a deep, engaging theme park management simulation with lots of ways for players to experience it according to their playing style.”</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/indoorlands?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1378890/Indoorlands/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

      <title>LOST EMBER should run nicer on Steam Deck / Linux, as dev fixes video issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LOST EMBER is an adventure game all about the power of nature. Released back in 2019, it seems recently that went back to it to ensure it works nicely on Steam Deck (and so Linux too).</p>
<p>Going by various reports of people who tried to play it previously, it had a problem where the movies wouldn't work and it seems that just stopped the game working as a whole. The developer was paying attention thankfully and put up a patch to solve the issues.</p>
<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/563840/view/3328747612251304994" target="_blank">announcement</a> earlier this month, the developer posted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might have noticed that Lost Ember is finally playable on the Steam Deck! :) The game had a couple of video issues on the Steam Deck, but we've finally found a way to eliminate those soooo:<br/>
<br/>
- Lost Ember is now running on Steam Deck!<br/>
- Alongside the development for both Steam Deck and the VR version, a variety of fixes made their way into the new build. Especially a couple of crashes and collision bugs should no finally be fixed<br/>
<br/>
We love Lost Ember on Steam Deck! Let us know what you think &lt;3 And if you're still experiencing bugs, please continue reporting them!</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vo7CPfVu7MY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7cd29ef5424c2f4f0ce9cd4dcc44ac14.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vo7CPfVu7MY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As always, great to see developers ensure their games work better on the Steam Deck. It now has a Deck Playable rating, mainly as the text can be a little too small to be Deck Verified. Hopefully the developer will solve that too, which is an issue many games have where it seems the developers made it with their eye-balls directly up against the screen.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lost-ember?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/563840/LOST_EMBER/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Valve are preparing to launch the latest update to Steam Play Proton, the compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Proton 7.0-5 is now in the Release Candidate testing stage, so it's not quite finished but you can give it a test yourself. Right now, they're looking for testing and reports on anything that is broken that wasn't before. For instructions, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6240" target="_blank">GitHub topic</a>.</p>
<p>The tentative changelog (as it may change before final release):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Now playable:
	<ul>
<li>Rift</li>
<li>Unravel 2</li>
<li>Airborne Kingdom</li>

<li>Re-Volt</li>
<li>Warhammer: Vermintide 2</li>
<li>Aspire: Ina's Tale</li>
<li>Battle Realms: Zen Edition</li>

<li>Improve GTA V situation with not loading textures.</li>
<li>Fix Red Dead Redemption 2 crashing after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher functionality after game update.</li>

<li>Fix Thrustmaster HOTAS having non-functional dial in Elite Dangerous.</li>
<li>Fix Planet Zoo randomly crashing.</li>
<li>Fix SCP: Secret Labratory not being playable after a recent game update (again).</li>

<li>Implement network video support for The Good Life and VRChat.</li>
<li>Update dxvk to v1.10.3-28-ge3daa699.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 should probably not be listed as playable, since it has some pretty major problems still.</p>
<p>Also, Valve, are you ever going to actually mark Paladins as Unsupported again? It has been broken due to the anti-cheat for months. It's really not inspiring any confidence in Deck Verified if a well-known broken game continues to be listed as Playable…</p>

      <title>If you use PolyMC for Minecraft you should switch away now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unfortunately, it seems a developer on the Minecraft launcher PolyMC went completely rogue and so for your own safety, you should remove PolyMC from all systems. Last night I was made aware of the situation and posted about it on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1582103691762405378" target="_blank">Twitter</a> but for those who don't follow along, here's what happened.</p>
<p>14 hours ago, according to GitHub, the creator removed the Code of Conduct with a commit <a href="https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee" target="_blank">message</a> titled "reclaim polymc from the leftoids". After that, they then kicked out the other developers from the project in some kind of completely hostile takeover.</p>
<p>People thought they got hacked but unfortunately this person seemingly just decided to attack others. In a message in the PolyMC Discord, they said this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3869764111666082503gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Regardless on your views, this kind of behaviour is <em>not</em> something anyone of any sane mind should support. Who knows what they would do next? What they've done is only show how they are completely untrustworthy, and they've basically killed the project. You should 100% consider PolyMC to be compromised and move onto another launcher.</p>
<p>Sadly, this means the various videos and guides I did on PolyMC are no longer valid, and so I will be looking to cover other launchers in future. You should also revoke any permissions you gave to PolyMC via your <a href="http://microsoft.com/consent" target="_blank">Microsoft account</a>.</p>
<p>What are your options for right now? You can try:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atlauncher.com/" target="_blank">ATLauncher</a></li>
<li><a href="https://multimc.org/" target="_blank">MultiMC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gdevs.io/" target="_blank">GDLauncher</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Although, MultiMC comes with its own controversy for Linux packaging and licensing stuff but at least the developer isn't malicious.</em></p>
<p>Is there some good news? Seemingly so. The team who were kicked out have banded together to carry it on under <a href="https://github.com/PlaceholderMC/PrismLauncher" target="_blank">PrismLauncher</a> but it's very early days on that yet.</p>

      <title>LEGO Bricktales is out now with Linux support and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Who doesn't love LEGO? ClockStone and Thunderful Publishing just recently released LEGO Bricktales and surprisingly, it came with full Native Linux support along with being Steam Deck Verified. They didn't mention anything about Linux before release, so it caught me by surprise but a welcome one and so I picked up a personal copy to give it a go.</p>
<p>LEGO Bricktales is set across 5 different themed biomes, where it's up to you to solve various puzzles by building anything that can help you. With physics at play, you need to ensure you're building something sound that won't fall apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9607615721666006954gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've actually been really quite enjoying this one. A great atmosphere, and it really does look the part — the LEGO style here is practically perfected. Having your constructions in the world, exactly as you make them is a really nice touch too, as is the ability to go back in sandbox mode and build them all bigger. While there is an overall story of helping your grandad rebuild a theme park, it's full of little mini-adventures as you go through and it's quite charming really. Good for all ages.</p>
<p>LEGO Bricktales is not really like any other LEGO game that has come before it. Most of them focus on some sort of action, whereas this is a stripped-down puzzle adventure from the creators of Bridge Constructor.</p>
<p>My only real gripe with it is that the camera controls can be a little annoying but you eventually get the hang of it.</p>
<p>Here's an intro and some Steam Deck footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6KZWVXyYxJM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ade00aff9ceb2afc0be856d45655fba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6KZWVXyYxJM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: currently, the Steam Deck uses Proton by default.</em></p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>A globetrotting LEGO adventure:</strong> Experience a whimsical and epic adventure around the world, packed with charming dialogue and fun secrets to unravel.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful diorama worlds:</strong> Explore five varied story world biomes and the amusement park hub, all fully built out of LEGO bricks.</li>
<li><strong>Build like never before:</strong> Discover the most intuitive brick-by-brick building in a LEGO video game, as you see your creations come to life in a three-dimensional world.</li>
<li><strong>Test your skills with varied puzzles:</strong> Different types of puzzles will test your building skills. Use your engineering brain in functional physics-based puzzles to build a bridge for a digger to get across a river, put your designer hat on to build a stunning new throne for the King, or customize the rides in the amusement park.</li>
<li><strong>Master your builds in Sandbox Mode:</strong> Unlock the Sandbox Mode upon completing a construction spot, then you go back in and improve your build with a huge selection of additional bricks from different themes.</li>
<li><strong>Heaps of items to collect and unlock:</strong> Find collectables in the different dioramas and use them to buy cool new items for your wardrobe or new brick color sets for the sandbox mode.</li>
<li><strong>Build your unique character:</strong> Create your own minifigure character from a huge selection of parts and unlock more options inspired by the worlds you visit as you progress through the story.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamDB makes it easier to track upcoming releases</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamDB, the unofficial website that tracks basically everything Steam, has a new and improved way for you to track upcoming games. With so many new releases happening all the time, it's pretty easy to get completely lost in it all. My own backlog of things to look at grows constantly and I do keep missing some pretty great looking stuff but perhaps no more.</p>
<p>Mentioned by Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1579772667879886850" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (the creator of SteamDB), the <a href="https://steamdb.info/upcoming/" target="_blank">Upcoming</a> page has been upgraded to be a weekly tracker and you can easily go back through previous weeks and check out upcoming weeks as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11356428011666010917gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>By default it's sorted by the amount of people following along, so you get the most popular titles showing at the top which is pretty useful. The trend is also a good way to see what games a lot of people are really excited about. Simple, to the point and exactly what I like without lots of big flashy banners to scroll past like on Steam directly.</p>
<p>I quite like their <a href="https://steamdb.info/calendar/" target="_blank">monthly calendar</a> too, showing off the big main game each day for an even easier glance at what you perhaps don't want to miss.</p>

      <title>Minecraft 1.20 Beta coming soon with camels and a new &#39;sniffer&#39; mob won the vote</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Live recently happened and they showed off many new things coming to Minecraft with the 1.20 update.</p>
<p>As usual, they're not announcing everything and plenty <em>more</em> will be revealed over the coming months with a first "snapshot" (a Beta) coming relatively soon with some new fun features. They also haven't revealed the name of the update just yet. Some of what's new includes: seven new default skins, a camel mob, hanging signs, a new bamboo wood set, rafts as new boat variants and a chiseled bookshelf.</p>
<p>On top of that a new mob was announced with the sniffer, which won this year's mob vote. This new mob will hatch from eggs you find hidden in chests, and when it grows into an adult it will help you find ancient seeds that you can grow into different decorative plants.</p>
<p><em>The Minecraft 1.20 update will launch in full in 2023.</em></p>
<p>Here's the Minecraft 1.20 video clip from Minecraft Live:</p>

      <title>Return to Monkey Island gets a Linux Beta version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you own Return to Monkey Island or are you thinking of buying it? Good news, as the developer now has a Native Linux version ready for Beta testing.</p>
<p>The Steam page currently seems to indicate it has Linux support already with the SteamOS icon but it is currently only in Beta for owners of the game. Announced by Ron Gilbert on <a href="https://twitter.com/grumpygamer/status/1580990722580566018" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, they mentioned you need to head to a special Steam Community forum post, that only owners can access for the instructions.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lAlDNn43QQQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8f958408d5ffd2ee1ff2f6a26be8bd30.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lAlDNn43QQQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We knew it was coming, as stated in our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/return-to-monkey-island-is-out-now-linux-version-due-soon/" target="_blank">original release article</a> as Gilbert said previously it would be "soon after" so it's nice to see a developer deliver on their words for Native Linux fans.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Return to Point &amp; Click Swashbuckling</strong> - Bringing classic point and click gameplay to the modern-day, intrepid pirates will solve puzzles and explore the islands with a clever evolution of classic adventure game controls. Context-sensitive interactions, reactive dialog trees, and an easy-to-use inventory system make pirating a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Embark on Archipelago Adventures</strong> - Navigate the sometimes-friendly confines of Melee Island, a familiar place that finds itself under new management by leaders who have put the squeeze on old friends and new faces. Venture out into uncharted lands like the aptly named Terror Island and the chilling outposts of Brrr Muda to make allies and enemies alike.</li>
<li><strong>Created by a Legendary Crew</strong> - The new chapter in the Monkey Island series marks the return of the iconic series’ creator Ron Gilbert, joined by game co-writer Dave Grossman, art director Rex Crowle (Knights &amp; Bikes, Tearaway) and composers Peter McConnell, Michael Land, and Clint Bajakian (Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck plugin system Decky Loader solves some major issues in new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/decky-loader-get-easy-steam-deck-plugins-and-make-colours-pop/" target="_blank">Last week</a> I showed off <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> properly, a fantastic plugin system for the Steam Deck and the developers have now put up a new release solving some problems.</p>
<p>While it worked and the plugins were great, they had some issues where it could cause crashes and make the Quick Access menu "laggy". All of those problems should now be a thing of the past as of version <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/releases/tag/v2.2.7" target="_blank">2.2.7</a>. So if you didn't have a great experience or saw instability with it, now is a good time to take another look! Really nice to see they found the problem and solved it so now more people can enjoy such a great extension system.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YQhvNiI3hKI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd93ae009c399252cc75e9e90d568082.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YQhvNiI3hKI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Release Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gamescope crashes and laggy QAM should now be a thing of the past. Notifications patching was being done pretty much everytime the UI was being interacted with, rather than just when it was needed. Also you can now back out of plugins using the B button as you might expect with the rest of the deck UI!</p>
<p><strong>What's Changed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>README rewrite by <a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/EMERALD0874" target="_blank">@EMERALD0874</a> in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/pull/214" target="_blank">#214</a></li>

<li>Allow B button to close active plugin and return to menu. by <a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/AAGaming00" target="_blank">@AAGaming00</a> in <a class="issue-link js-issue-link" href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/pull/218" target="_blank">#218</a></li>

      <title>Play real Game Boy cartridges on Steam Deck / Linux with GB Operator</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.epilogue.co/" target="_blank">GB Operator</a> excites the collector in me, giving you a small device to plug into your PC or Steam Deck, allowing you to play real Game Boy cartridges.</p>
<p>Costing $49.99 (plus shipping), it gives you a device that supports cartridges for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color and the Game Boy Advance. Along with their cross-platform Operator application, with a tightly integrated version of the mGBA emulator so you get plenty of features.</p>
<p>Honestly, I hadn't heard of this until it started appearing in my Twitter feed. The developers of the device mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s official - enjoy your childhood cartridges, now on SteamDeck! Today we validated at the office that GB Operator and the Operator app are fully compatible with Steam OS and run impeccably on SteamDeck. This makes the experience fun and portable, we're happy to support it 💪🏻</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's been around for some time too, so it hasn't just suddenly appeared and a lot of people seem to quite like it.</p>
<p>I have one ordered and on the way so I can see what all the fuss is about. Seems like collecting Game Boy cartridges is going to turn into something I end up doing now…</p>
<p><em>The creators are also currently working on a SNES version.</em></p>

      <title>NVIDIA &#34;unlaunching&#34; the RTX 4080 12GB, apparently 4090 Ti cancelled due to melting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of big NVIDIA news for you today one confirmed and one not so confirmed, which concerns a double-cancellation with the RTX 4080 12GB and a 4090 Ti / Titan.</p>
<p>Firstly, the RTX 4080 12GB is confirmed to be cancelled by NVIDIA directly. There was a lot of backlash on this due to both the naming of it and the price considering there is also the RTX 4080 16GB which is still a thing. Part of the issue was that while they shared the model number, they were clearly vastly different cards in actual spec no doubt what should have been a 4070 but NVIDIA wanted to price it higher.</p>
<p>In a very short <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/12gb-4080-unlaunch/" target="_blank">statement</a> they simply said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RTX 4080 12GB is a fantastic graphics card, but it’s not named right. Having two GPUs with the 4080 designation is confusing.</p>
<p>So, we’re pressing the “unlaunch” button on the 4080 12GB. The RTX 4080 16GB is amazing and on track to delight gamers everywhere on November 16th.</p>
<p>If the lines around the block and enthusiasm for the 4090 is any indication, the reception for the 4080 will be awesome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for a potential 4090 Ti / Titan, according to sources familiar with YouTuber Moore's Law Is Dead (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wih0h8ps44" target="_blank">video</a>) who claims they are a legitimate source based on all the information they've been given, this has also been cancelled as it was "tripping breakers, melting power supplies, and sometimes melting itself".</p>
<p>Seems like NVIDIA aren't having a good time lately. Especially after EVGA <a href="https://forums.evga.com/Official-Message-from-EVGA-Management-m3574574.aspx" target="_blank">pulled out</a> of doing any future NVIDIA cards too.</p>

      <title>Valve filed a &#39;computer game software&#39; trademark for &#39;NEON PRIME&#39; (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is perhaps exciting, seems Valve are cooking up something new with a <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/97625453" target="_blank">trademark application</a> for NEON PRIME. The application notes it's for "categories of computer game software, electronic game software, video game software, computer game programs downloadable via the internet" and so quite likely some new game is on the way.</p>
<p>It could be a game but then again it could be anything and it doesn't mean something will be released, as we've seen in the past Valve (like a lot of developers / publishers) prototypes a lot and cancels plenty before they ever see the light of day.</p>
<p>NEON PRIME was sent in as a trademark application on October 10th, so by doing so it's become public and anyone can go in and see. It doesn't give us a lot to go on though mind you but sure would be exciting for a new Valve game (or series?).</p>
<p>Valve are certainly on a roll lately with Half-Life: Alyx, Steam Deck and Aperture Desk Job. They've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/valve-have-multiple-games-in-development-they-will-announce-says-gabe-newell/" target="_blank">said before</a> that multiple games are in development, so perhaps we're finally getting closer to seeing one of them?</p>
<p>Then again, it could also be multiple years away and could even be a new VR game for their long-rumoured upcoming VR headset codenamed Deckard. Of which, we know that they're still working towards that too, thanks to a <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/jobs?job_id=52" target="_blank">new job listing</a> that clearly mentions the developer will be responsible for "prototype, ship, and support consumer gaming products leveraging visual-inertial tracking (HMD and controllers), camera passthrough, environment understanding, eye tracking, and hand tracking".</p>
<p>What do you think NEON PRIME from Valve could be?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> 15/10/22: as pointed out in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/comment_id=233848" target="_blank">comment</a> (thanks) there's <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/97625459" target="_blank">another</a> trademark application for NEON PRIME that gives us a different idea of what it could be as it's "intended to cover the categories of entertainment services, namely, providing online video games; provision of on-line entertainment, namely, on-line computer games; providing on-line computer games and on-line video games; electronic games services provided by means of the Internet; providing information in the fields of computer games and entertainment via the Internet; organization of competitions relating to video games, video game education, and video game entertainment; providing information in the field of on-line computer games and on-line video games and computer games".</p>
<p>Certainly a little eye-opening. Is it more than just a game? A whole service? Perhaps finally Steam Cloud Gaming, their own streaming service? Or, a service attached to a game somehow.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated helping Halo Infinite and Spider-Man Remastered</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a really small update to Proton Experimental on October 13th, so here's what's new and how to use it. This is the special version of the Proton compatibility layer for running Windows games, with lots of extra special fixes that eventually make their way into the main Proton version that's most used.</p>
<p>From the October 13th Update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix Halo Infinite crashing without internet.</li>
<li>Fix Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered displaying dialog about outdated drivers on AMD systems.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog available <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder, you now need Mesa 22 / Nvidia drivers 510.47 or newer for Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Need to know how to change the Proton version used? See the below video:</p>

      <title>UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you ready for another Sony game on Steam? The UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection arrives on October 19th, and it's been Steam Deck Verified already.</p>
<p>This is similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/marvels-spider-man-remastered-is-steam-deck-verified-ahead-of-release/" target="_blank">Spider-Man Remastered</a>, as clearly Valve and Sony are talking behind the scenes to get testing done and ensure the Windows ports are in good shape with the Proton compatibility layer. What a time to be alive, games from Sony releasing on Steam and being verified on a Linux gaming device. Still quite hard to believe but amazing to see.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eYJMMLg2FpU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/41f502f358f5469d39db06890a1aedaa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eYJMMLg2FpU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I do find it thoroughly odd that they're putting the newer games up before the originals, which is likely down to easier porting on these more modern games.</p>
<p>Will you be picking them up to play on Linux / Steam Deck? Let us know in the comments. I'll be taking a look with a video hopefully up soon after the release to see how it runs.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Client Beta updated, plus official Docking Station update coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released another small Steam Deck Client Beta update to fix some lingering issues, plus they've announced a Docking Station update is on the way.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6186282400391934912" target="_blank">Beta update</a> available in the Beta and Preview channels: you can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel here's what's new.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the Performance Overlay would still show when set to off.</li>
<li>Don't show the "switch to desktop" option in the power menu when the lock screen is active.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for their new official Steam Deck Docking Station, Valve put out this <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1580678549006323712" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi all, a quick update on the Steam Deck Docking Station. Thanks to reports from the community, we've discovered cases where MST and FreeSync functionality still require work. The team is actively working on these bugs, and we'll be shipping software and firmware updates soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The docked experience clearly still needs some work, and no doubt more issues will appear as many more people get their hands on a dock now as the official Docking Station still remains in the global top 10 sellers on Steam.</p>
<p>On top of that, they've made another additional <a href="https://twitter.com/ondeckupdates" target="_blank">Twitter account @ondeckupdates</a> where they will be posting smaller updates, that aren't big enough for the main OnDeck account that you might wish to follow.</p>

      <title>The JSAUX M.2 Docking Station for Steam Deck is a great choice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After playing with it for a few weeks, here's what I think along with how to set up the <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/m-2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0604?variant=43340045156572" target="_blank">M.2 Docking Station</a> for Steam Deck from JSAUX. Note: JSAUX sent a Dock and a 2TB SSD for review that I can keep.</p>
<p>Unlike other Docking Stations (including the official one from Valve), this has a built in M.2 SSD slot so you can give you Steam Deck a whole lot more speedy storage. You can buy the dock by itself but JSAUX also offer it with either a 1TB or 2TB SSD. It features a USB-C slot for charging, HDMI 2.0, two USB-A 3.1 ports and gigabit ethernet on the side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8166187871665746593gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8166187871665746593gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>It's a pretty great looking dock overall, and thanks to the SSD slot being on the back, it keeps it nicely out of the way so you don't really notice it. My continued gripe with JSAUX applies here though, with ethernet on the side being a little annoying because it sticks right out. I do wish the design was a little more like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler</a> and Valve with it on the back. A pretty minor gripe though all things considered.</p>
<p>Here's an overview video along with the setup:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dsVu-uYONWY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/87406f982336593265f02d5462d8ce4a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dsVu-uYONWY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It is more on the pricey side at $129.99 <em>without</em> an SSD, $199.99 with a 1TB SSD and $269.99 with a 2TB SSD. However, for the price you're getting something incredibly useful. Really, the pricing depends on if you use it while docked enough to want this, without a different kind of external drive taking up a USB slot and this way it's all nicely integrated.</p>
<p>Thankfully once you've got it set up and ready to go, it works great. All the ports work fine and SSD has been running smoothly inside it with a number of games tested repeatedly on it. The biggest annoyance is the initial setup though, which is down to Valve for only really supporting the Micro SD slot directly.</p>
<p><strong>How to set it up (and any other external drive):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set a desktop password with "passwd" in the Konsole terminal app.</li>
<li>Load the KDE Partition Manager, select the drive and remove any NTFS partition on it.</li>
<li>Add a new ext4 partition, label it something like "External" and apply the changes.</li>
<li>You can then use <a href="https://github.com/scawp/Steam-Deck.Mount-External-Drive" target="_blank">this script</a> to auto mount it and it works great!<br/>
<em>The script has a one-liner you can copy and paste into the Konsole terminal app.</em></li>
<li>Now you need to give yourself permissions on the folder the drive is mounted in. As an example you can run this command in terminal:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo chown deck /run/media/deck/*drive name / ID*</code></li>
<li>On the drive in the File Manager make a "steam" folder. Right click -&gt; Create New -&gt; Folder.</li>
<li>In Steam go to Settings -&gt; Downloads and add this "steam" folder from the new drive.</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/m-2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0604?variant=43340045156572" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta update tweaks notifications, boot video length upped to 30 seconds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fresh out the oven, Valve has put up a new Steam Deck <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/6186282400389030369" target="_blank">Client Beta</a> that tweaks how some notifications are accessed. This update is available in the Beta and Preview channels: you can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Quick Access Menu will now open to the notifications tab when you have new friend chat messages, game invites, or voice chat invites</li>
<li>Notifications for Game Invites in the Quick Access Menu now have an option in the footer to accept them without having to navigate to the chat window</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Steam group chats with long names or descriptions could cause break the layout of the chat screen</li>
<li>Increase boot animation max length from 10 seconds to 30 seconds</li>
<li>Added controller-specific glyphs on the Lock screen</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the Lock screen where you'd have to dismiss the On-Screen Keyboard manually if you slept the device while it was up</li>
<li>Fixed invoking the On-Screen-Keyboard while already in a fullscreen keyboard input scenario causing bad behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam Input:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with editing command settings from inside the virtual menu screen</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've no doubt many will appreciate the max length change to boot animations, considering there's so many great videos being showcased. Now there's even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-deck-boot-videos-get-an-easy-app-plus-videos-coming-to-the-points-shop/" target="_blank">an easy to use app</a> to download and install them.</p>

      <title>Steam Mobile App gets a huge revamp out now for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some time being in Beta, Valve has officially released the new shiny new Steam Mobile App for all.</p>
<p>This really is a big upgrade, and one we've all been waiting for. Valve let Steam Mobile die a slow death until this revamp, so let's hope they keep up with it this time. It has a new design, along with it being built on a whole new framework. Major new additions like QR code sign-in, making it easier than ever to jump into Steam on new devices.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8YhYPGltHyI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d36cd3615129a622c9fc78f7bda355a6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8YhYPGltHyI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>App Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Two-factor authentication to ensure you’re the only one with access to your account</li>
<li>QR code sign in - Scan a QR code to sign into Steam instead of entering a password or…</li>
<li>Sign in confirmation - Confirm your regular Steam sign ins with simple “approve” or “deny”</li>
<li>Authorized Devices - Manage access to the devices your account has signed in</li>
<li>Easy access to the Store, Community, News, etc from wherever you are</li>
<li>Your Library with access to your game content, discussions, guides, support, and more</li>
<li>Remote download of games and updates on your PC, managed from your phone</li>
<li>Customizable Steam notifications: wishlist, sales, comments, trades, discussions, friend requests, and more</li>
<li>Trade and Market confirmations – to ensure items don’t leave your account without your approval</li>
<li>An improved Store browsing experience for mobile screens</li>
<li>Support for using multiple Steam accounts in the app</li>
<li>Customizable tabs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Valve makes it clear that Steam Chat will remain a separate app, for some reason. It will also be getting some major upgrades today on Android and iOS "soon".</p>
<p>As for what's next. Valve are bringing the QR sign-in to Steam Deck, adding in new notification types and adding the Authorized Devices list to the Steam Client and browser.</p>
<p>The app is available in the <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/steam-mobile/id495369748" target="_blank">Apple App Store</a>, the <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.android.steam.community" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>, and as a <a class="Link eventbbcodeparser_Link_3I3zk" href="https://store.steampowered.com/mobile?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_" target="_blank">standalone APK</a>.</p>

      <title>Inspired by Factorio and RimWorld, space colony building sim Stardeus out in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking plenty of inspiration from Factorio and RimWorld (including a very RimWorld style), Kodo Linija and Paradox Arc have released Stardeus into Early Access. It comes with Native Linux support, along with it being Steam Deck Verified. <em>Note: the developer provided me a key months ago for early testing.</em></p>
<p>Set on a broken spaceship long after Earth was destroyed, your take in Stardeus is to build it back up with the help of various drones to make it habitable once again for your hibernating human survivors. Build up and travel the stars in a procedurally generated universe, with a lot of heavy simulation going on in the background.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zDeQ3FX3nyQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6afbdfb9ec01f84cf46c9791a62a736a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zDeQ3FX3nyQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it is a pretty huge game, with lots to learn, it's also surprisingly accessible. The developer has kept it in a closed-beta for some months now, and the introduction has been smoothed-over quite nicely with a tutorial that nicely walks you through various parts of the game as you go. Thanks to that, it's quite easy to get into it.</p>
<p>Unlike certain other similar games, Stardeus does have an end-game win condition. The whole point of what you're doing here is not to aimlessly wander the stars. Instead, the idea is that you build up enough and explore to find a suitable planet for colonization. It can take many tens of hours to get there though, and with it being in Early Access no doubt it will change and expand over time.</p>
<p>Even though it's unfinished, there's a lot to enjoy with this one already and tons of content available to play through with a few different scenarios. Kido Linija expect it to be in Early Access for 2-3 years where they will add in more scenarios, story events and various other features. It will still sprinkle in some quests though, so you're not entirely alone right away.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9513253371665590916gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9513253371665590916gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Since there's a huge amount to the game, the tutorial only covers so much and it does get to a point where you're on your own. It's there that Stardeus thrives, letting you click around and discover everything it has to offer as you research new buildings, and attempt to revive more of the population you have sitting in stasis.</p>
<p>It has some fantastic ambiance to it too. The music is soft and blends nicely into the background, while you're listening to all your little robots and people get to work. Honestly, I've been really sucked in by this one and the hours really do just fade away into space.</p>
<p>There are some niggling issues with it though, and some things just need to be made clearer, which no doubt the developer will get a ton of feedback on now that anyone can buy it and play it. Not a huge amount though, just a lot of little things that need a better even small explanation of why they won't work. Sometimes your actual people will take a bit too long to make a decision to do something too, leaving you waiting around even when the exact facilities they need are available.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>With only a handful of drones at your disposal, salvage, repair and rebuild your destroyed ship and restore life support before the crew suffocates in the vacuum of space.</li>
<li>Design and rebuild your ship according to your own needs and desires. Balance the onboard systems of oxygen, heat and power to ensure long-term survival.</li>
<li>Process resources into useful components to maintain and expand your ship’s facilities. Grow crops and turn the harvest into food for your awakening colonists. Generate energy to power your ship and create a robust interconnected system.</li>
<li>Use and expand your massive computing power to research alien technologies. Discover new ways to survive the harsh universe and take care of or exploit your human crew.</li>
<li>Once powered and crewed by skilled colonists, take your ship on an odyssey to explore and mine the procedurally generated planets and systems of a vast universe.</li>
<li>Prepare for the worst, hope for the best. Live through an endless number of events and encounters introduced by the story-generating AI. Be it alien face huggers, benevolent traders or pirates: always be vigilant and deal with whatever happens the way you chose.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the smooth gameplay, and backing from Paradox, I've no doubt this will be a hit. I'll happily recommend it even in this early stage. I can see myself spending many weeks playing this.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stardeus" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for $29.99 / £26.99 / €29.99.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 520.56.06 driver adds easier NVIDIA NGX updates for Wine / Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released driver version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/193764/en-us/" target="_blank">520.56.06</a>, adding support for NVIDIA RTX 40 series and adding a bunch of new features and fixes for Linux gamers.</p>
<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Implemented support for over-the-air updates in the Proton and Wine NVIDIA NGX build. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Updated the Vulkan driver so that the following extensions no longer depend on nvidia-uvm.ko being loaded at runtime:
	<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_acceleration_structure</li>
<li>VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations</li>
<li>VK_KHR_ray_query</li>
<li>VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline</li>
<li>VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch</li>
<li>VK_NV_ray_tracing</li>
<li>VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur</li>
<li>VK_NVX_binary_import</li>
<li>VK_NVX_image_view_handle</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow use of the "--add-this-kernel" feature by non-root users.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a more accurate progress bar when building the kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a warning message if a Vulkan ICD loader is not detected.</li>
<li>Reworked nvidia-installer's support for DKMS: the kernel modules will now be optionally registered with DKMS after the installer has already built and installed them on its own. nvidia-installer will now register the kernel modules with DKMS by default when the dkms(8) utility is detected on the system.</li>
<li>Added a new CUDA Debugger implementation for Pascal and newer architectures as a part of the driver package: libcudadebugger.so (previously released separately as "CUDA GDB Developer Preview").</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Fixes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption in geometry and tessellation control shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs when starting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crash with Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Roguelike tactical auto-battler Despot&#39;s Game: Dystopian Army Builder is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despot's Game: Dystopian Army Builder has now left Early Access along with Native Linux support, this roguelike tactical auto-battler is certainly unique.</p>
<p>It sees you run through various rooms in different levels of a dungeon, commanding an army of little pink fleshy people you equip with all sorts of random items. Turn your people into swordsman, wizards, healers, give them damage-soaking refrigerators, yoga pants, stale pretzels and more.</p>
<p>As you go through the dungeons you will come up against hordes of aliens, robots, demons and other monstrosities. Thankfully you have a lot of people and weapons at your disposal. Not only are you building up an army, but you also want to build up combinations by equipping people with a similar class to unlock special ability levels too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hM6USMrRFAo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/179336d350032d4ed46a0d1b6d4f34fd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hM6USMrRFAo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You're also picking special mutations for your team as you progress too that you collect from certain rooms, allowing you to have special buffs like special abilities being more likely to trigger, or returning a certain percentage of damage back to enemies and lots more. You also get a list of mutations you can buy and level up as you progress too, allowing you truly create a ridiculously powerful team.</p>
<p>It's an auto-battler, so while you're the one building up a team and moving your people around, you don't control them during battle. You get to pick their positions, or you can get the game to position them for you, but when the battles start it's a hands-off approach as you watch to see who wins.</p>
<p>There's different game modes too. The traditional mode has you go from room to room until you reach the end, while the King of the Hill mode sees you take on other players. Although, lots of the mini-modes available need you to play more of the game to unlock them.</p>
<p>“Despot’s Game is a culmination of all our team's hard work, shared experiences, and dedication,” said Nikolay Kuznetsov, Game Creator, Konfa Games. “We are extremely excited to share our unique idea fully realized, especially after garnering so much positive feedback.”</p>
<p>Overall, I like it a lot. Doesn't need fast reflexes, allows you to sit back and relax with it as you come up with a good strategy moving your people around and equipping them weird some really weird combinations. Easy to pick up and learn, while difficult later on to build up a good team that needs some thought put into it. If you want a game the blends dungeon crawling, strategy and auto-battles it's a good choice.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/despots-game?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227280/Despots_Game_Dystopian_Battle_Simulator/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. Currently the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/despots_game_dystopian_army_builder" target="_blank">GOG</a> version is not released.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You need the data files to play it so buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it running on Linux is nice and simple too since they offer an official AppImage and there's also a Flatpak available via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.openrct2.OpenRCT2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>A Robot Named Fight! source code released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of a nicely reviewed metroidvania called A Robot Named Fight! has released the source code, hoping that others can learn from it.</p>
<p>Currently though, it's not fully open source as they have it under their own license but they made it clear they're <a href="https://github.com/BartMartner/OpenARNF/issues/1#issuecomment-1268745170" target="_blank">considering</a> putting it under something like the GPL if they can. It also uses the Unity game engine, so it still relies on a proprietary game engine but it's still a good step and nice to see more developers consider open source.</p>

      <title>A lot of people were clearly waiting on the official Steam Deck Docking Station</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now that the Steam Deck is available <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">without reservation</a>, and the official Steam Deck Docking Station has released, it appears a lot of people were waiting on Valve for docking.</p>
<p>As of writing this, on the Global Top Sellers list, the Steam Deck Docking Station is currently at number 5, showing that quite a lot of people are buying it when you take into account that it's up against big hitters like FIFA 23 (and the price difference there is reasonably small too).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3185217981665573809gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3185217981665573809gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Only a few days ago, it was sat at the number 2 spot so while it's not selling as much a few days later, it's clearly holding some ground so a lot of people are buying it.</p>
<p>My own official Steam Deck Docking Station should arrive Friday, so I'll be letting you know when I think about it during next week after I've had some quality time with it.</p>
<p>Have you picked one up or are you going with something like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler</a>?</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Boot Videos get an easy app, plus videos coming to the Points Shop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/theres-now-a-dedicated-website-for-steam-deck-boot-videos/" target="_blank">Recently I mentioned</a> the new Steam Deck Repo website, allowing people to upload and download custom Steam Deck Boot Videos, well now there's an <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.steamdeckrepo.manager" target="_blank">easy to use app</a> (<a href="https://github.com/CapitaineJSparrow/steam-repo-manager" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) to go along with it.</p>
<p>This makes grabbing videos quicker and easier than ever. It's only just released so the Steam Deck Repo Manager app is limited but a perfect start to stop users having to make folders, and move files around manually. It also goes to show how fun and exciting the Steam Deck modding scene is, with new things appearing all the time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D-cl72fhfZk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee6c64a41f00bf69c7085b5116dacc7f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D-cl72fhfZk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally, according to xpaw from SteamDB on <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1580102765531258880/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Steam Deck Boot Videos will be coming to the Steam Points Shop. They track lots of changes happening to the Steam Client, with new language strings appearing in an update clearly showing it's in Valve's plans. Looking on <a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/commit/aafcb45f7dfec2b149817974fa3f972f899558d7" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, you can clearly see what they're doing. Some of the new strings include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>"Redeem_Equip_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "You can select your Startup Movie by going to Settings =&gt; Customization on your Steam Deck."</li>
<li>"ShopPageTitle_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "Steam Deck Startup Movies"</li>
<li>"Redeem_UsePoints_SteamDeckStartupMovie": "Use your Steam Points to get this Steam Deck Startup Movie. You can set this movie to play when your Steam Deck starts up."</li>
</ul>

      <title>KDE Plasma 5.26 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The KDE team have done it again! Giving us a fresh new Plasma desktop with plenty of upgrades and <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.26.0/" target="_blank">Plasma 5.26</a> is out now.</p>
<p>KDE say it's "All About the Widgets" and they're not wrong. When it comes to Widgets, they're referring to almost everything you see around the main Plasma desktop from what you add directly to the desktop, to the various icons and features on the bottom Plasma panel. With this release, you can now even resize those from the Plasma panel too which is quite a useful change.</p>
<p>Lots of Widgets saw upgrades too like the Dictionary allowing more than one dictionary definition or translation, the Sticky notes, User switcher and Media Player were all given new features too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mRNe8llSQ1g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b409588905a58805aeb64e6f19b32a7e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mRNe8llSQ1g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The 5.26 release also brings in officially the Plasma Big Screen mode, designed for use as the name suggests, on a big screen like a TV giving you a much better interface to use.</p>
<p>This also comes with it's own media player just for it called Plank Player. It even supports navigation with a remote, perfect for use on the sofa.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7659544191665494008gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7659544191665494008gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of focus on spit and polish with this release too. Their support of Wayland continues to improve, wallpapers change between light and dark themes to match, an option for changing the screen colouring for both night and day, a lot of bugs are also being fixed up as part of their "15-minute bugs" project so expect a more stable experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/changelogs/plasma/5/5.25.5-5.26.0/" target="_blank">list of improvements</a> goes a very long way down and it seems the Discover software store saw a rather large amount of fixes and improvements like multiple Flatpak updates, and actually inhibiting suspend while doing updates so you're not left with a broken system — quite an important one that. There's even a share button to properly direct people to apps inside Discover, nice! The numerous Flatpak upgrades will be very welcome for Steam Deck users, whenever Valve decides to upgrade it in SteamOS.</p>
<p>Also, in case you missed it, <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">KDE devs talk Steam Deck</a> and their work for it at Akademy 2022.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kona II: Brume is the follow-up to 2017's Kona from Parabole / Ravenscourt bringing another cold and mysterious adventure to walk through.</p>
<p><em>"Northern Québec, 1970. A bizarre mist - the Brume - is disconnecting a rural mining village from its quiet reality and disrupting the balance of nature. But where is it coming from? Step back into the role of Detective Carl Faubert and dive deeper into the surreal mysteries of Kona. Make your trek through the snowy landscapes of Northern Canada and discover that you are not entirely alone. Find other stranded people - both victims and survivors of a devastating avalanche - and uncover the hidden dark truth of the Brume."</em></p>
<p>Just recently the developers announced a new updated demo, which has Native Linux support and they're ensuring it runs well on both desktop and Steam Deck directly. The full release will also be coming with full Linux support, so it's another to keep an eye on. Check out the trailer below from the recent announcement:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explore</strong> - Explore the vast fictive land of Manastan in Northern Canada and fight your way through the village  - or what's left of it. Search for clues in wooden shacks, visit nearby locations on your trusty dog sled and navigate the surrounding lakes.</li>

      <title>VirtualBox 7.0 is out with their DirectX 11 support using DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this was an interesting one entering the GOL inbox recently. VirtualBox, the general-purpose full virtualizer has a big new release out and even they are now using DXVK.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> is the Vulkan-based implementation of D3D9, D3D10 and D3D11 for Linux / Wine that's used in Proton. There's also <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>, designed for running apps and games that have Linux Native builds (like VirtualBox itself in this case). It's quite incredible to see how this amazing open source tech is being used in more places, just goes to show how essential and performant it has become.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in VirtualBox 7.0 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Virtual machines can be fully encrypted now, including the VM config logs and saved states (CLI only for now).</li>
<li>GUI: Added a new utility similar to "top" or "resource monitor" which lists peformance statistics (CPU usage, RAM usage, disk I/O rate, etc.) of running guests.</li>
<li>GUI: Improved theme support on all platforms. Linux and macOS use native engine while for Windows host it is separately implemented.</li>
<li>Audio: Added "default" host driver type to make it possible to move VMs (appliances) between different platforms without the need of changing the audio driver explicitly. When the "default" driver is selected, the best audio backend option for a platform will be used. This is the default for newly created VMs.</li>
<li>Linux Guest Additions: Reworked guest screen re-size functionality, added basic integration with some of guest Desktop Environments.</li>
<li>Devices: Implemented new 3D support based on DirectX 11 (and DXVK on non Windows hosts).</li>
<li>EFI: Added support for Secure Boot.</li>
<li>GUI: Improving mouse handling in multi-monitor case on X11 platform.</li>
<li>Devices: Added virtual IOMMU devices (Intel and AMD variant).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus quite a lot more you can see on <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Changelog-7.0" target="_blank">the official site</a>, they've been busy.</p>

      <title>Fanatical running an awesome &#39;Dollar Collections&#39; sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time to get some more really cheap games, as Fanatical have launched their <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100721639-13797872?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fcollections%2Fdollar-collections" target="_blank">Dollar Collections sale</a> and there's plenty of good choices in there to get you through the upcoming cold winter nights.</p>
<p>As the name suggests it means you can grab game bundles for $1 / £1 and plenty of them work on Linux and Steam Deck quite nicely too with a number of Steam Deck Verified / Playable games. The majority of them in this case would be run with Proton.</p>
<p>Here's what they have to pick from:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Walking Dead Season 1 &amp; 2 Complete Pack</li>
<li>Deponia Full Scrap Collection</li>
<li>Leisure Suit Larry Wet Dreams Double Pack</li>
<li>Commandos Collection Pack</li>
<li>Dungeons 2 - Complete Edition</li>
<li>Men of War: Collector Pack</li>
<li>Tropico 4 Collectors Bundle</li>
<li>POSTAL Paradise Pack</li>
<li>Sudden Strike Trilogy</li>
<li>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 1 &amp; 2!! Double Pack</li>
<li>Tropico 3: Gold Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly that The Walking Dead Season 1 &amp; 2 Complete Pack is a complete ridiculous steal for such a price. Don't miss out on that one. It even pushed me to finally pick it up to see what all the fuss is about as a fan of the TV series.</p>

      <title>The upgraded ivoler Steam Deck Docking Station is another good choice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Don't fancy buying from JSAUX and don't need the charger + extra expense of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">official Steam Deck Docking Station</a>? ivoler are another good choice.</p>
<p>They sent over their newer refreshed model, which has an aluminum casing compared with their original plastic one. It also now has gigabit ethernet, with the previous model not having ethernet at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15992466731665482944gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>The upgraded <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">JSAUX Docking Station is great</a>, however the ethernet sticking out of the side really does annoy me. Here with ivoler, that's not a problem since it sits nicely at the back so I can position it around my desk or TV unit a lot easier. Honestly, that one change alone makes me like it ever so slightly more than the JSAUX offering. ivoler's choice design here just helps keep all the wires out of sight and out of mind.</p>
<p>Not the only major difference though. In terms of bulk, the ivoler version is slimmer and honestly just looks better but it is <em>slightly</em> longer but not by an amount that really makes any difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12942880241665483071gol1.jpeg"/><em>ivoler bottom, JSAUX top.</em></p>
<p>One other difference here and another improvement, is that the ivoler dock blocks none of the air intake on the back of the Steam Deck which JSAUX do. It's never been a problem for me with JSAUX as the intake pulls air in just fine but having the entire thing uncovered is obviously best and so ivoler wins again here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20396630201665483382gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>From the official specs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

USB-C power delivery port support 90W, which supports fast charging for steam deck and most mobile devices, also compatible with iPads and Android phones with USB-C ports. [❗Note: Charger, HDMI cable, not included.]</li>
<li>[4K@60Hz HDMI Output] The Steam Deck dock stand comes with a 4K@60Hz HDMI 2.0 output. Advanced built-in chips, plug and play, supports HDCP 1.4 to play protected content from iTunes / Netflix / DirectTV etc. When you connect an external 4K monitor (1080P), it can provide you sharper and smoother visual experience, so you can enjoy the visual feast on your games.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard to say a whole lot about it without needlessly padding the article here. It's a Steam Deck Docking Station with a good price, good features and it just works.</p>
<p>I can happily recommend this one if you're after a Steam Deck Dock that works well, doesn't cost a fortune and has a good design as well. A no-frills Docking Station that just gets the job done and stays out of your way, what more could you want? You really can't go wrong with this and it quickly replaced the JSAUX dock on my own desk.</p>
<p>On pricing without discounts, it's the same as the upgraded JSAUX version at £49.99 / $49.99.</p>
<p>You can buy it easily on Amazon:</p>

      <title>Decky Loader, get easy Steam Deck Plugins and make colours POP!</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Did you know you can extend the Steam Deck with various plugins? I’m going to show you how to do it, and some of what’s available using <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a>. This was mentioned by me <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/steamos-plugin-manager-should-enable-lots-of-fun-on-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">some time ago</a> but it has come a very long way since then.</p>
<p>This allows you to browse, download and install plugins for the Steam Deck with an interface built into the Quick Access Menu (the three dot button on Steam Deck). In my video below, I'll show how to install it and demo a few of the plugins, with vibrantDeck being something quite amazing, at least to my eyes but it is not something everyone will like. The screen on the Deck really does look quite dull without using it now.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YQhvNiI3hKI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd93ae009c399252cc75e9e90d568082.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YQhvNiI3hKI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text Guide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the Steam Deck Settings.</li>
<li>Under System -&gt; System Settings toggle <code class="inline-code">Enable Developer Mode</code></li>
<li>Scroll the sidebar all the way down and click on <code class="inline-code">Developer</code></li>
<li>Under Miscellaneous, enable <code class="inline-code">CEF Remote Debugging</code></li>
<li>Confirm dialog and wait for system reboot</li>
<li>Click on the <code class="inline-code">STEAM</code> button and select <code class="inline-code">Power</code> -&gt; <code class="inline-code">Switch to Desktop</code></li>
<li>Make sure you have a password set with the "passwd" command in terminal to install it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vOMYGj22rQ" target="_blank">YouTube Guide</a>).<br/>
<em>It won't show a password being entered as a security measure but it is working.</em></li>
<li>Open a terminal ("Konsole" is the pre-installed terminal application) and paste the following command into it:
	<ul>
<li>For the latest release (recommended for all users):
		<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">curl -L https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader/raw/main/dist/install_release.sh | sh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After that you can just boot into Gaming Mode, and the plugin menu will be available in the Quick Access Menu as shown in the video above. You can also turn off Developer Mode once it's installed, as I tested it working just fine.</p>

      <title>The new Steam Mobile App is getting close to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A few updates later while in Beta and Valve has put out the first Release Candidate for their completely overhauled <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamMobileApp" target="_blank">Steam Mobile App</a>. Having a Release Candidate means they're very close to releasing it for everyone, it just needs a bit more testing to see if any urgent issues appear.</p>
<p>What's they've added recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved messaging when asking for camera permissions.</li>
<li>Fixed pull to refresh in the Library screen not refreshing everything.</li>
<li>Improved loading states in the Library screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when opening links externally.</li>
<li>Improved behavior of how the app attempts to open non-Steam links in your default device browser.</li>
<li>Fixed the ability to send multiple "Verify Code" actions when migrating / adding an authenticator, which would end up loading to failures.</li>
<li>Updated wishlist notifications to open up directly to the wishlisted app page rather than taking you to the wishlist.</li>
<li>Fix web content sometimes not refreshing properly when attempting to reload the same page multiple times.</li>
<li>Fixed some non-English languages not always correctly displaying numbers with decimal places.</li>
<li>Improved the reliability of sign in confirmation dialogs appearing.</li>
<li>Fixed case for certain users where approving a sign in confirmation would have no effect.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you wish to try it out before release:</p>
<p><strong>Android</strong></p>
<p>Open <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.valvesoftware.android.steam.community" target="_blank">this link</a> on your Android device. The Google Play store will offer you a link to join the beta and download the updated app.</p>
<p><strong>iOS</strong></p>
<p>Open <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/8BOPXsGz" target="_blank">this link</a> on your iOS device. You'll be prompted to install Apple's own TestFlight app. Once TestFlight is installed, it will automatically install the updated Steam Mobile App. Note: spaces on iOS are limited.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-37 is out now fixing up more games for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> (also known as Proton GE) as a community-built version of the Proton compatibility layer to run Windows games, with a new release out now and FSR is back.</p>
<p>Versions 7-37 and 7-36 were released, initially removing AMD FSR being in it directly, but thankfully another community hacker sorted out the patches needed for it so it made a return.</p>
<p>Here's what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Import nvapi enablement list from proton upstream (<a class="commit-link" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/commit/9a708e02c18ea53386dddd13e7e1ae5c78615965" target="_blank">ValveSoftware@<tt>9a708e0</tt></a>)</li>
<li>Import media-converter changes from proton upstream (<a class="commit-link" href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/commit/5339633f9b5e32eae24d43e4572792ba6791220d" target="_blank">ValveSoftware@<tt>5339633</tt></a>)</li>
<li>Update dxvk</li>
<li>Update vkd3d-proton</li>
<li>Update wine-bleeding edge</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Shatterline (thanks orowith2os)</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Halo Reach mod tools (thanks orowith2os)</li>
<li>Add protonfix for Ougon Musoukyoku (thanks namaenonaimumei)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This version is not included in Steam or Steam Deck, with you needing to add it yourself. It often includes fixes Valve hasn't yet done officially, and some things they can't (legally) do for videos. It does come with less quality assurance and testing though, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>How to use it? You can simply use the ProtonUp-Qt tool that we've covered here numerous times now. See the previous <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">GOL Guide on GE-Proton with ProtonUp</a>. </p>

      <title>There&#39;s now a dedicated website for Steam Deck boot videos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since Valve have made it official in the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steamos-332-and-a-stable-steam-deck-client-update-are-out-now-heres-whats-new/" target="_blank">Steam Deck stable update</a> to change your boot video, reddit user waylaidwanderer <a href="https://steamdeckrepo.com/" target="_blank">made a website</a> where you can easily upload and download these quick clips.</p>
<p>A nice idea, and certainly makes finding one you want a little easier. Useful too, since you can preview the video before you download to see if you will like them. It also includes dedicated instructions below each video, telling you exactly what you need to do to get it working which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Here's a look over some of the boot videos available and a reminder on how to do it:</p>

      <title>My current little wish-list for Steam Deck upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Steam Deck has been out for a while, it's now easy to purchase <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">with no reservation queue</a>, and the long-delayed Steam Deck Docking Station is also here!  Valve has put out a lot of updates but there's plenty they could improve. Honestly, it's vastly different to how it felt at release.</p>
<p>After thinking on it for some time, plus gathering some inspiration from people in our <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">Discord</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, here's a current quick list of items I would like to see that i think would just make the Steam Deck better overall. All of these I think are perfectly doable. Obviously there's plenty i want from a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 2 which is basically confirmed</a> but what about for now through software updates?</p>
<p>Here's my little list:</p>
<p>A more customizable Home Screen. Let me put collections here, let me move things around and make it more "mine".</p>
<p>Customize the performance overlay. I already know it's possible because it uses MangoHud, which itself has plenty of things you can tweak on desktop Linux and it can be moved to different parts of the screen. The current monitor is great with the different levels you can switch to but let us move it to a different position at the very least, it covers up the UI on a lot of games in the top left.</p>
<p>Downloads with the <em>screen</em> off. The screen itself likely eats a fair amount of battery life, so it sure would be nice if we could have the screen off while downloads continue right? Maybe an option we can turn toggle for the power button to turn the screen off on one tap, with a double-tap being suspend? There's probably better ways to do it but it would be a real nice to have option. I know it's probably not possible to do downloads while suspended like other consoles do due to technical limitations, but that would be one for the Steam Deck 2 and so this feels like a nice small compromise.</p>
<p>More "official" apps that can be installed easily in Gaming Mode in the Non-Steam section of the Library. We know Valve can do it, they did it with Chrome. Let's get more in here! Netflix, Spotify and many more direct-apps. A proper music player would be great here too for your local collection.</p>
<p>Options to deal with the Shader Cache. Not only can it get rather large, being a problem for the 64GB model, it's also confusing for new users. There's posts on it constantly with people confused what's eating their drive space. Clean up the language on it, make it more visible for each game. Let people move it too.</p>
<p>Let us move the on-screen keyboard in Desktop Mode. A properly compact version would be great too, it just takes up far too much space.</p>
<p>More regular upgrades to the Plasma Desktop. It's pretty far behind right now, and likely will be again after the next major update drops. The KDE team put a huge amount of effort into upgrading the desktop experience, we should want in on that.</p>
<p>Steam Controller 2. I don't need to say any more do I? Well, the Docking Station is out now, there's many third-party docks and lots of people will be hooking up to a TV. Give us a good official controller!</p>
<p>Let us pick what the Deck boots into between Gaming Mode and Desktop Mode. I'm sure most people use it in Gaming Mode but the option for those of us using it often like a PC or keeping it docked, it could be really useful.</p>
<p>Even more attention on Deck Verified. It's good the system exists but it's far from perfect. Paladins, for example, is still listed as Steam Deck Playable, despite the anti-cheat breaking it quite a long time ago. How are things like this not picked up? Trust in Deck Verified is essential.</p>
<p>I'm sure you all have your own wishlist too. Let me know what you want to see in the comments.</p>

      <title>JSAUX wasted no time with a new Steam Deck Docking Station with DisplayPort</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Find the new official Steam Deck Docking Station too expensive? Perhaps you might like to take another look at JSAUX, as they've announced <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">another</a> upgraded Docking Station.</p>
<p>Blimey, they need to slow down a bit. I already have their previous normal Docking Stations, which I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-need-to-wait-on-valve-the-steam-deck-docking-station-from-jsaux-is-great/" target="_blank">reviewed and found to be excellent</a>. Plus, I have the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/jsaux-announce-their-new-steam-deck-dock-with-an-m2-ssd-slot/" target="_blank">Docking Station with an M.2 SSD</a> slot here ready to review (delayed due to sickness on my end).</p>
<p>Now they've launched the Docking Station "HB0702", which brings with it DisplayPort 1.2 so it can more directly compete with Valve.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14719509131665223004gol1.jpg"/></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>7-in-1 Docking Station for Steam Deck. Equipped with an HDMI 4K@60Hz output, a Gigabit LAN Ethernet input, a USB-C port for charging, three USB-A 3.1 ports, and a DP port, letting you explore a new way to play with Steam Deck.</li>
<li>It comes with a 4K@60Hz / 2K@120Hz HDMI 2.0 output When it's connected to an external 4K monitor, it provides a sharper and smoother visual experience, so you can enjoy the visual feast on your games.</li>
<li>Full charging speed for your Steam Deck. The JSAUX Steam Deck docking station supports 100W max. power delivery, which is enough power to charge your Steam Deck at full speed (45W) when paired with the original charger.</li>
<li>The JSAUX all-in-1 Steam Deck docking station blends hub and stands together perfectly, so you can keep your desktop neat and organized.</li>
<li>Support DP1.2, simultaneous connection of HDMI and DP port, two monitors can output 4K@60Hz at the same time, expand the screen and enjoy the ultimate gaming experience.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The main difference here is the DisplayPort 1.2 addition and an extra $10 to the order price making it $59.99 (no charger included). You can <a href="https://www.jsaux.com/products/docking-station-for-steam-deck-hb0702" target="_blank">order it direct</a> but they also told me to expect it on Amazon in early to mid November like their previous dock.</p>
<p><em>I've been told one is being sent over to GOL for me to take a look.</em></p>

      <title>A few more picks from Steam Next Fest</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest</a> is in full swing, and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/steam-next-fest-october-2022-edition-is-live-now/" target="_blank">earlier this week</a> we put out some recommendations. Here are a few more games that run great via Proton on Linux to take a look at this month: Cosmoteer, Dredge, and Potionomics.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Cosmoteer</h5>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/799600/Cosmoteer_Starship_Architect__Commander/" target="_blank">Cosmoteer</a> is an open world spaceship constructor sandbox where you build a ship piece by piece then adventure about the galaxy to perform your usual slate of space jobs like mining, bounty hunting, and trading. This is my number one find from the Next Fest so far, and I've already had a lot of fun with it. It reminds me of playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies/" target="_blank">Space Pirates and Zombies</a> for the first time way back in 2011, but more relevant references for the gameplay would be <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/" target="_blank">Star Sector</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/335620/Star_Traders_Frontiers/" target="_blank">Star Trader: Frontiers</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/383840/Nimbatus__The_Space_Drone_Constructor/" target="_blank">Nimbatus</a>. The core mechanics for a fantastic game all are here without even touching on building a fleet or multiplayer, both of which will be included in the Early Access.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZwgC3-AeDOo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/517a2f2342c49a421728816976165745.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZwgC3-AeDOo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><small>A quick look at Cosmoteer</small></p>
<p>The demo does have a vicious performance bug on Proton but thankfully it's solved by changing your launch command to <code class="inline-code">%command% --cores 1</code>. Cosmoteer releases into Early Access at the end of October.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Dredge</h5>
<p>For you fishing minigame aficionados, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562430/DREDGE/" target="_blank">Dredge</a> is an exploration fishing game with a distinct style. I went in blind thinking it would be a cute time waster, so imagine my surprise in discovering Dredge appears instead to be a Lovecraftian horror game with fishing mechanics. The core loop is innocent enough: you undock from the village you start in and spend the day fishing and exploring the bay before selling your catch to upgrade your boat. It's not long, however, before the game reveals its horror aspirations - fishing in the dark raises your stress (think <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/304650/SUNLESS_SEA/" target="_blank">Sunless Sea</a>), fish rot in your hold with unidentified disease, and pretty soon you start catching full-on Eldrich abominations in your fishing nets. It's also not clear what happened to the bay's previous fisherman. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><small><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9205836341665165604gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9205836341665165604gol1142.jpg"/></a>Dredge definitely sets a tone</small></p>
<p>Give this one bonus points if you enjoy 'inventory Tetris', as you can fiddle with your cargo to maximize the size of your haul. The deceptively cute graphics and simple gameplay paired with a darkening story and some grotesque 2D art made for an enjoyable state of discombobulation, and I'm curious how heavily the full game will lean into its horror elements.  Dredge ran flawlessly for me via Proton and there's a good couple hours of content in the demo. It's slated for a 2023 release.</p>
<hr/>
<h5>Potionomics</h5>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1874490/Potionomics/" target="_blank">Potionomics</a> you create and sell potions from a potion shop you inherit from your deceased uncle. Think the relationship-building <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">Stardew Valley</a> meets the sales part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/" target="_blank">Moonlighter</a>. The game looks and performs fantastic via Proton, and there's a fun card game for the haggling process. The character design is, frankly, spectacular, and there's a fun mechanic whereby improving your relationship with characters via conversations/dates earns you new cards to use in the haggling minigame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><small><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19934541101665165833gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19934541101665165833gol1142.jpg"/></a>Selling a potion to Quinn, the village witch/hustler</small></p>
<p>There's far too much going on to call Potionomics a dating sim, but from the demo my guess is that building relationships will be the primary focus of the game rather than the shop simulation. One caveat here is that the demo is quite short (less than an hour) and has a lot of tutorialization, so it's hard to know how well the final product will come together. Potionomics releases on October 17, so we don't have long to wait before 'shipping for our protagonist and the the Public Relations Moth from the cover of this article.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's impossible to keep on top of everything with Steam Next Fest, so if anyone has dredged (sorry) the depths and come up with something special I'm curious to hear about it.</p>

      <title>The Undead are invading Prison Architect in the next expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Prison Architect - Undead is the next expansion to the building and management sim, with things about to get spooky.</p>
<p>With it comes a new Graveyard Quick Room to make your compound a bit more spooky, however that comes with a legion of undead you need to deal with. Sounds like a bad idea to me. Prisoners can become infected, increasing the size of the horde and you need to find a way to deal with it all effectively. Call in bounty hunters, or turn everything into a weapon and deal with it yourself.</p>
<p>“Just in time for spooky season, Undead adds a mix of survival and horror to Prison Architect that will put Wardens’ management skills to the test,” says Gaz Wright, Game Director on Prison Architect at Double Eleven. “Grappling with the task of survival is no easy feat, as it introduces an extra layer of complexity and pressure to management gameplay. We hope our community will enjoy Undead just as much as we enjoyed creating it!”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Fm329o8wYtU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4e5c395d51e156e2786fa174320bcde6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Fm329o8wYtU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Welcome the Graveyard - This brand new Quick Room satisfies your inmates’ needs for Freedom and Comfort, making them feel calmer for 12 hours. Be mindful when you add gravestones though, as they will easily interrupt this peaceful atmosphere…</li>
<li>The Rise of the Dead - In Undead, no one is safe. And there are many ways to become Infected. One inmate can get sick, some others can be bitten by an unfriendly undead, or again a bunch of infected inmates can rise (aka spawn) directly from the Graveyard. Wardens have no power over the Infected units, they will move and act independently in the prison until stopped. Inmates and guards can try and fight them off, but if they fail, they will join the deadly bunch!</li>
<li>Who You Gonna Call? Bounty Hunters! When things go south (because they will) and your prison can’t hold off the outbreak, call the Bounty Hunter Emergency Service: tough, trained bounty hunters will join your fight against the undead.</li>
<li>New Traps, Techniques, and Weapons - Desperate Times Call for Desperate (and creative) measures. Use Zombie chum to lure the undead, build a walled-off area and lock them inside, or steal that glorious chainsaw you’ve been eyeing for a while: everything is allowed to fight off the horde.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Prison Architect - Undead releases on October 11th.</p>

      <title>Facepunch put out a fresh statement on Rust for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/rust-for-steam-deck-linux-still-some-time-away/" target="_blank">I recently wrote</a> about how it's looking pretty unlikely that Rust will actually be supported on Steam Deck / Linux with Proton, and it's not looking any better right now.</p>
<p>Previously it was just comments from Facepunch Studios' Garry Newman on Twitter, with Newman trying to explain their thoughts on why it hasn't happened yet. Now, we have another and perhaps a bit more public / official answer with their latest official <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/news/the-lumberjack#EACandProton" target="_blank">news post</a> on the Rust website including a note at the bottom about it from Alistair McFarlane, the Producer at Facepunch, that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know, we switched to EAC's new platform with the intention of providing support for the Steam Deck, and so far we haven't done that. So when is it coming?</p>
<p>Well, short answer is we don't know. We don't know if it is. When we discontinued linux support in 2019, one of the core reasons was how the cheating community was exploiting the Linux platform. That's not to say that cheating was super widespread on Linux, but it was safer for cheat developers. And that's not good in a game like Rust where a cheater can ruin weeks of hard work.</p>
<p>Enabling proton support would mean we're asking the EAC team to provide support for a whole other platform, which we fear would reduce their ability to support Windows - our main platform. We don't know whether we should enable one platform at the disadvantage of another.</p>
<p>The one thing we don't want to do is to enable Proton support to only discontinue it six months later. We don't want to encourage players to spend their money on a Deck to play Rust and then be in a position where we want to take that ability away.</p>
<p>For now, we're still weighing up the risks and will continue to explore options with EAC. Don't expect to see Proton support in the near future, but we hope to have it enabled someday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's basically the same story as what Newman explained. They don't wish to potentially open up Rust to more cheat developers again, where they don't seem to feel confident that EAC would be able to keep up with it on top of preventing the cheats on Windows too (which is obviously the main platform).</p>
<p>It is a genuine shame, since Rust is (while quite brutal) a great survival game and very popular. It's also interesting, because clearly they think that EAC don't provide all that great protection on Linux if they're that worried about what would happen again. While again, other games like Apex have it, they're very different games.</p>

      <title>The latest Godot Engine showreel is an impressive look at upcoming games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Every now and then the developers of <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, a cross-platform free and open source game engine, put together a showreel of what's made with it.</p>
<p>A new one is out now, and it really shows a nice diverse selection of games being created with it. Not only is it a great look at some existing and upcoming games but it's also a nice advert for what Godot can do. Hopefully over time even more developers will use it since it has fantastic Linux support, and no fees.</p>
<p>Here's the desktop / console Godot Engine showreel:</p>

      <title>No more Steam Deck reservation queue — buy it now, plus Docking Station available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is finally here. Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3276955672625890260" target="_blank">removed</a> the reservation queue for the Steam Deck, so you can buy it right now. Additionally, the Steam Deck Docking Station is also now available.</p>
<p>We've been seeing reports a lot recently about people being able to reserve a Steam Deck, and get an email within a week or even a few days. So the end of the reservation queue was very much expected. This is great news though, as hopefully people who were sitting on the fence will now just jump right in and order. Some might perhaps jump back to a queue, if they do get overwhelmed by orders though.</p>
<p>Along with the news, Valve revamped the <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/" target="_blank">Steam Deck website</a> as well, with a little celebration video of a Steam Deck with fireworks along with the prominent note on the Docking Station too.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Steam Deck comes in three editions: 64GB, 256GB and 512GB. The two bigger storage models have faster SSDs, and the top-end model has an anti-glare etched glass screen.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aRnZrSBK3R4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d10c59c6ff21ef778905b157099f3807.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aRnZrSBK3R4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Note: the original copy of the above video, featured the Nintendo Switch emulator Yuzu in an apparent woops by Valve. They re-uploaded to remove it.</em></p>
<p>Since it's now much more readily available. Do you think there will be another surge in purchases? It's quite likely — I think there will be. We also had news recently from a KDE developer, that Valve had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">crossed the one million mark</a> in Steam Deck shipments. So things are going very well for Valve's latest hardware entry.</p>
<p>For the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeckdock" target="_blank">Docking Station</a>, it also has a brand new flashy looking official page, which mentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck™ Docking Station is designed to add extensibility to your gaming setup. Whether connecting your Steam Deck to your living room TV, setting up on your work desk, or charging on your night stand, the Dock is perfect for extending the places and ways you can use your Steam Deck.<br/>
<br/>
Not too big or too small, Docking Station is exactly the right size and shape to hold Steam Deck securely. From the right angle USB-C connector at exactly the right length, to the molded rubber seat to ensure there’s no scratching, the Dock was made for Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Priced at £79 / $89 / €99, it's perhaps a little steep when compared with a number of readily available high-quality third-party docks on the market, however you can't really beat the first-party support we've come to see from Valve. Here's the main Steam Deck Docking Station Specifications: 3 x USB-A 3.1 Gen1 Ports, Gigabit Ethernet, 1 x DisplayPort 1.4, 1 x  HDMI 2.0, USB-C Power Delivery passthrough input (power supply included) and a 6" USB-C captive cable with low profile 90° connector to connect to the Deck.</p>
<p>Valve also posted a <a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1578117908445933568" target="_blank">Tweet</a> to clarify some details in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>MST (multi-stream transport), enabling multi-monitor support.</li>
<li>DisplayPort 1.4 + HDMI, supports up to 1440p 120 hz, or 4k 60 hz.</li>
<li>FreeSync support • Easy firmware updates via Steam Deck.</li>
<li>45W Type C power supply.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5221147841665079324gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5221147841665079324gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Their Docking Station will get upgrades too, and they said it might need a firmware update out of the box but updates will happen as easily as plugging your Deck in and following the instructions. When it comes to compatibility, Valve do include a note in the Docking Station FAQ you should be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="bbcodes_Italic_3PSCE BB_Italic">Note: There is a known compatibility bug that we're still chasing down. With some LG displays, when the Docking Station is connected via HDMI, sleep / wake can result in visual noise. Another sleep/wake cycle or unplug/plug of the dock cable solves it. We're actively working on fixing this bug and there will be a software update once it's resolved.</div>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I've got the official Docking Station ordered now, so I'll let you know what I think when it arrives.</em></p>
<p>All good news for Linux Gaming as a whole too, since so much of what goes into the Steam Deck helps Linux as a platform. It's also my own personal choice on where to play my games now, because it's just so convenient.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, another big SteamOS and Steam Deck Stable Client update went live as well. Here's a look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gv2-9Kah_Ig"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0186ef8852930f57071acee2c046d52b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gv2-9Kah_Ig" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Finally, I’ll end this with a plea to Valve. Please make a new Steam Controller. Don’t make me beg. You've clearly learned a lot with the Deck, I bet a Steam Controller 2 would be awesome. Do it.</p>

      <title>Cassette Beasts is a wonderful take on monster catching</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It needs to hurry up and be 2023 so I can play the full game of Cassette Beasts, an upcoming monster catching / creature collection game from Bytten Studio and RawFury. Coming with full Native Linux support built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>, it's easily one of my biggest highlights from the ongoing Steam Next Fest, where it has a rather great demo available to play right now.</p>
<p>Playing this, I felt a little like a kid again, bringing back some really fond memories of the early Pokemon games. The great twist here is that you're pretty much making a bootleg copy of the creatures you encounter, using retro cassette tapes. Ah, memories coming flashing back of recording off the radio onto tape when I was younger. Heck, the game even has special bootleg creatures to find too!</p>
<p>Here's a little footage for you:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nvFFfKUJhTo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/875254250d2595ad25f9e5bc00ba08da.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nvFFfKUJhTo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really quite fantastic. Can't wait to see more of this and fuse various creatures together to form some kind of completely unholy thing that can take down anyone. You really don't want to miss out on trying this.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?!</strong><br/>
	Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li><strong>Fuse monster forms!</strong><br/>
	Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li><strong>Explore a rich open world</strong><br/>
	Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li><strong>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions</strong><br/>
	Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li><strong>Master a deep battle system</strong><br/>
	Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dead Cells now has a Boss Rush mode if you like pain</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love pain? Want to make your life difficult? Good news for you then as Dead Cells now has a fresh upgrade out with a Boss Rush mode so you can sweat against the toughest.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, it lets you fight the various bigger creatures in the game. To access it there's a basement door in the Prisoner's Quarters, where you can also access the Training Room and the Tailor. Just keep going until the third door with the red boss head and go inside. This will give you another 4 doors for 4 different stages split across:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>3 bosses back-to-back</li>
<li>3 enhanced bosses back-to-back</li>
<li>5 bosses back-to-back</li>
<li>5 enhanced bosses back-to-back</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The "enhanced" bosses have been given "even more ways to kick your ass" the developer said, so "extra limbs, healing powers, buddies to help them kill you - all the good stuff!". Oh goodie.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bAEt_uWf5Es"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6b623583b3013f1ac72c05f17eb44c9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bAEt_uWf5Es" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You even get a fancy statue, which you unlock parts for as you progress through the Boss Rush. There's also these new bits added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Ranged Weapon: Glyphs of Peril</strong> - The lower your health, the more attacks this weapon has in its combo (up to 7 hits). Crits from the third hit onwards.</li>
<li><strong>New Skill: Taunt</strong> - Enrage the enemy right in front of you, causing them to attack and move quicker, but also take more melee damage.</li>
<li><strong>New Mutation: Wish</strong>- Wish for a great item and you'll get it! The next one you pick will be upgraded to Legendary quality. Only one use, and this mutation get locked in your loadout once it triggers, though.</li>
<li><strong>8 new Outfits</strong>, unlocked through the <strong>Boss Rush.</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can pick up Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Formula Retro Racing - World Tour is a fresh upcoming low-poly racer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your classic racing games with low-poly visuals? Keep an eye on Formula Retro Racing - World Tour which releases next year and has a demo available along with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>"A retro racer updated for the modern age, Formula Retro Racing: World Tour fuses the pick-up-and-play simplicity of 90s-style arcade racing with realistic physics, split-screen multiplayer, and 60fps performance.

You'll race through iconic global locations, compete against other drivers, and try to beat your own lap times. Do you have what it takes to master each racing line, hug every apex, and cross the checkered flag to victory?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_Jz4K2Q_fMM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/097f830a6869459040a9a1afd52a0f96.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_Jz4K2Q_fMM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>RimWorld - Biotech expansion announced and a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RimWorld is set to get even bigger with the upcoming Biotech expansion that releases in a few weeks, along with a major free update for all players.</p>
<p>The expansion <a href="https://ludeon.com/blog/2022/10/biotech-expansion-announced-update-1-4-on-unstable-branch/" target="_blank">sounds pretty wild</a>, mixing in some huge new features that will change the way you play the game and grow your colonies. For starters, you will now be able to have babies. People can do it naturally, or have a baby via technological means. Naturally, it will come with a set of challenges with keeping them safe and happy and as they develop you will get to pick which traits and passions a child will develop.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17694511641665053276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17694511641665053276gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21115759251665053274gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/21115759251665053274gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another big addition is The Mechanitor, allow you to turn your colonists into people with special brain implants letting them command semi-living machines. Sounds pretty wild. You'll grow them and command various types and be able to grow a whole swarm of them or turn them into "fearsome squadron of massive ultratech war machines and industrial behemoths".</p>
<p>This new tech comes with its own price attached of course including pollution, that seems to twist the creatures and environment if left unchecked.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4644073151665053578gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4644073151665053578gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7157385771665053580gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7157385771665053580gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that the Biotech expansion will also let you do some gene-editing, so you can modify your people and turn them into xenohumans with special exotic traits. These range from "subtle personality traits and eye color to hulking furry bodies, glands for fire-breathing, rapid regeneration, and even immortality". Sounds like you're going to need to watch out for new factions using it too.</p>
<p>A big free update with version 1.4 will be releasing as well containing lots of big improvements like</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup performance improvements.</li>
<li>Painting and color customization for walls, floors, furniture, and lights.</li>
<li>Actually useful shelves that store lots of stuff.</li>
<li>Two new turret types.</li>
<li>Starting possessions for some colonists.</li>
<li>Rot stink from corpses.</li>
<li>New mod manager UI.</li>
<li>New options menu.</li>
<li>Heat overlay.</li>
<li>Quest search bar.</li>
<li>Tile inspector.</li>
<li>+ More</li>
</ul>
<p>You can buy RimWorld for Linux from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/rimworld?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/rimworld?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

<li>Play custom boot animations in full screen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Go tell Bungie you want Destiny 2 on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Destiny 2 is one of the biggest and most popular shooters around and sadly it doesn't work on Steam Deck / Linux. Now is your chance to give your say and <em>maybe</em> Bungie will listen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/bungie-say-a-big-fat-no-to-proton-and-steam-deck-for-destiny-2/" target="_blank">A little while ago</a> I wrote about how Bungie had given Steam Deck a pretty firm nope, and sadly the situation simply hasn't changed since then. They took notice of people requesting it, and then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/bungie-has-more-to-say-on-destiny-2-for-steam-deck-and-its-still-a-no/" target="_blank">issued a statement</a> where they once again gave us a pretty firm nope.</p>
<p>Now, there's a dedicated place on the Destiny 2 Reddit where you can give your feedback on it. This comes in the form of what they call a <em>Focused Feedback</em> post titled "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/xuonok/focused_feedback_linux_and_alternative_platform/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">Focused Feedback: Linux and Alternative Platform Support</a>". Writing about why the post was made, a Destiny 2 Reddit moderator noted in a comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some additional context on why this was selected as a Focused Feedback topic, despite lack of recent popular threads about it, posts discussing official support for Destiny 2 on Proton (read: Steam Deck) have been automodded to Bungie's official stance on the matter (listed below) for a while now because - until very recently - there was nothing to discuss besides people expressing that they wanted Proton support and/or whether or not Bungie's rationale for the Proton prohibition is valid.</p>
<p>Given that, in the past week, we've had the announcement of Stadia's planned demise AND a Destiny 2 team lead expressing their love for Steam Deck as a <strong>hardware</strong> choice for playing Destiny 2 (they were playing D2 on Steam Deck in a manner which is allowed by Terms of Service), there is renewed public interest in the discussion and the decision was made to make it this week's Focused Feedback topic. This way, the discussion can be had and Bungie is provided with fresh, organized feedback on this issue from the DestinyReddit community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their comment about the Destiny 2 developer enjoying the Steam Deck is probably <a href="https://twitter.com/tomfromtheweb/status/1576790234200649728" target="_blank">this post</a> from Tom Farnsworth, the Senior Design Lead at Bungie, who had to use Moonlight to stream it from a PC to their Steam Deck. <em>Sure would be nice if we didn't have to do things like that huh?</em></p>
<p>Since the Steam Deck is doing so well (like apparently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">shipping over a million now</a>), players shouldn't need to resort to installing a different operating system or streaming from a PC to play their favourite games. Hopefully more developers, like Bungie, will start to take notice if the player base on Steam Deck continues growing.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/xuonok/focused_feedback_linux_and_alternative_platform/" target="_blank">the Reddit Post</a> to give your say.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to play Overwatch 2 on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While you might struggle to get in due to ongoing server issues, Overwatch 2 is out now free to play and it can run quite nicely on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Here's how to get Overwatch 2 installed and running. Since it's not available officially for Linux, we're going to be using the Wine compatibility layer for this, along with help from the <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> app.</p>
<p>First up is the video guide which walks through each step, plus some gameplay:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QsWL0mqFxgE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a51491de3e7ec26d14dae9481aecaa8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QsWL0mqFxgE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Text Guide:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a>. On Steam Deck be in Desktop Mode where it's found in the Discover app.</li>
<li>Load it up and create a new Bottle for Gaming.</li>
<li>In the main Bottles settings, go to Runners and download Caffe.</li>
<li>Go inside the Bottle you created (click it).</li>
<li>Head to preferences, scroll down to System and change the Runner to Caffe.</li>
<li>Go to the Installers section, install Battle.net.</li>
<li>For Steam Deck: when finished installing Battle.net and Overwatch, you can add Bottles to Steam to launch in Gaming Mode via the big "Add A Game" button on the bottom left of the Steam window. <em>Bottles has it's own add to Steam ability, but for me it didn't work.</em></li>
<li>It can then be found in the Non-Steam section of your Library in Gaming Mode.</li>
<li>After launching Bottles when in Gaming Mode, you can hold down the Steam button and use the right thumbpad / right thumbstick to move the mouse and right trigger for left mouse button by default so you can leave Steam Input as a gamepad. Makes it easy to click buttons in launchers while keeping gamepad for in-game.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>That's pretty much all there is to it. Performance will be really quite bad until the shaders compile though, just be patient with it and after a good while it will sort itself out quite nicely. I wouldn't recommend doing any Ranked gameplay until you've put a good few hours into each map so a lot of the shaders will be sorted.</p>

      <title>Oxygen Not Included has a new animated short, plus a &#39;Story Trait System&#39; update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Klei are back with a brand new big update to Oxygen Not Included, after they decided <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/no-more-dlc-for-oxygen-not-included-devs-decide-to-do-free-updates-instead/" target="_blank">not to do</a> any more paid DLC so this is the first of many free updates to come. Plus a fancy new animated short.</p>
<p>With the new release they added in a "Story Trait System", which gives you a collection of interactive POIs (point of interest) burief inside the asteroids to find. The first two are: the Somnium Synthesizer harnesses the power of Duplicants’ subconscious minds by unlocking their ability to dream for the very first time, while the Critter Flux-O-Matic offers a new way to roll the dice on critter morph outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally there's a new Kitchen room, with a Spice Grinder to enhance food. Plus some additions for people who own the Spaced Out DLC.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7cK5oB3CM1k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9649fbb338da6ddea7744ba45960b2b1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7cK5oB3CM1k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>All versions</div>
<ul>
<li>Added Story Traits system and UI
	<ul>
<li>Added Somnium Synthesizer story trait</li>
<li>Added Critter Flux-O-Matic story trait</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Kitchen room type</li>
<li>Added Spice Grinder building (Freshener Spice recipe, Brawny Spice recipe, Machinist Spice recipe)</li>
<li>Enabled renaming rockets</li>
<li>Fixed a number of Transit Tube bugs</li>
</ul>
<div>Spaced Out! only</div>
<ul>
<li>Added Smog Slug and Spong Slug critter morphs</li>
<li>Added Rocketeer Spice recipe to Spice Grinder</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Recently they also put up a roadmap which sounds quite exciting. Klei are planning to add in expanded surface gameplay tools and content, various quality of life updates to make playing it smoother, various new room types like "Laboratory, Mission Control Room, better bedrooms" along with bigger additions like new biomes, expanded world generation options and more. A cosmetic system like in Don't Starve Together is also in the works, which they hope will help fund more free updates instead of DLC.</p>
<p>You can buy Oxygen Not Included on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/457140/Oxygen_Not_Included/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta updates fix Red Dead Redemption 2 and external screen changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two Beta updates have landed for the Steam Deck with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014484230244" target="_blank">Client</a> and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014483383230" target="_blank">OS</a> update available, with some pretty big changes to how external screens are handled.</p>
<p>Available in the Beta and Preview channels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>External display settings</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of refresh rate and FPS limit settings independently for internal and external displays.</li>
<li>Disable refresh rate switching via the quick access menu for external displays by default. Alternative refresh rates are still accessible via the resolution dropdown in Settings-&gt;Display.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to developer settings to re-enable refresh rate switching in the quick access menu for external displays. Please note that the Steam Deck’s built-in display was validated to support the full range of refresh rates available in the slider, but for arbitrary external displays we can't provide a guarantee that the resolution + refresh rate combination will be functional. This can lead to a scenario where the external display doesn’t display an image, so there isn’t an easy way to undo the change. Here be dragons, we don't recommend turning this setting on.</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance improvements when rendering the homescreen.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when loading some SteamInput configs.</li>
<li>Reduced occurrence of double-activations on Soft Press on Touch Pads and Sticks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also available only in the Preview channel as it's an OS upgrade:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash in Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
<li>Improved external display hot-plug detection</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a run over the changes and a quick look in a video. For this I tested a good while of Red Dead Redemption 2 to ensure it really was fixed and not only does it run smoothly, there's no crashing now either.</p>

<p>"Streets of Rogue 2 is a procedurally generated open-world game about player choice, freedom, and anarchic fun. The game takes inspiration from open-world and crafting/survival titles ranging from Skyrim to GTA to Valheim to Stardew Valley, with an emphasis on streamlined and fast-paced gameplay. It also adds the free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent elements of RPGs like Deus Ex to create a true sandbox experience."</p>

      <title>NVK is a new open source Mesa Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jason Ekstrand of Collabora just <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-nvk.html" target="_blank">announced</a> NVK, a brand new open source Mesa Vulkan driver for NVIDIA GPUs. No you're not dreaming but it's also not from NVIDIA directly — as usual the open source community is doing the work.</p>
<p>It's still early-ish days for NVK but what they've been able to do with it so far sounds reasonably promising. The current nouveau drivers for NVIDIA in Mesa aren't going to be removed but they don't exactly work well, and a lot of it was done coding in the dark with reverse engineering.</p>
<p>Things have come a long way though, with NVIDIA gradually releasing more documentation and recently their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/nvidia-releases-open-source-linux-gpu-kernel-modules-beta-driver-5154304-out/" target="_blank">open source Linux GPU kernel modules</a>.</p>
<p>NVK itself was written "almost entirely from scratch using the new official headers from NVIDIA" over the last several months targeting Turing+. Ekstrand has some pretty high goals for it, like wanting it to become "the new reference Vulkan driver within Mesa" and so they're "building NVK with all the best practices we've developed for Vulkan drivers over the last 7.5 years and trying to keep the code-base clean and well-organized".</p>
<p>This is a serious effort to get a good open source driver for NVIDIA GPUs and that sounds awesome. Eventually it could become "what RADV is to AMD hardware" but there's a lot of work to get there.</p>
<p>As for OpenGL support, they might even end up using the Zink driver (an OpenGL implementation on top of Vulkan), instead of writing a whole new OpenGL driver to go along with it. Zink has come a long way too so it could be a pretty good plan.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-nvk.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> for all the info.</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper is a nice twist on base / tower defense</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together elements of survival, mining, exploration and tower defense — Dome Keeper is worth your attention. Note: key provided by the developer to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>Here you're defending your little Dome against an onslaught of monsters. Mixing between tower defense with waves of enemies, with your time in between waves dedicated to mining down below the surface for resources so you can upgrade everything you possibly can to survive just a little longer. Do you rush to get back before the monsters arrive, as you keep your watchful eye on the timer or do you let it get a small beating because you've struck gold with resources or something special?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WOYP2luxudY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b65583ab5ad4170643255cf0f774f7c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WOYP2luxudY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even though you're constantly facing off against the timer, it doesn't feel frantic. It's a surprisingly chilled game half the time and i think that's a big part of why I like it. Action where it needs to be but a nice mixture of gameplay with the exploration mining below the surface.</p>
<p>Perhaps a little bit light on content overall, with the vast majority of your time spent digging or just shooting monsters from your dome but for what it is — a lot of fun. The basic idea they have is perfectly formed here and for those who just like to chill out with their games, it's an easy pick up and play experience. The developer seems to have plans to keep expanding it too so I'm genuinely quite excited to see what else they add into it.</p>
<p>According to the publisher, RawFury (<a href="https://twitter.com/jantonsson/status/1575863051085090819" target="_blank">Twitter</a>), it's done well too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dome Keeper became profitable a few hours after launch &amp; grossed $1 mil soon after! With over 7K games launched on Steam this yr, this result is far from given, but shows what can happen when an amazing game, made by a world class developer gets the support to make full impact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A happy recommendation for desktop Linux and Steam Deck as it plays fantastically on both.</p>
<p>You can pick it up on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/dome_keeper" target="_blank">GOG</a> ("soon") and right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Wine manager app Bottles gets some drag and drop fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://usebottles.com/" target="_blank">Bottles</a> is the awesome free and open source app to help you manage the Windows compatibility layer Wine. A fresh release is out now with version 2022.9.28 (yes I'm a few days late).</p>
<p>With Bottles, you can easily install the likes of Battle.net, EA Launcher, Origin, GOG Galaxy and more with a growing list of easy installers. Plus you can just throw in whatever Windows apps / games you need. It's just a nice tidy way to keep it all together.</p>
<p>My favourite new feature is easily their new drag and drop implementation for running things, allowing you to throw a file on top of the window when you have a configured Bottle open to then run it inside it. In other words, you have a Wine Bottle created, then you drag and drop a Windows game / app installer inside — neat!</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16485691741664898563gol1.mp4"> </video>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Video Credit - Bottles Team</em></p>
<p>Display Settings also now have their own dedicated dialog, which looks a bit cleaner and keeps things a bit more focused for when you're tweaking various options. Like virtual desktop resolution not appearing unless the setting is actually turned on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1494547201664898712gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1494547201664898712gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Their work on the UI is great and they've continued cleaning it up in other places too, along with their continued work to have Bottles use the full power of the latest generation of GTK4 and libadwaita for designing interfaces. When tweaking your Gamescope settings, they've also adjusted the dialog to "be more intuitive and self-introducing". Plus lots more.</p>
<p>The main highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia-specific settings are now hidden on other setups.</li>
<li>Run executables by dropping them on the bottle.</li>
<li>Move from XML to Blueprints for UI.</li>
<li>Mobile improvements.</li>
<li>The Gamescope dialog is now more polished and intuitive.</li>
<li>Display settings has now a dedicated dialog.</li>
<li>All selectors are ported to the libadwaita.</li>
<li>Support for ja_JP,zh_TW,ko_KR languages.</li>
<li>Dependencies with an incompatible architecture are now hidden.</li>
<li>Support for the bundled gstreamer version if provided by the runner.</li>
<li>Adding a new program will be immediately available, without having to update the whole list.</li>
<li>Removed the ability to install multiple dependencies in one go.</li>
<li>Improve wording for Components section.</li>
<li>Lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Gamepad driver and app &#39;SC Controller&#39; gets Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller" target="_blank">SC Controller</a>, what originally started as an application to control the Steam Controller outside of Steam and expanded to cover more gamepads now has a <a href="https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller/releases/tag/v0.4.10-pre" target="_blank">pre-release</a> up with Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>This means you can control the Steam Deck gamepad, Steam Controller, PlayStation, 8bitdo and many others without the need for Steam Input — for whatever reason you can think of.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1287182001664881388gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1287182001664881388gol1.png"/></a>I enjoy that classic Steam skin a bit too much.</em></p>
<p>While it's a pre-release meaning it needs more testing, it does appear to work quite nicely including flawless switching between SC Controller handling inputs and turning it off to see Steam Input then take over again. I've no doubt plenty of people will make use of this.</p>
<p>The app features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allows to setup, configure and use Steam Controller(s) (and others) without ever launching Steam</li>
<li>Supports profiles switchable in GUI or with controller button</li>
<li>Stick, Pads and Gyroscope input</li>
<li>Haptic Feedback and in-game Rumble support</li>
<li>OSD, Menus, On-Screen Keyboard for desktop <em>and</em> in games.</li>
<li>Automatic profile switching based on active window.</li>
<li>Macros, button cycling, rapid fire, modeshift, mouse regions...</li>
<li>Emulates Xbox360 controller, mouse, trackball and keyboard.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve makes Steam Deck custom boot screens easier (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 5/10/22</strong>: in a later <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014486735948" target="_blank">Beta update</a>, Valve <em>changed</em> the folders for custom videos so it's now:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.steam/root/config/uioverrides/movies/ </code></p>
<p>If you don't have .steam for whatever reason it's:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.local/share/Steam/config/uioverrides/movies/</code></p>
<p>You still need to make the extra folders yourself.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Valve just released a fresh Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3301726014480099879" target="_blank">update</a> for the Steam Deck, as they loved seeing all the custom boot screens so much they've now made it officially supported. This is currently available in the Beta and Preview channels you can swap over to by going into Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Yes, that's right, a hardware vendor just changed their software to let you officially override their bootup and suspend animations. What a time to be alive. Covered by me <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/custom-boot-animations-for-the-steam-deck-are-pretty-sweet/" target="_blank">with a guide before</a>, it's now easier than ever and with less steps needed.</p>
<p>From their changelog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's been great to see all the community activity around custom boot videos, so we made a couple updates to make this a bit easier to do. The new folder location below will be a safer place to save your video files, and they won't be wiped with every Steam update.</p>
<p>Custom boot videos</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck will now look for custom boot and suspend animations in steamui/overrides/movies/. Please note that you'll need to create this folder first.</li>
<li>Play custom boot animations in full screen</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue with startup haptics</li>
</ul>
<p>Resolution: applies to Preview Channel only</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a toggle allowing Steam Deck to automatically control the display resolution for external displays. When toggled on, Steam Deck will automatically adjust the resolution for best performance on higher resolution displays.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So really all you need to do is make the folder "overrides" and inside it a folder "movies" so it ends up as:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">~/.local/share/Steam/steamui/overrides/movies</code></p>
<p>Then put your custom movie files in that match the names of what Valve use. Then it's done and in my own testing it does work. I especially like the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/xs3jzn/my_handheld_history_ultimate_edition_boot_video/" target="_blank">handheld history</a> animation from Redditor TareXmd shown in the below quick video:</p>

      <title>KDE devs talk Steam Deck and their work for it at Akademy 2022, over a million shipped</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently at the <a href="https://akademy.kde.org/2022/" target="_blank">Akademy 2022</a> conference, KDE's David Edmundson gave a talk on the Steam Deck and the ongoing work in KDE to improve things.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, the Steam Deck is a full Linux PC and includes a full KDE Plasma desktop mode you can use for whatever you want as well. Thanks to that, the KDE team have been working on improvements (with plenty already done) to make it a better experience.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://conf.kde.org/event/4/contributions/94/" target="_blank">talk description</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Steamdeck is one of the most interesting and excitement big deployments of KDE in recent times.</p>
<p>In this talk I will share how Plasma fits into the Steamdeck and what aspects of KDE made us the right choice for their new userbase. I will then share some of the projects that contractors Blue Systems have been doing for Valve and how the work there benefits not just the Steamdeck but improves the ecosystem for all Plasma users.</p>
<p>Finally we look at what this could mean for KDE on the whole as more vendors gain the same confidence in Plasma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always interesting to hear what's being done and it seems quite a lot. Various changes were done for Valve including startup performance improvements, a robust systemd managed boot, microphone volume indicators, improving resource visualization and system monitors, big improvements to system settings, firewall configuration and much more.</p>
<p>Here's the full clip:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a0gEIeFgDX0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3cbb54553096fa977869f6732f23336d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a0gEIeFgDX0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Perhaps the biggest bit of info coming out of this is that according to Edmundson, Valve has shipped over a <strong>million</strong>.  At about 29:45 in the above video in response to a question on it Edmundson said "They have crossed over a million, and they're still processing back orders". Valve haven't actually given out any numbers in public on it yet and Edmundson was not speaking for Valve but still, the answer was pretty confident and clear.</p>

      <title>AMD driver update gets Red Dead Redemption 2 working better on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Are you having issues with Red Dead Redemption 2 on either the Steam Deck or a Linux desktop with an AMD GPU? Well, upcoming driver updates should improve it. While there was an update in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/proton-experimental-fixes-up-red-dead-redemption-2-gets-more-games-working/" target="_blank">Proton Experimental recently</a> that fixed the game not actually running after the FSR2 upgrade, it seems there's still problems with it <em>crashing</em> after a little while.</p>
<p>Looks like it's possible that will be solved as well soon though! <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/18884" target="_blank">An update</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/RADV-RDR2-APU-Fix" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>) was recently merged into the Mesa drivers for RADV (the AMD Vulkan Driver) that enabled a "unified heap on APUs for Red Dead Redemption 2". This came from developer Samuel Pitoiset (Valve) and inside the request it mentioned how it "Fixes memory explosion with RDR2 without hurting performance as my previous attempt did.".</p>
<p>So with Mesa 22.3 that's due in November it should be a much nicer experience. However, for Steam Deck specifically, Valve might just pull in the change and have it up in a Beta update as I imagine they want a high profile game like this to be sorted quickly.</p>

      <title>SteamOS and Steam Deck on top for Linux in the Steam Hardware Survey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">September 2022</a>, with it showing that clearly the Steam Deck with SteamOS is the most popular way now to game on Linux.</p>
<p>With the latest numbers though, there is a dip in the overall Linux user share with it now at <strong>1.23%</strong>. A drop overall of 0.04 percentage points which some may attribute to just noise but that's what the survey says. Historical data can be found on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a> like the below graph snapshot:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10291899971664799503gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10291899971664799503gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>As for the most popular Linux distributions, it's now pretty clear that SteamOS is on top:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 17.04% +3.35%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 64 bit 12.48% +4.28%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.57% -0.32%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 7.80% -1.13%</li>
<li>Flatpak runtime 64 bit (multi-distro) 4.81% +4.81%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 4.31% -0.15%</li>
<li>Other 42.99% +5.10%</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure some will argue about <em>combining</em> distributions together, like Arch and Manjaro that would put them on top but really they're quite different. Just like how SteamOS has its own update schedule, so does Manjaro they're just based-on Arch. A bit different for Pop and Ubuntu, which share the same base directly.</p>
<p>As for devices, Steam Deck is clearly top for Linux with it's GPU being used by 17.07% putting it at the top for Linux players. That's an +3.35% increase compared with last month too, so the lead is only continuing to grow. Once again though, it's still not even showing up in the Windows stats meaning very few overall people are using Windows on the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updates fix up Indiana Jones, Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has recently put up a fresh update for Proton Experimental, bringing more game compatibility and some fixes. The update was released on September 30th.</p>
<p>Here's what games are newly supported with Proton Experimental:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pico Park Classic Edition.</li>
<li>Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind.</li>
<li>Darkstar One.</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Emperor Tomb.</li>
<li>Crazy Machines 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus some dedicated fixes landed including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) having no audio.</li>
<li>Fix Return to Monkey Island not reacting to mouse clicks after a recent game update.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surprisingly, Valve set Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) as Steam Deck Verified in February and remained so up until the end of August, where they finally noticed some long-standing audio problems that required a really old version of Proton 4 but that still had some issues. At least now they've dropped the rating down to Playable. Nice to see it getting some attention here.</p>
<p>Changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how to actually use Proton Experimental and a run over the above in video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ocBSyslp3q4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54e48a631c1ac191c04f81636c2cef65.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ocBSyslp3q4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text guide (Steam Deck):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game and head to the little COG icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select it from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility menu on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't have Proton Experimental installed, it's available in your Steam Library the same as any other game and app.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Vulkan Beta driver 515.49.19 is out now, driver 515.76 causing problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have done another new release to their developer-focused Vulkan Beta driver with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver" target="_blank">515.49.19</a> out now. <em>This is completely separate to their main driver series.</em></p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3</a> support for the following dynamic states:

		<ul>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_CLAMP_ENABLE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_POLYGON_MODE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LOGIC_OP_ENABLE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_BLEND_ENABLE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_BLEND_EQUATION_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_WRITE_MASK_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_DEPTH_CLIP_ENABLE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_COLOR_BLEND_ADVANCED_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_PROVOKING_VERTEX_MODE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_RASTERIZATION_MODE_EXT</li>
<li>VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_LINE_STIPPLE_ENABLE_EXT</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What does VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 do? This extension adds almost all of the remaining pipeline state as dynamic state to help applications further reduce the number of monolithic pipelines they need to create and bind.</p>
<p>More changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Provisional Vulkan video extension updates:
		<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_video_queue: 6 -&gt; 7</li>
<li>Note: these changes are not backwards compatible with the old revisions so applications using the old revisions will need to be updated to continue working</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes:
	<ul>
<li>Fixed regression with mesh shader queries</li>
<li>Updated OpEmitMeshTasksEXT to be interpreted as a terminator instruction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>open-gpu-kernel-modules release:
	<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.19" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/515.49.19</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Unless you actually need the extra Vulkan extensions, you should probably just stick to their mainline drivers. However, they seem to be having a few issues there. Stable driver <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/193095/en-us/" target="_blank">515.76</a> was released back on September 20th, and it appears to be causing lots of people to <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/bug-report-black-x11-screen-and-partial-lockup-when-upgraded-to-515-76-and-dual-rtx3060/228912" target="_blank">get a black screen</a> so you may want to stick with the previous version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/Download/driverResults.aspx/190425/en-uk" target="_blank">515.57</a>. Hopefully NVIDIA will find the issue and fix it up soon.</p>

      <title>Linux kernel 6.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest and great version of the Linux kernel has been released with Linux 6.0 out now. From the release <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/10/2/255" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<p><em>"So, as is hopefully clear to everybody, the major version number change is more about me running out of fingers and toes than it is about any big fundamental changes. But of course there's a lot of various changes in 6.0 - we've got over 15k non-merge commits in there in total, after all, and as such 6.0 is one of the bigger releases at least in numbers of commits in a while."</em></p>
<p>Naturally it comes with a huge amount of new features, fixes, performance improvements and the list goes on. Some of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Arc Graphics support for the new dedicated chips. Still experimental and needs up to date Mesa too.</li>
<li>Work towards supporting AMD RDNA3.</li>
<li>Support for NVMe in-band authentication.</li>
<li>Better CPU energy efficiency.</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi V3D kernel driver.</li>
</ul>
<p>A whole lot more that you can see over at <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-60-features" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Linux creator Linus Torvalds was recently awarded the first-ever Intel Innovation Award for his lifetime's worth of technical achievement from Intel's Pat Gelsinger.</p>

      <title>The &#39;Heavy Machinery&#39; update for survival game Volcanoids looks awesome</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh wow, I really need to check out Volcanoids again. The survival game that has you build and upgrade a big moving drill now has a lot more in it with some other big machinery.</p>
<p>The newly released Heavy Machinery update has expanded the world with lots of different tanks, each of them having weak points you can destroy and it looks thoroughly satisfying! There's also various types of drones that will now be flying around being a total menace, 3 new weapons for players, new anti-air turrets for players and there's even now full controller support which means it might even be a lot more playable on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QwPn2CuxxOc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7743d857793ce4a63c90e7ce73b2ef4d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QwPn2CuxxOc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/951440/Volcanoids/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Volcanoids on Steam</a>. It's 30% off until October 6th and it has Native Linux support</p>

      <title>Brotato is going to be my next horde-survival arena-shooter obsession</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you don't hear from me much over the next week it's because I've discovered Brotato. Another in the list of wave-based <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde survival games</a> and it's honestly great. Note: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Released into Early Access on September 27th, it works great out of the box on desktop and Steam Deck with Proton 7. The developer "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1942280/discussions/0/4555968543727029680/#c3363649883734796651" target="_blank">might</a>" also do a Native release later on, which shouldn't be too much trouble as it was made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> which has excellent Linux support.</p>
<p>Much like other horde games (including Vampire Survivors), you run around an arena taking down enemies while powering up your character the longer you survive. At least here though, it's brought back proper timed waves and so you get a breather in between each set of the action to level up your character, get new weapons and items and get ready for the next wave. You can create some pretty insane character builds with this one, and my favourite feature is probably that you can actually sell weapons if you want something better. You can also combine the same weapon to make it more powerful, and free up another slot for something else.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="727NFQkdMBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf4ed8ef1d3451cd2081130c14178320.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/727NFQkdMBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Auto-firing weapons by default with a manual aiming option.</li>
<li>Fast runs (under 30 minutes).</li>
<li>Dozens of characters available to customize your runs (one-handed, crazy, lucky, mage and many more).</li>
<li>Hundreds of items and weapons to choose from (flamethrowers, SMGs, rocket launchers or sticks and stones).</li>
<li>Survive waves lasting 20 to 90 seconds each and kill off as many aliens as you can during that time.</li>
<li>Collect materials to gain experience and get items from the shop between waves of enemies.</li>
<li>Accessibility options: tweak the health, damage and speed of enemies so the difficulty is right for you.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Already an easy recommendation. A lot of fun.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors 1.0 coming October 20th, seems a Linux port is still planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer poncle has now confirmed that Vampire Survivors will hit the 1.0 on October 20th. The sad news is their big game engine upgrade is not landing yet.</p>
<p>Coming with the 1.0 release will be new language support including: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Polish, Portuguese, Turkish, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. The rest of the actual content upgrades seem to be a surprise though.</p>
<p>The thing is, they've been porting their Electron-based game over to Unity. An exciting idea that should help solve various performance problems and open them up to more platforms. They're now aiming to release that by the end of the year, and they're on the "last pass at optimization and polish (plus adding the final bits of content that still have to be seen on the current version too)".</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3370402903772184201" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said the new engine will bring:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Work on machines that get the webGL not supported error, get a white screen of death, get a black screen with a sad face, or have the game installed on a non-standard path.</li>
<li>Fix input issues or the game straight up crashing when multiple controllers are attached to the machine.</li>
<li>Remapping input.</li>
<li>Cloud Save conflicts due to non-useful files.</li>
<li>Use more than 1 CPU core :) Let those FPS fly high.</li>
<li>Native support for Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see they're still firmly planning a Native Linux port, although it does work well enough on desktop and Steam Deck with Proton but some people are unable to run it due to various issues with Electron. So a proper port should solve that too.</p>
<p>You can see some of my own gameplay of Vampire Survivors in a video I did back in April, where I told you not to buy a Steam Deck if you value your free time:</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Google gives up on Stadia, will offer refunds on games and hardware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As expected for some time now, Google has decided to call it quits on their cloud gaming service Stadia. This was announced in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/stadia/message-on-stadia-streaming-strategy/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today.</p>
<p>Written up by Phil Harrison, the Vice President and General Manager at Stadia, the post mentions how "it hasn't gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service".</p>
<p>The wildest part about this, is that they're going to be refunding all Stadia hardware purchases made through the main Google Store and they will also be refunding all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store. Harrison said they expect to have finished up the majority of refunds by Mid-January, 2023. They will not be refunding any Stadia Pro subscriptions though, only the full purchases. More info on the <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/12790109" target="_blank">process here</a> but it seems like it's not ready yet.</p>
<p>Players will still be able to access and play games on Stadia through until January 18, 2023.</p>
<p>In the post Harrison mention how the "underlying technology platform that powers Stadia has been proven at scale and transcends gaming" and they see "opportunities to apply this technology across other parts of Google like YouTube, Google Play, and our Augmented Reality (AR) efforts — as well as make it available to our industry partners" so it seems they will continue to offer it to others to use.</p>
<p>This is a pretty huge defeat for Google to give up and refund wholly like this. With the likes of GeForce NOW, Xbox Cloud and Amazon Luna — the business model that Google had with you needing to buy full-price games was pretty much doomed.</p>

      <title>GOG celebrates 14 years with big sale, game giveaway and Skyrim release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> are celebrating 14 years of existing with a big sale on lots of games, plus you can get a free copy of Master of Magic Classic.</p>
<p>For the giveaway, simply be logged in to <a href="https://www.gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> and scroll down to find the giveaway banner. They only have a build up for Windows but since it uses DOSBox you can easily run it nicely on Linux too. You can claim that game free until Sunday October 2nd, 10 PM UTC.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has also now landed on GOG with the <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition" target="_blank">Anniversary Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_special_edition" target="_blank">Special Edition</a>. GOG said in their email that their version has been tweaked so you can get the Anniversary Edition content without the need for Creation Club access and naturally it's fully playable offline.</p>
<p>As for modding it GOG said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the game is recognized as one of the most modded titles in the history of video games, support for community-created content in Skyrim was one of our top priorities. The GOG version is compatible out of the box with most modifications mods via Nexus Mods Vortex v1.6.12 and newer. Support for mods requiring Skyrim Script Extender will be added later today. Additionally, GOG is preparing something special to provide an even smoother modding experience – expect more details soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The game has long worked in Wine / Proton so it's another option for you and good news for GOG fans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/gog_14th_anniversary" target="_blank">As for the sale</a> there's 900+ discounted so do let us know if you find a good deal.</p>

      <title>Transferring files from PC to Steam Deck with FileZilla FTP</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want another way to transfer files from a PC (Linux / Windows) over to a Steam Deck? Here's how to do it using the FileZilla FTP application. I've already covered the use of tools like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/heres-how-to-transfer-files-from-your-pc-to-a-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Warpinator</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/syncthing-is-a-great-way-to-transfer-files-from-pc-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Syncthing</a> and both are great, however not everyone gets along with them and this way is pretty much bulletproof with a tiny bit of a setup.</p>
<p>First up here's the video and below will be the text guide as usual:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VfsSCMiZVf4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b0c9515c7169c7098a162ef05296d15.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VfsSCMiZVf4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank">FileZilla</a>. On Linux you can grab it from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.filezillaproject.Filezilla" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li>In Steam Deck Desktop Mode, set up a password by using "passwd" in terminal.</li>
<li>Next enable and start SSH with these commands in terminal:<br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo systemctl enable sshd</code><br/>
<code class="inline-code">sudo systemctl start sshd</code></li>
<li>Find the IP address of your Steam Deck. Click the WiFi / Networking icon, then go into details and it will be at the top of the list and may start something like 192. Make a note of this IP.</li>
<li>Load up FileZilla, entering the details into the top bar. The username will be "deck" and the port is "22".</li>
<li>Click Quickconnect.</li>
</ol>
<p>Done, you're ready to get transferring files.</p>

      <title>Point and click mystery adventure The Excavation of Hob&#39;s Barrow is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arriving with Native Linux support, the new mysterious point and click adventure game The Excavation of Hob's Barrow from Cloak and Dagger Games / Wadjet Eye Games is out now.</p>
<p>"Antiquarian Thomasina Bateman is writing a book on the barrows of England, documenting the treasures she finds buried within. When an intriguing letter summons her to the small village of Bewlay, tucked away in the remote countryside, she sets off by train with her assistant a day behind. Upon her arrival, however, the mysterious man who summoned her is nowhere to be found. Her assistant never arrives. A stubborn landowner refuses access to the barrow, and the locals are wary of this woman who is traveling alone and (gasp!) wears trousers. The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is off to a rocky start. And then Thomasina starts having strange dreams... "</p>

      <title>The free Indonesia update for art of rally is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to expand to some gorgeous locations to race through, the free Indonesia update for art of rally is out now.</p>
<p>Their release announcement was short and to the point noting that the new update features 6 new tracks, 2 new songs and a whole new free-roam area for you to practice in too. This has bumped up the content since release to a rather impressive 78 stages across the likes of Finland, Sardinia, Norway, Japan, Germany, Kenya and Indonesia. With over 50 cars too, there's plenty to keep you entertained in this one now.</p>

<p>Back at release in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/art-of-rally-strips-down-the-furious-sport-into-a-serene-top-down-experience/" target="_blank">my article</a> I mentioned it is "a racing experience that pulls away all the fluff, puts it back to the basics of you and the car wrapped up in a visually striking look that I can easily and quite happily recommend" and I still happily stick by that. Great little racing game and perfect for the Steam Deck too.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by classic hack and slashers like Diablo and turn-based RPGs like Tales of Maj'Eyal or Stoneshard, we have the new open-world RPG coming Of Blades &amp; Tails. Planned to enter Early Access on October 19th, this will feature Native Linux support and it looks great.</p>

      <title>Project Killswitch sales suspended as the kickstand messed with the Steam Deck fan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Looks like dbrand are not having a great time with <a href="https://dbrand.com/killswitch" target="_blank">Project Killswitch</a>, their bundle of accessories as they had to pull it from sale shortly after going up for reservations due to it causing problems.</p>
<p>It was a little confusing, as a reservation holder myself the link in the email to buy it just ended up going to a Twitter post. Confused, I reached out to dbrand but didn't hear back until their public announcement about what happened. Sent in an email and posted in public on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/xqsj59/our_milliondollar_mistake/#" target="_blank">Reddit</a> too, they made a "Million-Dollar Mistake".</p>
<p>They shipped out a bunch of them to various content creators and news websites (not to us though…) which they said had people whose knowledge "ranged from 'casual' to 'built their own Linux distro'" and all seemed fine. Then they shipped some out to The Verge, who emailed back to note there were problems with the magnetic kickstand and the Steam Deck fan. It was <em>slowing</em> down their Steam Deck fan! After more testing, another unit saw their fan <em>speed-up</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19801540021664445040gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19801540021664445040gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In short, the whiney Delta fan was the one affected, the Huaying was not and according to dbrand they've heard that Valve are apparently no longer using the Delta fan. So this is why they pulled the launch, as their magnets screwed with any Steam Deck with a Delta fan and obviously they can't just let that happen. To be clear, everything else is fine, just the kickstand causes issues.</p>
<p>So now they're going back and changing the kickstand to a "mechanical interlock system", which will probably end up a little like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">the fantastic DeckMate</a>. Everyone who purchased it with the magnetic version will get a "free replacement of both their case and kickstand" which is great to see.</p>
<p>It's going to take a while though, with any new orders now not shipping until sometime Q1 2023, but they will still be shipping out orders of those reservation holders who did manage to get through initially.</p>

      <title>System76 gives the Oryx Pro a big refresh with an OLED 4k display</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Linux flagship NVIDIA laptop from <a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a> has been given a major overhaul, making it something of a beast. Pricey though, with you needing to dig deep into your wallets with a base price of $2,199.</p>
<p><em>If you're after a powerful system with a proven Linux vendor, this is one of the best possible machines you can buy.</em></p>
<p>System76 are keen to note the difference in available performance between this and their older model, noting in their press material that the CPU is "+35% faster", the memory is "+92% faster" and the graphics are "+40% faster" thanks to all the changes. You're now getting a 12th Gen Intel® Core i7-12700H, DDR5 RAM and a choice between an NVIDIA 3070 Ti or 3080 Ti. No matter what you're doing, it seems like the new System76 Oryx Pro will probably handle it quite nicely.</p>

<p>It's also interesting to see how all the marketing around Linux machines has evolved. System76 have now begun noting in their releases about gaming noting things like Steam Play Proton, ProtonDB, ProtonUp-Qt and Lutris. What a different world it is not Linux now to have hardware vendors repeatedly talking up gaming.</p>
