      <title>Handshakes is a free sokoban puzzler about two hands meeting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes a good firm handshake is what's needed and someone decided to turn that idea into a free puzzle game with Handshakes.</p>
<p>Released back in January, this delightful little puzzler has 30 levels of arm-stretching that ranges from easy at the start up to palm-sweaty brain-teasingly difficult. Always playful though, I ended up cutting off one of my hands in some levels — woops. A genuine delight to randomly come across when looking for something new to play through. It won't take you too long to beat unless you're an idiot like me.</p>
<p>It's clever, because you're controlling multiple hands that need to meet, and you need to push boxes out of the way, open doors and more. Simple ideas but wonderfully made, what a gem.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DO1U9nyjUqs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/966762e399571b94b9ebd648d1989540.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DO1U9nyjUqs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It gets a firm shake from me.</p>
<p><em>Lots of people seem to like this one too with an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam!</em></p>
<p>Go shake some hands over on <a href="https://petpumpkin.itch.io/handshakes" target="_blank">itch.io</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2171690/Handshakes/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>The developer is also making an expanded version now too named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2245130/Handshakes_Hands_On/" target="_blank">Handshakes: Hands On</a> that will have lots of new levels and plenty of new game mechanics to tickle those fingers with.</p>

      <title>Prison Architect: Jungle Pack releases soon with another free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox continue the DLC train here with Prison Architect: Jungle Pack announced for release on February 7th along with a free update for all players.</p>
<p>For the free update named The Jailhouse, they said it will include quality of life improvements including changes to guard behaviour, improvements to quick build materials, a small makeover of the deployment scheduler and the addition of Toby, a Yorkshire Terrier dog. The update also re-balances the Identity Thief reputation and other in-game effects.</p>
<p>As for the DLC here's what you can expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>It’s a prison, in a jungle! - </strong>Enjoy some wooden furniture, five new flooring types (one specific for water!), one outdoor cinema plus new walls and doors: all is set to thrive in the jungle.</li>
<li><strong>Tropical fever (and how to survive it) - </strong>Tropical fever can spread among inmates. Luckily, you can fight and manage it with netted beds, fire pits, and a new, cutting-edge medical program.</li>
<li><strong>A different environment - </strong>In the jungle, you will find new trees, which you can farm and sell, or chop down for lumber. Some wood variants for guard towers, drains, etc. are also available.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Inspired by the classic SimTower, build up high with Property Pro</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Property Pro is an upcoming game from SimDevs, with an aim to capture the classic feel of SimTower from the 90s. With a hint of the character styling from Prison Architect and RimWorld, the idea sounds good.</p>
<p>You'll get to build a properly from scratch or purchase a used one, which may came with a whole bunch of hidden issues you need to deal with. Lots of different types of rooms to build, special guests, surprise inspects and many other challenges are planned to be included.</p>
<p>See some screenshots below, click them to make them bigger:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16210584961675428759gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16210584961675428759gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12879636771675428761gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12879636771675428761gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/SimDevs/status/1618340598624440322" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a child, I was captivated by SimTower even though I didn't fully understand how to play the #game. Now that I'm older, my goal is to recreate what it felt like playing the game from those cherished memories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>That really spoke to me, I remember enjoying what little of it I understood back then too…</em></p>
<p>Seems like it's worth keeping an eye on, if you love management style games.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721000/Property_Pro/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support just like their previous game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/810590/Area_86/" target="_blank">Area 86</a>.</p>

      <title>Going to live my dream of Fifth Element flying cars in MiLE HiGH TAXi</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember the classic sci-fi movie Fifth Element? I sure do and I only watched it <em>again</em> recently, where memories came flowing back of how I used to want those flying cars. Well, one game developer clearly loved it too and they're soon releasing MiLE HiGH TAXi.</p>
<p>The developer mentions it shouldn't take players long to get to grips with the controls, and you can expect a "pulse-pounding ride" where you'll "encounter a cast of hilarious and chatty pedestrians, as well as impatient and over-the-top passengers" as you try to avoid all sorts of obstacles.</p>
<p>It's a mixture of Crazy Taxi, with mechanics inspired by Fifth Element and I honestly can't wait to try it out. Created by solo dev Cassius John-Adams, it's looking impressive as you'll see in the below trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Xzs46WdaMkg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0a20d05eef4f561a76f6edaa9f54f23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Xzs46WdaMkg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has a few different game modes too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In regular mode, strategize to pick up and drop off passengers in efficient ways, maximizing your earnings and extending your game time and career.</li>
<li>In Challenge mode, you'll face increasingly difficult challenges as you deliver passengers sequentially to level up.</li>
<li>In Free Roam mode, you'll be able to explore the city with no time limits or passenger pickups, discovering hidden shortcuts and other secrets as you go.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer plans to release it on March 13th, with Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified ahead of release.</p>
<p>Follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366560/MiLE_HiGH_TAXi/" target="_blank">on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok is a Norse inspired horde survival rogue-lite</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nordic Ashes: Survivors of Ragnarok is yet another survivor game in the spirit of Vampire Survivors, except this has a Nordic theme to it and it's now on Steam with Native Linux support. It's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The developer sent a copy to my Steam Curator and I've been playing it a fair bit since I love these <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">horde games</a>, and being a huge <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/my-game-of-the-year-2022-is-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Brotato</a> fan I was keen to see more variations on it. </p>
<p>Here it's has the similar mechanics of running around an arena, collecting things from enemies to level up and buffing up your character. However, unlike most others in the genre, it's not about building up a big assortment of weapons to unleash hell on your screen. Nordic Ashes is a bit more tame, with more of a focus on surviving and boosting your main weapon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21252723791675357208gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21252723791675357208gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Runs great out of the box on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>As you go through each map you level up, upgrade skills and when you die or finish a level there's some meta-progression to on the legendary Norse tree Yggdrasil but building that up can take quite a few hours of grindy gameplay. This is a lot more based on movement skill to avoid enemies and carefully picking your upgrades, compared with trying to be a truly overwhelming force like other similar titles where half the screen is covered by special effects. To some it might be better, but if you're really into the insane over-the-top action of the other titles this may not be for you. But for a somewhat slower and calmer experience it may be a good match.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore the 9 Realms, each of them based on a world connected by Yggdrasil, the legendary Norse Tree.</li>
<li>Different characters, with exclusive abilities and weapons depending on their role.</li>
<li>Constellation Ability Trees to upgrade your survivor’s powers.</li>
<li>Design the most powerful builds.</li>
<li>Bosses with their own behaviours to make battles more epic.</li>
<li>Dozens of Relics to unlock.</li>
<li>Yggdrasil upgrades as a meta-progress.</li>
<li>Exclusive Early Access skins!</li>
<li>Play using mouse &amp; keyboard or controller.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Sports management / visual novel mash-up Roller Drama is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't play many visual novels (mostly a whole zero) but I do love when games sprinkle it in with other things like the sports management game Roller Drama. The game is certainly inspired and looks a lot like Roller Derby but it's not a simulator of it, and the actual gameplay is quite different according to the developer.</p>
<p>Set in a dystopian alternative world "where things are going… slightly worse than they are here", you watch as personal dramas rage on, manage matches and players and much more.</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interactive narrative with meaningful choices (almost 100!) and multiple endings.</li>
<li>Vivid, explorable universe.</li>
<li>Replayable narrative and matches: every championship is unique, several different endings.</li>
<li>Replay a specific chapter.</li>
<li>Real-time roller derby matches.</li>
<li>Coach a team of five athletes with wildly different personalities.</li>
<li>Hand drawn character art by award winning illustrator Vic Macioci.</li>
<li>Play with controller or mouse + keyboard.</li>
<li>Cloud saves.</li>
</ul>

<p>Available with Native Linux support <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293420/Roller_Drama/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>While it is not yet Steam Deck Verified, the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1293420/view/3267948473375698907" target="_blank">worked</a> to ensure it plays well.</p>

      <title>Zoom Platform, a store aimed at &#39;Generation X&#39; adds more Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One I've been meaning to point out for a while now is <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/" target="_blank">Zoom Platform</a>. A games store that tries to appeal to "Generation X" with both new and classic games, DRM-free and they're continuing to build up their Linux support.</p>
<p>They don't have a whole lot available for Linux Native fans right now, with 26 titles currently tagged as supported including Sensible World of Soccer 96-97, Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition, Judge Dredd and more but they're continuing to build it up.</p>
<p>Recently they <a href="https://www.zoom-platform.com/news/new-updates-2023-01-07" target="_blank">updated</a> a bunch of Duke Nukem titles that use DOSBox, to work better with both the DOSBox and DOSBox-X flatpaks and over the last few months they've added more titles. Just recently, they also added Linux support for Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty, noting on <a href="https://twitter.com/ZOOMPlatform/status/1620784072980299776" target="_blank">Twitter</a> a goal of theirs is to "support Linux as much as we can".</p>
<p>It's interesting to see a store that tries to appeal to the slightly older generation of gamers. As much as <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> tried to in the past, they've long since moved their focus much more onto modern releases. So perhaps some older readers might want to keep an eye on Zoom Platform.</p>

      <title>Dwarf Fortress made over $7 million in January</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that's completely deserved of course. The Dwarf Fortress developers shared that the game made over $7,230,000 in January.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the <a href="http://www.bay12forums.com/smf//index.php?topic=181354.0" target="_blank">official forum</a> in their latest monthly report. They do make it clear, that they don't get to keep all of that as a bit less than half "will go to taxes" and they have to pay people, they have all the usual business expenses and so on but of course they will still get a lot of money from it overall. Enough that they've " solved the main issues of health/retirement that are troubling for independent people, as well as safeguarded the future of the game".</p>
<p>How much they made over the last few months:</p>
<ul>
<li>January: $7,230,123.58.</li>
<li>December: $15,635.07.</li>
<li>November: $14,071.27.</li>
<li>October: $15,374.72.</li>
<li>September: $14,679.51.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it's amazing to see and fully deserved, this isn't exactly the kind of success a lot of indie teams can reproduce though. They have a lot of unique factors at play here including putting it out free for many years before their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/" target="_blank">Steam</a> release, which had numerous upgrades like the official graphics along with the health problems the developer faces which no doubt has spoke to hearts of many people.</p>
<p>If you've been playing it, how many hours have you sunk into it since the Steam release? It's playable with Proton but a Native Linux port is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/dwarf-fortress-releases-december-6-on-steam-and-itchio-native-linux-support-later/" target="_blank">planned</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD reveal prices and availability for Ryzen 7000X3D CPU series</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD has now revealed how much you can expect to be poorer by when picking up one of the new 7000X3D CPUs, along with release dates. The details were announced on Twitter and are:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Available February 28</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 9 7950X3D - $699</li>
<li>Ryzen 9 7900X3D - $599</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Available April 6</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryzen 7 7800X3D - $449 </li>
</ul>
<p>Good news for those of you with an up to date motherboard too, as AMD continue to mention how it's a drop-in replacement for AM5 motherboards with a BIOS update so no need to go out and buy another board. When it comes to cooling, they recommend at least a 280mm all-in-one liquid cooler for the best performance. </p>
<p>They also released a video about it below:</p>

<p>I really absolutely don't <em>need</em> one since I have an AMD Ryzen 5800X but I sure do <em>want</em> one. </p>

      <title>Big new Stable Update for Steam Deck and Desktop Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has today released a major update for the Steam client on Steam Deck and for Desktop users too. There's absolutely masses new including small new features, along with plenty of bug fixes to make the experience smoother overall, as usual a whole bunch of it is shared between Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft just broke their games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 21:17</strong>: Looks like Proton developers have updated the "bleeding-edge" Beta for Proton Experimental, that works around the issue. Note: using it can cause other issues, the Beta doesn't have a lot of testing, you've been warned.</p>
<p>If you go into the Properties on Proton Experimental in your Steam Library, and opt into the "bleeding-edge" Beta, then set your Ubisoft games to use Proton Experimental it will fix it for now until a proper Proton update is out. </p>
<p><strong>Update 22:11</strong>: Valve released a Proton Experimental (no Beta needed) fix for this.</p>
<hr/>
<p><u><em>Original article below</em></u></p>
<p>Third-party launchers on Steam are once again being a massive nuisance. First it was EA breaking everything on Linux and Steam Deck and now it's Ubisoft telling everyone to hold their beer.</p>
<p>Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/proton-experimental-upgraded-to-fix-the-ea-app-failing-to-update-on-steam-deck-a-linux/" target="_blank">fixed the EA App</a> in Proton after a while, and it's likely we're going to need to wait on a fix from Valve again for whatever Ubisoft changed in the latest Ubisoft Connect update.</p>
<p>When you go to launch any game on desktop Linux or Steam Deck that uses Ubisoft Connect, it will do an update and then you'll be greeted with this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5117776381675266378gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5117776381675266378gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>That picture above is from my Fedora Linux desktop trying Ghost Recon Breakpoint today.</p>
<p>After testing The Division 2, Watch Dogs Legion, Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Ghost Recon Breakpoint on my Steam Deck too, they all also gave the exact same problem as you'll see in the screenshot below from my Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7110715951675266489gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7110715951675266489gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>So it seems that every title that uses Ubisoft Connect, is now left broken on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. This comes only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">two weeks after</a> Ubisoft fixed The Division 2 for Steam Deck / Linux. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/fix-ghost-recon-breakpoint-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Breakpoint still needs manual fixes</a>.</p>
<p>Why do developers and publishers keep forcing these absolutely useless third-party launchers on us? Never once have I, or anyone I've spoken to, actually wanted them. They only ever cause problems and solve basically nothing that Steam cannot already do directly.</p>
<p>I've logged an official <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6498" target="_blank">bug report</a> with Valve and notified their developers about it.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 22:13</strong>: In addition to the below, Valve did another Proton Experimental update after some recent Ubisoft Connect <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/ubisoft-broke-their-games-on-linux-desktop-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">breakage I highlighted</a> that includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix 2K launcher failure caused by launcher update.</li>
<li>Fix Ubisoft Connect launcher failure caused by launcher update.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>

<p><em>If you're confused on what Proton is, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">check out my beginner's guide</a>.</em></p>

<p>For <strong>Proton Hotfix</strong>, Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais said on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1620567410205130752" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix change has just been deployed to fix an issue where the Dead Space save screen thumbnail wouldn't appear properly. We're not aware of any remaining issues with the game but are continuing to monitor reports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Changelog can be found <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet asking for clarification Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1620587750587252736" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of those changes were improvements to our DX12 implementation to better support usage patterns we hadn't seen before.</p>

      <title>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past gets a reverse-engineered clone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, the 1991 classic from Nintendo has been reverse-engineered to bring it natively to more platforms. Nintendo are no doubt warming up their lawyers. Available on <a href="https://github.com/snesrev/zelda3" target="_blank">GitHub</a> under the MIT license, it notes the game is fully playable from start to finish and it does need the original ROM for the resources, so it doesn't include the copyrighted assets.</p>
<p>Some extra features were added too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for pixel shaders.</li>
<li>Support for enhanced aspect ratios of 16:9 or 16:10.</li>
<li>Higher quality world map.</li>
<li>Support for MSU audio tracks.</li>
<li>Secondary item slot on button X (Hold X in inventory to select).</li>
<li>Switching current item with L/R keys.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like it's supported to run it across Linux, macOS and Windows too!</p>

      <title>elementary OS 7 &#39;Horus&#39; is out now with major AppCenter upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>elementary OS, probably one of the absolutely slickest looking Linux distributions around, has released version 7 with some major upgrades.</p>
<p>According to the Founder and CEO, Danielle Foré, the previous release saw downloads hit over 400,000 and that's not counting third-party downloads or torrents that don't use their downloads page. Some impressive numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20058983841675254487gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20058983841675254487gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>elementary OS 7 screen - credit to the elementary OS team</em></p>
<p>elementary OS 7 saw a lot of working going into the AppCenter, their first-party application for installing and updating software. It's quite unique, as it offers developers a pay what you want model to put up applications for users, something they seem to be quite successful with.</p>
<p>The new release overhauls the likes of app descriptions, easier updates, upgrades to side-loading and alternate stores, improved responsiveness of the AppCenter itself, rewritten navigation and lots more. One major change is how they handle installing from other sources, instead of showing a warning message it will now show the app in AppCenter with a clear icon and note that it's not curated by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17022305351675254762gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17022305351675254762gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some more of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNOME Web 43 with support for creating web apps.</li>
<li>Big improvements to their Feedback app to make it easier to use.</li>
<li>A simpler to use OS installer with less screens to click through.</li>
<li>Their onboarding welcome app now lets you configure automatic updates.</li>
<li>Their email app Mail now has a "more-modern, flatter design" as a final step to make it more responsive.</li>
<li>A redesign of Printer settings.</li>
<li>A complete rewrite of their Music app.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers noted performance has been a focus for this release too and in "just about every section" they could have written about performance. They've spent a fair amount of time looking into slowdowns, reworking old code and optimizing everything they possibly could.</p>
<p>Lots more in the <a href="https://blog.elementary.io/os-7-available-now/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Really looking good! I've always been impressed by the design of elementary OS 7.</p>

      <title>Budgie 10.7 sounds like a great desktop to use on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Budgie 10.7 is out now, refreshing many parts of this Linux desktop environment to improve the UI across many parts. Originally created for the Solus Linux distribution, nowadays it lives as an independent project and continues to impress.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot new including an application indexer that should be more reliable, Budgie Desktop Settings has a new design for widget selection and Budge Menu saw quite a few improvements like: gaining support for dual-GPUs to pick the right one, a personal user menu giving you quick access to folders like Home and Documents, quick-access buttons at the bottom things like Desktop Settings and Power and the Budgie Menu also no longer needs to reload when the application index changes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875362121675253239gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10875362121675253239gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

<p>Some more of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Budgie Run Dialog uses their new application indexer.</li>
<li>A new Budgie Screenshot application built into the desktop.</li>
<li>Lots of improvements to the notification system, like showing you a summary of notifications after using something in fullscreen. Their notification system also now supports more of the FreeDesktop Notification spec.</li>
<li>Raven, their big panel on the right, now has a whole new widget API system so anyone can build their own widgets for Raven. Plus there's upgrades to multiple existing Raven widgets like a new Usage Monitor giving you a minimal look at CPU, RAM and Swap use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots more can be found in the <a href="https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-7-released/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>I've never actually used Budgie myself, and going by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/users/statistics/" target="_blank">our user stats</a> not a whole lot of people do that filled in their PC Info. If you do use it — what attracts you to it compared with the likes of GNOME, KDE, Xfce and so on?</p>

      <title>Colossal Cave returns from the 1970s in a 3D reimagining</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Colossal Cave, originally released in 1977 from Will Crowther and Don Woods has been revived and reimagined for modern audiences. Another one for a heavy dose of nostalgia perhaps? This new version comes from Sierra On-Line founders Ken and Roberta Williams.</p>
<p>While the original was a text-based adventure, this new version gives it a full 3D look while still aiming to be faithful to what the original game represented. With the non-linear exploration system, you will decide on how to proceed through it and discover the many secrets hiding.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CsGwtyaKBZ0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/848a9b09f047902c44405de2c72e5981.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CsGwtyaKBZ0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Scenic landscapes with hidden secrets.</li>
<li>Miles of caves, caverns, and crawl to work your way through. With over 15 distinct areas to explore in the Colossal Cave.</li>
<li>Difficult puzzles for those seeking a challenge.</li>
<li>Over 20 individual achievements to find and accomplish.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“The original Colossal Cave Adventure was truly unlike anything anyone had seen before, and we hope to make a similar mark on the next generation,” says Roberta Williams, Founder and Lead Designer, Cygnus Entertainment. “Ken and I would have never thought this game could be the experience we’ve created today, but we’ve made that dream a reality thanks to a lot of love and hard work from us, our team, and our gracious partners.”<br/>
 <br/>
“Colossal Cave is a game with a long history, and as we got deeper into the project we realized that our Sierra heritage as well as the game's history were a powerful combination,” says Ken Williams, Founder and CEO, Cygnus Entertainment. “When we began this project we received overwhelming support from every direction because of what this game ment to an entire generation. We’ve had the fortune to watch kids and adults alike enjoying the game just as we did all those years ago, and we can’t wait to bring it to all of our fans today!”</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215540/Colossal_Cave/" target="_blank">on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>
<p><em>The PR mail said it would be on Humble and itch.io too but it does not seem live on either.</em></p>

      <title>Inspired by Boulder Dash and Supaplex, Gem Worlds is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh the nostalgia is heavy with this one! Gem Worlds is inspired directly by the likes of Boulder Dash and Supaplex. I didn't play either, but it's also very similar to one I did play and LOVED on Amiga called Emerald Mine.</p>
<p>This will be something of an acquired taste I think, more for my older readers, since it's not especially flashy but plays on nostalgia from the classics and I love to cover everything from tiny solo games to the latest AAA as long as they could be interesting. I also spent far too many days inside playing the likes of Emerald Mine.</p>
<p><em>Have a little look at the trailer below:</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hxtclWR-yQM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/171787657cf29380f2b907b0745291a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hxtclWR-yQM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore 50 uniquely-generated levels across 5 unique worlds.</li>
<li>Collect gems, dodge boulders, escape to survive.</li>
<li>Fight monsters (or avoid them) using melee or a variety of skills.</li>
<li>Unlock and upgrade more than 10 diverse skills as the game progresses.</li>
<li>Exploit biome-specific obstacles including mines, icicles, cactii, and more.</li>
<li>3+ hours of play time.</li>

      <title>SurrounDead looks like a mix of DayZ and Project Zomboid</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's early days for the game yet with it in Early Access but SurrounDead could be a promising one to play online with some friends.</p>
<p>From the description and footage shown from the developer, it looks like an odd blending of DayZ and Project Zomboid. However, it also seems to be heavily inspired by another called DeadPoly which is lesser known than the two aforementioned bigger games but if you've seen that you'll know what to expect.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jP121rIaaQw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4849daf089fbd9ede70cb8e0bea0d9bd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jP121rIaaQw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What makes this different then? Why am I mentioning it? Well, I initially thought it actually had a Native Linux version whereas DeadPoly does not. It has the SteamOS icon on Steam but checking SteamDB, there's no Linux content or launch configuration. Only after I checked the system requirements, did I spot something that's somewhat unique, as it directly lists Proton for Linux as what they support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8549866651675182317gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8549866651675182317gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It might not exactly be the first time, my memory escapes me on who did it first, but it's in the single digits on the number of developers noting support being official for Proton in this way so I thought it was interesting to highlight.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Travel through a desolate post apocalyptic landscape.</li>
<li>Fight zombies and possibly worse.</li>
<li>Find many different firearms, melee weapons and equipment.</li>
<li>Trade with survivors in trader hideouts or safe zones to get that one piece of equipment you need.</li>
<li>Barricade buildings or find your self somewhere in the wilderness to escape to.</li>
<li>Loot varied locations to improve yourself, but be aware of your surroundings.</li>
<li>Weather and day/night cycles, be careful.</li>
<li>Manage your stats to stay alive.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Free strategy shooter game Unvanquished v0.54 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free, open source and full of bugs (the squishable kind) — Unvanquished is a mixture of strategy and an FPS with a new release v0.54 out now. Unvanquished is a fork of Tremulous, for those don't know it's similar in style to Natural Selection with aliens versus humans fighting it out with each having a little base to build.</p>
<p>This release brings with it official ARM support for Linux, so you can now play Unvanquished on your Raspberry Pi and many other ARM systems. Some of course might be too slow but it also means you can now run a server for it on ARM too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9447110311675181444gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9447110311675181444gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Unvanquished v0.54 screenshot.</em></p>
<p>More polishing work went into the UI this time around too with the map load screen now showing the map name and author name and map authors can be a little creative with the level shots now too. On top of the modded servers can also be a little more creative, as they can have their own welcome screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17000929741675180516gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17000929741675180516gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Welcome screen example shot.</em></p>
<p>Speaking of online play, the developers improved colour code support for things like usernames, so it doesn't count towards the character count limit.</p>
<p>Other improvements include an update to the lucifer cannon model, there's no negative momentum anymore impacting players as the game goes on, rockets no longer follow dead players and a bug affecting Marauder zap chains is fixed. There's also a bunch of new icons , spectator mode fixes and numerous fixes to bots to improve how they play so they should actually be a bit more menacing and fun to play against. Bot navigation got the biggest upgrade, with their navigation mesh (what they use to pathfind) now being generated in-game solving many problems.</p>
<p>Plenty of changes to the graphics rendering was added like the ability to disable light styles, files for optional features when disabled are no longer loaded, serious issues with dynamic lights were solved along with many crash bugs being fixed.</p>
<p><em>Seems like 2023 is going to be a good year for Unvanquished.</em></p>

      <title>Steam Deck and desktop Beta fix up more on-screen keyboard bugs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bugs! Kill 'em all! Would you like to know more? Valve have a new Steam Deck and Desktop Steam Beta available with a few bugs being stomped. As per usual, there's some shared between them since they mostly use the same bits of the Steam client now.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck here's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3635002625426139933" target="_blank">what's changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed right-shift and nearby keys of onscreen keyboard sometimes not working.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed "a" and "c" keys triggering an animation on the game details page.</li>
<li>Fixed controller guide button shortcut summary showing an incorrect icon.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed an issue where the deadzone slider would get clipped in the controller configurator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">And then a few differences for Desktop Steam so here's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659772423378761673" target="_blank">what's changed</a> there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed right-shift and nearby keys of onscreen keyboard sometimes not working.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed "a" and "c" keys triggering an animation on the game details page.</li>
<li>Big Picture Mode only supports modifying network settings when running on SteamOS / Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Hid button to view Steam Deck manual in Quick Access on non-Deck devices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixed an issue where the deadzone slider would get clipped in the controller configurator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">One day this year, I really hope I get to excitedly write about how either Valve or NVIDIA fix the terrible performance of the New Big Picture Mode on Desktop. Apparently one does not simply <s>walk into Mordor</s> make it work well. I'm sure if it was easy, it would have been sorted by now.</p>

      <title>Forspoken gets an update to improve Steam Deck performance</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/" target="_blank">Forspoken</a> has been controversial for quite a lot of a reasons but also a title many were looking forward to. The release was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/forspoken-desktop-linux-spoof-steam-deck/" target="_blank">bit rough</a> but the developers are cleaning it up now and it has some Steam Deck fixes.</p>
<p>Here's the patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Adjustments have been made to HDR mode.</li>
<li>Localization and spelling fixes.</li>
<li>Various minor fixes.</li>
<li>Certain technical issues occurring on Steam Deck has been fixed.</li>
<li>Performance and stability has been improved on Steam Deck.  </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Amazing to see games from publishers like Square Enix pay attention to a Linux gaming device, we're going to see a lot more of this over the next year. Although, it would be great if developers did these things before release, especially with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-in-stock-japan-hong-kong-south-korea-taiwan/" target="_blank">roll-out of the Steam Deck in Asia</a> going strong, there's going to be a lot more people using it now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8463547201675173182gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8463547201675173182gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I still personally think £64.99 is a crazy price for it, so I won't be going into any depth on it myself. It currently has a Mixed user rating on Steam from over 2,000 people and the peak player count dropped pretty harshly quickly after release so it's not exactly popular.</p>
<p>They did update the demo too, so for those of you who wish to try it out that might give you a good idea now.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The work to improve gaming performance on Steam Deck and Linux desktops for AMD GPUs is always ongoing, and it seems we're set for another nice improvement to how smooth games are.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems is shader compile stutter, where you play through a game first-time and see it stuttering about all over the place until the shaders get built. It's less of a problem in plenty of games if Valve have them ready for download but that's not always possible, and doesn't always solve it. Some games also update a lot and need shader cache updates often, this will again help with those times where it’s not yet available. For games not on Steam, it will also be a huge bonus win for performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0</a> released back in November 2022 included some major changes to work around it, and work is ongoing in the AMD GPU driver RADV to make use it what's needed. Later NVIDIA drivers have it and the improvements there are quite impressive but the current experimental work in the AMD GPU driver needed work.</p>
<p>As Valve contractor Mike Blumenkrantz <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/through-the-loop/" target="_blank">blogged about</a> recently going over work they and others have done regarding the VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library Vulkan API extension, and the blog post is well worth a read for some background into it but to cut to the chase — the result of the work is a "50,000%" improvement in fast-linking which for <em>gamers</em> should result in a much improved experience for certain games.</p>
<p>The work should hopefully come in Mesa 23.1 due later this year where use of the noted Vulkan extension above should hopefully be turned on by default, and then for Steam Deck players specifically hopefully in something like SteamOS 3.5.</p>
<p>This and more was covered in my recent video:</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 23: Ready, Set, Go!</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-22-happy-hacking/" target="_blank">Part 22: Happy Hacking</a></strong></p>
<p>If you look at the commercial Linux gaming catalogue at the turn of the millennium, in amongst all of the 3D shooters and strategic simulations being released, one glaring omission seems to have been the lack of any racing games. Loki Software never ported any to Linux, nor did any of the other porting houses. This left a void for the free gaming community to fill. One of the first be off to the races was <em>Trophy</em>, whose development started in March 2000.</p>
<p>The latest version of <em>Trophy</em> I can run from Red Hat Linux 7.3 is version 1.1.3 from before the game was ported to ClanLib 0.8 and beyond. To do this, I first had to grab the ClanLib-0.6.1-fr1.i386.rpm, ClanLib-sound-0.6.1-fr1.i386.rpm, and Hermes-1.3.2-fr3.i386.rpm pacakges from freshrpms. Even then, the included binary that came bundled with the 1.1.3 source tarball would still not load, as it was built against libstdc++5 which is too new.</p>
<p>This is the same problem I had when attempting to launch later versions of <em>Cube</em>, but since I could satisfy all the other build dependencies in this case, I was able to compile my own binary linked to my older version of glibc. To do this, all I had to do was run "make clean" followed by "make" in the trophy directory. This did mean I also had to install all of the ClanLib and Hermes development packages, which from freshrpms came to a whopping eleven packages in total.</p>
<p>Even then the game window still came up labelled as "Trophy 1.0.6" instead, but both the "Snake" and "Rally" tracks were present and correct, so I know I built the right version. Beyond that the only other bug I encountered was that I was unable to change the colour of my car using the arrow keys as the menu suggests, with the new game screen only seeming to allow me to input my name. That said, I am also unsure what the "Hall Of Fame" is even for at this point.</p>
<p><em>Trophy </em>is a top down racer which distinguishes itself by having an emphasis on using extras such as vehicular combat to get ahead of your rivals. You can fire a machine gun at other cars by pressing the "x" key, drop bombs with the "c" key, and give yourself a turbo boost by holding down the "a" key. All of these are powered by collectibles found scattered about the track, right up until you finish the fifth and final lap. The result is a strong arcade feel without being a kart racer.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14509378931674772712gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14509378931674772712gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2622579241674772713gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2622579241674772713gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>The graphics are appealing if a little compressed, with the tracks themselves being large for the time 1200x1200px bitmaps created in several layers through use of the GNU Image Manipulation Program. In fact, an entire track designer manual was written that goes over the process of building a track, all to encourage <em>Trophy </em>players to make a submit their own creations. This manual can still be read from the <em>Trophy </em>website hosted on SourceForge.</p>
<p>Work on <em>Trophy</em> advanced in fits in starts, with the latest 2.0.4 release from 2019 still depending on the ancient ClanLib 1.0 software development kit. But while <em>Trophy</em> ossified from a technical perspective over the last decade or so, the gameplay became deeply enriched starting with the 2.0.0 release. This was the first to feature a championship mode as well as a shop where you can buy vehicle upgrades and new cars, giving the money you collect a real purpose at long last.</p>
<p>With all of these additions in particular, <em>Trophy</em> reminds me very much of <em>Mini-Car Racing</em> as published by eGames, one of my brother's favourite games growing up. Whether this a coincidence or not is hard to say, as both games first released in the same year, but they do both have you race on the moon. <em>Mini-Car Racing</em>, incidentally, is also one of many older games which are far easier to get working with WINE than on modern versions of Windows today.</p>
<p>Looking at the TODO list included alongside <em>Trophy </em>shows that<em> </em>the similarities were planned to go even deeper than that, with the inclusion of oil slicks, rockets, and jump points on the tracks. All of which compounds the feeling that <em>Trophy</em> does still have a great deal of unfulfilled potential, with networked multiplayer also having been mooted at one point. There is a legacy here that would be great for someone to build upon, should the right contributor be found.</p>
<p>Which free and open source game projects take off and which stagnant often seems to be at the gift of chance, but at least here there is always the option that some new life can be breathed into them, if given enough interest. The same can even be said for what is to this day my mother's favourite computer game, a free software title which for most of the 2000s was one of the most lauded Linux games to ever be released for the platform.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns gets an update to help Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns is a great strategy game from the developer of XCOM, and now it should actually much better on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Two major problems were broken Cloud Saves and a crash for plenty of people at certain points, with both now hopefully solved! Always nice to see such major titles getting some special attention for my favourite gaming platform and the stability fixes specifically should also help players on Linux desktop too!</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/368260/view/3678912721785348966" target="_blank">update</a> they noted this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>General performance improvements</li>
<li>General stability fixes</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck Virtual Keyboard fixes</li>
<li>Steam/Deck/Link save fixes, including cloud syncing</li>
<li>Steam Deck stability fixes</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see my previous video on the game below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="69g7N0celto"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1440839a02821bab3953221a0b90c044.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/69g7N0celto" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely looking forward to playing more of it, although I really hate that it has micro-transactions, that still feels gross. They already have a Season Pass, which actually gives you everything extra with the micro-transactions to buy extras individually, it just feels completely stupid to have both and confuse players. Aside from that, I don't have a lot to complain about, the battles are a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Deadpool just arrived recently too:</p>

      <title>Slavic fantasy-adventure The End of the Sun gets a demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for something just a bit different? The End of the Sun is a Slavic-fantasy adventure and you can try it out now. At release it will have Native Linux support and the demo has a Linux version ready too.</p>
<p>About the game: "The End of the Sun is a first-person exploration and adventure story-based game, set in the world of Slavic rites, beliefs and legends. The small village becomes a place of mysterious events, through which the line between myth and reality begins to fade perilously. As the ashter (Slavic sorcerer) who is gifted with the ability to travel in time and knowledge about Navia (the otherworld where human fates shape), following the trail of the unusual fugitive, you come to a mysterious village. Unfortunately, you cannot find anyone there, at least not in a way you expected to. All you can see around are burned hearths."</p>
<p>The developers say you can expect around an hour gameplay from the demo, with English and Polish full audio with 9 languages planned for the full release that will be sometime in Q4 2023.</p>
<p>You can see their new teaser below:</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.etlegacy.com/" target="_blank">ET: Legacy</a> continues carrying the torch of the classic multiplayer title Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, with a new release out that has lots of fixes.

      <title>Adventure puzzler Myst now Steam Deck Verified, will adjust graphics automatically</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Myst, the remake of the 1993 classic, has been updated and is now Steam Deck Verified so you can go and get as confused as I was by it. I've not played the 2021 remake myself but it sure does look good, and I have some fond memories of trying to figure out the original.</p>
<p>The latest update to the game notes full Steam Deck support with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features </p>
<ul>
<li>Myst will now autodetect to optimal graphics settings when playing on Steam Deck for the first time (this will not affect games that are streamed to Steam Deck; it only affects game instances from installations on the Steam Deck itself). Autodetect can be used in the graphics settings menu to bring you back to these optimal settings on the Steamdeck version of Myst at any time.</li>
<li>Updated credits localization for a few members.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fixes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Spoiler, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">(SPOILER) Fix for a little piece of Atrus’ hair floating away from his head while in D’ni.</div>
</details>
</li>
<li>Fix for player height being a bit off in VR when descending some ladders around Myst, regardless of Quick Travel On Ladders enabled or not.</li>
<li>Fix for “(Restart Needed)” showing up next to the ray tracing option if you simply auto detect your graphics settings in the graphics settings menu, without modifying the ray tracing setting at all.</li>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-48 out now with updates to DXVK, VKD3D-Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-48" target="_blank">GE-Proton v7-48</a>, the community supported version of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> translation layer, is out now with upgrades to various components to continue making Steam Deck and Linux gaming better.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated proton-wine bleeding edge.</li>
<li>Updated vkd3d-proton.</li>
<li>Updated dxvk.</li>
<li>Update dxvk-nvapi.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>These are all the various components that translates Windows API calls to something Linux understands, and the parts that translates Direct3D to Vulkan.</em></p>
<p>The developer notes it also includes fixes for Dead Space thanks to pulling in the latest work for each of the above.</p>
<p>On top of that it's noted that a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/8153" target="_blank">problem</a> with Monster Hunter: Rise is actually a graphics driver issue for the AMD RADV driver, which has fix <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20941" target="_blank">pending</a>. So the fix for that is expected in a future Mesa driver release.</p>
<p>Here's an example guide on installing GE-Proton</p>

      <title>Valve fixed up Dead Space on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you waiting for news on Dead Space becoming more playable on Steam Deck — Valve have already delivered.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/the-new-dead-space-is-sadly-a-great-big-mess-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">original article and video</a>, it was an example of just how bad some brand new releases can be, especially when they don't have a shader cache built up for it. Thankfully, Valve apparently continue burning the midnight oil on weekends to get <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> fixed up.</p>
<p>Not only have they put up an <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1619247174965137409" target="_blank">initial</a> shader cache now, they've also <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1619377996615528448" target="_blank">updated</a> Proton Hotfix to work around the map crashing the game and even included a little performance fix too. The result of all of that together is quite amazing compared with how it was at release.</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="liIh1i7vE1E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9be5baf5ba3c600041cda43290c07a79.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/liIh1i7vE1E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Don't go expecting perfection though just yet of course, it’s a brand new big budget title and there may be some lingering issues as Valve is reacting quickly as the problems appear but their dedication to it is truly admirable. Shows how much they care about their players having a good experience, even for titles that haven't been through Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Great work Valve. Hopefully one day we won't have to wait around for shaders to get sorted. Developers using the Vulkan API would be a good start.</p>
<p><em>Be sure to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">follow me on YouTube</a> for more videos.</em></p>
<p>For Linux <em>desktop</em> players curious on how it runs: after allowing Steam time to sort shader pre-caching (which took quite a while — and froze Steam completely at one point). Running it on Fedora Linux 37 with an NVIDIA 2080Ti and an AMD Ryzen 5800X, it does work out of the box.</p>
<p>It still needed about 1 minute for the <em>in-game</em> shader loading before the intro logo screens. From there, it also gave the freezing issue on the loading screens the Steam Deck originally saw but after about 30 seconds that went to the menu just fine. </p>
<p>Performance can be problematic though even on desktop, as there's plenty of shader stuttering and the intro scene in the ship had at least one full freeze for a good few seconds still. So while the shader system works great for the Steam Deck, desktop Linux is obviously a whole range of hardware combinations so it's not as easy for Valve to sort. Thankfully, desktops generally have a <em>lot</em> more power to push through the shader spikes but even so, repeatedly stuttering and multi-second <em>freezing</em> when it loads new sections in is not great. Hopefully Valve have more VKD3D-Proton performance improvements coming for desktop.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck and Steam Beta fix on-screen keyboard, Gyro improvements, Linux input fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>More goodies coming to the Steam Deck and Steam Desktop Beta, as Valve sure do like to work quickly to solve bugs and add features. Once again a lot is shared between the two but there are some differences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed onscreen keyboard not visible in-game when opened with gamepad</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Gyro Calibration UI: Gyro rotation readings are displayed to help diagnose drift issues.</li>
<li>Autocalibration of Gyro Drift has been reworked. After the initial calibration, setting down a controller on a stable surface silently recalculates drift compensation within a few seconds. Movement Threshold values can be manually tweaked - useful if you notice drift re-appear when the controller is in hand.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Steam Deck Desktop / New Big Picture Mode / Overlay</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Steam Chat window scaling</li>
<li>Fixed onscreen keyboard windows refusing to close</li>
<li>Fixed regression where some Remote Play Together dialogs no longer worked</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for Linux desktop, Valve also solved this issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed keyboard input to Steam menus on Linux</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659772423367878641" target="_blank">Desktop changelog</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3635002625415252852" target="_blank">Steam Deck changelog</a>.</p>
<p>What are you current most wanted fixes?</p>
<p>For me, I really want them to figure out what's causing the New Big Picture Mode to perform so poorly on Linux. It's pretty much unusable with NVIDIA.</p>

      <title>Watch Dogs: Legion from Ubisoft arrives on Steam, playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's yet another Steam release from Ubisoft, as they continue dumping their older titles on Steam. Watch Dogs: Legion is here and playable on Steam Deck. We've already had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/fix-ghost-recon-breakpoint-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Ghost Recon Breakpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">The Division 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/immortals-fenyx-rising-now-on-steam-but-quite-messy-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Immortals Fenyx Rising</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-impressive-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/trackmania-steam-playable-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Trackmania</a> on the way soon too. Clearly, Ubisoft want the Steam monies.</p>
<p>The good news with Watch Dogs: Legion is that it doesn't put up much of a fuss on Steam Deck. Much like previous Ubisoft release there's no real Steam integration so no Steam Achievements, and once again it has Denuvo Anti-Tamper so if you keep changing Proton versions for testing and / or keep swapping between machines, it might eventually lock you out for 24 hours if you've done it too much (very annoying).</p>
<p>Apart from that, it's pretty smooth sailing in terms of how stable it is but performance like a lot of open-world games needs you locking it to 30FPS because it cannot keep a stable 40. I tested between DirectX 11 and DirectX 12, with DirectX 12 clearly being a lot smoother overall.</p>

      <title>The new Dead Space is sadly a great big mess on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space" target="_blank">Dead Space</a> got a remake that was released today and I was <em>incredibly</em> excited by it but sadly it's just a mess. Not the game story, graphics or anything like that but specifically the performance on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The publisher and developer haven't said it's supported, and Valve haven't given it a Deck Verified rating but many were no doubt like me and very keen to play it. There's numerous problems with it that I'm going to explain and some of them will no doubt get fixed up over the next couple of weeks through performance patches to the game, and with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> updates I expect to come as well.</p>
<p>Trying with both Proton Experimental and Proton Hotfix (that's the default set by Valve for it), it's no different between them. This is also installed on the Steam Deck's SSD, just to rule out any SD Card issues as I wanted to be sure on that too. <em>The game does warn you it's designed for SSDs and it even claims users on plain HDDs may see errors.</em></p>
<p>From massive loading spikes, that will often completely freeze the Steam Deck, to issues causing the Steam Deck to reboot, it's full of problems. Some will be improved when it has a full shader cache, while others will need a Proton update. Trying to look at the map, for example, will hard-crash the game and lose your progress every time. Even if you struggle a bit through the great many massive performance drops to get it to perform better later on thanks to some shaders being built up, the map crash and Steam Deck reboots (same happens in God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Breakpoint) just make it unplayable. Even when some shaders are built, plenty of areas will also still just drop performance hard with stutters to load it all.</p>
<p>See a video below highlighting just how bad the first couple runs are:</p>

<p><strong>Update 28/01/23</strong>: I've <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6486#issuecomment-1407385214" target="_blank">provided</a> Valve with multiple crash-log files on the issues. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck now in stock across Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Komodo PR sent word that there's no longer a reservation queue to purchase a Steam Deck across Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Originally, much like the western launch of the Steam Deck, you had to wait in queue until it was your turn to purchase due to stock levels. Now, that's mostly no longer the case. The only one that isn't in stock is the 64GB model specifically in Japan, where Komodo said it was "backordered at this time" so it's obviously been a bit too popular there.</p>
<p>Komodo states they've seen "high demand", and the official Docking Station is still in a reservation queue for Japan and Taiwan but is in stock for Hong Kong and South Korea.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchases an in-stock item will have it shipped within two weeks of the purchase, while out of stock in the reservation queue will be filled as "quickly as possible" with emails inviting you to purchase going as soon as they're available in the order reservations were made.</p>
<p>You can order a Steam Deck from Valve's partner <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">Komodo</a> across Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Nice to see that the Asian markets are reacting well to the Steam Deck, let's hope it keeps up so more people can appreciate just how good Linux can be for gaming. I expect this year we will see Valve announce new regions too, further expanding the reach of the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>The overlooked gorgeous pixel-art Lila&#39;s Sky Ark is now on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fresh chance for me to tell you to take a look at the overlooked gem that is Lila's Sky Ark, as it's now on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/lilas_sky_ark" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? The second game from Monolith of Minds who first gave us the action-adventure <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/resolutiion-is-out-now/" target="_blank">Resolutiion</a>. Technically this game is Resolutiion's prequel story, not that you need to know that as it's entirely standalone. Lila's psychedelic world is in grave danger. Help her and her eccentric friends stop the Conductor’s minions from destroying all things musical and magical in this meditative action-adventure game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="B98fLZUfsIM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/326d15cc4e355c6cbb57dc26ed7a8656.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/B98fLZUfsIM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore Lila's pyschedlic world and get to know her quirky cast of friends, such as the fantastically bespectacled Doctor-Father-Sir and the raven shopkeepers.</li>
<li>Search this groovy dreamscape for hidden secrets, recipes, and even new glasses for a certain Sir.</li>
<li>Unravel Lila's puzzle-like story, which explores themes such as loss, loneliness, grief, and depression, in this moving prequel to Resolutiion.</li>
<li>Battle music-inspired enemies and punishing bosses using an array of strange weapons unlocked through alchemy recipes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Released originally back in April 2022, amongst many other fantastic titles it was completely overlooked by most with only 67 user reviews on Steam (and only 8 of those gave it a thumbs down).</p>
<p>Now you can grab it on <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/lilas_sky_ark" target="_blank">GOG</a> on top of <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/lilas-sky-ark?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1573390/Lilas_Sky_Ark/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Trackmania heads to Steam and the devs say it&#39;s playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackmania, the 2020 remake, is heading to Steam and the developers have started answering questions like — will it run on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>Even more Ubisoft coming back to Steam, what a treat. Following on from earlier Steam releases of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/fix-ghost-recon-breakpoint-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Ghost Recon Breakpoint</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">The Division 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/immortals-fenyx-rising-now-on-steam-but-quite-messy-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Immortals Fenyx Rising</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-impressive-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>. From Ubisoft Nadeo, it will be free to play when it hits Steam on February 2nd, so you can bet I'll be giving it to a go so you know what to expect on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>Speaking on Twitter in their thread answering questions, they mentioned about the Steam Deck: "2. Can I play Trackmania with my Steam Deck? We are still waiting for the official review for Steam Deck from Valve to know if it is possible. From our tests, the game is playable on the device.". Nice to see some more official testing being done! Would be good to see more of that from Ubisoft and others.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yjmzsOOrEnQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c377f22ad7f0c3a5225ceba3a804e995.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yjmzsOOrEnQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2225070/Trackmania/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Why are Ubisoft coming back to Steam? The answer is clear: money talks. Ubisoft want more of it, and clearly they're not doing as well as they would like as mentioned in their recent financial <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/3nCTlhd4Dke8pe308etZ6e/b11d0bfe9c5094f0eecd44541c6ba0b8/Ubisoft_update_January_23_English_Final.pdf" target="_blank">statement</a> from CEO Yves Guillemot: "We are clearly disappointed by our recent performance. We are facing contrasted market dynamics as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and everlasting live games, in the context of worsening economic conditions affecting consumer spending.".</p>

      <title>Rhythm adventure Hi-Fi RUSH from Tango Gameworks gets a surprise release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tango Gameworks, developer of The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, along with publisher Bethesda just stealth released their latest game called Hi-Fi RUSH.</p>
<p>It’s an awesome looking rhythm adventure with a bit of Jet Set Radio styling. You join with the protagonist Chai having a music player in their chest and a makeshift junk guitar you swing around at enemies with the music. Here you’re fighting against an evil tech megacorp and the characters, world and combat all flow along with the music and it has some great cartoony cutscenes too. It even sprinkles in plenty of comedy, and there’s been a good few laugh out loud moments from me.</p>
<p>At release it was rated as Steam Deck Playable by Valve. <em>Playable</em>, not Verified, due to it apparently having text that can at times be too small. It does otherwise work great out of the box though, clearly this had some testing before release by either Valve or the developer / publisher directly. Have a look in the video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Gsws9AueNLU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b862524da37ad65f261b7d9bf627257e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Gsws9AueNLU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since this is a rhythm game, you do need to pay attention to the music. I’ll admit I actually find rhythm games genuinely difficult because I just don’t have any rhythm for it but it’s fun to try and the music fits it perfectly. Here though, they clearly thought of people like me too, as you can tap a button at any time to bring up a rhythm bar to help you time your attacks correctly.</p>
<p>As you go through the game collecting scrap, you eventually get to use it at your hideout with a new friend who helps you with upgrades to attacks to give you new combos, special attacks, items and permanent upgrades. So it only gets more epic as you go through.</p>
<p>While it has some fantastic music, something I of course appreciate is that it has a streamer mode, so for videos and livestreaming, it will replace some tunes from popular artists that would get you a copyright hit with original tunes made just for the game. It’s nice to see some developers care.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Chai Versus the World - Labeled ‘defective’ after a shady corporate experiment mistakenly fuses a music player to his heart, Chai must now fight for his freedom in a slick animated world where everything – platforming puzzles, enemy attacks and even the colorful gags &amp; banter - are synced to the beat.</li>
<li>Open Up the Mosh Pit! - Take on armies of corporate drones (read: actual robots) in satisfying, rhythm-amplified combat. Time your moves to pull off flashy Beat Hits, hard-hitting special abilities and even combination attacks with your allies! Want to show off? Go further and tap into the beat to amp up your skills and earn those covetous S-rank scores.</li>
<li>Rowdy Rebels Vs. Badass Bosses - Lead a squad of colorful teammates and take the fight to the heart of an, er, heartless corporation. Square off with each department’s boss, from Production to Marketing to Finance, each more ready to protect the company’s bottom line than the last in over-the-top battle sequences accompanied by their own music tracks!</li>
<li>Grab Your Headphones - Tap your toes to a killer mixtape of original music, as well as songs by Nine Inch Nails, The Prodigy, The Joy Formidable and more! Want to show off your skills to a live streaming audience? Fret not: Hi-Fi RUSH includes a streamer-friendly alternate audio mode to keep you from broadcasting copyrighted music.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of the box on Medium settings performance hasn’t been a problem at all on Steam Deck. Some momentarily blips here and there, but for the most part it’s been impressively smooth to the point that I haven’t felt like I needed to change any settings and that’s just fantastic. Exactly the kind of experience I want to see more of on the Steam Deck when it comes to performance.</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush not only has a great artistic style to it but it makes interesting use of different perspectives too. It has a fully 3D environment you run through, but at times it will also pull the camera back to be side-on like a classic platform and some of the bigger battles give you a special area to run around with multiple stages to fight through. There’s a <em>lot</em> to enjoy about this one.</p>
<p>While this is only an early impression because it just came out of nowhere, I’m seriously impressed and enjoying the heck out of it. The only downside so far, is that it comes with Denuvo Anti-tamper.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1817230/HiFi_RUSH/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>4A Games release a full Metro Exodus SDK for modders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>4A Games have done something quite awesome. They've <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/412020/view/5254045511872508445" target="_blank">released</a> a SDK for people to make full game modifications of Metro Exodus. </p>
<p>This isn't some basic level modding abilities either, they've gone the full mile and released their own editor that enables people to create fully standalone content too. It has integrated <a href="https://mod.io/" target="_blank">mod.io</a> support as well, so it's not tied to Steam. They said it includes "some tutorial levels and as an example of a fully featured, shipped level, we’ve included a full unpacked Metro Exodus sandbox level for you to tear apart using our tools".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11206653671674736853gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11206653671674736853gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One thing to be clear on though is that they're <em>not</em> entering the game engine licensing business. So, you cannot sell your works with it or put it behind any kind of paywall. This is just something they decided to do for their modding community. Pretty fun to see another game engine going a lot more open like this. Hopefully in future they'll perhaps open it up even more if this goes well.</p>
<p>The Exodus SDK only has a native build for Windows but we know their editor is clearly able to make Native Linux builds too.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/metro-exodus?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/412020/Metro_Exodus/" target="_blank">Steam</a> - both stores have it with 75% off right now too.</p>

      <title>Developer of point and click adventure Splittown looking at Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your adventure games? Here's one to keep an eye on. The developer of Splittown has mentioned they're looking into Native Linux support. They're making the game with Visionaire Studio, which has Linux support, so hopefully it won't be too much trouble if they decide to do it.</p>
<p>Writing on their Steam forum <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2117400/discussions/0/3321988498676426081/?tscn=1674387698#c3759977302535798342" target="_blank">they said</a> earlier this week "FYI I'm looking to make a Linux build hopefully over the weekend or next week the latest. Thank you for your patience!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uLwUO14sW7Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/43ca9c44ea11240fbf96faf7af9e7d4f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uLwUO14sW7Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cold War has split the world in two, both figuratively and literally. The Great Divide spans across the globe with an impenetrable mess of concrete and barbed wire sandwiched between the two blocs. You are Leonard Nimby; stone-faced former top agent of IM5, hot on the trail of a shrink gun stolen from you by a villanous mayoral candidate on the eve of a fateful election.<br/>
<br/>
Splittown is a point-and-click adventure game inspired by 90s classics such as Day of the Tentacle and Sam &amp; Max Hit The Road. You'll crack confounding puzzles, stuff improbable amounts of items in your pockets, and engage in humorous dialogue with a colorful cast of characters on an adventure that will push your wits to the limit.</p>

      <title>Might and Magic 6, 7 and 8 get an open source reimplementation with OpenEnroth</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to play Might and Magic 6, 7 and 8 on modern systems with an updated game engine? Well, <a href="https://github.com/OpenEnroth/OpenEnroth" target="_blank">OpenEnroth</a> looks mighty promising.</p>
<p>It's nowhere near finished yet with only Might and Magic 7 playable but it's regularly seeing contributions to keep working away on it. Support for 6 &amp; 8 will be added in the future, obviously they need to start somewhere. The idea, like a lot of these open source projects including OpenMW for Morrowind or OpenRA for Red Alert (and others), is to build a platform to have it run on modern systems with enhancements while keeping the original game feel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18047092811674735832gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18047092811674735832gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13650682561674735835gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13650682561674735835gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I've added it to my big list of releases to follow, so whenever there's a juicy update on it I'll let you know.</p>
<p><em>Nice to see a good few more projects like this appear over the last few years.</em></p>

      <title>Atari announce another 80s classic revival with Caverns of Mars: Recharged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another revamp of a classic is on the way with Atari once again teaming up with SneakyBox, as the 1981 title Caverns of Mars is releasing as Caverns of Mars: Recharged.</p>
<p>In Caverns of Mars: Recharged, players progress through 30 missions set within three primary "depths" of Mars, descending deeper and deeper into enemy territory. Blast through oncoming hostile fire, bull through debris and obstructions, and dodge other obstacles all while keeping a close eye on fuel and ammo reserves. Featuring a unique local co-op mode, players can team up with one partner assigned to navigation while the other player shoots the drone. From the trailer below, it looks pretty good!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="d0zp4P9SHUo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7199a8697e0d5792868c66a2153a11e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/d0zp4P9SHUo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Caverns of Mars is a great early example of a game designed for Atari’s 8-bit computers, which makes it a perfect addition to the Atari Recharged series,” said Atari CEO Wade Rosen. “It’s an intensely fun arcade-style experience in both single player and two-player co-op.”</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fully Destructible: </strong>The environments in <em>Caverns of Mars: Recharged </em>are fully destructible; don’t hesitate to blast through any obstruction in your way, but be wary of fuel reserves. Each shot depletes fuel, but speedy travel grants time bonuses! </li>
<li><strong>Arcade Mode:</strong> Traverse the depths of Mars in three stages, strategically choosing upgrades and power-ups that will make each run unique.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge Mode: </strong>Progress through 30 bite-sized challenges across navigation, combat, and other exciting scenarios. </li>
<li><strong>Perky Power-Ups:</strong> Collect weapons that will change your strategy on the fly for tactical maneuvering. Carve a new path with a well-aimed railgun shot or let the spread of a shotgun blast do the talking for you! </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can wishlist / follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2213980/Caverns_of_Mars_Recharged/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's releasing in March and will have Native Linux support like previous titles developed by SneakyBox.</p>

      <title>Lots more EA games get a Steam Deck Playable rating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has again continued to go through various EA games that were previously problematic on Steam Deck due to the new EA App, with lots of them now marked as Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>They only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ea-games-playable-on-steam-deck-sims-4-jedi-fallen-order/" target="_blank">just recently</a> tweaked a few others including Battlefield 1, Jedi Fallen Order, Sims 4 and Titanfall 2 and so they've continued on now. Nice to see Valve are acting on all their work going into <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> for improving Windows to Linux compatibility for games. <em>I'm surprised it took this long though.</em></p>
<p>Here's all the latest games I've found that have been bumped up to Playable with them now using Proton Experimental by default since that has all the EA App fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Way Out</li>
<li>Battlefield 4</li>
<li>Battlefield V</li>
<li>It Takes Two</li>
<li>Madden NFL 21</li>
<li>Madden NFL 22</li>
<li>Madden NFL 23</li>
<li>Mass Effect: Andromeda Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</li>
<li>Mirror's Edge Catalyst</li>
<li>Need for Speed Heat</li>
<li>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered</li>
<li>Need for Speed Most Wanted</li>
<li>Need for Speed Rivals</li>
<li>Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2: Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>Unravel Two</li>
</ul>
<p>This long list only goes to show just how much of a ridiculous <em>nuisance</em> third-party launchers on Steam can be. There's often simply no need for them, other than extra advertising for big publishers. One day, I hope this repeating launcher problem gets solved for good, it's frustrating to have games work great and then suddenly one update later they're full of issues because of an extra launcher.</p>

      <title>ControllerTools plugin for Steam Deck now gives low battery notifications</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A Steam Deck plugin for Decky Loader that I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/this-new-steam-deck-external-controller-plugin-is-quite-useful/" target="_blank">recently mentioned</a>, ControllerTools, has a fresh update out to make it more useful.</p>
<p>Since I last covered it, all of this has been added in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New feature:</strong> Added low battery alerts. These can be toggled via a new UI setting.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when multiple controllers with the same product/vendor ID are plugged in.</li>
<li>Add a debug mode UI setting to enable verbose logging.</li>
<li>There isn't support yet for battery capacity for Xbox controllers connected over USB. Hide the percentage indicator for now.</li>
<li>Added hacky support for Xbox controllers battery capacity.</li>
<li>Add more generic support for controllers and icon for Stadia.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully though, at some point Valve will be able to hook up their own built-in features like this for third-party controllers but until then ControllerTools really does add some useful stuff.</p>
<p>You can find the plugin on <a href="https://github.com/alphamercury/ControllerTools" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Installing it with Decky Loader is easy, since it has a built-in plugin store to just download various plugins all directly inside Gaming Mode on Steam Deck. This update is currently <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-plugin-database/pull/205" target="_blank">pending</a> approval, so it should be live sometime soon.</p>

      <title>Factorio is about to increase in price so be quick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of the awesome Factorio have announced that the price is about to go up, so if you still haven't purchased it now is the time. Honestly this truly is one of the best indie games ever made, with full Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck "Playable" too.</p>
<p>This is the third price rise in 7 years (at least going by GBP) and it's never been on sale either, so it's not like holding out for a big sale event on various stores is going to help.  The price will rise by $5 tomorrow (and likely the equivalent in your currency), January 26th, as announced by the official <a href="https://twitter.com/factoriogame/status/1616388275169628162" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good day Engineers,</p>
<p>Next week, on Thursday 26th January 2023,<br/>
We will increase the base price of Factorio from $30 to $35.</p>
<p>This is an adjustment to account for the level of inflation since the Steam release in 2016.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3647544351674645008gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3647544351674645008gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Why don't they ever put it on sale? It's a good question and their original <a href="https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?p=159626#p159626" target="_blank">answer</a> on this was about "respecting the players who have already purchased the game" and not to "reward the people who hold off on buying the game". It's a pretty fair point really and they've done well to sell so many copies without a sale with an Overwhelmingly Positive user rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam and Steam Deck Beta add the ability to move the on-screen keyboard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve continues to roll out new unstable releases of the Steam Client for Desktop and Steam Deck, with a new update giving the ability to move the on-screen keyboard. Looks like someone has been reading <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">my wishlist</a>.</p>
<p>In the Steam Deck <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3635002625404567687" target="_blank">Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Added ability to move the standalone &amp; overlay keyboard. The keyboard will cycle through a set of positions.</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed controller input in the windowed version of the controller configurator</li>
<li>Added mouse buttons to the events that will skip the start-up movie</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Desktop <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659772423356815885" target="_blank">Beta</a> included the above and additionally these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="plain-list-title">Added a notification when an Xbox controller is plugged in, but Windows settings prevent reading the Guide button (which prevents bringing up the Steam main menu and other functionality like chords).</p>
</li>
<li>Added a quick guided tour</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Right now, the ability to move the on-screen keyboard is a bit hit and miss. Sometimes it works, sometimes it vanishes needing you to open it again and sometimes doing it will then seemingly break Steam Input where only the touch screen then works on Steam Deck. So they have a lot more work to do on that. That's what a Beta is for though of course, to test. It also only seems to work in Desktop Mode and the locations are limited to top and bottom.</p>
<p>New Big Picture Mode is also still terribly buggy and slow on NVIDIA when trying it on Desktop, pretty much unusable. Hopefully Valve or NVIDIA can solve that.</p>

      <title>Forspoken needs desktop Linux to spoof being a Steam Deck to work</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 25/01/23</strong>: Valve are now <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/891390/history/?changeid=17495330" target="_blank">forcing</a> the spoofing of a Steam Deck server-side, so the workaround is no longer needed.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In a case of what the heck? Square Enix and Luminous Productions just released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1680880/Forspoken/" target="_blank">Forspoken</a>, which works on Steam Deck but it won't run on desktop Linux without spoofing it being a Steam Deck. One of those moments where I had to blink a good few times, wipe my glasses and let out a big sigh. </p>
<p>To run it on desktop Linux you can either load launch Steam directly with "-steamdeck" or by setting "SteamDeck=1 %command%" as a launch option for the game itself. No this isn't a joke. It's not entirely clear why but I'm not going to say the developer or publisher actively chose to block Linux desktop, it's more likely they just didn't think about what they were doing outside of letting it run on Steam Deck specifically (which runs SteamOS Linux).</p>
<p>Without that workaround, launching it on desktop Linux gives you this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19843946761674596859gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19843946761674596859gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>It "didn't be installed" on my <s>Windows</s> Linux.</em></p>
<p>But when launching with the workaround, well it's a different story. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13689737811674597651gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13689737811674597651gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Doesn't exactly seem very stable either, it would completely crash if I picked a different overall graphics preset. Some individual graphics settings made it completely crash too. I also couldn't get it to go above 30FPS, with Vsync off and a limit set to 120FPS it just wanted to stay at 30FPS (and plenty below that).</p>
<p>Looks like a rough launch with it being Mixed on Steam so far and plenty of critic reviews have not been particularly kind on it either. At £64.99 it just doesn't seem worth the price.</p>

      <title>Direct3D to Vulkan translator DXVK 2.1 adds HDR support, improves shader stutter issue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK, one of the secret sauces included with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> compatibility layer, has a big new release out now. <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.1" target="_blank">DXVK 2.1</a> adds in some big new features like HDR!</p>
<p>Currently, this new HDR support is quite limited though. No major Linux desktop environment actually supports HDR yet, so you will have to use <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> specifically with it. When paired up with vkd3d-proton version 2.8 or newer, it "will allow D3D12 games to detect and use the HDR10 color space if they support it". It's also only supported on AMD GPUs, and even there it needs special Linux kernel patches.</p>
<p>One that perhaps is more exciting, because pretty much everyone will benefit, is even more improvements to shader compilation. From the release notes it states the use of "pipeline libraries was extended to pipelines with tessellation or geometry shaders in order to further reduce stutter". On top of that, if your GPU driver supports it, more features of the VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 extension are being used to reduce stutter when MSAA is on.</p>
<p>Another performance upgrade is that DXVK will use fewer threads for background optimization of graphics pipelines, which may make games smoother on some systems but it doesn't change the <em>initial</em> shader compiling.</p>
<p>Some other improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new GLFW backend for Native Linux builds using DXVK.</li>
<li>More consistent D3D11 performance.</li>
<li>A workaround for the Uplay overlay getting stuck on.</li>
<li>Fixes for: Ashes of the Singularity, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Cardfight!! Vanguard, Gujian 3, Resident Evil 4 HD, Saints Row: The Third, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Sonic Frontiers and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I'm quite excited to see all the improvements. Hopefully it won't be too long before the Steam Deck and Proton together get upgraded to make use of it all.</p>

      <title>Wine 8.0 is out now with major compatibility improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wine 8.0 is out now, a big improvement over the last stable release with many upgrades for Windows to Linux compatibility across thousands of games and apps. This is part of what makes up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a>, the compatibility used on Steam Deck to run Windows games.</p>
<p>One of the major changes here is the conversion to the PE format for various modules. This format is used by Windows, and an important milestone for Wine to increase compatibility with copy protection, 32-bit applications on 64-bit hosts, Windows debuggers and more. Work is still to be done though to finish it properly, as some modules still need to be properly converted.</p>
<p>The Wine developers say they also implemented a "special syscall dispatcher", to avoid the overhead of a full NT system call to minimise the performance impact.</p>
<p>WoW64 was upgraded too, and once the final PE work is done, they say it will then be "fully possible" to run 32-bit Windows applications without needing 32-bit libraries. This is no doubt something many are looking forward to.</p>
<p>Lots of Media Foundation fixes and improvements too that should help audio and video issues across many apps and games, Direct2D upgrades, lots of optimizations for Direct3D and newly supported Direct3D 10 and 11 features are in, better steering wheel support, big improvements to controller hotplugging, better force feedback support, better support of DualShock and DualSense controllers, better support for CJK fonts and so on.</p>
<p>Absolutely lots more you can see in the <a href="https://www.winehq.org/announce/8.0" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully later this year Proton will see a full upgrade to the latest Wine release, to give us even more improvements for gaming on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental and GE-Proton 7-47 updates available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve gave <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">Proton Experimental</a> a small update with two improvements, plus for users of <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> you may want to know about an important version bump there too for Steam Deck and Linux desktop gamers.</p>
<p>For <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> the latest update included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve multi-touch support.</li>
<li>Fix native scrollbar being always visible in Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proton Hotfix</strong> also seemed to get an update, although there's no notes anywhere I could see on what has actually changed there.</p>
<p>If you're confused on Proton and all the different versions, see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my original guide on Proton</a>. Proton Experimental gets automatically installed if Valve set it on a game, or you can just search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library to install it. Then in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu you can set it on individual games. I did a previous guide on swapping Proton versions below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f1GvONkE9S0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6bb07ac6333f611978e50464915ff76b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>GE-Proton 7-47</strong> also rolled out, as another quick update to the community-made build that included a rather urgent fix, as the release notes mentioned it has "been writing invalid state cache files that can lead to all sorts of trouble". So it seems like a pretty important one to upgrade to.</p>
<p><strong>Text Guide to install GE-Proton:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download ProtonUp-Qt:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: simply download ProtonUp-Qt from Discover in Desktop Mode (Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Make sure it's set to Steam at the top and select to install GE-Proton.</li>
<li>Reload Steam to update the compatibility layer list.</li>
<li>In Steam:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: right click a game and go to Properties.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: find the game in your library, go to the little COG on the right and then select Properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; Tick the box, select GE-Proton from the drop-down</li>
</ul>

      <title>Colony sim Stardeus adds in derelict ships, system scanning, new ship design system</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/inspired-by-factorio-and-rimworld-space-colony-building-sim-stardeus-out-in-early-access/" target="_blank">Stardeus was one of the most promising</a> Early Access releases on 2022, giving you pretty much RimWorld in space and the first major update is out now. Clearly, the developer has been rather busy.</p>
<p>Taking on a ton of feedback from players, this update is largely focused on many systems that just make the whole game flow a bit better and some elements became far less tedious. </p>
<p>It now includes derelict ships as you adventure through the stars, letting you reel it in with a winch and attach it to your ship or scrap it for materials. There's also now precision thrusters to easily adjust your ship, big improvements to system scanning with a radar to let you find resources a bit easier and it even allows you to find derelict ships and planets with anomalies. An auto rebuild option will help when a big rock smashes into your ship, a ship design preview when starting a new game along with giving you a detailed ship plan to rebuild it the same, a whole bunch of new objects and the list goes on.</p>
<p>See the new overview from the developer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D8XbOko1RXo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eaf91ab161097fa45b5ec95fbb207bc8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D8XbOko1RXo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/stardeus?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1380910/Stardeus/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>JSAUX will be doing more colours for their Steam Deck backplate</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Accessory brand <a href="https://jsaux.com/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a> recently did a poll to see what colours people might like for a Steam Deck backplate and the winners are in.</p>
<p>Currently you can only order a clear backplate, well, they're <em>mostly</em> clear as it has a sort of frosted look to it which helps cover up the kind of small manufacturing issues you can see with some completely clear designs. People kept asking for colours though, and so JSAUX did a poll on Twitter with the result being Purple and Green as the winners and so they will be doing those sometime from April:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15983199181674569069gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15983199181674569069gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>I do wish Blue won though, I would have loved that but Purple looks pretty awesome I will admit.</em></p>
<p>JSAUX also recently (finally) released a <a href="https://twitter.com/jsauxofficial/status/1617458412136046592" target="_blank">statement</a> about their mishap on teaming up with a very dubious store after some pushing from me, and they're <a href="https://youtu.be/PI6GgNU1Z54" target="_blank">trying to do better</a> on a whole bunch of other points I raised with them too which is really good to see.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck and Desktop Steam Beta improves Steam Input for Nintendo Controllers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Steam Beta is out now for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3635001990334169993" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659771788285745556" target="_blank">Desktop Steam</a>, with a bigger focus on Steam Input improvements and some Big Picture Mode fixes too.</p>
<p>Once again, the changelog is the same across both since both clients now share nearly everything thanks to the desktop client now using the New Big Picture Mode. Given how Steam Input has to handle and support all sorts of controllers, it's no surprise at times some of them could do with improvements. This time around there's quite a few improvements for Nintendo Joycons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked the layout of the mode settings page to show more content</li>
<li>Added upper grips as an option for mode shifts.</li>
<li>Filtered Mode Shift button options to only show available buttons based on the controller type.</li>
<li>Fixed chord activator options for XBox and XBox Elite controller types.</li>
<li>Improved Layout Preview for Nintendo Switch Joycon Left/Right/Pair.</li>
<li>Fixed Capture button icon not being displayed for Joycon Pair.</li>
<li>Fixed the Switch Pro Layout Preview not showing the gyro.</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch SL/SR buttons now show up as Bumpers for single Joycons or Grip buttons for a JoyCon Pair.</li>
<li>Joycon individual/pair Gyro now displays and functions properly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Big Picture Mode (on Desktop Mode in Steam Deck)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the cursor when in gamepad-navigation mode in Big Picture</li>
<li>Fixed Big Picture Mode keyboard window not exiting when closed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with detecting game windows on Linux</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>Here&#39;s how to fix Ghost Recon Breakpoint on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to play the new Steam release of Ghost Recon Breakpoint on Steam Deck? Or a Linux desktop? It doesn't run out of the box but here's how to fix it.</p>
<p>Breakpoint actually comes with both Vulkan and DirectX 11 that you can pick between when launching, although neither of the options currently work giving a DirectX error. Thankfully, you <em>can</em> work around it by changing one single file. A word of warning though: this game has Denuvo Anti-Tamper, and so swapping around Proton versions and going between PC and Steam Deck a lot will get you locked out (as it did for me). It also has the same issue as <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5511#issuecomment-1399504207" target="_blank">God of War</a> on Steam Deck, where it can hard-crash and reboot the Steam Deck — but just like God of War, not everyone has that problem.</p>
<p>Here's a video talking about it, plus the fix and the text guide is delow:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IBXkUwPuVU8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e70c6feba9f7984daa46105de0e81b98.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IBXkUwPuVU8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How to fix it (be in Desktop Mode for Steam Deck):</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Properties of the game in Steam, go to Local Files and Browse.</li>
<li>Head into the BattlEye folder.</li>
<li>Edit the <code class="inline-code">BELauncher.ini</code> file in a text editor</li>
<li>On the line that says <code class="inline-code">64BitExe=GRB.exe</code> change it to <code class="inline-code">64BitExe=GRB_vulkan.exe</code></li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you select Vulkan when going to launch the game</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>On desktop Linux though, there's another problem. It will keep forcing a small 720p window. The only workaround I've found for that, is to manually edit the settings file found somewhere like this:</p>
<p><code>/steamapps/compatdata/2231380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Ghost Recon Breakpoint/GRB.ini</code></p>
<p><em>The location above depends on where you have it installed.</em></p>
<p>Inside there, change "WindowMode" to 0. At least there you can maximise it. All other modes end up forcing 720p, which is even a bug on Windows in their Vulkan renderer with many posts on it. You can't set the resolution there, as the game overrides it but setting WindowMode to 0 lets you maximise, and the game sets the resolution to match the window.</p>
<p>As you can see from it on Fedora Linux working with the above:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14266701991674600115gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14266701991674600115gol1.jpg"/></a><em>KDE screenshots cause a huge FPS drop…</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>I do have a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6471" target="_blank">bug report</a> sent to Valve for Proton on this, and I've reached out to Ubisoft about it too. </p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 22: Happy Hacking</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-21-fluffy-bunnies/" target="_blank">Part 21: Fluffy Bunnies</a> </strong></p>
<p>As was true for many people at the time, some of my first real experiences of using Linux as a child came through the use of Knoppix, one of the first distributions to popularize the use of Live CDs. This allowed me to explore a wide swath of Linux applications while not disturbing the Windows environment I needed for school at the time. One of these was a role playing game which I recall I never got to work well, but lingered on in my imagination regardless.</p>
<p>As an adult I can recognize this as <em>Falcon's Eye</em>, a GUI for the venerable <em>NetHack</em> released by Jaakko Peltonen in 2001. The SourceForge page for the game is still online, but only has source code available for use on Linux machines, the building of which is a byzantine task given the variety of build modes. By trawling the Wayback Machine I was able to find links to RPM packages for the last stable 1.9.3 release already built for Red Hat Linux, making installation far simpler. </p>
<p>Even then setting up the game takes the form of modifying configuration files, either by editing jtp_options.txt located in the /usr/lib/games/nethackdir/config directory, which controls such things as graphic and sound modes, or by fiddling with the local ~/.nethackrc file for options specific to your personal user account. <em>Falcon's Eye</em> started in an oversized 1024x768 window on first launch, making consulting the jtp_options.txt file beforehand a good idea.</p>
<p>The default option of playing the MIDI soundtrack through timidity also caused <em>Falcon's Eye</em> to hang at times with a black screen. Changing to using the MIDI sequencer device of my sound card by using playmidi solved this issue and also gives the music a nice AdLib feel, but the cleanest rendition of the music is by use of the MP3 files through the mpg321 player, although doing so takes less advantage of my Sound Blaster 16 hardware.</p>
<p>As a <em>NetHack</em> novice the game comes with a steep learning curve, with the most important lessons for me being that you can move in diagonal rather than just cardinal directions, and that locked doors and chests can be kicked, rather than just picked or unlocked with keys. I also found myself hitting constant dead ends until I discovered that hidden passages and doorways could be revealed by pressing the "S" key. Learning how to fight at range is worthwhile as well.</p>

<p>In terms of mechanics the most significant change <em>Falcon's Eye</em> makes to <em>NetHack</em> is having the game now be mouse driven, necessitating the addition of a sometimes overeager pathfinding system whenever I misclicked. Graphics are iconographic, being static replacements for the original ASCII characters, with no animation and often limited variation. At times I found myself being mauled by a jackal that I thought was just my tame little dog.</p>
<p>The quality of the artwork that is there can not be disputed however, being an appealing and consistent set that does do a lot to bring the Mazes of Menace to life. In tackling those mazes, I have found that playing as a Samurai works well for me, not that it stopped me from succumbing to many a painful death. My most successful run so far saw me be felled by a fire ant on dungeon level six, after it ignited my potions and left me to suffer a slow agonizing burn.</p>
<p>Roguelike concepts such as permadeath and procedural generation baffled me as a child, and even today leave me with a grudging acceptance that I am unlikely to ever beat the game. In fact, my first proper dive into the genre would not come until I played the far more accessible <em>Dungeons of Dredmor</em> about ten years later, itself being the brainchild of former Loki Software programmer Nicholas Vining. It may be heresy, but for me, being able to save made all the difference.</p>
<p>Since then I have at least gained experience in a number of contemporary <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> licensed games, giving me a better handle on some of the fantasy terminology and quirks used in <em>Falcon's Eye</em>, such as how lower armour class values are actually better than higher ones. <em>NetHack</em> is a hodgepodge of popular culture milieu, from discovering Hobbits running around searching for the One Ring, to including an entire Tourist role as some kind of elaborate joke.</p>
<p>Further work on <em>Falcon's Eye</em> stalled out by 2005, with later Linux Game Publishing alumnus Clive Crous forking the project into what would become <em>Vulture</em>, now purchasable on both itch.io and Steam, albeit with the source code still being freely available. No Arch Linux packages seem to exist, and the itch.io page only has Windows binaries available. I could compile <em>Vulture</em> from source, but if I am to go through all that trouble, I might as well build something fresh instead.</p>

      <title>dbrand bait Nintendo with their new SwitchDeck skin for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>dbrand have today revealed their latest way of poking fun at other companies, with their special edition <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/switchdeck?utm_source=GamingOnLinux&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=switchdeck" target="_blank">SwitchDeck</a> skin for the Steam Deck. This isn't the first time they've prodded the beast, like with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/dbrand-issued-an-update-on-killswitch-replacements-dock-compatibility-and-more/" target="_blank">Killswitch</a> case for Steam Deck that they had to remake part of due to problems with magnets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For years, countless blogs have clickbaited millions into believing that a "Switch Pro" was just around the corner. One Switch Lite and a Switch OLED later, we decided to tackle the problem ourselves. After stockpiling a considerable amount of ammunition, our lawyers quietly remarked how they would prefer if we abandoned the mercenary plot and instead went back to shameless plagiarism. Unfortunately for the blog writers, we know how to multitask.</p>
<cite>dbrand</cite></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7012682131674500220gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7012682131674500220gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>dbrand did tell me via email that they will be shipping the skin out to me, although they've not said when. So I might be able to take a look at the quality soon, maybe not. Based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aOqHNJBLDc" target="_blank">last skins I tried from dbrand</a> though, I would expect the SwitchDeck to be high quality.</p>
<p>As for why they did this, dbrand didn't note it but I spoke to the creator behind the Fan the Deck YouTube channel who said dbrand sponsored them on the idea for their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A09_2yy5f2o" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch emulation video</a> because only dbrand were crazy enough to sponsor such an idea. I doubt Nintendo will let that video stay up for too long…</p>
<p>You can buy the skin on <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/switchdeck?utm_source=GamingOnLinux&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=switchdeck" target="_blank">dbrand's website</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck thoughts a year later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been <em>close</em> to a year since the Steam Deck launched, so here's where things currently stand and my thoughts on it.</p>
<p>I’ve had access multiple weeks before the official release, as I was one of the lucky people Valve sent a review unit to, so I’ve seen first-hand how many of the rough edges have been smoothed out over the last year and I have to say, I’ve only continued to be more and more impressed with how Valve has handled their latest hardware entry. Last year I even wrote about how I felt Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/valve-steam-deck-home-run/" target="_blank">hit a home run with the Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>For those who prefer to listen in, here's a little video I did to round-up some thoughts and give an overview that I put up on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux YouTube Channel</a> just recently:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="I0L6NK-MfrU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9fc65db1370902f3317b4ea8eef783ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/I0L6NK-MfrU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p style="text-align:center"><em>Games in the video: Broforce, followed by Grim Dawn.</em></p>
<p>I've actually had <em>three</em> Steam Decks now. The first one being the original review unit I had to send back that had a dying fan, which I also accidentally snapped the SD Card inside when going to check, a reminder to always remove it if you're going to do some tinkering. Seriously, don't forget about it. If you're going to take the back off, remove the SD Card first. So there was the replacement for that, and then I purchased one personally when my time in the original reservation queue came up. Safe to say, I'm invested both personally and professionally. I play something on mine nearly every day, with a mixture of docked and handheld depending on how I'm feeling.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck is by no means perfect, with many issues still remaining, but then that’s true of any hardware ever made by anyone. I could write a long list of problems I have with my iPhone, my Nintendo Switch and all the other devices I own. I'm sure I'm not alone in this, unless you're some kind of zealot, you will find problems in everything.</p>
<p>While it has issues, it remains my absolute <em>favourite</em> way to play games because of the convenience it provides to help unshackle me from my desk as well as the surprising power it has in what you can play on it.</p>
<p>Valve’s support of it has helped pull over many sceptics too. I remember reading The Verge and their headline was "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review" target="_blank">it's not ready</a>" and yet a year later, the same writer has now said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve" target="_blank">it's ready</a> and it's won them over to be their favourite gadget of 2022. That wouldn't have been possible without the constant upgrades from Valve, of which they’ve put out over 100 updates looking back at all the release notes. There's been some really big updates too like the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steamos-34-is-out-now-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4</a>. However, Valve has slowed down on stable Steam Deck updates, as they've <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/we-may-get-a-steam-controller-2-plus-fun-updates-coming-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank">moved over</a> to a monthly release schedule now for stable updates.</p>
<p>That's not even counting updates to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, their compatibility layer to run Windows games on Steam Deck that's used on Linux desktop too. Proton had tons of updates over the last year as well, as Valve keep chasing down issues in games and getting them fixed with various open source developers under contract to work on Proton, the graphics drivers and more. When you compare the compatibility on Steam Deck between now and when it launched, it's like a night and day difference, the improvements are simply astonishing. I'm sure desktop Linux gamers will understand this point too, the amount of games we have access to across the whole of Linux now is just awesome.</p>
<p>When it comes to Valve's updates it's not just the usual notes you might see from other hardware vendors, and their typical patch notes stating things like "improved stability". Valve always like to tell you exactly what they've done and they've repeatedly improved the interface on the Steam Deck too, like how they added proper multi-tasking and ensured recently switching between different apps and closing them all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhtK92WNJZs" target="_blank">worked nicely</a>.</p>
<p>With the Deck Verified system, Valve has seen plenty of things to be happy about there. Deck Verified is their official compatibility rating split between Verified, Playable for titles that have some issues and Unsupported with over 7,300 titles rated at least Playable (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-deck-hits-over-7000-games-playable/" target="_blank">7,000 was hit towards the end of 2022</a>). You can continue to try and play anything of course, this is only what Valve has officially tested.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest and most played games around can be played on Steam Deck like: Elden Ring, Spider-Man Remastered, Cyberpunk 2077, Warframe, No Man's Sky, Apex Legends, Valheim and the list just keeps going on.</p>
<p>Deck Verified is far from perfect though, you can’t really go anywhere without someone complaining about a rating on some game not being right. From Verified games that don’t actually work, to unsupported games that actually work perfectly. It’s an ongoing area of improvement that I hope the second year Valve really nails down, although the ratings are largely correct when you look at the bigger picture. It’s just a few random titles that slip through the net.</p>
<p>It can get quite annoying though, to have a Verified game that clearly shouldn't be Verified. A <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1617238571659972609" target="_blank">recent example</a> I can pull up is God of War, which has a confirmed issue and has been a problem for months, where the RAM use will shoot up to about 14.2GB and then the game will slow to zero FPS and eventually reboot the Steam Deck. While asking for perfection on any platform is ridiculous and impossible, it does show that Valve need to be a more reactive to change ratings, regardless of games being AAA or indie. It would also be nice for Valve to be more open on <em>how</em> they are reviewing titles to improve trust in it.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck has sat in the top 5 of the top sellers list (<a href="https://steamdb.info/topsellers/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) for something around 40 weeks, and the majority of that time has been at number 1 or number 2 when a few super hits came along to knock it down like Elden Ring or Modern Warfare 2 but it's quite rare to see it knocked down to the number 2 spot even a year later. The Steam Deck has some very clear staying power. It has only just launched in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/steam-deck-now-shipping-across-asia-plus-a-new-steam-deck-stable-client-update/" target="_blank">few select regions of Asia</a> too, so it should continue to sell quite well for some time.</p>
<p>So while the Steam Deck is going great, it still has some mountains to climb as well. A sore point continues to be anti-cheat, a constant problem with some of the biggest games not working like Destiny 2, PUBG, Dead by Daylight, Rust, Modern Warfare 2, Lost Ark, FIFA 23 and so on. There's not exactly a huge amount Valve can do about this though, as they worked with Epic Games on Easy Anti-Cheat support and the same for BattlEye, we just need more people using the Steam Deck for developers to care to make sure it's supported. That of course is an ongoing problem, but one that might eventually solve <em>itself</em> if the Steam Deck continues to be a success. Massive publishers will only chase the big monies. Then again, Ubisoft surprised us recently by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">fixing The Division 2</a>, which I am still surprised by.</p>
<p>It's repeatedly a marvel that you can play so many games on a portable like this, or hooked up to a TV or a monitor with either the official Valve dock or one of the great many USB-C docks available elsewhere. Previously PlayStation or Microsoft exclusive titles running on it is just amazing.</p>
<p>We've repeatedly seen publishers talk about their own excitement on it too, even Microsoft have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/xbox-game-studios-talk-more-of-their-titles-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">repeatedly</a> made announcements to showcase their published games compatibility. Microsoft also even went as far as to create their own guide for Xbox Cloud Gaming on Steam Deck. See my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/microsoft-upgrades-xbox-cloud-gaming-for-linux-and-chromeos/" target="_blank">full guide on Xbox Cloud in this linked article</a>, you don't need Edge. The surprises through the last year just kept on coming.</p>
<p>The community around the Steam Deck building up has been fun to watch too. People learning how Linux works, because it's powered by SteamOS and not Windows. We've seen the Heroic Games Launcher and others repeatedly improve to help with getting other stores working on Steam Deck like GOG and Epic Games. Then there's the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/decky-loader-makes-steam-deck-plugins-even-easier-with-new-installer/" target="_blank">Decky Loader plugin system</a> I've covered a few times, that can really help add in some essential extras Valve has yet to add into the system or has no plans to add, the possibilities with the Steam Deck just feel endless because of Valve's support of it being such an open platform and I think this is what will keep it being so popular because so many people are really appreciating that there’s no walled garden locking you in.</p>
<p>It's not just the software community though, the hardware community is incredible too. So many people still coming up with new and clever ways to attach things to the Steam Deck, like my favourite being the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">Deckmate attachment system</a> that lets you slot anything onto the back of the Steam Deck. We’ve had a few gaffs like dbrand with their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/project-killswitch-sales-suspended-as-the-kickstand-messed-with-the-steam-deck-fan/" target="_blank">problematic magnets</a> (that some <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/stop-mixing-magnets-with-the-steam-deck-or-face-fan-and-temperature-troubles/" target="_blank">haven't learned from</a>), but it’s all still fun to see companies try things for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9558120521674484630gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9558120521674484630gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured: the Deckmate.</em></p>
<p>Plenty more companies have jumped in too like JSAUX with various docks like one with an <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-jsaux-m2-docking-station-for-steam-deck-is-a-great-choice/" target="_blank">M.2 SSD slot</a>, there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/the-upgraded-ivoler-steam-deck-docking-station-is-another-good-choice/" target="_blank">ivoler too</a> and the list of companies doing Steam Deck docks goes on and on. Many of them beating Valve to the punch on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/thoughts-on-the-official-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">Official Docking Station</a>. JSAUX are even doing transparent Steam Deck backplates now too (and <a href="https://youtu.be/PI6GgNU1Z54" target="_blank">JSAUX are trying to improve</a>).</p>
<p>Faced with an increasing amount of competition now from GPD, AYANEO, OneXPlayer and more, who are putting out more and more devices with newer chips in them, but often much higher prices, it will be fun to see how it all continues to build up. Valve opened the flood gates (flood valve?!) for handheld PC gaming and we still haven’t even seen the public release of SteamOS 3 yet, for more vendors to use it and for potentially people to make their own steam machines with it.</p>
<p>Even with the competition noted above, Valve will still clearly come out on top. It's not enough to keep producing these new shiny handhelds with more powerful internals, if the price is a lot higher and with a lack of support as each company swiftly moves onto their next upgraded model. Something that I hope, perhaps, a SteamOS 3 launch might help with, because support could improve there across many devices over time.</p>
<p>We do know a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" target="_blank">Steam Deck 2</a> is at least planned too, so clearly this is not going to be a one time thing for Valve, something people were a bit worried about prior to release. Given the success, it would be weird if they didn't continue it.</p>
<p>My Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/my-current-little-wish-list-for-steam-deck-upgrades/" target="_blank">wishlist</a> mostly still applies too, like the shader cache problem — when I went to load up God of War last night, it needed to deal with the shaders for a good 30 minutes before the game loaded.</p>
<p>That's pretty much the state of things Steam Deck as they are now nearly a year on. There's a lot to look forward to from games coming out to continued Steam Deck upgrades, I'll be here covering all of it.</p>

      <title>Valve marks some EA games Playable on Steam Deck again like Sims 4, Jedi: Fallen Order</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>EA recently sent Origin to the graveyard and replaced it with the EA App, which caused numerous problems on Linux desktop and Steam Deck but it looks like the biggest problems are over on that.</p>
<p>The problem is that these extra external launchers can cause a number of issues for the Proton compatibility layer. This is because Valve (and their open source contractors who work on Proton) need time to catch-up on the compatibility side. The switchover <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/ea-begins-swapping-out-origin-for-ea-app-on-steam/" target="_blank">came with problems</a>, which Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/valve-fix-new-ea-app-in-proton-experimental-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">partially solved</a> a week later but it still had issues leading me <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/how-to-fix-the-ea-app-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">to do a guide</a> on getting it working again. Another few weeks later, Valve put a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/proton-experimental-upgraded-to-fix-the-ea-app-failing-to-update-on-steam-deck-a-linux/" target="_blank">proper fix in</a> to stop the EA App failing to update.</p>
<p>With that all done and the dust settled, Valve has now gone back through multiple problematic EA published titles to re-review them for Steam Deck compatibility.</p>
<p>Titles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battlefield 1.</li>
<li>Jedi Fallen Order.</li>
<li>Sims 4.</li>
<li>Titanfall 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>All officially noted to be playable again, with Valve setting them to use Proton Experimental by default.</p>
<p><em>Nice to see Valve do go back over certain titles to check them again, although they really need to do that for God of War that <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux/status/1617238571659972609" target="_blank">has a bug</a> that can reboot your Steam Deck.</em></p>

      <title>Humble Bundle offering a whole lot of gems in two new bundles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another good chance for you to build up your Steam collection, with Humble Bundle offering two new bundles full of games. Here's what to expect from them. To help you out and stop you needing to click around, I'll note the expected compatibility across Linux desktop and Steam Deck, along with Native Linux support or a ProtonDB rating (which goes Platinum - Gold - Silver - Bronze - Broken).</p>
<p>First up is the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/in-case-you-missed-it-gems-2022?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">In Case You Missed It: Gems of 2022 bundle</a> that has:</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Prehistoric Kingdom</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Deck Playable</li>

      <title>Rocket League is getting additional anti-cheat functionality</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a move that could cause issues for Linux desktop and Steam Deck gamers, Rocket League is going to introduce new anti-cheat measures. <em>Something people argued with me on Twitter some time ago that wouldn't happen — I was right again.</em></p>
<p>Rocket League originally had Native Linux support and the development studio Psyonix was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/05/psyonix-creator-of-rocket-league-is-joining-epic-games/" target="_blank">acquired by Epic Games</a> back in 2019. Then in early 2020 they ended support for Linux and macOS, and later that year it became an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC. Thanks to how far Wine and Proton have come though as Windows compatibility layers, it actually continued running nicely on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. That might change though.</p>
<p>The problem is that Rocket League has recently seen a surge of AI bots being put into online games, so that people can cheat. An issue highlighted by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cheaters-hacked-an-ai-bot-and-beat-the-rocket-league-elite/" target="_blank">Wired</a>, where high-level players were seeing odd behaviour with players that had seemingly "superhuman skill". It's a growing problem, that developer Psyonix is now addressing.</p>
<p>In a statement on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/10g5ods/update_on_bots_in_online_matches/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the last several weeks, the introduction of third-party bots to online matches – in Competitive Playlists, especially – has understandably been a very active topic among the Rocket League community.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we took action against a number of accounts running bots in Rocket League. This banwave should cover the vast majority of accounts that have used bots since they first appeared in online matches towards the end of 2022, and we will continue to monitor for bots and take appropriate action against any players/accounts using them. Furthermore, to help us address bots in future matches, we have added a “Cheating” report reason back into the game. You can find this in game on the report reason list in the Report/Block menu.</p>
<p>Finally, we are taking steps to introduce additional anti-cheat functionality into Rocket League. This is in progress with the engineering teams, and we’ll share more on this once we’re closer to implementation.</p>
<p>While we have been quiet on the subject during this time, we have been actively investigating these bots since they first appeared late last year. We strive to be active participants when it comes to community conversations about our game, but we are always going to be more deliberate on issues related to game security and competitive integrity, withholding comments until we are ready to take action.</p>
<p>There is a zero tolerance policy when it comes to using bots in online play. This is considered both cheating and matchmaking abuse, and it violates the Rocket League <u><strong>Terms of Use</strong></u> as well as the <u><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></u>. Also, if you are interested in working with Psyonix directly on anything bot-related, you can reach out to us here on Reddit, on Discord, or Twitter. Thanks, everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anti-cheat is a repeating problem for Linux desktop and Steam Deck gamers, often blocking out games entirely from working. Hopefully this won't be a repeat of previous issues but it's worth highlighting for any readers who enjoy playing Rocket League.</p>

      <title>Turn-based city-builder set on Mars, Farlanders has launched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Farlanders is a turn-based city-builder from Andriy Bychkovskyi and publisher Crytivo that has you colonize and attempt to terraform the red planet. It's available now with Native Linux support, but no Steam Deck rating as of yet.</p>
<p>"Lead the charge in establishing a colony on Mars in this turn-based strategy game with a nostalgic look but fresh gameplay. Use specialized tools to terraform the planet, build residential areas for your colonizers, and construct resource-producing factories in an effort to become a self-sustaining society."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="omF4BR5AWe8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d485f48ef9e901b82b6790254a110fd7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/omF4BR5AWe8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>7 campaign missions with narrative tied to the Farlanders: Prologue.</li>
<li>Competitive freeplay game mode with 3 scenarios.</li>
<li>Build your own colony on (and below) the Martian surface using more than 50 different structures.</li>
<li>Terraform the planet using a variety of tools.</li>
<li>No 2 maps are ever the same with procedural map generation.</li>
<li>Dynamic weather changes and anomalies.</li>
<li>Research tree with 19 technologies.</li>
<li>Trade with other colonies that will reflect fluctuating market prices and demands.</li>
<li>Uncover alien artifacts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I sadly simply haven't had time to personally play through this one, however I did enjoy the demo and the Prologue as it has some interesting mechanics. The Prologue had a good user review score too, as does the full game with them both being "Very Positive" on Steam. Nice to see more developers continue Native Linux support, and provide a free Prologue for people to actually see if they like it first, I do miss the days of easy to find demos but glad to see them come back in a new form.</p>
<p>You can buy it now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318740/Farlanders/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It's coming to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/farlanders" target="_blank">GOG</a> but not clear when.</p>
<p>On top of that you can try the free Prologue on <a href="https://andriy-bychkovskyi.itch.io/farlanders-prologue" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/farlanders_prologue" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1460540/Farlanders_Prologue/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to see if it's something you might like.</p>

      <title>Free open source RPG &#39;FreedroidRPG&#39; arrives on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not going to win any awards on style but some of you may want to know that the classic free and open source RPG FreedroidRPG is now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1979930/FreedroidRPG/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <em>A name some older readers might not have seen for a while…</em></p>
<p>This is a game I remember reading about and following along back in the early days, way before Steam came to Linux and when Wine couldn't exactly run a whole lot. It might not be up to modern standards in many ways but fun to see it continue on. Linux has obviously come a very long way as a gaming platform with so many games available to play either Native or through Proton.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-bUiKnrkKDY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/89016736834752ca9e56b4e25d2f21c6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-bUiKnrkKDY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>I have to admit a penguin slapping robots is quite amusing.</em></p>
<p>More about it from the developers: "Freedroid aims to provide a popular reference game in the open-source world. Our goal is to do so through the implementation of an immersive world with distinctive dialog and graphical styles in a format that is friendly to all ages while providing a fair amount of choice to the player. In view of this, we rely on high quality literary content to provide entertainment and emotional investment as well as educational benefits."</p>

      <title>I&#39;m far too excited about Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania is an upcoming mini expansion for the popular action-platformer metroidvania game from Motion Twin / Evil Empire coming early this year.</p>
<p>It was originally announced at <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/lots-of-good-stuff-announced-at-the-game-awards-2022-m-roundup/" target="_blank">The Game Awards 2022</a> which I covered in my big round-up and now the developer is teasing it more again.</p>
<p>As ridiculously brief as the teaser is, I can't help but feel terribly excited about it. Truthfully, I wasn't even a Castlevania fan until very recently, I never really played the older games and wasn't until watching the truly incredible Castlevania Anime on Netflix that I felt pulled into the world. You really should watch it, truly excellent.</p>
<p>The new teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q10fKa_MkW0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5be2be69380d5b4076d36b8e0025a24f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q10fKa_MkW0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What the DLC will come with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Classic Weapons: </strong>Unlock 14 iconic weapons such as the Vampire Killer, Throwing Axe &amp; Holy Water to decimate Dracula's bestiary of monsters and finally the dark lord himself. Each item has been translated into the fast-paced combat of Dead Cells while keeping their original essence.</li>
<li><strong>Explore Dracula's Castle: </strong>Secret rooms. Flame-lit corridors. Gloomy tombs. Beautiful paintings. Food hidden in the walls. Full of original monsters from the series, such as harpies, werewolves &amp; haunted armors, the character of the iconic castle will transport you into the realms of gothic fantasy.</li>
<li><strong>Classic and Reimagined Music: </strong>We're giving you access to an alternative soundtrack made of 51 of the original Castlevania tunes, that can be heard across the entire game. Yes, 51! On top of this, we've taken the 12 most iconic tracks, such as Vampire Killer, Bloody Tears and Simon Belmont's Theme, and reimagined them in the style of Dead Cells as a soundtrack for this DLC, while preserving the Castlevania ambiance of course.</li>
<li><strong>A New Story:  </strong>Richter Belmont and Alucard will be by your side throughout your quest to vanquish Dracula, helping you to navigate the maze of Dracula’s Castle and providing you with strong weapons (sometimes willingly, sometimes not). However, where there is good there is evil, so watch out for powerful foes who will try everything in their power to stop you from reaching the throne room.</li>
<li><font color="#e0e0e0"><strong>Three Boss Fights: </strong></font>Fight against the very essence of evil in two intense duels versus Death and Dracula, both set against a majestic backdrop. If you can survive these gauntlets, prepare yourself for our most ambitious boss showdown yet...</li>
<li><strong>Castlevania Outfits: </strong>Unlock 20 outfits as you progress through the castle, letting you roleplay as all your favourite characters like Alucard, Richter Belmont, Simon Belmont, Maria Renard, Trevor Belmont, Sypha Belnades or even Dracula himself.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>With Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified, you're in for a good time even before this DLC release.</p>

<ul>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide.</li>

      <title>An interview with the creator of the Heroic Games Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interested to learn a little about the people who make cool open source programs? Today I have interview with Flávio, the creator of the popular <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> used on Linux desktop, Steam Deck, macOS and Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Q: First of all can you introduce yourself</strong></p>
<p>"Hi! My name is Flávio, I am a developer originally from Brazil but moved to Sweden 4 years ago. Father of 2 kids and passionate about tech, open source, gaming, history and heavy metal."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get started with programming?</strong></p>
<p>"Well, I started working on IT in general when I was 16 and at that time I started to experiment with web development. Professionally I started to work as a developer around 7 or 8 years ago. Web and Android development."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us about the Heroic Games Launcher, what is it and why did you make it?</strong></p>
<p>"Heroic is an open source games launcher, it supports downloading, installing and playing games from Epic and GOG stores.  It is available for Linux, Windows and macOS. Behind the curtains it uses the great tool called Legendary to deal with the Epic games and our in house solution called GOGDL to deal with the GOG games.</p>
<p>Besides that, it is also possible to add your own games using what we call ‘Sideload’ feature, so since a couple of releases ago you can use Heroic even if you do not have an Epic or GOG account.</p>
<p>I use Linux since 2007 and always used it to play some games. But since Valve has developed Proton and DXVK and VKD3D started to be a thing, I migrated 100% to play on Linux, since almost all my library was playable on it and it is the system I also use for everything else.</p>
<p>When Epic started to give free games was when I discovered Legendary and started using it to play those games on Linux. One example of a game that I finished at the time using it was Control, that was Epic exclusive for a while and I really wanted to play it.</p>
<p>So since Legendary is a CLI tool and no GUIs were available for it at the time, I saw a good opportunity to contribute to the open source community and started to think on how I could develop a GUI for it with the developer stack I am used to.</p>
<p>I wrote a post on the linux gaming community on reddit to see first if people were interested in that and I got more than 300 comments and people were really excited for that.</p>
<p>A couple of days after the post I released the first version with basic features.</p>
<p>Then I asked my wife to help me with the UI/UX (she is a designer) and she did some research on the gaming community about the launchers we have on Linux and based on that feedback she started to make the design for it and we started to improve based on the feedback we were receiving as well."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8234942081674222543gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8234942081674222543gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Q: Has anyone from Epic Games or GOG reached out to you about the Heroic Games Launcher at all?</strong></p>
<p>"No, so far no one has reached us about it."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How difficult is it to support these stores that don’t support Linux directly with a launcher? What problems do you face?</strong></p>
<p>"Well, first is the lack of documentation. Since they do not have an open API, both Legendary and GOGDL are reverse engineering them to make the basic stuff. Some things for GOG are still not available, some Galaxy features for instance. But Linguin (one of our devs) is putting a lot of effort into improving this part and supporting GOG was a huge milestone for the project. And in parallel he is also developing Nile, a CLI tool for Amazon games that we will implement a frontend in Heroic pretty soon."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Heroic has been out for a while now, how have you found the reception to it? How’s things going overall?</strong></p>
<p>"Well, we know that a lot of people really dislike Epic Games and part of that is related to some comments from their CEO about Linux.</p>
<p>In general the reception was always good and several people came to give me thanks for the project and how it was making their gaming life more productive on Linux.</p>
<p>But there were some people that were saying that I should not waste my time on that, that I should do other stuff. Or they were complaining that it was an Electron App and I should write it in another framework or language.</p>
<p>Bottom line, deciding to stick with Electron was the best decision I made for the project, since it makes it a lot easier to distribute the app and that is why we have AppImage, Flatpaks, debs, RPMs and also why was somehow simple to distribute it on Windows and macOS as well.</p>
<p>Some people come to me from time to time saying that they discovered that it was possible to game on Linux because they were using Heroic on Windows and saw that there was a Linux version. So this made them experiment and even migrate to Linux because of that and I think this is pretty cool."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do you think people should use Heroic over Lutris, or Bottles or *insert other app*? Do you see them as competition, or is it more like companions?</strong></p>
<p>"I have a lot to thank Lutris and also PlayOnLinux for making my life a lot easier to play games on when this was a pretty hard task and we did not have Proton, etc. Lutris was definitely an inspiration for Heroic and still is. </p>
<p>We have a great relationship with the developers of Bottles and Lutris and they help us when we need and vice-versa. The way I see it is that we are united for the same cause, that is to make gaming on Linux easier and accessible for everyone, especially newcomers. </p>
<p>Sometimes some games won’t work on Heroic and they work fine on Lutris or on Bottles and the other way around so having alternatives is great and that is the best thing of the Open Source community.</p>
<p>So, cheers to all of them! :)"</p>
<p><strong>Q: How did you get started with Linux and what’s your favourite distribution and why?</strong></p>
<p>"I started with Linux in 2007, my first experience was not that good, it was with Fedora 6 or 7 I guess and GNOME at that time was not really welcoming so I hated it.</p>
<p>After a couple of months, a friend of mine showed me a Brazilian distro called Kurumin that came with KDE3 and had several scripts and automations for everything. We need to remember that at that time even to use a CD or USB drive you needed to mount it manually on the terminal, so having these automations and scripts was great. So then I started to use it and love it.</p>
<p>Nowdays I don’t have a favourite distribution. The ones I used the most were OpenSuse (around 2 years), Slackware and Gentoo for around 1 year each and then Manjaro for I guess almost 4 years until I discovered Garuda that is my distro of choice today. Although I want to experiment with Vanilla OS now from my friend Mirko from the Bottles team. I basically only hear great things about it.</p>
<p>The thing is that I don’t really have time to setup things from scratch so I like to use distros that does most of the work for me and I just need to configure basic things for my workflow."</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is your opinion on the Steam Deck? Valve sent the developer Lutris a Steam Deck, did you ever hear anything from Valve on a bit of support to help you?</strong></p>
<p>"Steam Deck is basically the best thing in Linux gaming since forever I would say. The amount of work that Valve did on it and making all this progress available for the Linux community is amazing. It is a great piece of hardware and it’s software is only getting better.</p>
<p>Valve never got in touch to send a Deck to us but we were able to buy one with donations from our community that I think it is great. </p>
<p>I think makes sense that Valve sent one to the Lutris team due to the importance and longevity of the project."</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are your favourite games? Give us your top 5!</strong></p>
<p>"Oh, that is a really hard question because I play games since I was 6 and I play on console as well.</p>
<p>I will probably forget some but If I need to get 5 games that I had a pretty good time those would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Castlevania SOTN</li>
<li>Metal Gear Solid 3</li>
<li>Bloodborne</li>
<li>NieR: Automata</li>
<li>The Witcher 3"</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: If someone wanted to help with development on the Heroic Games Launcher, what are you looking for? How can they get involved?</strong></p>
<p>"There are several ways of helping with Heroic development, even if you are not a developer you can help with translations on our Weblate project.</p>
<p>Developers should first be nice people, I have to say that I consider myself pretty lucky because our team today is pretty nice and we work pretty good together and they made a lot for the project.</p>
<p>Our stack is basically NodeJS, Typescript, CSS/SASS and ReactJS.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher" target="_blank">our GitHub</a> we have issues and feature requests with a label called ‘Good-First-Issue’ that is where people can start to understand how the code works and so on.</p>
<p>We have opportunities for all levels of developers from students until seniors and Heroic is a great way to put something on your CV. We have even created a Heroic Organization on </p>
<p>Linkedin so people can add their contributions and link to our official page there. This is good if you are searching for work to show their skillset.</p>
<p>If you develop with Python you can also get involved on GOGDL or even Legendary as well.</p>
<p>So if you want to contribute, just go to our Discord community and get in touch with us :)"</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are you most excited about for the future of Linux gaming as a whole?</strong></p>
<p>"I am pretty excited about that because gaming on Linux today is totally proven and I believe this year will get even better. I mean, if the Steam Deck made Ubisoft add <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">Easy Anti-Cheat support for Linux on The Division 2</a>, I really can only expect things will get even better from now on.</p>
<p>I think 2023 will be simply great for us and we will have more and more support from big publishers."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there anything you would really love to add to the Heroic Games Launcher, that’s just perhaps out of reach right now?</strong></p>
<p>"I think there are several things that could (and perhaps will) be added to Heroic in the future. We plan on adding more stores of course, Amazon, maybe Itch.io and others. We also are planning a way of automating fixes like Proton does with Protonfixes by using a database of what we call ‘workarounds’. We are also working on a new design for Heroic to make it more modern but also with a better UX in general.</p>
<p>I would like to have is a native support for EA and Ubisoft games because their official launchers simply sucks, not only on Linux, but on Windows they are terrible as well. We have started to investigate and look into them, so might be possible in the future but definitely not an easy task."</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 525.85.05 is out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have put up a smaller stable update for their Linux driver with a couple of noted fixes included. Here's the details. Since this is a stable driver in their Production Branch, all users should be okay to upgrade.</p>
<p>Here's what's included in version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/198554/en-us/" target="_blank">525.85.05</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved the reliability of suspend and resume on UEFI systems when using certain display panels.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented some controls in the nvidia-settings control panel from working when running an X server as an unprivileged user.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST when using VK_MEMORY_ALLOCATE_DEVICE_ADDRESS_CAPTURE_REPLAY_BIT to allocate memory.</li>
<li>Disabled Fixed Rate Link (FRL) when using passive DisplayPort to HDMI dongles, which are incompatible with FRL.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On GitHub, their open GPU kernel modules were also <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/releases/tag/525.85.05" target="_blank">updated</a> along with it to fix build problems with Clang 15.0.</p>
<p>Is there a bug in the NVIDIA drivers you're waiting on a fix for? Let me know in the comments.</p>

      <title>New Steam desktop and Steam Deck Betas fixes up Big Picture Mode, Steam Input</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put up another Beta update for the Steam client on Desktop and Steam Deck with plenty of fixes. Here's all the details.</p>
<p>Since the two largely share the code now, the changelog across both (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3659771788271315337" target="_blank">Desktop</a> / <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3635001990319736151" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>) is basically the same. Here's the patch notes that should apply to both:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed background images on a collection on the app details page not being clipped correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the Remove Collection dialog was not appearing.</li>
<li>Added icons for VR support or Mouse &amp; KB only support to app portraits.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect focus shifting away from the BPM window faster and reduce instances of navigation going to BPM after starting a game.</li>
<li>Fixed Steam mini window not closing when entering Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed problem where setting certain library filters in Big Picture Mode could cause those games to become hidden. when switching back to desktop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle errors better and fix some cases where configs would no longer load.</li>
<li>On larger screens combine the keyboard and numpad tabs of the choose binding screen.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases where some languages could have text overflow in choose binding screen.</li>
<li>Remember the last active tab in the choose binding screen and open to that instead always using the tab w/ the current binding value.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one is Steam Deck Specific:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed non-Steam apps becoming unresponsive to gamepad when onscreen keyboard is opened.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This on is Desktop specific:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Big Picture window being incorrect size when moving it to a different display with win+shift+arrow key.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p>Here we go again though: Valve noting details for Steam Deck on things just don't exist. I've pointed this out a few times like with the gamepad icon, and new controller settings in previous Betas that aren't on Steam Deck and they're doing it again now. The mouse / keyboard and VR icons they noted in both patch notes do not exist on Steam Deck. I really don't get why they're not checking these before publishing as it's confusing to users. I've notified them across multiple places and they just don't see to be getting the message. <em>I seem to be the only one checking these things…</em></p>
<p>On desktop Big Picture Mode see the example with Half-Life: Alyx and Trombone Champ having the new icons:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14306742831674212487gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14306742831674212487gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The problem on Steam Deck is that where they're putting these icons is where the Deck Verified status is, and it wouldn't exactly make sense for the Steam Deck to even have a gamepad, keyboard / mouse or VR icon either as the Deck Verified status covers that. So it's a bit odd they keep detailing it in the Steam Deck patch notes. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/steam-deck-beta-update-plus-easy-flatpak-updates-and-more-hdr-teasing/" target="_blank">new controller options</a> still missing for idle time and turning off when exiting big picture mode is just odd though.</p>

      <title>Plasma 5.27 Beta live with Flatpak settings, multi-monitor upgrade, SteamOS updater</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go! The next version of KDE Plasma is <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/5/5.26.90/" target="_blank">now in Beta</a> and ready for wider testing, with some really great sounding changes. This is my favourite Linux desktop environment I use at home, plus it's the Desktop Mode on Steam Deck!</p>
<p>One of the big changes coming in Plasma 5.27 is the addition of Flatpak permission settings, so you'll no longer need another additional application (like Flatseal) to sort through what Flatpak packages can do. This is great, and has been needed for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18009430871674139011gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18009430871674139011gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Multi-monitor support should also be a lot better, as they've done a huge <a href="https://notmart.org/blog/2022/12/multi-screen/" target="_blank">overhaul</a> on it behind the scenes. While it should be mostly invisible to the end-user the changes involved were quite big and should result in no more empty desktops, you shouldn't see panels and widgets getting lost, a better experience with USB-C based docks (hello Steam Deckers) and so on.</p>
<p>This is probably what I am most excited about, as someone who uses Plasma for basically everything, it has been a nuisance at times with docking the Steam Deck and with it losing my second monitor on my desktop at times. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10952879611674139162gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10952879611674139162gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other changes coming include:</p>
<ul>
<li>More Flatpak improvements for Discover.</li>
<li>A SteamOS backend for performing Steam Deck updates in Discover.</li>
<li>Plasma Welcome - a new tool for users getting started using the desktop.</li>
<li>Upgrades to their Pipewire integration.</li>
<li>Lots more Wayland improvements.</li>
<li>Quick and easy window tiling.</li>
<li>Plus loads more fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Get some gems like Streets of Rogue, Hellpoint, Chasm and more in this bundle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fanatical seem to be putting out some really great bundles lately, with the <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-100721639-13797872?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fvanquish-bundle" target="_blank">Vanquish Bundle</a> offering up some pretty nice indie gems for you. I'll go over what to expect on Steam Deck, and for Linux desktop listing either Native Linux status or ProtonDB rating (which goes Platinum - Gold - Silver - Bronze - Broken) to save you clicking around for info on each one.</p>

      <title>The Wandering Village gets gamepad and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village, a very unique city-builder set on the back of a giant creature recently had a major update that added in gamepad support which also helps Steam Deck too. <em>I was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/the-wandering-village-is-absolutely-mesmerizing/" target="_blank">pretty big fan</a> of the initial release.</em></p>
<p>As of the update, Valve has given it a Steam Deck Playable rating using the Native Linux version, with it not being fully Verified due to some text being too small but as I show in the video below — there's really no problem at all with the text so Deck Verified once again being a mystery on the ratings.</p>
<p><em>Some of what's included in this update:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full Gamepad Support (+ Steam Deck support)</li>
<li>New Autosave System</li>
<li>Worker Management Window to centrally manage employed workers</li>
<li>Disable Tool to more quickly disable and enable buildings</li>
<li>First set of Steam Achievements</li>
<li>New Buildings:
<ul>
<li>Granary, a larger food storage building</li>
<li>Onbu Discipliner, a building that, when used, hurts Onbu, but forces it to listen to your commands</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's a little look at the gamepad support on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h9OmN2JM0vE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b5c60cc02bf47bf95eb0e1f9317b53f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h9OmN2JM0vE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>There's a number of other improvements included in this update, like the harvesting tool not being used to remove Onbu's Spikes (the creature) causing it to not be happy with you. Something that kept tripping me up. There's also some visual fixes, edge-scrolling was added, buildings now have back doors for better villager pathing and so on.</p>

      <title>Hyper Gunsport saves the original from the closure of Stadia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hyper Gunsport released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663250/Hyper_Gunsport/" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://necrosoftgames.itch.io/hypergunsport" target="_blank">itch.io</a> with Native Linux support back in December 2022, and now the developer has sort-of rescued the original Stadia exclusive Gunsport with it.</p>
<p>What is it: at its core, Hyper Gunsport is a cooperatively competitive action game where the object is to shoot the ball into goals of varying difficulty, while the opposing team tries to do the same. Each time the ball crosses the net its point value goes up, so longer volleys mean bigger points and higher stakes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pem-VJqbb2E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85a055e73cd31dd5f679ead4715dfee4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pem-VJqbb2E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Hyper Gunsport is basically an upgraded version of what the older Stadia exclusive was, the developers say "Hyper Gunsport is the sequel to the original Gunsport in the sense that Super Street Fighter II Turbo is the sequel to Street Fighter II".</p>
<p>Now, they've actually packaged up Gunsport itself into a Beta version you can try out on Steam, with some Stadia bits stripped out of it. As they said on <a href="https://twitter.com/necrosoftgames/status/1615439469674659840" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "Stadia is shutting down tomorrow. This means all  exclusives, like the original Gunsport, will blink out of existence. But!! Since we care about game preservation we've made an offline version of Gunsport available in the Steam version of Hyper Gunsport, through the beta channel.", and they continued, "Anyone who bought Hyper Gunsport on Steam already has access to this if they want to compare and see the differences. It's offline, and has the Stadia trappings stripped out, but at least it exists! Select the beta and type OriginalGunsport to unlock it.".</p>
<p>Along with the Native Linux support, it's also Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton removes the dxvk-async patch in version 7-45</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's another release of the community-made compatibility layer GE-Proton with <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton7-45" target="_blank">version 7-45</a> out now, and this one removes a popular patch to help game performance but there's a good reason for that.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0</a> released, the software that does the Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 translation to Vulkan, it came with major changes to shader compilation. Thanks to pulling in support for the VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library extension, it allows it to compile the shaders when games load their D3D shaders, rather than at draw time — the result is that games <em>should</em> perform better and reduce the stutter.</p>
<p><em>To work with it, you do need updated drivers with the recommended versions being 520.56.06 for NVIDIA and 22.2 for Mesa (AMD / Intel). AMD RADV users need to use "RADV_PERFTEST=gpl" to enable it.</em></p>
<p>So, with it mostly taking over the job of the old dxvk-async patch, GE-Proton has removed it. Another reason though, as pointed out in the release notes, is that dxvk-async causes <a href="https://github.com/Sporif/dxvk-async/issues/55" target="_blank">problems</a> with the dxvk-cache and it seems the developer on dxvk-async no longer uses it either.</p>
<p>For those who still need it, for whatever reason, you can just use older versions of GE-Proton.</p>
<p>Need a primer on how to actually use GE-Proton? You can see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/protonup-qt-got-upgraded-heres-how-to-use-it-on-steam-deck-and-linux/" target="_blank">my previous guide here</a> but to save you clicking around the video and steps are below:</p>

      <title>Ubisoft fixed The Division 2 on Steam Deck and Linux desktop </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, that's a nice surprise isn't it. Ubisoft did something good. They released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2221490/view/3632750190483497136" target="_blank">tiny patch</a>, that enabled Easy Anti-Cheat so The Division 2 now works on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>I've tested it on Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux desktop and yep — it works. Although, performance can be pretty <em>rough</em> due to the usual shader compiling issues on your first couple of runs while it stutters about quite fiercly. That <em>will</em> become smoother over time, and eventually (hopefully) Valve will have the shaders to send out with the game when it downloads like they do for others games. </p>
<p>Note: for Steam Deck players, <u>don't</u> turn on DirectX 12 as the game won't run. If you do, steps are noted in the video below on how to fix it sliced in between some gameplay clips I did earlier (timestamped). Text steps on the fix below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JNrs1QRa6Bc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9dc1abacdd6621584970dc7089a589fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JNrs1QRa6Bc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Turn Off DirectX 12 fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Head to this location:
<ol>
<li><code class="inline-code">./steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/2221490/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/My Games/Tom Clancy's The Division 2/</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Edit the <code class="inline-code">state.cfg</code> file in a text editor, find where it says "dx12 = true" and change it to false.</li>
<li>Reload the game.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>With it now actually playable, I'm quite hopeful that Valve will have some tricks they can do in Proton to improve performance, on top of the shader stuff mentioned above. Now that it's working, at least they'll be able to investigate it to see if there's anything possibly.</p>
<p>If you find it actually doesn't still run for you, make sure you have the "Proton EasyAntiCheat Runtime" installed from your Steam Library. Just search for it in Steam, it will be there to install. It's supposed to be automatic, but sometimes not.</p>
<p>Now if we could just get Destiny 2, Rainbow Six Siege, Rust and Dead By Daylight then I will have a lot less to complain about.</p>

      <title>Assemble Entertainment talk up their indie hits on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nice to see more publishers taking a direct interest in Steam Deck. Assemble Entertainment recently sent out an email to talk up their games on Valve's handheld. One of which, Endzone - A World Apart, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/endzone-a-world-apart-gets-upgraded-for-steam-deck/" target="_blank">I just covered in an article and video</a>.</p>
<p>They're not the first to do this, with others like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/xbox-game-studios-talk-more-of-their-titles-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Xbox Game Studios</a> publishing their own details directly on Steam. I am surprised we haven't seen more of this though.</p>
<p>In the press release, it was noted that Assemble "is looking to provide an extensive catalogue of hidden gems and instant classics to those who want a great gaming experience on the go" and that "getting everything Steam Deck ready is still a work in progress" but they gave a shout-out to some existing titles.</p>
<p>Currently Steam Deck Verified:</p>

      <title>Endzone - A World Apart gets upgraded for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gentlymad Studios and Assemble Entertainment recently released an upgrade for Endzone - A World Apart, helping out anyone playing it on Steam Deck. This is part of a wider Steam Deck push from Assemble, that I'll be noting in an article to come.</p>
<p>For Endzone, their post-apocalyptic survival city builder, they <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/933820/view/3648509051989294833" target="_blank">announced</a> that they've ported over the UI used on consoles for Steam Deck to give a better experience. Plus, they also adjusted performance and effects to make it work better on the hardware too. One trade-off is the text sizing, as they said "we had to compromise on text size for faster UI usability" that they claim won't harm the experience.</p>
<p>I decided to give it a test directly and capture a little of it that you can see below along with giving some thoughts:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="q8WvJvPr3xA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13479a9f4ccf6114748fc2f8e016d52e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/q8WvJvPr3xA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The new UI is definitely looking good on Steam Deck, it feels like it was built for it. Text sizing as they said is still an issue though, the clarity is not amazing, made worse by how cramped the letter spacing looks with the font they're using but overall not too bad. Playable for sure.</p>
<p>Nice to see more developers optimise the Steam Deck experience. Would be good to see more over this over the next year, as text size especially is important for the Steam Deck. Small fonts are just no good.</p>

      <title>AYANEO confirm their Linux-based AYANEO OS arrives this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AYANEO, maker of some pretty popular gaming handhelds, announced that their own Linux operating system for their devices will be released this year. While we've seen others looking to the public release of SteamOS 3 that powers the Steam Deck (like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/gpd-talk-about-cooperating-with-valve-for-steamos-on-their-devices/" target="_blank">GPD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/onexplayer-looking-at-shipping-handhelds-with-steamos-like-the-steam-deck/" target="_blank">OneXPlayer</a>), AYANEO seem to want to "do a Valve" and have that extra level of control directly.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/AYANEO__/status/1615720358983921667" target="_blank">Twitter</a> their announcement was quite simple noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AYASpace will be upgrade and improved and also AYASpace 2 is under development which will be released in 2023 !<br/>
What's more,  new feature "Community" will be added to AYASpace APP.</p>
<p>Even more exciting, AYANEO OS goes live in 2023 as well 🥳<br/>
Expect official news announced soon ~</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5426039181674053406gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5426039181674053406gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20601100821674053408gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20601100821674053408gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>When they <a href="https://store.ayaneo.com/article/234" target="_blank">previously</a> talked about the Linux-based AYANEO OS, they said "AYANEO team loves games and game consoles as well. In the process of creating the best Windows handheld in the world, they found that the existing operating system in the new form of PC handheld still has many poor experiences, and even some problems that we can't be solved. In order to allow everyone to enjoy the game and the handheld hardware better, AYANEO has launched the AYANEO OS, which is based on the Linux system and developed exclusively." and they mentioned clearly they would be using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> too.</p>
<p>They recently finished their <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-2-completely-different-amd-6800u-handheld#/" target="_blank">IndieGoGo</a> crowdfunding campaign for the AYANEO 2 and the GEEK model, both of which come with an AMD Ryzen 6800U. They had 2,680 people give over their monies to help fund them, with their IndieGoGo now switching to in-demand which is basically like another way to pre-order the devices. So while successful for AYANEO at $3,157,147 currently in total, it's an absolutely tiny fraction of what the Steam Deck has sold which was over a 1 million units back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/kde-steam-deck-akademy-2022/" target="_blank">October last year</a> (that was even before launching in some Asian regions).</p>
<p>If I hear any more, I'll let you know.</p>
<p><em>2023 is clearly the year of Linux gaming handhelds huh?</em></p>

      <title>Circle of Kerzoven is an upcoming settlement builder with lots of simulation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Circle of Kerzoven appears to be one I missed that was pointed out in December last year, as an interesting looking settlement building game that simulates a whole lot of things you need to keep an eye on. <em>The developer of the game pointed it out on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/5511/" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Forum</a>.</em></p>
<p>"Take the role of a leader delegated to build new settlements in remote, unknown corners of the empire. In those forgotten places, nature is wild and legends are more real and vivid than one may think. Experience the challenges of different seasons and climates in a world, where every animal and every plant tries to find their place in nature, while you lead your villagers. How much will you share with nature? Will you strive for balance or even enforce the extinction of certain animals? Follow the old paths… or find your own."</p>
<p>You can see their early trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wrl6BASU938"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/596e34c86e6d160f12893c14281d4e31.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wrl6BASU938" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique deep simulation of the nature in a building strategy game with complex interdependence between humans and nature.</li>
<li>Manage simultaneously the acquisition, refining and distribution of resources on multiple maps in different climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Manage the needs of the citizens. They are “alive” and have a specific home, workplace, and unique needs.</li>
<li>Animals are looking for food, get thirsty, sleepy, and form social groups to find their place in nature.</li>
<li>Plants grow and are affected by the actions of the humans, animals, and their environment.</li>
<li>Seasons and climate affect the gameplay, as certain plants grow only under certain conditions. Temperature affects humans, animals, plants, and the environment.</li>
<li>Interact and trade with other factions that produce goods with the same rules as you do.</li>
<li>Create own maps and scenarios in the editor and extend them using mods.</li>
<li>Charming and calm low poly art style.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stone Kingdoms is an in-development open source remake of Stronghold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Anyone remember the original Stronghold from FireFly Studios? Well, there's an open source remake named Stone Kingdoms. Currently in-development and available on <a href="https://stonekingdoms.itch.io/stone-kingdoms-rts" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/stone-kingdoms/stone-kingdoms" target="_blank">GitLab</a>, the code is under the Apache 2.0 License but it also includes the artwork from the original game with permission from FireFly too (according to the developer of the project).</p>
<p>Developed with <a href="https://love2d.org/" target="_blank">LÖVE</a>, a framework for making 2D games with Lua.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18072956221674040046gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18072956221674040046gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Right now it seems it needs some more developers to jump in and help, with plenty missing from it, so it's not complete and playable. However, it does have enough done that you can load into the game into a map, and start building things so it's clearly off to a great start.</p>
<p>Looking forward to following this along, Stronghold would definitely be a fun game to have a complete open source game engine replacement for that would allow it to continue living on modern platforms long into the future.</p>

      <title>Bluetooth support for the Stadia Controller is now live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google has put up a <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/" target="_blank">web-based tool</a> to turn on the Bluetooth mode for the Stadia Controller, as we finally say goodbye.</p>
<p>They say it works on Chrome 108 and above but when trying to work it on Fedora KDE, it just gives a message about currently being in use by another tab or program no matter what I tried. Even setting up the special udev rules they note in the FAQ, just nothing seemed to work. I had to dust off my old Windows install to do it, where it worked without problems there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8732180721673984024gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8732180721673984024gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The switch is <em>permanent</em>, and headphones won't work when plugged into the bottom of the controller when using Bluetooth mode. Tandem Mode will still work though, where you connect another controller to it but they both act like a single controller.</p>
<p>Once you've managed to enable Bluetooth, you can hold down Stadia + Y to start pairing and continue using it. I'm quite thankful it hasn't ended up as e-waste, because it's damn comfortable to hold. Easily still one of the nicest ever feeling controllers I've used.</p>
<p>Testing it briefly with my Steam Deck in the new Bluetooth mode — it works just fine connecting, and a quick game test showed it fine too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1187464781673984133gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1187464781673984133gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10780370381673984134gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10780370381673984134gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus, the biggest and most important thing to note: there's a time limit. You only have until 31st December 2023 to enable it. Quite a while and no doubt because they just want to shut down everything consumer-side for it and be finally rid of it. </p>

      <title>Stellaris: First Contact story pack announced focusing on pre-FTL and cloaking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellaris: First Contact is the next DLC for the space sci-fi strategy game from Paradox, with more of a focus on the early game. Sounds nice, because after quite a few games played, the early game does end up feeling a little stale.</p>
<p>It's all about expanding events for early civilisations with events and mechanics for pre-FTL civs across the stars, as well as new origins and most excitingly — cloaking tech. The thought of what I can do with that…it will also launch alongside a free update called "Canis Minor" providing something for all players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MjGQJBZBKxI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3679167d9bca9957b11784c8350e1947.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MjGQJBZBKxI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What it will actually include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Origins:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Broken Shackles: You didn’t take to the stars; you were taken to the stars as an alien captive! Now, you and your fellow prisoners have overtaken the ship and found yourselves banding together to survive and thrive as a diverse new community. Can you rise to greatness from this humble origin… and will your former captors take notice?</li>
<li>Payback: No one would have believed your world was being watched keenly by intelligences greater than your own - until they invaded. But you did not go quietly into the night! Your civilization has repelled a would-be conqueror from space, and with sudden access to their advanced technology, you’re about to discover just what else is out there beyond the stars!</li>
<li>Fear of the Dark: As you’ve explored your home system, you’ve always suspected you weren’t alone in the galaxy… especially when one of your planets suddenly suffered an “incident” a while back. A very large faction of your own people have long advocated against tempting fate out in the dark abyss of the unknown. What path will you choose as you find yourself needing room to grow?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New Pre-FTL Interaction Options</strong>: What will your role be when the next member of the galactic community tells their origin story? New mechanics allow for a broader range of interactions with pre-FTL civilizations, depending on their level of technology and their awareness of your presence. Will your arrival be celebrated, or met with violent panic?</li>
<li><strong>Cloaking Technology</strong>: Nobody saw this feature coming! Equip your ships with cloaking devices to survey in secret or catch a foe unaware; keep subtle tabs on your pre-FTL neighbors with cloaked observation posts. Just be sure your own scanners and intel are strong… you never know which of your neighbors might be lurking in the shadows!</li>
</ul>
<p>Stellaris can be purchased on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/Stellaris" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GameImage turns games, emulators and Wine into an AppImage - useful perhaps for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Formerly named Agape, <a href="https://gitlab.com/formigoni/gameimage" target="_blank">GameImage</a> is a way to package up games with either Wine or an Emulator into a portable AppImage that could be useful for the Steam Deck. <em>I could have sworn I wrote about this before, but apparently not. <u>Edit</u>: it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/06/winepak-a-project-to-get-windows-games-packaged-with-wine-flatpak-for-an-easy-linux-installation/" target="_blank">Winepak</a> I was thinking of previously.</em></p>
<p>As the developer on the project explains, emulation is popular and with the Steam Deck here people are doing a lot of it. However, configuration can be an issue, with files getting messed up or going missing and so GameImage aims to help with that as it packages up a runner (like an Emulator or Wine), a game and it's configuration files into a single AppImage.</p>
<p>Now, I should note, there's some obvious <em>legal</em> stuff around this that could cause issues with people sharing their creations with it that could contain full games. So it's of course something more for <em>personal</em> use. That, or you could share creations <em>without</em> the game perhaps for people who just want the configuration all set up and ready for you to slot your game files into after.</p>
<p>Another problem though is bloat. For the Steam Deck especially, drive space is always a concern. Every AppImage made with GameImage would contain duplicates of whatever emulator or Wine version being used, which is the point though, since it's all about being self-contained and easy to run anywhere be it a Steam Deck or desktop Linux. It does use squashfs, which will compress them to save a bit of room.</p>
<p><em>Interesting idea.</em></p>
<p>It currently supports RetroArch, PCSX2, RPCS3, yuzu and Wine. It also supports having a proper logo for each AppImage too, as the developed showed in their example:</p>

      <title>The Division 2 launched on Steam but no support of Steam Deck or Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In another clear case of anti-cheat woes for Steam Deck and Linux desktop gaming, The Division 2 is another broken game. Ubisoft continue their shift back onto Steam, with Tom Clancy's The Division 2 launching January 12. If you were excited to give it a run on Steam Deck though, or a Linux desktop, you're completely out of luck right now. <strong>Update: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/ubisoft-fixed-the-division-2-on-steam-deck-and-linux-desktop/" target="_blank">a fix was released</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The Division 2 uses Easy Anti-Cheat, and while that tech does support Linux and Proton, Ubisoft have seemingly not enabled it. That, <em>or</em> there's other technical issues currently with Proton and support for Easy Anti-Cheat. We've seen some issues in the past like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/valve-dev-understandably-not-happy-about-glibc-breaking-easy-anti-cheat-on-linux/" target="_blank">glibc updates breaking Easy Anti-Cheat</a>, so it <em>could</em> be related.</p>
<p>Currently, no matter the version of Proton picked either the official Proton or the community-made GE-Proton, The Division 2 will load until the Easy Anti-Cheat logo screen and then just get stuck in a loop trying to load it forever until you force-quit the game.</p>
<p>Shame, could have been a good fit for the Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>The longest beard wins in wizard brawler MageQuit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the mood for a simpler action game to play with friends in local or online multiplayer? MageQuit isn't a new game, but I did miss that it added full Native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/572220/view/3271325539822338684" target="_blank">noticed</a> that the game wasn't working well with the Proton compatibility layer with the game crashing (even though it was "Steam Deck Verified" with Proton…), so they made a Native Linux version. Valve hasn't re-verified it, so you'll need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1GvONkE9S0" target="_blank">manually</a> set it to use the Steam Linux Runtime if you're on Steam Deck but desktop Linux will download it normally.</p>
<p>This wizard brawler is all about "spell drafting and beard envy" with up to 10 players online or locally throwing around spells, with a beard that grows on each kill and the longest beard at the end of 9 rounds wins. There's 70 different spells to use, AI bots support, spell curving for trick shots, controller support, various game modes like teams or free for all, a dynamic soundtrack and cross-play between PC and Xbox.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="54iOlcE9_V8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3589f0cac4d573e4d8bf6e6c3a66ccc4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/54iOlcE9_V8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's really nice to see more games like this that actually have offline play, some developers making the big mistake of being online-only and it's real difficult for smaller indie games like this to cut through the noise to get players.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/572220/MageQuit/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Old World - The Sacred and The Profane DLC adds a lot of new events</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World - The Sacred and The Profane is a new DLC for the impressive historical strategy game from Mohawk Games and publisher Hooded Horse. I'm actually really surprised by Old World, it arrived on Steam <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/old-world-from-the-civilization-iv-designer-releases-on-steam-along-with-linux-support/" target="_blank">back in May 2022</a> with full Native Linux support that worked great. Since then, they've continued regularly updating the game with new free content and upgrades.</p>
<p>This new DLC just dropped out of nowhere and it's pretty big too! While it's a historical game, this expansion is more about the "what if". It includes over 350 new events, new clergy characters, 10 new character traits, six new historical characters, new religious dissent mechanics as well as a bunch of "cult" city projects.</p>

      <title>The next Valheim biome will be Ashlands, a land of the dead</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim developer Iron Gate AB has begun teasing the next biome update, and they're doing things a little bit differently with Ashlands. They're not going to be so secretive about it, as they want to be more transparent. This will also likely help for those who kept thinking they weren't doing enough, as their community was quite outspoken on how long Mistlands took to arrive.</p>
<p><em>While they won't be as secretive, it may mean they show things that don't end up making it into the game.</em></p>
<p>Ashlands is also not going to be spread across the map, instead it will be placed at the far south as a big volcanic island. They're also sharing some pre-production concept art of what they want it to have:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14221731491673951224gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14221731491673951224gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7532811241673951226gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7532811241673951226gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In regards to it taking a long time to add a new biome, they said they they do have some " fun things planned for you between then and now", which does include an Xbox version that has full cross-play support so you'll be able to play with your console buddies. They also teased some difficulty settings and something called "Hildir’s Quest", which will be a new NPC and a new way to re-style your hair. More clothes seem to be coming too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13111705391673951388gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13111705391673951388gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Accessibility is also going to be a focus in future, as they want more people to be able to play the game. They've suggested sending them an email, if you have a disability or anything else that affects your gaming to chat about possible solutions that might help. Nice to see a focus on that.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam desktop and Steam Deck Beta fixes up more on-screen keyboard issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a fresh Steam desktop and Steam Deck Client Beta, with more fixes for the on-screen keyboard and other adjustments.</p>
<p>With the New Big Picture Mode being on desktop now, as continued from previous Beta releases a lot of the changes between them are similar or the same now.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6763877288741739919" target="_blank">changed</a> for desktop Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed onscreen keyboard opening on desktop and in-game when opened via controller.</li>
<li>Added up/down cursor keys to onscreen keyboard, press shift then left/right cursor to use.</li>
<li>Decreased size of the full &amp; partial controller support icons on app portraits.</li>
<li>Added pinned notifications for new inventory items, trade offers, async game turns, moderator messages, offline chat messages, and help request replies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/5662747178724589491" target="_blank">notes</a> for Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed opening onscreen keyboard in-game causing input to no longer go to game.</li>
<li>Added up/down cursor keys to keyboard, press shift then left/right cursor to use.</li>
<li>Added option to ignore Steam Rewards on Account page if they were registered by another user on the device.</li>
<li>Decreased size of the full &amp; partial controller support icons on app portraits.</li>
<li>Added pinned notifications for new inventory items, trade offers, async game turns, moderator messages, offline chat messages, and help request replies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once <em>again</em> though, they've copy pasted from the desktop Beta notes to Steam Deck, as the full and partial controller icons on app pictures are not on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer - Part 21: Fluffy Bunnies</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-20-the-antediluvian-world/" target="_blank">Part 20: The Antideluvian World</a></strong></p>
<p>While their foray into interactive storybooks did fail to impress, it did help remind me of BlackHoleSun Software, one of the earliest Indie developers to create games with Linux in mind. They were a cross-platform studio whose first game <em>Krilo </em>was boasted to be the first "commercial game that contained versions for Linux, Windows, MacOS, and BeOS on one CD-ROM", with at least some of their games having been developed from Linux and then ported to other systems.</p>
<p>Their most well known game<em> Bunnies</em> would be released as shareware in 2001, with the bunnies-1.06-x86linux.sh installer providing a demo version you could later update through the use of a retail key. Since BlackHoleSun Software is now out of business I can no longer register my copy of the game, which is a shame as <em>Bunnies</em> while braindead is still kind of fun. The demo limits me to playing only one map called "The Castle", with eleven further maps being teased.</p>
<p><em>Bunnies</em> also included a level editor for registered players which helped spawn an active mapping scene, with a collection of fan maps once being hosted on the BlackHoleSun Software website. Up to six rabbits can compete at any given time, and can be either computer or human controlled. The objective is simple; just move your rabbit to hop on top of other bunnies to make a rain of gibs fly out across the screen, or not if the "no gore" option has been set.</p>
<p>In fact, an entirely gore free version of the game was also made available, by using the bunnies-nogore-1.06-x86linux.sh script instead of the default installer. <em>Bunnies</em> allowed the player to connect to online servers for networked multiplayer, as well as for up to four players to play locally from a single computer. Gameplay modifiers include being able to toggle a low gravity mode, jetpacks, or even reversing the orientation of any given map.</p>
<p>Technically the game ran alright for me, but did produce a few segmentation faults and some graphical corruptions when displaying text fields. BlackHoleSun Software would go on to work on one more game, the 3D team based vehicular combat title <em>Aftermath,</em> before they folded up shop in the mid 2000s<em>. </em>At this point though the future of <em>Bunnies</em> or any of the other games from BlackHoleSun Software appears dead in the water.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1680471651671834404gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1680471651671834404gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7271695401671834195gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7271695401671834195gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully, the story does not have to end there. <em>Bunnies</em> itself is derivative of the earlier game <em>Jump 'n Bump </em>released for MS-DOS in 1998 by developer Brainchild Design, with its source code made available a year later in 1999. This allowed the game to be ported over to Linux using the SimpleDirect Media Layer, with installation on Red Hat Linux 7.3 being made trivial by use of the jumpnbump-1.50-1.0.rh7.rf.i386.rpm package from freshrpms.</p>
<p><em>Jump 'n Bump</em> allows for up to four players to play over the network or from a local hotseat. The game also sported an active mapping scene in its day, with a number of additional maps once being available from the Brainchild Design website. Most of these maps can still be accessed through the Wayback Machine on the Internet Archive, although the need for someone to maintain a modern curated archive of these appears to be apparent.</p>
<p>If I am honest I would say the overall visual style and presentation of <em>Jump 'n Bump</em> is superior to <em>Bunnies</em>, with cleaner pixel art and a cute interactive menu screen. The gameplay is pretty much identical, with the same frantic hopping about and the same rain of gibs upon contact. Even most of the modifiers found in <em>Bunnies</em> can be unlocked inside <em>Jump 'n Bump</em> through the use of cheat codes, along with a few tweaks unique to <em>Jump 'n Bump</em> itself.</p>
<p>You can even activate AI controls by holding down the Alt key followed by the number of the player you wish to bring to life, allowing <em>Jump 'n Bump </em>to be tackled as a single player game. With its assets available work on <em>Jump 'n Bump</em> has continued apace, with a fork of the game supporting SDL2 still seeing active development. There is also a modern remake of the game based on the Godot Engine, and even a version made that can be ran from within a web browser.</p>
<p><em>Jump 'n Bump</em> is far from the only time the free software community has created an enduring game, with its close to twenty five years of existence seeming paltry in comparison to some of the classics. One of those classics wears many faces, but there is one face in particular that has remained etched in my memory for years, even if I never did get a good handle on the game's actual mechanics. It is time to change that.</p>

      <title>Tabletop Club is a free and open source physics-based 3D tabletop game sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a Tabletop Simulator like experience but prefer free and open source games? Keep an eye on Tabletop Club. One I've been meaning to give a shout-out to for a little while, as I dig through a bunch of my missed items from before the holiday season.</p>
<p>Available under the MIT license on <a href="https://github.com/drwhut/tabletop-club" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://drwhut.itch.io/tabletop-club" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, it enables you to play various tabletop games offline or online without the need for registrations and logins as you can just host a game and share a room code with friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Tabletop Club, you are given a box of toys to play with, and it's up to you what you do with them! Sure, you can play board games, but why not make a house made of dice, then frisbee it with a poker chip? Draw on the table while waiting for your opponent to make a move in chess, or flip the table into deep space after losing an all-in bet? The table is your oyster!</p>

<p>Early days for the game project, with a first Beta version only going up in November last year. Nice to see more open source games appear though, especially stuff like this that can have such wide uses.</p>

      <title>Breachway is a deck-building Slay the Spire meets FTL: Faster Than Light </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Breachway looks like one to watch, a game the blends together the deck-building of Slay the Spire and space antics of FTL. Two of my favourite indie games right there, and I must admit Breachway looks pretty good.</p>
<p>In the game you will explore a randomized galaxy and build up a card deck of different ships, modules, crew and experiment with different combinations. You get to upgrade your ships too and unlock new cards to take into battle. According to a developer post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2118810/discussions/0/5704402939722726569/#c3728449612309803135" target="_blank">Steam</a>, they plan Linux support too with testing already going on for it. Have a look at the trailer below:</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complex Ship upgrade system</strong> - Acquire powerful equipment for your ship, further enhancing its performance with a multitude of subsystems.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse tactical choices</strong> - Hack enemy equipment or disable it with precise rail-gun attacks, overwhelm your enemy with flak barrages, or cook them alive with laser attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Uncover powerful card synergies</strong> - Test out new card combinations and approaches to combat by mixing and matching equipment and cards in your deck.</li>
<li><strong>Assemble a rag-tag crew</strong> - Each crew member has their own quirks and allegiances that have an effect on how you react to encounters and deal with various factions.</li>
<li><strong>Unlock new ships and factions</strong> - Unlock special faction-specific ships as you play and experience the story and events from different angles.</li>
<li><strong>Carve your own unique path</strong> - Your crew and previous choices determine how you can interact with the varied events you encounter on your journey, while tense narrative encounters force you to grapple with morally grey decisions.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Stop an alien substance spreading in the Regulator City demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Regulator City is an upcoming action rogue-like from developer Orangepixel, where you're tasked with stopping the spread of a strange powerful alien substance.</p>
<p>This strange ooze is seeping out of an asteroid that crashed into the city, with various gangs using it to become stronger and more dangerous but you've got access to an apparently "safe" version of it to give you some special abilities of your own.</p>
<p>In the game you control a single character but you also have an AI controlled team supporting your every move, so technically you're all of them. You can lead the way, or hang back a bit and watch the chaos as your team goes in to take out all the bad guys. Use the AI as your weapon, the developer says.</p>
<p>You can see some gameplay from the developer below:</p>

<p>Seems like it's going to be a pixel-smashing good time.</p>
<p>A free demo is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1892750/Regulator_City/" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>State of the industry: MSI offered a chance to win the ability to buy a GPU</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The GPU industry is so broken right now and to make things worse, MSI thought it would be a good idea to do a lottery for a chance to win the ability to buy a GPU. I had to do a triple-take to make sure I was reading it right.</p>
<p>I would really love to have been a fly on the wall in the meeting where MSI <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/luckyticketGPU" target="_blank">thought this</a> was a good idea. A competition that lasted all of 3 days, where people who signed up and entered would be put into a prize-draw where MSI would pull names out of a hat and give them the chance to buy a GeForce RTX 4090 within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Wow, that's super generous isn't it? <em>A "limited" amount of people would also get a $50 MSI store code.</em></p>
<p>I can't be alone in thinking that was just really weird, getting a chance to possibly spend money by entering a competition. What in the world…I thought doing a lottery was supposed to be the exact opposite of that. Did I fall into an alternate even worse universe recently?</p>
<p>Am I going insane, or is the GPU industry just a complete total mess right now? Prices are absolutely crazy, pricing out a huge amount of people with AMD and NVIDIA focusing mostly on the high-end with their latest chips, with both sides also having plenty of problems like <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/pci-sig-12vhpower-nvidia-statement" target="_blank">melted power connectors</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/amd-reveal-ryzen-7000-x3d-processors-desktop-65w-cpus-and-new-mobile-chips/" target="_blank">temperature issues</a> (noted at the bottom). Then we have Intel, whose new GPUs aren't exactly turning heads.</p>
