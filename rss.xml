      <title>Semi-open world paper plane adventure &#39;Paper Sky&#39; coming to Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I do love how indie developers come up with all these unique and quirky game ideas, and now Paper Sky is on the way from developer BRUTE FORCE who also made the dynamic physics platformer Crumble. Crumble was well made and a pretty clever game overall, so I'm keen to see more from this developer.</p>
<p>They've launched a Kickstarter with a goal of 35,000€ EUR, which they have until Fri, May 24 2024 to hit. For those of you who love more casual games, this might be for you. It's going to have Native Linux support, and full testing on Steam Deck. The developer even noted they're planning proper gyroscope integration too for controlling the plane by tilting.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pFBkgPXEWtM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4331ad3c6c8bf177bb9d529dfd799d57.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pFBkgPXEWtM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fold your own Paper plane in the first game to ever let you do that.</li>
<li>Dynamic paper transformation, either glide with the paper plane or roll with the paper ball.</li>
<li>10+ hours of relaxing yet challenging gameplay, experimenting with the world and fully exploring the wind flows.</li>
<li>Write your message, and help other players carry on theirs just like they helped yours.</li>
<li>12 unique art styles.</li>
<li>Challenge mode, compete against others to see who can glide the farthest in an online Paper Plane competition using your own folded paper plane.</li>
<li>Customizable plane, beyond its flying capability you will be able to fly your colours.</li>
<li>Play at your own pace - No hard skill checks, no dark souls filtering bosses. If you can't use the skies, use the ground.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo on the Steam page but currently only for Windows, so you'll need Proton to test it for now. However, they said the Beta will be available on all platforms. The full release is planned for 2025.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1617230/Paper_Sky/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist / follow on Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bruteforce/paper-sky" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fund it on the Kickstarter</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve makes paid &#39;Advanced Access&#39; a clear feature on Steam now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With more and more AAA publishers putting up special editions of games you can pay extra for, to play a few days before the main release, Valve has formally made "Advanced Access" a thing on Steam.</p>
<p>You know the drill, you've seen it right? "Buy the Deluxe Edition or the Special Edition, and you get to play 3 days before everyone else!" something to that effect anyway. Publishers have been using all sorts of naming and wording for it — until now. On top of Valve adjusting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/steam-refunds-get-adjusted-to-account-for-pre-release-playtime/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the refund rules</a> recently, this whole Advanced Access thing is now, well — an actual thing on Steam.</p>
<p>Noticed by <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1783058912142360635" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> creator Pavel Djundik on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1785650/TopSpin_2K25/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TopSpin 2K25</a> you'll see this for example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18923932561713957989gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18923932561713957989gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p><em>Seems like Valve did a bit of a woops there though. The Learn more link actually goes to the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6554-ED29-FBDB-1612" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Early Access info</a> page instead of the new <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/453F-5C96-EAC2-9145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access page</a>. I'm sure they'll fix that soon though.</em></p>
<p>At least according to the Advanced Access page, it seems the feature is open to any developer to do this. As Valve say "Games by default will not include an Advanced Access pre-purchase option. This will be setup at the discretion of the developer/publisher creating and selling their products.". So it's not reserved for AAA.</p>
<p>With this getting promoted to be a proper official Steam feature, it's no surprise then to see them going over some of their rules like refunds to ensure people aren't gaming it by playing as much as possible before "release" (what does <em>release</em> even really mean now?) to refund it.</p>
<p>How do you feel about Advanced Access?</p>

      <title>Atari revives Infogrames and acquires Totally Reliable Delivery Service</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari are trying more and more to make a proper full comeback now and they've just announced a revival of Infogrames along with acquiring Totally Reliable Delivery Service.</p>
<p>Infogrames returns as a new publishing label, which was well known from the 1980s to early 2000s, with plans to acquire various IP and publish games directly, that "fall outside the core portfolio of IP associated with the Atari brand" and they see "game preservation as a core component of its mission".</p>
<p>“For decades, Infogrames built a reputation as a publisher and developer of amazing and eclectic games, and we are excited to bring it back,” said Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari. </p>
<p>As part of this, they've also swallowed up Totally Reliable Delivery Service (which has Linux support) from tinyBuild as their first purchase.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15032684571713954110gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>“With Totally Reliable Delivery Service, Infogrames is starting off with a strong IP that has a loyal and enthusiastic player base,” commented Geoffroy Châteauvieux, Manager of Infogrames LLC. “The Infogrames team will be able to expand upon the strong work of tinyBuild, and re-energize this high-potential franchise.”</p>
<p>In the last year or so we've seen <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Atari buy up Nightdive Studios</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a>, and it seems they plan to keep going. Let's hope they don't end up as another Embracer Group that ends up being the cause of so many job losses they ended up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-companies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">splitting into three companies</a>.</p>

      <title>Flathub for Linux apps has been given quite the makeover</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://flathub.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub</a> is my favourite place to grab various apps for Linux and Steam Deck and it just had a bit of a makeover and it's looking fancy.</p>
<p>The new update brings with it a rotating featured banner with 5 apps updated weekly, an app of the day listing, new grouping for trending apps along with a tabbed section for trending, popular, new and updated. Thanks to their work behind the scenes to get developers to update all their listings to have proper branding and colouring, it's all looking a bit swish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17311972751713953194gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17311972751713953194gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The tabbed section switch below the featured banners is a good touch, giving you a quick and easy glance at some of the latest and popular. The team on <a href="https://floss.social/@flathub/112315662449987878" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> noted that this has been "almost a year in the making, including tons of work on documentation, backend, frontend, and the actual metadata in apps".</p>
<p>Oh, and according to developer Cassidy James on <a href="https://mastodon.blaede.family/@cassidy/112316204447915007" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> there's now well over 3 million active users of Flathub.</p>
<p>Nice to see Flathub continue to evolve and improve, especially nice with their team actually doing proper verification for apps and games getting listed along with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/flathub-now-prominently-notes-unverified-flatpak-apps/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting unverified apps</a>.</p>

      <title>Minecraft v1.20.5 the Armored Paws drop update is live now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mojang have released the latest upgrade to Minecraft with the version 1.20.5 the Armored Paws drop free update out now.</p>
<p>This update brings in the new Armadillo and Armadillo Scutes, Wolf Armor and Wolf variants. Armadillo look pretty cute and fun as a new passive mob that rolls up when it detects certain threats. Good for helping deal with Spiders and Cave Spiders since they will run away from them when not rolled up too. They drop Armadillo Scutes, periodically and when brushed, which is an essential item for crafting the new Wolf Armor.</p>
<p>Not just that there's also a big change to chunk spawning, making the radius more configurable and they've also decreased the default value to give most players a performance boost. More on that in a previous <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w03a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">snapshot post</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UKF91_m_B2Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/95395dfa46647143207808dcccad753b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UKF91_m_B2Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Plenty more was changed in this release too including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The UI has been updated with a fresher look.</li>
<li>Decreased the default size of the spawn chunks and made the value configurable.</li>
<li>Updated the health and damage dealt by Tamed Wolves.</li>
<li>Adjusted spawning conditions for Wolves, allowing them to spawn on Coarse Dirt and Podzol blocks.</li>
<li>Adjusted the texture of the Wolf Collar layer to be more consistent with the new Wolf Armor.</li>
<li>Adjusted passive mobs spawning in Grove biome to only include Rabbits, Foxes and Wolves.</li>
<li>Minor tweaks to existing Blocks, Items and Entities.</li>
<li>Added option to use Japanese variants of CJK characters.</li>
<li>Added support for Viossa language.</li>
<li>When entities leave or enter The End, the area they arrive in will now stay loaded for 15 seconds, matching the behavior of Nether Portals.</li>
<li>Improvements to the Game's Performance.</li>
<li>Improved handling of errors during saving and loading.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Minecraft also now requires Java 21. The full changelog lists rather a lot of changes along with plenty of experimental features you can turn on like the new Mace weapon.</p>
<p>See the release <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/armored-paws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> and <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-20-5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for more.</p>

      <title>Ghostwire: Tokyo removed Denuvo Anti-Tamper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know plenty of people skip over games with Denuvo Anti-Tamper, so for those who do you may wish to now take a look at Ghostwire: Tokyo.</p>
<p>For Linux and Steam Deck players, it can be a special nuisance since it can end up entirely locking you out of games for a day or so when switching around Proton versions. And if you play on both PC and Steam Deck (or other handhelds), that can cause quite a problem when trying to get games to work well as you try different things. So now it shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>You can see the update noted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1475810/history/?changeid=U:47536834" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> showing its removal, with the developer and publisher being silent on it. Most games get it removed eventually, since they need to keep paying for it, eventually it's not worth it once a game is past its prime.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wPTX1I2pKeA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f32c3da0e9d77b5e5d96fd1cd0a354ca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wPTX1I2pKeA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Ghostwire: Tokyo is rated Steam Deck Verified and ProtonDB Gold.</p>

      <title>Horizon Forbidden West gets Intel XeSS v1.3 and text scaling</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Steam Deck players, and those with not so great vision, as the latest update to Horizon Forbidden West brings in some essential improvements. For Steam Deck players, Valve have rated it as Steam Deck Unsupported for now as they say it can't perform well enough.</p>
<p>Maybe with the newly updated Intel XeSS v1.3 it might be a bit better? Additionally, the developers added text scaling with it being set to Large by default on Steam Deck. It's really nice to see a developer pay attention to these things (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/dead-island-2-arrives-on-steam-boasting-of-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unlike Dead Island 2</a>) although one day I do hope to see such a basic thing in releases and not updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5870698061713948036gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Thankfully the experience seems reasonable on Desktop Linux, with people on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2420110?device=any" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating it Gold overall.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's all that's changed in version 1.3.55.0:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved the visual quality of dust.</li>
<li>Added Interface Text Size option in the General Settings menu.</li>
<li>Improvements to texture streaming to reduce memory usage and improve quality.</li>
<li>Updated Intel XeSS to version 1.3 with improved image quality and new XeSS Native AA option.</li>
<li>Resolved performance regression when enabling NVIDA Reflex On+Boost.</li>
<li>When using Quick Slot hotkeys to select weapons, the last used ammo type used will now be remembered.</li>
<li>Improved smoothness of camera movement in Photo Mode when using the mouse.</li>
<li>Removed hardcoded Mouse and Keyboard bindings for actions such as Navigation Assist in Focus Mode. They now listen to their respective remappable key bindings.</li>
<li>Various optimizations and stability improvements.</li>
<li>Various UI bugfixes.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam refunds get adjusted to account for pre-release playtime</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a small tweak to their refund policy, which closes a small loophole left open for Early Access and Advanced Access.</p>
<p>Their refund system is pretty reasonable giving you 14 days from purchase and 2 hours of play until you can no longer refund a title, but it seems it was left just a little bit <em>too</em> open in some cases. The good news is that Valve's not actually changing those rules, it's just getting a tweak to take into account <em>all</em> time played including before the full release date. So you won't be able to refund a game that gave you a few days access early, if you put over 2 hours into it, which it seems you could before.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4195741362094579141" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam, Valve said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we have updated a portion of our Refund Policy regarding pre-purchased titles. This change covers titles that are in pre-purchase and offer “<a href="https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/453F-5C96-EAC2-9145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access</a>”. Playtime acquired during the Advanced Access period will now count towards the Steam refund period. You can find out more information regarding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Refunds here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we look back to earlier in April the refund page simply stated this about pre-purchases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REFUNDS ON PRE-PURCHASED TITLES</p>
<p>When you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title. The standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the game’s release date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it now reads as this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REFUNDS ON TITLES PURCHASED PRIOR TO RELEASE DATE</p>
<p>When you purchase a title on Steam prior to the release date, the two-hour playtime limit for refunds will apply (except for beta testing), but the 14-day period for refunds will not start until the release date. For example, if you purchase a game that is in <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6554-ED29-FBDB-1612" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Early Access</a> or <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/453F-5C96-EAC2-9145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Advanced Access</a>, any playtime will count against the two-hour refund limit. If you pre-purchase a title which is not playable prior to the release date, you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title, and the standard 14-day/two-hour refund period will apply starting on the game’s release date.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems pretty straightforward and fair enough. </p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 40 is officially out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for some more upgrades? Today Fedora Linux 40 has now been officially released bringing with it big upgrades with GNOME 46, KDE Plasma 6 and lots more. Plus the usual assortment of upgrades and enhancements to all the core applications.</p>
<p>With this release you're getting Linux kernel 6.8, Mesa 24.0.5, Wayland out of the box for the KDE edition, the inclusion of PyTorch for deep learning, numerous security improvements and so much more across the bump in versions of KDE and GNOME with all the enhancements there like improved HDR support in Plasma, experimental Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) in GNOME and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20962377431713884748gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20962377431713884748gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They also revived the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora Atomic Desktops</a> branding which includes Fedora Silverblue, Fedora Kinoite, Fedora Sway Atomic and Fedora Budgie Atomic. So if you fancy a different type of Linux distribution perhaps give those a try that use either ostree or image-based provisioning that the Fedora team say isn't really "immutable" so it's being clearer going forward.</p>
<p>See more in the release <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-40/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>. And you can see the overview of changes for <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/whats-new-fedora-workstation-40/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora Workstation</a> and <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/whats-new-in-fedora-kde-40/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora KDE</a>.</p>
<p>You might also want to read the interesting blog post titled "<a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2024/04/23/notifications-46-and-beyond/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Notifications in 46 and beyond</a>", which goes over the work involved in improving notifications in GNOME thanks to funding from the Sovereign Tech Fund.</p>

      <title>Trackline Express is a quirky, funny and unique journey</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackline Express is a game all about getting your train across an unforgiving desert, and it's a whole lot of fun coming from Bubblebird Studio who also made the cute Haven Park. Note: key provided by KeyMailer.</p>
<p>Going into Trackline Express I thought I was getting something a <em>bit</em> like Unrailed! but it's actually <em>very</em> different. Here it's much more of a crafting and people-management adventure, while also defending a train from various AI characters you meet that wish to destroy it. There's plenty of chaos but I adore it, especially the scraggly drawn graphics that really give it a lot of charm.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19658716011713882999gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19658716011713882999gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The gameplay has a nice loop to it too and in some ways it's a lot more relaxed compared to Unrailed!. You start off alone, gradually getting more passengers as you go, with each passenger able to contribute to the journey and you can switch between the passengers at any time. So you can have one off chopping wood, one mining coal to keep you going, one defending you from barbarian attacks and so on. The train also only moves when you put someone in the engine, so you move on when you're stocked-up and ready to go.</p>
<p>It's all about managing your time, along with the finite resources in each section. Each passenger has their own health and a water bar too with all the actions costing water, so you need to keep sending your passengers around to little pools and water pumps to fill back up again. </p>
<p>The crafting system is quite interesting too. Giving you various tools to get resources, buildings to help transform resources like ore into actual usable Iron and you can even build new parts for your train. When you want to craft something you have to pay to unlock it using coins you've gathered or sold resources for, then you place down the blueprint to dump resources into to eventually build it. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5584659351713881196gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5584659351713881196gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5848369571713881197gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5848369571713881197gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Click images to enlarge them</em></p>
<p>Don't have enough resources for what you wanted to build? Just pick up the blueprint, even if it has some resources in it, and make a run for it while another passenger runs the train. This is needed, because you only have a limited safe area around the train, as going outside it hurts your passenger and losing a passenger can be quite fatal to your plans. You can also place buildings on your train, to take useful things like a Forge on the go.</p>
<p>Quite silly overall but I've been really enjoying it.</p>
<p>All this because you're trying to get away from wildfires, so if you take too long, eventually it will catch up to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614270731713881438gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4614270731713881438gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Left something behind? You can set the train to go backwards to go and grab it too. It's such an overall odd blending of game mechanics, but it all comes together quite nicely.</p>
<p>Just be prepared for failure, because you <em>will</em> fail. Sometimes because you die during an attack, sometimes because you've just messed up the resources and need to restart a section. That is one slight issue with it, because the resources are finite like trees, mines and pools only giving a specific amount of each, you could end up stuck. But that's also part of the challenge - using everything wisely.</p>

<p>It has Native Linux support and I had no problems there at all, it all worked very nicely. I can easily recommend this one for those of you looking for something entertaining that's a bit different to a lot of what's coming out lately. Trackline Express is a game full of character that's well worth picking up. High replay value too so you'll get plenty of hours out of this one.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2343920/Trackline_Express/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Shoot through a mass of alien cells in Swarm Grinder 1.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Swarm Grinder is a repeatable action roguelite where you control a little mech, as you battle your way through a big swarm of cells that spawn various types of enemies. An interesting one if you enjoy games like Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>Here you spawn into a procedurally generated map full of alien cells. As you travel around, these cells burst and reveal various types of enemies. These cells regrow too, so sitting still is not an option and you need the fuel they drop to keep going. Every so often you get a big wave that bursts out of the cells to deal with. There's plenty of upgrades to change your run too, which you get by clearing specific areas of cells to call down a mining system which spawns 3 different upgrades to pick from.</p>
<p>It gives a similar sort of feeling to Vampire Survivors, Brotato and many other survivor-like games with the auto-firing mechanic but it's probably one of the most unique around and it just hit the big 1.0 and left Early Access.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UijnTE9cob4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/34e4066c418e086cd1f93593b39be813.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UijnTE9cob4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's a really interesting idea for a game! It has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Playable. The Linux version on Desktop works great, and since the initial release the performance on Steam Deck is also much improved. It's now usually above 50FPS, instead of dropping below 30FPS.</p>

      <title>Khronos Group seeking proposals for paid work to improve OpenXR for Godot Engine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group, the overseers of many open standards like OpenGL, Vulkan, OpenXR and more are currently looking to pay someone to improve OpenXR in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>They recently on April 22nd posted up a <a href="https://www.khronos.org/rfp/godot-integration" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Request for Proposal for the work</a> as they hope to "expand and demonstrate the reach of the API Standard by better integrating OpenXR with the Godot game engine to effectively bridge the gap between runtime developers and application developers".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">So they're hoping the work will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a testbed for the OpenXR API by enabling a direct feedback channel between app developers and runtime developers. A byproduct of this is building the OpenXR Advisory Panel with app developers to ensure successful OpenXR Conferences with the Outreach Subgroup.</li>
<li>Improve developer documentation including examples with WG notes on best practices. Although the OpenXR Tutorial Project covers using OpenXR directly, most app developers will use a library/engine therefore providing examples at the engine level is still needed.</li>
<li>Provide a OpenXR Working Group (OWG) approved open-source reference for other game engines and libraries to reduce fragmentation in the industry. Since Godot is MIT-licensed, the work done in this project can be freely integrated into proprietary projects, advancing the entire industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>As per the <a href="https://members.khronos.org/document/dl/32395" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> they're willing to pay up to $100,000 for the work and you need to send in any proposals by 22nd May, 2024. They say anyone that has experience with Godot and OpenXR is welcome to submit a proposal to be considered.</p>

      <title>Rhythm-shooter roguelite KILLBEAT sounds like a real blast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You don't see many roguelites like this! KILLBEAT blends musical rhythm shooting with fast-paced action to create something that looks rather fun.</p>
<p>With music inspired by EDM and metal, the developers say the unique soundtrack adds a spin with catchy vocal chop melodies. The music goes along with the gameplay of course and if you manage to get a good combo going, it adds additional musical instruments to the tracks and you get some gameplay bonuses.</p>
<p>More about it: "Descend into the depths of Cadence Drop, a mysterious sinkhole devouring an entire city. Fight your way through monsters and bosses as you venture deeper, driven by the rhythm towards the source of the beat.</p>
<p>Explore procedurally generated levels with rhythm driven, skill-based gameplay. Shoot, Dash, Reload, Repeat, and Finish off your enemies on beat. Create varied builds with synergies for each run - Offence is your best defense."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZUzLsUqifGM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fefd8d9b8333951257ea7cbcaacb67d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZUzLsUqifGM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developers have said they will be doing a Linux version, which you can sign up to their newsletter for more info on their <a href="https://kalmagames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> as they're looking for testers. So here's your chance to ensure it's a good release.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2808530/KILLBEAT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Valve tweak 4K screen scaling on Linux, plus more Remote Play fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A fresh Desktop Steam Client Beta has been released, and it sounds like a useful one for those of you who do Remote Play. It's always nice to see more Remote Play fixes, because it often ends up as the least stable feature on Steam, especially on Linux.</p>
<p>Here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4219385260137009468" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Remote Play</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the streaming button staying stuck on "Stop" when the streaming client exits quickly.</li>
<li>Fixed framerate drop when capturing over 120 FPS.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slow startup on busy systems.</li>
<li>Changed the default scale from 200% to 150% on a 4K monitor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>SteamOS 3.5.19 Preview out for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small SteamOS Preview update for Steam Deck, along with an additional Steam Client Beta update. </p>
<p>After releasing <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/steamos-3518-preview-released-for-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.18 Preview</a> only recently that curiously mentioned some rather vague "Stability and security improvements". Here we are again with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4202496761535270229" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.5.19 Preview</a> with more weirdly vague "Additional stability and security improvements".</p>
<p>I have to admit my curiosity has piqued now. What are the changes and why are Valve now being repeatedly vague on it, when previously they've been really quite detailed with all their fixes? It could be that they don't want to detail them properly until it goes stable for everyone, to prevent issues being jumped on by bad actors to cause issues perhaps.</p>
<p>A Steam Deck Client Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4202496761535420316" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> was also released with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed slow startup on busy systems.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the streaming button staying stuck on "Stop" when the streaming client exits quickly.</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Buying the bundle also enters you in for a chance to win a 512GB Steam Deck OLED, which will be chosen at random during the week starting May 6th.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A freshly squeezed cup of Proton Experimental was released today by Valve containing fixes for multiple games on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux like Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>Firstly, they're listing Sonic Colors: Ultimate as now playable, with a lot of people using GE-Proton to play it previously. Plus there's now some initial D3D12 support for OpenVR which they note should work for Battlezone Gold Edition in DX12 mode.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Other changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West no longer displays warning about outdated drivers with Nvidia GPUs.</li>
<li>Updated Wine Mono to <a href="https://github.com/madewokherd/wine-mono/releases/tag/wine-mono-9.1.0" target="_blank">9.1.0</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton 9.0 regressions:
<ul>
<li>Overwatch 2 no longer randomly crashes.</li>
<li>Video playback in Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition works again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2757628091713802495gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2757628091713802495gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - Overwatch 2</p>
<p>And the changes for Wine Mono (replacement for the .NET Framework) v9.1.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to a license change in Vagrant, the Vagrant build files have been removed in favor of Podman. The official build of this release was also made using Podman.</li>
<li>Fixed a build error on systems that use a scheduling policy not in a hard-coded list.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when auto-generating a COM interface for some classes with array types in their signature (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55736" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Winehq bug 55736</a>).</li>
<li>Implemented String.Concat(object, object, object, object, __arglist) (<a href="https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56248" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Winehq bug 56248</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed doubled characters when typing in Terraria.</li>
<li>Added support for Joystick and Keyboard inputs in Managed DirectX/monoDX.</li>

      <title>Dead Island 2 arrives on Steam boasting of Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver have now finally released Dead Island 2 on Steam, after previously being Epic Games exclusive and they're boasting about Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A deadly virus is spreading across Los Angeles, turning its inhabitants into ravenous zombies. The city is in quarantine and the military have retreated. Bitten, infected, but more than just immune, you learn to harness the zombie inside of you. Only you, and the handful of other swaggering assholes who happen to be resistant to the pathogen, hold the future of Los Angeles (and humanity), in the balance.  <br/>
 <br/>
As you uncover the truth behind the outbreak you’ll discover the truth of who – or <em>what –</em> you are. Survive, evolve, save the world – just another day in LA! </p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5278328781713801633gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5278328781713801633gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While it does look really good, I do want to touch on an issue. Their new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOx07gV3thY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam trailer</a>, which I can't embed here due to it being age-restricted on YouTube, boasts pretty clearly "Steam Deck Support". However, Valve has only given it a Steam Deck Playable rating which notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This game sometimes shows mouse, keyboard, or non-Steam-Deck controller icons.</li>
<li>Entering some text requires manually invoking the on-screen keyboard.</li>
<li>Some in-game text is small and may be difficult to read.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why in 2024 is font sizing still an issue? It's such a basic accessibility feature.</em></p>
<p>Additionally the first-time setup requires an active Internet connection (Denuvo Anti-tamper) and lesser so an issue since it is primarily a handheld, it doesn't default to external Bluetooth/USB controllers on Deck so you need to manually switch. Their own <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/934700/discussions/0/4368004468484074346/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum post</a> on it also goes over some other issues like the first launch of the game is likely to <em>fail</em> and cross-play with Epic Games needing some setup.</p>
<p>If you're going to boast about Steam Deck support, I generally would expect a lot better, to actually have the game running properly from the first load without issues. Otherwise, it's not supported in any sense of the word. It's just another game released on Steam, that runs thanks to Valve's effort with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, that aside, it will likely run quite well on Desktop Linux too thanks to Proton.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group splitting into three companies</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group have announced that after being the cause of many job losses, shutting down developers and selling some off - they're now splitting into three companies.</p>
<p>These three will be <em>Asmodee Group</em>, <em>Coffee Stain &amp; Friends</em> and <em>Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends</em>. Each of them will be separate, publicly listed companies which Embracer say enables " each entity to better focus on their respective core strategies and offer more differentiated and distinct equity stories for existing and new shareholders" that will enable them to "unlock value in the high-quality assets of Embracer Group following the successful completion of the restructuring program".</p>
<p>Coffee Stain &amp; Friends will have a focus on a wide variety of games across PC, console and mobile across two distinct segments of premium and free to play. This includes some control over Deep Rock Galactic, Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Wreckfest, Teardown, Valheim, Coffee Stain, Ghost Ship, Tarsier, Tuxedo Labs, as well as THQ Nordic and Amplifier Game Invest plus "more than 200 other IPs".</p>
<p>Asmodee Group will focus on board games and digital board games including Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders, Azul, CATAN, Dobble, Exploding Kittens plus they're also developing tabletop games for The Lord of the Rings, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Netflix, Lego and Star Wars. As part of this, Asmodee also <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/asmodee-secures-financing-agreement-of-eur-900-million-as-part-of-separation-deleveraging-the-remaining-embracer-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">secured</a> a new financing agreement of 900 million euros through JP Morgan, BNP Paribas, SEB, Societe Generale and Swedbank which Embracer said is "an important part of the debt refinancing of Embracer Group following its restructuring program".</p>
<p>Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends will be their "creative powerhouse in AAA game development" and will remain the "stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider intellectual properties" but they also control the likes of Crystal Dynamics, Dambuster Studios, Eidos-Montréal, Flying Wild Hog Studios, Tripwire, Vertigo Games, Warhorse Studios and 4A Games among many others. IPs includes Dead Island, Killing Floor, Kingdom Come Deliverance, The Lord of the Rings, Metro and Tomb Raider, among many others. The group will include PLAION, Freemode, Dark Horse and other businesses.</p>
<p>I should note that both Coffee Stain &amp; Friends and Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends aren't the official names, just what they're being referred to right now. As Embracer said the official names will be "decided at a later stage".</p>

      <title>Sunshine game streaming update has frame timing improvements for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sunshine when paired up with Moonlight offers a great way to stream games from your PC to pretty much any other system, and the latest release v0.23.1 should work better on Linux now.</p>
<p>This is an alternative to the now defunct NVIDIA Gamestream, and you can use it as an alternative to things like Steam Link / Remote Play. The idea is that you set up Sunshine on your gaming PC, then use Moonlight to get the stream on your other devices. So you can play whatever you want across your many systems like Steam Deck, mobile and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13097767681713780715gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13097767681713780715gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - War Thunder</p>
<p>Here's what's new / changed in v0.23.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fixed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Capture/Windows) Disable HRD and CBR encoding options by default for AMD GPUs due to video quality regressions in v0.23.0</li>
<li>(UI) Fix incorrect strings for QuickSync 'fast' and 'faster' presets</li>
<li>(UI/Linux) Fix update prompt appearing even when running the latest version</li>
<li>(Input) Fix crash when absolute input events are received prior to the display viewport being set</li>
<li>(Input/Linux) Fix missing clamping of rumble intensity to valid range</li>
<li>(Build/Tests) Fix error when attempting to disable compilation of tests</li>
<li>(Build/Linux) Fix some compilation errors when using Musl libc</li>
<li>(Logging) Fix broken debug messages for codec capability flags</li>
<li>(Logging/Linux) Fix log messages to include the correct setcap command for resolving KMS permission errors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Added</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(Capture/Linux) Improve frame time consistency for all capture backends</li>
<li>(UI) Set focus to the PIN textbox when navigating to the PIN tab</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dependencies</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove libavdevice dependency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Misc</strong></p>

<li>(Linux) Prefer ayatana-appindicator3 over appindicator3 if both are available</li>
</ul>

      <title>Parking Garage Rally Circuit coming by dev of JellyCar with Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game that is something of a homage to the days of the Sega Saturn, Walaber Entertainment who created the fun JellyCar series have announced Parking Garage Rally Circuit. This really looks like it would fit right at home on the Saturn! Complete with tasty low-poly, chunky textures.</p>
<p>"The 'Parking Garage Rally Circuit' tour comes into a city, selects a parking garage, and temporarily turns it into an exciting rally course for a week-long competition. Each track in the game is styled as a unique parking garage that has been turned into a race course. Players will use a map of North America + UK to chart their course from track to track across the globe."</p>
<p>You can see their announcement video below, although you may need to turn your speakers up a bit to actually hear the developer properly:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Skg6V3Up0BM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7ed99ca502ad6bc2956d7e5053bfb429.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Skg6V3Up0BM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the video they said clearly it's been tested on Steam Deck and will have a Native Linux version. They also said it will offer multiple tracks, online leaderboards with ghost cars and even a simple online mode to race your friends.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">You can </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737300/Parking_Garage_Rally_Circuit/" rel="noopener" style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); font-size:17px" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:17px">. It's due to release later this year.</span></p>

      <title>Over 10 years later 7 Days to Die is going to leave Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A long time coming after initially going live back in December 2013, developer The Fun Pimps has now announced that 7 Days to Die is going to be leaving Early Access. The release is currently planned for June, with an exact date to be given closer to the time No I can't quite believe it's finally happening either.</p>
<p>Internally known as Alpha 22, they said they've always planned for that to be the "final" 1.0 release. Currently they do still plan to implement all their original Kickstarter goals, with further updates post-1.0 already planned with a preview <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6024237391713778691gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> available.</p>

<p>Some of what's to come after 1.0 include an overhaul to the weather system, a wardrobe system, cross-play for consoles, bandits, an event system, a story mode, Steam Workshop support and more.</p>
<p>The do plan to raise the price as well for the 1.0 release, to match with the new console release too, although later today April 22nd until April 29th, they will be putting it on a 76% discount to give people one more chance to buy it cheap before the price rises.</p>

      <title>PSA: someone set up a fake Proton-GE website</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems <em>nothing</em> is safe from bogus websites and scams, with someone setting up a fake website for Proton-GE / GE-Proton. A warning note about it was added to the GE GitHub page readme <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/commit/7bbf58654befd0c2f0856c5568f89f98ddc98ec6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month</a>, which I've only just been made aware of.</p>
<p>The website in question protonge.com, which I am intentionally <em>not</em> making a clickable link, makes it seem like it's all official but the <em>only</em> official place is the <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Cheekily, it even uses a screenshot of mine taken from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/protonup-qt-for-easy-ge-proton-installs-on-linux-and-steam-deck-v270-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an older article</a> about ProtonUp-Qt which is a completely different (but related) project.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7365448271713776782gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7365448271713776782gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>According to the website, Proton-GE has builds "tailored for various game genres", well that's a new one. Claiming they have "a customized Proton build to enhance your experience in each specific gaming category". That's just not how it works.</p>
<p>No matter what industry you're in, or what tools you're making, even open source projects — there's always someone who will want to ride on its popularity to do something nefarious.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a recent spate of emails going around claiming to be from the Kdenlive video editor team, where the official developers had to post up <a href="https://mastodon.social/@kdenlive@floss.social/112207013564456009" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warnings</a> across social media. These emails tried to get people to download things for partnerships, which of course is usually some form of malware.</p>

<p>Arm64X is a new type of binary that can contain both the classic Arm64 code and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/arm64ec" target="_blank">Arm64EC code</a> together. This makes Arm64x compatible for both the classic Arm64 and Arm64EC processes on a Windows on Arm device and a particularly good fit for middleware or plugins that may be used by both ABIs.</p>
<p>Introduced in the Windows 11 SDK, the Arm64X binary is a type of Portable Executable (PE) file that works with both Windows 11 on Arm and Windows 10 on Arm. To build Arm64X binaries, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/arm64x-build" target="_blank">Build Arm64X Binaries</a>.</p>

      <title>Action-filled naval sandbox game Windward follow-up Windward Horizon announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember Windward? Released in 2015, it's an action-filled multiplayer sandbox game that puts you in control of a ship sailing the high seas of a large procedurally-generated world and it's getting a sequel with Windward Horizon.</p>
<p>Windward sold quite well too, over 500K copies I've been told, so not a big surprise to see Tasharen Entertainment return to the setting. Currently the Steam page only lists Windows support officially, but Stride PR told me very clearly "Windward Horizon will have support on Linux as well.".</p>
<p>The developer said they aim to "improve every aspect of the original, such as adding lore to the game, a robust economy system that governs growth, fully configurable internal ship layouts with adjacency bonuses and penalties for interesting builds and many, many new skills to complement the expanded talent trees" and it will be free to try next month for a limited time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CEM8PzT0EZQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/af21fa318aa951bc7c95c1842c7bb7ed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CEM8PzT0EZQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“As a standalone sequel, Windward Horizon improves upon Windward’s foundation while keeping its original charm,” said Michael Lyashenko, Founder of Tasharen Entertainment. “With an engaging gameplay loop filled with intricate systems and detailed customization options, we’re creating a feeling of freedom many open world sandbox games can’t match.”</p>
<p>Follow along on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2665460/Windward_Horizon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Phantom Fury gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Phantom Fury is a new FPS from Slipgate Ironworks and 3D Realms, taking place a few years after Ion Fury and it's going to be Steam Deck Verified for release.</p>
<p>While their team say it takes place after Ion Fury, they also say it's not a direct sequel, more of a "soft sequel" taking place in the same universe but it's more of a spin-off.</p>
<p>Releasing on April 23rd, the Steam page doesn't yet actually show the Steam Deck Verified status however 3D Realms <a href="https://twitter.com/3DRealms/status/1780724635094360154" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> about reaching it on X (formerly Twitter) which the official Valve OnDeck account reposted. Have a look at their explainer video below which talks about the setting and shows off various bits of gameplay:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gSTClUnCHoc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8a8b7bd6acf4122251c17f9e31f074e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gSTClUnCHoc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>An intense mixture of bombastic action and road movie</strong> - Fight through seedy hotels in Albuquerque, explore abandoned facilities in Los Alamos, secure the streets of Chicago, and so much more!</li>
<li><strong>An insanely interactive world</strong> - An incredible amount of interactivity brings the environments to life. Fully usable computers, helicopter flights, playable arcade machines are only a few examples of what you can expect.</li>
<li><strong>A vast array of weapons</strong> - Over 20 unique weapons are at your disposal! Fan favorites like the Bowling Bombs are joined by brand-new equipment such as armor-piercing shotguns and electrified foam shooting devices. Unlockable weapon upgrades and mods with completely new fire functions will give you the necessary control needed to overcome any fight the way you want!</li>
<li><strong>A wide range of unlockable skills and upgrades</strong> - Weapons aren’t the only way to overcome the many challenges waiting along the way. Upgrade your bionic arm and suit with powerful new abilities, such as a punch attack or an electric shield.</li>
<li><strong>A terrifying number of enemies</strong> - Encounter vicious cyborgs, menacing soldiers and disgusting mutations, each with their own special skills. Push your skills to the limit in exhilarating boss battles.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With it being Steam Deck Verified you can bet it will work great with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Desktop Linux too!</p>

      <title>Crownfall multi-act update live for Dota 2, plus a new comic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just released a big new update for Dota 2 with Crownfall, which not only includes a new comic to read but also what they call The Markets of Midgate. This is the first act of an ongoing story event.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/crownfall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Markets of Midgate is just the first act of an ongoing four-act narrative that will span the next few months. You'll be able to play through new acts as soon as they become available, but you can also move through the adventure at your own pace — the introduction of a new act won't close off an earlier one.<br/>
<br/>
Which means you can take as long as you like exploring every possible path, challenge and secret in Act I. And as much as there is to find, this event's just getting started. Crownfall will keep expanding as it unfolds over the coming months, with each new act bringing its own story, characters, a unique overworld map and all-new rewards. There might even be a surprise or two along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you get is this special new overworld map to explore the area of Skywrath, and as you play games with various characters you obtain different tokens. You use these tokens to unlock paths through the overworld map to progress through the story and earn rewards. It's free for everyone, but you can also pay $14.99 to get the Midgate Pathfinder Pack to give you more places to explore with sidequests, more stories and more rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15339624781713518103gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15339624781713518103gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's also various new cosmetic packs released you can buy. The second part of the story is due out mid-May, with the other two acts not dated yet.</p>
<p>You can read the comic on the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/crownfall/comic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dota 2 website</a>.</p>
<p>Play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dota 2 free on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 64bit support released, plus Vulkan for Linux via DXVK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now launched the 64bit update for Team Fortress 2, which should bring performance improvements for most users. Plus we get Vulkan now too.</p>
<p>After being in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/team-fortress-2-has-a-64bit-and-vulkan-update-for-linux-in-testing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beta since January</a>, the Vulkan support is thanks to DXVK which is now the default launch option for the game on Linux. This replaces Valve's original ToGL translation layer for OpenGL, but it's left in as a Legacy launch option for those who need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9869620751713516903gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9869620751713516903gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the update <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/?tab=updates" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 64-bit support for Windows/Linux client and server
<ul>
<li>Should include performance improvements for most users</li>
<li>Bugs can be reported here: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games/issues</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an exploit related to uploading invalid custom decals that would crash other clients</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And then a quick follow-up update after:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would be falsely detected as malware by some anti-viruses</li>
<li>Fixed a crash relating to using some Unicode characters on Linux</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like there's a lot of bug reports flowing in, so expect more updates to come.</p>

      <title>Free Stars: Children of Infinity coming to Linux after smashing Kickstarter goals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that really was fast. Free Stars: Children of Infinity, the sequel to The Ur-Quan Masters (Star Control 2) is now confirmed to be supporting Linux (and macOS).</p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign has only been up for just over a day and it's already managed to pull in over $240,000 in funding. This means the $220,000 stretch goal for Linux and macOS support has been achieved as <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pistolshrimp/free-stars-children-of-infinity/posts/4080050" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by the developer. Since it also passed $240K, it will also now see a DRM-free PC release as well so that's double good news. It's not confirmed what DRM-free stores they will put it on but their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pistolshrimp/free-stars-children-of-infinity/posts/4080177" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> mentioned possibilities being itch.io and GOG.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MqCnsE3hxP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78a59f9c07693e23bcb30c95843152.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MqCnsE3hxP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The campaign still has a whole 29 days to go with extra stretch goals including more languages, local co-op, console ports, English voice over and if they somehow hit $4.4 million they will open source it all.</p>

      <title>Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence delayed, Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change on May 8th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two bits of news for fans of the grand strategy games from Paradox Interactive as we've got a delay for Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence, but we also have a date for Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change.</p>
<p>For the upcoming major expansion Victoria 3: Sphere of Influence, Paradox put out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/529340/view/5848561962978078111" rel="noopener" target="_blank">statement</a> to say that it's just not ready. It was going to come on May 6th, but it's been pushed back to June 24th. Why? As they said "we’ve unfortunately come to the conclusion that both the update and the expansion are in need of more time for bug fixing and polish". It's coming with some pretty big changes and while they're "happy with the features on offer in 1.7/Sphere of Influence, we simply do not believe that sticking to the original release date will allow us to deliver those features in a polished and balanced state".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14604466271713435038gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14604466271713435038gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Fair enough, let's not have a repeat of Europa Universalis IV: Leviathan, which released back in April 2021 and is <em>still</em> sat on Overwhelmingly Negative on Steam. Ouch. It's actually nice to see Paradox take a step back for quality on something.</p>
<p>You can grab Victoria 3 from:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/humble-choice-for-april-has-terraformers-victoria-3-the-callisto-protocol/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">April's Humble Choice</a></p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>The other side is that they did just announce Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change to release on May 8th, hopefully an expansion that will actually do better this time. Winds of Change adds more focus to key regions of the world. New mission trees, new government reforms and new national mechanics are in place for over a dozen nations. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ha6Ivz_7fOE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11c8d4cf566c3151e708e4c8bc32bbfa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ha6Ivz_7fOE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change includes new historical content for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major American Nations: The Aztecs, Maya and Inca all get significant updates, including an Aztec mechanic that promotes warfare and demanding sacrifices, new ways to unite the Mayan nations into one kingdom, Incan royal authority, and many other improvements and updates. These nations also receive special content to allow an alternate-history invasion of the Old World.</li>
<li>Major Trading Nations: Both The Netherlands and Venice see expanded historical flavor, including more detailed content for the creation and enlargement of the Dutch Republic, the Glorious Revolution uniting the Dutch and British crowns, the Venetian Council of Ten, and the glories of the Venetian Renaissance.</li>
<li>Gunpowder Empires: The declining Timurid Empire can either fully embrace  Persian traditions or return to its horse empire roots through a life of plunder, and the rising Mughal Empire has new routes to unite all of India under its sway. The Central Asian Horde nations also get updates, including unique flavor for the Tatar, Mongol and Moghul Khanates.</li>
<li>Central Europe: Austria, Hungary and Bohemia get revised trees, including the possibility for the Austrian and Hungarians to form the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary and for Bohemia to expand Hussite Power in the heart of the Empire, while all three can tailor the HRE to their liking.</li>
<li>Major Formable European Nations: New alt-historical options and content for the formation of Germany and Italy.</li>
<li>Minor Orthodox Empires: Surrounded by enemies, the Black Sea kingdoms of Theodoro and Trebizond seek to thrive and expand, potentially reviving Orthodox fortunes in the region.</li>
<li>Hisn Kayfa and Hormuz/Oman: The minor nation Hisn Kayfa, heirs of the Ayyubid dynasty, and major Gulf trading powers of Hormuz and Oman get unique mission trees to dominate the Middle East.</li>
</ul>
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Winds of Change will be available for $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.99.</p>

      <title>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another potentially big PC release coming up is Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance from ATLUS and SEGA and it has been Steam Deck Verified already. This is great news, as it means testing has actually been done on it well ahead of release on June 14th.</p>
<p>Valve's compatibility note does mention though that it needs an active internet connection for the first-time setup, so just something to keep in mind. Likely due to the inclusion of Denuvo Anti-tamper.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19665129531713428353gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19665129531713428353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The latest trailer can be seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbLdn_bviZI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, which I can't include here directly, since it has an age restriction on it.</p>
<p>The latest title in the series, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance allows players to enjoy the story of Shin Megami Tensei V in its entirety, with a new story path, untold in the original.  Massively expanded with new areas, demons, and music, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance features more accessible gameplay, an improved battle system, new demon experiences, and greater field exploration. </p>
<p>As a standalone game, you don't need to have played the others. Which is good news for people new to the series.</p>
<p>Getting Steam Deck Verified is good news for Desktop Linux players too of course! It means it really should run without issues on a more powerful desktop system!</p>
<p>It can be pre-ordered via:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> (13% off)</p>

<p>After months of being radio silent in Nouveau driver development, Skeggs sent a<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/nouveau/20240416234002.19509-1-bskeggs@nvidia.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> massive 156-part patch set</a> as a follow-up on the Noveau GSP firmware enablement work, code cleanup, ioctl-like interfaces between NVKM and the Nouveau DMS driver which will reduce driver overhead and call chain complexity.</p>
<p>The important part for this news is that this patch series was submitted using his new NVIDIA work email address.</p>
<p>Strange times indeed since, no one was expecting that Skeggs would be at NVIDIA, and due to the history involved with that company that he would also <em>continue</em> to contribute directly with Nouveau.</p>
<p>Looks like history may be repeating itself with AMD and Radeon…could this be another sign of NVIDIA opening up more?</p>

      <title>Adventure Mode Beta out now for Dwarf Fortress</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dwarf Fortress on Steam from Bay 12 Games and Kitfox Games has a fresh Beta now available containing the new Adventure Mode. This turns the expansive building sim into a big turn-based RPG, where you can create a character and freely roam the rich simulated world you've made a home in during the Fortress Mode or start afresh in a newly generated world.</p>
<p>To access it you just need to own it on Steam, head to the Properties -&gt; Betas and select "beta - Public beta branch". To go along with it, they'll also be releasing the Dwarf Fortress Soundtrack 2 (Adventure) DLC, this will also be available across Bandcamp, Spotify, Youtube and Apple Music.</p>
<p>Check out the Beta trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dX2gnya3eH4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b32a88355e7a6a6e290f824fbe6da484.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dX2gnya3eH4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With this being a Beta it's not finished of course and they said there's "features from Classic Adventure Mode and planned new features that have not made their way to the Steam version yet", so work is ongoing to expand Adventure Mode still.</p>
<p>You can buy it on:</p>

      <title>Ghost of Tsushima PC specs revealed - should work on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony has released the specifications needed for the upcoming PC release of Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT, and it seems like it scales quite well so it should run on the Steam Deck (and Desktop Linux will no doubt be fine).</p>
<p>An exciting upcoming release, which many have wanted to see on PC since the original PlayStation release in 2020. Sony are treating their PC fans quite well nowadays though with so many titles releasing.</p>
<p>Here's the specs for those that want to see (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3561493351713366368gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3561493351713366368gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Going by that, at least on Steam Deck, we might see it stick around 30FPS and be reasonably playable. Considering it's coming with NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeSS it should be good across a wide range of hardware.</p>
<p>Curiously, this is also the first Sony release on PC that will come with the new PlayStation overlay. As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/04/17/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-cross-play-and-system-requirements-revealed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Sony mentions this includes access to your Friends list, Trophies, Settings, and your Profile. So you'll be able to earn PlayStation Trophies, but it will also work just fine with Steam Achievements too. This PlayStation overlay is entirely optional though, which is good to see and will look something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9138276371713366617gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9138276371713366617gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm not really one to care about achievements and trophies, but a nice touch for those that do, further bridging the gap between traditional consoles and PCs. Although it remains to be seen if this new overlay works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>, but I'm sure Valve will update it to get it working if it doesn't initially.</p>
<p>Previous PC trailer if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EzWBNwhb870"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/917587cd15a8fb992c160dac4d4734a1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EzWBNwhb870" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It releases on PC on May 16th. Will you be picking it up?</p>

      <title>Buckshot Roulette hit a million sales, multiplayer mode in development</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It just goes to show, that as challenging as it is for indie devs right now, there's still a whole lot of success stories. Buckshot Roulette is the latest to hit over a million sales.</p>
<p>Previously available via itch.io, it recently jumped over to Steam with a big update and clearly caught the attention of a lot of players thanks to its dark and intriguing game idea where you play Russian roulette with a 12-gauge shotgun. There's over 12,000 user reviews on Steam now giving it an Overwhelmingly Positive rating.</p>
<p>You won't see many games that get user reviews <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/fcukignfyif/recommended/2835570/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like</a> "Dealer handcuffed me then shot himself in the head twice.", and that's a pretty accurate summary of how nuts this title is. With a multiplayer mode in development right now, no doubt when that releases the game will see another big uptick in players.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BbKAIy1GFF4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3793ce32a7dfc20981c82f08e3602379.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BbKAIy1GFF4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I think this goes to show that there's clearly a place for all types of games. From AAA chasing ever more realistic looking environments and people, to smaller stranger games like this.</p>
<p>Wonderful to see <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> games gain such popularity. Be sure to follow our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Godot_Engine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine tag</a> for more!</p>

      <title>World of Goo 2 delayed until August 2nd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The goo has gotten a bit stuck, and so the May release date <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/world-of-goo-2-launches-in-may-on-the-epic-store-but-linux-support-from-their-website/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously announced</a> for World of Goo 2 has been pushed back to August 2nd.</p>
<p>As a reminder, World of Goo 2 will have Linux support but you will need to buy it direct as it's going to be on the Epic Store. Presumably it will eventually hit Steam after their Epic Exclusive deal is up. At least they're still providing direct-purchases though.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://tomorrowcorporation.com/posts/world-of-goo-2-launch-date-enhanced-now-august-2-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Goo is flowing, balls are coalescing, and blinking eyes lift up towards the sky where a mysterious pipe is rumored to appear. But instead, a signpost rises up out of the ground. “Good news!,” it says. “The World of Goo 2 launch date has been enhanced. It has now moved to August 2, 2024. We are proud to offer you this enhancement free of charge!”</p>
<p><em>From the Team: We have really appreciated your kind comments and patience while we finish building the best possible game!</em></p>

      <title>Asymmetrical indirect control RTS game Roboden now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>How about a free game to add to your library? Roboden is an asymmetrical indirect control real-time strategy game about robot colonies and it's now Steam Deck Verified. It also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>In the game you control the colony priorities while the automated drones execute your program. Collect resources, build and combine units, and play with friends in cooperative and competitive modes.</p>
<p>One I missed that was released back in 2023, it looks like an interesting concept and good to kill a few hours with. Since release the developer has continued improving it, and has now put out an update that enabled it to become Steam Deck Verified too. From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2416030/announcements/detail/4191237128330669820" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer added in improved gamepad controls, larger fonts and some accessibility fixes along with a new font.</p>

      <title>Adventure of Rikka - The Cursed Kingdom is one for classic Zelda lovers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you like classic action-adventure puzzle games like the older Zelda titles? Be sure to check out Adventure of Rikka - The Cursed Kingdom.</p>
<p>Released back in March from developer Poorly Drawn Squid, The Adventure of Rikka is a top down 2D action RPG with a focus on puzzles, exploration, secrets and collectables. You must defeat the dark forces that has cursed the lands, fight enemies using your sword and an arsenal of items such as the bow and fire wand and save the kingdom!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4-oykMa9Wmk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/afaf1766c4c45c2d9f3bb197c25fea9d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4-oykMa9Wmk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I actually only came across this looking up recent Steam Deck news, somehow missing the main release. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1726390/announcements/detail/7790739306613725922" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developer noted</a> in an announcement that they're currently waiting for Valve to put it through review but they say "The UI of the game was actually built to fit the Steam Deck display and is then scaled up for larger monitors" and it also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>7 Dungeons with challenging boss-fights, and many smaller puzzle dungeons.</li>
<li>10 Unique player items such as the Bow, Bomb, Grappling hook, Pegasus boots and the Fire wand.</li>
<li>Upgradeable items and weapons.</li>
<li>Shards and Stones of Power scattered across the land which are used to upgrade your stats.</li>
<li>A bunch of side quests.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1726390/Adventure_of_Rikka__The_Cursed_Kingdom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It only has a few reviews so far, but early indicator is that players enjoy it.</p>

      <title>Athenian Rhapsody is one of the wackiest games I&#39;ve seen for a while</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Releasing May 14th, Athenian Rhapsody certainly caught my attention in the GamingOnLinux inbox with a tagline of "Make friends and catch IBS". I obviously had to open that email and see what the heck this was all about.</p>
<p>Athenian Rhapsody is an upcoming comedy RPG, one that the publisher notes is "simultaneously a tribute to classic games such as Earthbound, absurdist comedy, and create your own adventure storybooks". </p>
<p>Made by solo developer Nico Papalia with a focus on tongue-in-cheek storytelling and vibrancy, you'll explore the colourful world of Athens as you make friends (or not), engage in rambunctious mini-games ranging from weight-lifting, shooting bugs, or drawing your own bosses to fight, and partake in excruciating challenges such as "Carry A Feather" as you travel from town-to-town. All this in the name of writing your own Rhapsody - a special, unique memento/token of your exact playthrough (no it's nothing to do with NFTs).</p>
<p>This is also the weirdest trailer I've seen in a long time:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NDYSfjIi-V4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5fb5c5185d344d49440909fc45d913a7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NDYSfjIi-V4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I have a key request in for this one because of how totally insane it seems. Hopefully I'll be able to see how well it runs on Steam Deck + Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>You'll be able to buy it on:</p>

      <title>Superhero strategy game Capes confirmed for release on May 29th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capes is an XCOM-like superhero strategy game coming from Spitfire Interactive, comprised of key creatives behind the Hand of Fate franchise. It has a new trailer and a release date now!</p>
<p>Drawing upon experience that reaches back to Freedom Force (2002) and Teen Titans (2006), Spitfire is reimagining superhero tactics for a new age while learning from the past. Capes brings together a unique blend of classic influences including comics like Days of Future Past, Astro City, or Watchmen, and elements of games such as XCOM and Into the Breach.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qcLKBe6PDB4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/41b8c2626b51f8e2ef1b7b33ed4e3637.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qcLKBe6PDB4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The super villains won. 20 years later, in a time when people with superpowers are arrested and taken off the streets, a ragtag group of young heroes fight to liberate King City. Under the questionable guidance of Doctrine, one of the city’s last surviving Capes, this new team must learn to work together, uncover The Company's secrets, and find out whether they're strong enough to become the heroes King City needs them to be.</p>
<p>Recruit other emerging superheroes and take on The Company across a challenging hand-crafted tactical campaign. Tackle smaller stakes and learn to wield your team's powers in optional "patrol missions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be Mighty: Play as a team of heroic protectors, each with unique skills and powers. Master each hero and unleash their devastating ultimate abilities!</li>
<li>Assemble Your Team: Combat isn't based on raw strength. Choose your heroes wisely and combine their individual superpowers to create powerful combo attacks!</li>
<li>Level Up: Complete challenging missions and side-quests to gain XP and unlock your heroes’ potential with new abilities and powerful upgrades!</li>
<li>Defeat Evil: Face down vile villains, criminal corporate henchmen, and powerful bosses. Do you have what it takes to free your city from the clutches of villainy!?</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm really excited by this one, as a big XCOM fan and lover of all things superhero related, so I have a key request in to hopefully be able to check it out on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081080/Capes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Take back 1944 occupied Poland in &#39;63 Days&#39;, will be optimised for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>63 Days is a new action strategy game coming from developer Destructive Creations who previously made War Mongrels and Ancestors Legacy. 63 Days is about brotherhood and the fight to regain independence against overwhelming odds in the 1944 occupied Warsaw, Poland.</p>
<p>They announced the game earlier this month, and over email they mentioned to me "We're working hard to optimize the game for Steamdeck. That means we're improving things like text scaling, controller support, and overall performance." which is great to see!</p>
<p>It’s an isometric real-time tactics game that follows in the footsteps of Destructive Creations' previous release, War Mongrels, building upon its gameplay mechanics. Ready for those of you looking to scratch that tactical itch playing a proven formula with quality graphics, fresh gameplay elements, and music produced by the legendary Adam Skorupa.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ddXRUPx99gs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bd845cc779ff3eea10d9d07da48bd89b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ddXRUPx99gs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2202120/63_Days/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It's planned to release later this year. Looks good!</p>

      <title>Free Stars: Children of Infinity, sequel to The Ur-Quan Masters now on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pistol Shrimp Games, founded by Toys for Bob veterans, have today launched the Kickstarter campaign for Free Stars: Children of Infinity which is a direct sequel to The Ur-Quan Masters (Star Control 2).</p>
<p>Developers include the original creators of The Ur-Quan Masters, Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford (the original founders of Toys for Bob), Ken Ford, and Dan Gerstein.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MqCnsE3hxP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78a59f9c07693e23bcb30c95843152.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MqCnsE3hxP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: "Happy days and jubilation, captains! Traversing the universe may be an endless venture, but we have finally reached the next destination in our long quest to bring Free Stars: Children of Infinity to life," said Pistol Shrimp Games’ founders Fred Ford and Dan Gerstein in a joint statement. "Help us complete this journey through the stars, and — with enough backers, we might even get to infinity plus one."</p>
<p>Even if you haven't played the original, which is free and open source and recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/free-stars-the-ur-quan-masters-open-source-star-control-2-now-available-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had a Steam release</a>, plenty of games you've likely played were in some parts inspired by it. The Ur-Quan Masters has been called "one of the greatest games of all time" and praised by the likes of Tim Cain (Fallout, Fallout 2) of Obsidian Entertainment, Ken Levine (BioShock, System Shock 2, JUDAS) of Ghost Story Games, and Mark Darrah (Mass Effect), alumni of BioWare. The Ur-Quan Masters inspired countless other creators in the video game industry, including the devs behind No Man’s Sky, Subnautica, and Stellaris — to name just a few.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6783281921713283553gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6783281921713283553gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They plan to have it highly moddable, as they said it "supports modding out of the box", and accessibility is a key issue for them too as they hope to include keyboard and controller support, co-op play, multiple difficulty modes, avoidable or automated combat, generated voice-over for vision-impaired players and so on.</p>
<p>They're seeking at least $100,000 on the Kickstarter campaign, with Native versions for Linux and macOS at a $220,000 stretch-goal. At time of writing, it already has over $80,000 and the Kickstarter has only been up for about 2 hours. So it's clearly got a lot of people excited.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but I'm quite excited for this one!</p>

      <title>PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs launches in early May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know I'm going to be suckered into PAC-MAN Mega Tunnel Battle: Chomp Champs when it releases on May 8th, after previously being a Stadia exclusive. Good to see more ex-Stadia games actually come to PC properly like this. Although, the press releases said May 9th, but Steam say May 8th so the Steam date might change.</p>
<p>After playing it myself on Stadia, before Google hit the dreaded killswitch, it actually was genuinely good fun. And unless they do something ridiculous with it, no doubt it will work really well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>This is no normal PAC-MAN, it's a battle royale styled game with 64-player battles and various colourful connected mazes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZGpZRuFKIKA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0c96be4a1ad719ceaf0dae0e4eba4278.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZGpZRuFKIKA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ready to welcome players of varying skill levels, game modes include Elimination Mode with arcade-style action where players of any rank can compete and earn Tokens to redeem on customisation items, and Ranked Mode where players battle against similarly skilled opponents from around the world and gain Rank XP earning their place on the leaderboards. </p>
<p>PAC-MAN MEGA TUNNEL BATTLE: CHOMP CHAMPS includes a Friend system that lets players drop into the same match with friends, track progress, and spectate the action when their friends – or foes – are playing the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has cross-platform multiplayer too, so finding a game with friends shouldn't be an issue.</p>
<p>You can pre-order via:</p>

      <title>It took about 15 years but epic roguelike Caves of Qud is nearly done</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Caves of Qud from developer Freehold Games and publisher Kitfox Games is approaching the 1.0 finishing line, and so their roadmap towards the release has been put up and it sounds really exciting.</p>
<p>A big part of the work they've been doing is on the UI (user interface) to make it a lot more modern, and the good news there is that it's complete! A fresh public pre-release is coming soon that will feature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- ALL NEW INTERFACE - The much-touted, transformational UI redesign is complete! Fully mouseable, fully gamepaddable, and gorgeous, but all carefully designed to maintain the essence of what makes Qud Qud.<br/>
- A refresh of the starting town of Joppa, with as much texture &amp; lived-in feeling as the rest of the world.<br/>
- Hundreds of new sound and visual effects.<br/>
- 40 new achievements.<br/>
- Several new narrative touches, big bug fixes, &amp; performance improvements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some shots of the new interface (click them to enlarge):</p>

<p>What's coming up next? Throughout the Summer and Fall they will be working to finish the main quest, and provide something for people who have finished it. That, plus a "more hands-on" tutorial. Then lots of smaller things like achievements, some missing sounds, visual effects, bug fixes and so on.</p>
<p>As for when it will release? They don't have an exact date yet but it will be sometime in late 2024.</p>
<p>How about after release though? They said they plan to keep updating it with major content and system releases, although how much they do " does depend on the financial realities of sales, but no matter what, we have two big DLCs planned already". They're not sure yet if the DLC will be free or paid just yet.</p>

      <title>Emulation tool RetroDECK brings in Ryujinx for Nintendo Switch, many other improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RetroDECK is one of the simplest options for getting various emulators set up on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, and the latest release has lots of fun improvements to check out.</p>
<p>What's the point of RetroDECK? It gives you an easy one-click install via Flatpak to get everything you need to play retro games. You just need to supply the games, they do all the configuration for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12684752391713269046gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12684752391713269046gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>In version 0.8.0b they've updated all available emulators to their latest versions, ES-DE (EmulationStation Desktop Edition) was also bumped up to version 3.0.1 and they pulled in some new system support too including:</p>
<ul>
<li>PSVita, trough Vita3K.</li>
<li>Solarus.</li>
<li>GZDoom that is now the DOOM system default engine.</li>
<li>Ryujinx for Nintendo Switch.</li>
<li>MAME (Standalone).</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also an overhaul to Steam controller layouts, there's controller configurations for 2-4 people multiplayer in Cemu, Duckstation, GZDoom, RPCS3 and Ryujinx.</p>
<p>With their configurator tool they added the ability to swap the ABXY buttons for compatible systems, Steam Flatpak detection for controller profile install, RetroDECK now knows if it is running on a real Steam Deck or other Linux desktop, they disabled the "Desktop Mode" warning when not running on Steam Deck, plus various other fixes in the <a href="https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/releases/tag/0.8.0b" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) Beta released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical is gearing up for the release of the next LTS (long term support) version of Ubuntu, with a first Beta now available for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat).</p>
<p>While the Beta is not intended for production use the developers said that the Beta is "known to be reasonably free of showstopper image build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of 24.04 LTS that should be representative of the features intended to ship with the final release expected on April 25, 2024".</p>
<p>For gamers, you'll be pleased to know this release ships with the vm.max_map_count value boosted to 1048576, which is needed for certain games to run, this matches up with Fedora <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/arch-linux-changes-vmmax-map-count-to-match-fedora-ubuntu-for-better-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and now Arch Linux too</a>.</p>
<p>A Games page has also been added to the Ubuntu App Center, the mail app Thunderbird version 115 has been moved to a Snap package, GNOME upgraded to version 46, you also get Firefox 124 and LibreOffice 24.2 and various upgrades to other included software like Pipewire 1.04. You're also getting kernel 6.8 as standard.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4572079991713268176gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4572079991713268176gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) Beta</em></p>
<p>There's a few app changes too like the default install only being "minimal", but you can select "extended selection" to have stuff like LibreOffice and Thunderbird installed. GNOME Snapshot replaces Cheese for webcams and Games are no longer installed by default. Various improvements to the look and feel of their Flutter-based installer too with it being more customizable.</p>
<p>Plenty of security improvements have been implemented too like some tweaks to the Ubuntu kernel to restrict the use of unprivileged user namespaces, TLS 1.0, 1.1 and DTLS 1.0 are forcefully disabled, they said that packages are now "built with security-hardening features which stop many undiscovered security vulnerabilities, rendering them unexploitable" and more.</p>
<p>Various other upgrades included too like GCC 14, Python 3.12, OpenJDK 21, LLVM 18, Rust 1.75, Golang 1.22 and .NET 8.</p>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04 is also the first LTS release that supports the Raspberry Pi 5 with both arm64 server and desktop images.</p>
<p>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS will be supported for 5 years until June 2029. </p>
<p>You can find the downloads on <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/24.04/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Ubuntu website</a>. Release notes on <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/noble-numbat-release-notes/39890" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their forum</a>.</p>

      <title>Descent 3 has been made open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update #2, 21/04/24 18:06</strong>: the code is now licensed under the GPL!</p>
<p><strong>Update 18/04/24 15:11</strong>: there seems to be an issue with the licensing at the moment. The MIT license was not meant to be up on it, as this was <a href="https://github.com/kevinbentley/Descent3/issues/32#issuecomment-2061461160" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apparently</a> the default GitHub put on it. That license has now been removed, and so there's now <em>no</em> license on it. Hopefully this will be sorted soon so it can be clear for anyone who wishes to contribute.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Another classic has been given the open source treatment, with Descent 3 from Outrage Entertainment now available under the MIT license. This release was put up on <a href="https://github.com/kevinbentley/Descent3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a> by Kevin Bentley, one of the original developers.</p>
<p>It has a bit of an interesting history as it was originally ported to Linux way back in 2000 from Loki Entertainment, which didn't age particularly well. Then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/02/descent-3-returns-to-linux-and-macos-with-an-official-modern-port/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">much later in 2020</a> developer Ryan "Icculus" Gordon did a re-port with various upgrades.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7721286881713266742gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7721286881713266742gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the latest version of the Descent 3 source code. This includes the '1.5' patch that Jeff Slutter and Kevin Bentley wrote several years ago. At the time, it worked for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p>
<p>Some proprietary sound and video libraries from Interplay have been stripped out (the ACM and MVE format). I have that code if someone wants to help make a converter so the old cutscenes work. It'll take some effort to stub out that code so it compiles.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to do is get everything compiling again, and ideally some CI/CD actions. After that, the code needs to be cleaned up some, to remove old version control comments, etc. A lot of this code was written by a really great team, but keep in mind we were much younger and less experienced back then.</p>
<p>If you're interested in helping maintain it, please send me a message. Otherwise, I'm happy to take pull requests.</p>
<p>This is the last update I put out there showing different architectures playing along. Yikes, that was a long time ago, sorry we never released a 1.5 patch. Some logistics got in the way!</p>
<p>Thanks to Jeff Slutter, who did most of the work modernizing the code from the 90's. I'm looking forward to seeing what the community does with it!</p>

      <title>Half-Life remake Black Mesa has a big upgrade with DXVK 2.3.1, optimizations and bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective have released the Necro Patch for the Half-Life remake Black Mesa, which brings with it some essential bug fixes and some nice optimizations. If you had issues with it previously, you might want to give it another go as it sounds like they put a fair amount of work into this update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20051272641713256700gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20051272641713256700gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Main Update Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved performance of the game (Vulkan, UI optimization, New Renderer/New Post Post Process Optimization).</li>
<li>Fixed cases where game would crash on startup.</li>
<li>Fixed UI flickering and artifacting.</li>
<li>Fixed crash in the first map of Interloper that players were experiencing.</li>
<li>Improved controller support using Steam Input (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/362890/discussions/0/6733519291681971343/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more info</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed hitch when weapon decals are first applied to gun.</li>
<li>Re-enabled weapon decals by default.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing to note is that they mentioned in the update that they may be looking into "more robust fixes that might break saves and switching over Linux support to Proton, but we don’t have a timeline for that". So eventually the Native Linux version may no longer be a thing. Presumably because it works better with Proton and they're already using a big part of Proton anyway (DXVK) for rendering on Windows (Linux still seems to use Valve's really old ToGL).</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another festival of games is live on Steam now with Steam FPS Fest 2024 running until April 22nd at 10am PT / 5pm UTC, and there's also plenty of demos for games to try too.</p>
<p>For those of you building up thousands of Steam Points as well the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/event/sale_fps_fest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Points Shop</a> also has a couple of new items for the event. Good, because I have nearly a <em>million</em> and need something to do with them…wait a minute, they're free?! </p>

<p>I'm absolutely diving back into Fallout soon myself, after recently finishing up Alan Wake, as I don't like to play more than one story game at the same time. Can't wait! The show really gave me the itch to need more.</p>

      <title>Bazzite v2.5 has fixes for Lenovo Legion Go and ASUS ROG Ally, plus smoother installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite is one of the most interesting versions of Linux available for handheld gaming devices, and the latest release version 2.5.0 is out now with some great improvements. Don't skip on giving it a go! This is the last version based on Fedora 39, before Bazzite 3.0 plans to jump up to Fedora 40 after the Fedora release later this month.</p>
<p>The install experience has been improved thanks to it including certain Flatpak packages, instead of making you wait for them to be installed on first boot. They also skip the initramfs build at first boot as it's now part of the downloaded ISO, and there's also a Torrent available now too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14208242131713179120gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14208242131713179120gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Lenovo Legion Go</em></p>
<p>Specifically for handheld PCs they've added the <a href="https://github.com/hhd-dev/adjustor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Adjustor</a> tool, which gives a reverse engineered version of AMD's vendor function for setting TDP on demand in Ryzen processors, through ACPI. They've solved Lenovo Legion Go and ASUS ROG Ally auto-VRAM issues, a dependency EmuDeck required was added and there's also a new <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=1038" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Handheld Wiki</a> for more info on device support.</p>
<p>See all in the <a href="https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/releases/tag/v2.5.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> and the <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-2-5-0-update-released/1108" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release post</a>.</p>
<p>Now they're looking towards Bazzite 3.0 that will bring an updated kernel, GPU drivers, and major desktop environment updates with KDE Plasma 6 and GNOME 46.</p>

      <title>OpenTTD 14.0 brings a scalable font, a new ship pathfinder, social platform integration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Twenty years after the first release, OpenTTD 14.0 has been made available bringing with it some really useful sounding features to enable new ways to play. OpenTTD is an open source simulation game based upon the popular Microprose game "Transport Tycoon Deluxe", written by Chris Sawyer. It attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6028160791713176870gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6028160791713176870gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For new players, the experience should be a little nicer, since it now actually includes the Help and Manual buttons in game to get some basic info. A lot of default settings were adjusted too making them feel a bit more modern, plus Cheats got renamed to Sandbox to make it more clear it's perfectly fine to use this mode.</p>
<p>A new scalable font is included, inspired by the sprite font, which makes it scale up a whole lot better at different zoom levels. The developers also fixed up various pixel errors and colouring issues too across the UI.</p>
<p>The ship pathfinder had a lot of love put into it, so ships will actually properly find their way now and stop getting lost. A new unbunching feature was also added, to help you give vehicles more space between them.</p>
<p>A new way to play was added as well, where you can slow down the calendar and even freeze it. This is so you can continue to play and expand, while having things like aging and inflation slower or frozen giving you more time to just keep on building up.</p>
<p>There's also optional social platform integration for Steam, Discord and GOG Galaxy.</p>

      <title>MineClone2, inspired by Minecraft, gets renamed to VoxeLibre</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by the core gameplay of Minecraft, the name MineClone2 was <em>not</em> a particularly good one and it seems the developers were aware and so it's gone through a rebrand to be now called <a href="https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VoxeLibre</a>.</p>
<p>Built on the free and open source <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Minetest</a> game engine, it's one of the most popular voxel sandbox open-world games around as an alternative to Minecraft. As they <a href="https://git.minetest.land/MineClone2/MineClone2/issues/4235" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> on their Git page about the renaming:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the small overall amount of votes here, a similarly small amount of votes on Matrix, the large amount of people who voted on Discord and the large margin by which the name VoxeLibre won the voting on Discord, as well as the heated discussion that followed the survey on private dev chats...</p>
<p>The new name of this project will be</p>
<p><strong>VoxeLibre</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see their most recent update trailer below:</p>

<p>Well, if they want to eventually actually shake all the Minecraft clone comments to become properly their own thing, a better name like this was going to be needed.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-3 and 9-4 released with a new option to help with modded games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 15/04/24 18:43</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-4</a> was released shortly after with these changes as well now:</p>

</ul>

<hr/>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton 9-3</a> has been released, and it includes a fancy new option to hopefully prevent you having issues with modded games when moving between systems like a PC and a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The new option is this Steam launch option <code class="inline-code">COPYPREFIX=1 %command%</code> and the mechanics behind it are a little on the complicated side, and you need to be careful not to mix it up if you do plan to use it as it will wipe your Proton prefix, which one depends on how you use it. Developer Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider explained it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By default steam stores the wine prefixes in the steam library where the game is installed under SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/ as well as shader cache files in shadercache/. When 'Steam Deck' session aka gamescope session is used, the -steamdeck option is appended to steam. This causes the default path for prefix compatdata and shadercache to change to the default steam install location ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata (or shadercache). This can be problematic if you are say for example switching from normal desktop steam to steamdeck. Or for example if you have a portable hard drive or SD card you keep your games on to use between the two. If you did something like say install mods for a game or played a game that doesnt work with cloud saves on the desktop, the prefix would not get used when you move the drive over from the desktop to steamdeck. Instead steamdeck would try to make a new one. The same goes in reverse for if you play games on the steam deck and try to move the game drive or sd card to a desktop.</p>
<p>What COPYPREFIX=1 DOES is if -steamdeck is applied it will check if a prefix exists on the game partition/drive. If it does, it will then WIPE the steamdeck prefix, and replace it with the one from the game partition/drive. . It does this with shader cache as well. This way steam will pick up your mods/saves that you had on your desktop or other PC you used the drive on before.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if -steamdeck is NOT applied -- it works in reverse. It will try to wipe the prefix on the game partition, and replace it with the one in steamdeck's default location. It does this with shader cache as well. A good use case for the reverse of the desktop -- say you've put in a ton of hours on a game with saves that don't work with steam cloud saving -- or have a bunch of mods you've applied on a game on your steam deck -- then you want to migrate to your desktop. In this case, put steam in desktop mode. Close steam then re-open it from the terminal using the steam command so that -steamdeck is NOT applied, then you can use COPYPREFIX to copy the steamdeck prefix to your game's partition/drive.</p>
<p>Again to clarify usage scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam launched in deck mode (-steamdeck applied) or from terminal with -steamdeck = copy FROM game partition prefix TO steamdeck prefix</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam launched from desktop shortcut or terminal without -steamdeck = copy FROM steamdeck prefix TO game partition prefix.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Clever light-manipulating puzzler Closure from 2012 gets upgraded for modern PCs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Eyebrow Interactive have given a fresh coat of paint to their 2012 game Closure, thanks to bringing in game porter Ethan Lee to get some technical issues sorted out. For those not aware, Closure first came to Linux in the Humble Indie Bundle 7!</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/Closure/announcements/detail/4191237128331739599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam developer Tyler Glaiel mentioned how much PCs have changed since then, and a number of technical issues appeared since the original release like shaders being completely broken on some graphics cards. Even building the game was getting complicated due to the old development environment, so "thanks to Ethan Lee (<a href="https://flibitijibibo.com/maintenance.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">flibitjibibo</a>) we got the game building again and updated a bunch of outdated tech to fix a whole ton of issues related to it".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uuOB6AHNGPs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5b140ce5107496d1ab9762fc561cddf8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uuOB6AHNGPs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MAJOR CHANGES</p>
<ul>
<li>A large number of issues related to windowing / fullscreen / high-res monitors have been fixed</li>
<li>Shaders (graphical effects, including ones related to collision detection) should now behave consistently on all graphics cards.</li>
<li>The Mac version is back! At least, on the pre-apple-silicon macs. (anything with an M1 or later chip is not supported)</li>
<li>You can reset the save file from the main menu now! (Gonna be honest, I'm not sure why I even thought this was okay to omit back when we did the pc port...). You're welcome, speedrunners</li>
<li>The steam cloud save file name was made consistent between mac/linux/windows. If you had an existing save file, the new version may not be pointing to it by default. If for some reason you want to play on your old save file instead of playing from scratch again, you can point the game at it via the settings file (new savefile name is closure_001.sav, previous on some platforms was cloudsave_closure_001)</li>
<li>A typo in the dev commentary was fixed (Job Schubbe -&gt; Jon Schubbe)</li>
</ul>
<p>BORING TECHNICAL CHANGES</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated from SDL to SDL2. Ironically I know SDL3 is on the way soon, but SDL2 should solve most of the compatibility issues related to windowing, fullscreen, DPI scaling, controller input, etc.</li>
<li>Shaders ported from Nvidia CG to GLSL. Nvidia CG was discontinued a long time ago and did some weird stuff on some graphics cards, so porting them all to GLSL should make them behave consistently everywhere and not have that issue where some GPUS would make you fall through the ground.</li>
<li>A number of link and runtime dependencies were removed, less DLLs are included with the game.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Proton Experimental brings lots of bug fixes, controller support in a few launchers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>RimWorld - Anomaly expansion and big free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ludeon Studios just released RimWorld - Anomaly, a huge new expansion to the colony-building sim filled with all sorts of crazy looking horrors.</p>
<p>This is a proper horror expansion too with you needing to survive flesh infestations, cultist attacks, shambling undead, blood rains, invisible hunters, and other sanity-shredding perils. You'll get to capture and study entities to harness the power of the void, conduct psychic rituals and awaken an evil machine god. Although, that does not sound like a good idea really does it? Inspired by classics including Cabin in the Woods, The Thing, The Cthulhu mythos, Hellraiser, and many more the developer said.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="59ooT57Lo3g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3741df0df6c590559a055988df02cbf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/59ooT57Lo3g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A big free update version 1.5 was also released bringing with it <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSgQmFRFk0FATWTjyZkKRq4oa58sQps4D0kE_uoyKR1y3ZXJT1nIMZSsno7T8cfG-Y6B8lVL3QFnbwQ/pub" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a lot</a> including books and bookcases, wall lamps, flood lights, hidden conduits, couches, ornate doors, Mechanoids can now emerge from bodies of water to attack your colony, when downed, humans still capable of manipulation can now crawl on the ground instead of being fully incapacitated, and a fun new option to restart your game after game over to have new colonist inhabit your colony remains. Plus <em>so</em> much more.</p>
<p>You can buy RimWorld for Linux from:</p>

      <title>Palworld is getting a major content update this Summer, plus a PvP Arena mode later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Palworld is set to expand in multiple big ways, which actually sounds quite exciting with a whole lot of new content set to arrive in the monster catching game.</p>
<p>Announced during the Triple-I showcase they showed off a trailer for an upcoming PvP mode, although they've since clarified the trailer had an error about when it will release. It will <em>not</em> release in the Summer, instead the plan there is to have an update adding in "a new island with a new species of Pals, new buildings, weapons, and more". The PvP mode meanwhile is sometime <em>later</em> in 2024.</p>
<p>The teaser they showed off was incredibly short:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="t37_VSUc1fU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bcbbff0d2c36d1663191abbc93a40ecf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/t37_VSUc1fU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Palworld is rated Steam Deck Playable and works great on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palworld on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>PathBlasters is like a competitive vertical-scrolling Bomberman</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by classic arcade games, PathBlasters looks like an absolute gem that deserves some attention mixing in some fun gameplay elements with a bit of a competitive edge to it.</p>
<p>My first thought when seeing it was it really resembles the idea of the classic Bomberman, but puts it into a fast-paced vertical-scrolling explosive block-pushing puzzler and it looks like so much fun to play with friends. Check out their trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nyaHV1GUfVM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3a81b94eb7d771100df7a8f3309f6046.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nyaHV1GUfVM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More: "Move crates, explode TNT, create your path as fast as possible to escape the Guardian. Run through 5 environments with their unique gameplay mechanics. Slide on ice in the mountains, avoid burning floors in the volcano, use chain reactions of blobs in the swamps, and more to discover. Combine speed and intelligence to find the fastest path. Escaping the guardian won't be an easy task!"</p>
<p>It has a mixture of solo play and versus modes, with both local and online play available. That makes me happy to see, because too many smaller fun looking games like that often rely on local multiplayer so great to see you'll be able to play friends anywhere.</p>
<p>PathBlasters has Native Linux support and controller support, so could be a fun one for Steam Deck fans too!</p>
<p>Available to buy from:</p>

      <title>Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon is a colourful cinematic 2D puzzle platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OutOfTheBit Ltd are doing it again. After the wonderful Full Void last year, they've announced Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon, another great looking cinematic platformer.</p>
<p>It will have Native Linux support again too. In fact the developer emailed recently to note that an older game of theirs, Super Arcade Football, was released on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/super_arcade_football" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and that "We're big Linux fans here at the studio and we always make sure our games run natively on Linux".</p>
<p>Nanuka will take players on an adventurous expedition through diverse regions, each with its own distinct environmental and architectural influences. Along the way, numerous enemies will endeavour to block your path and fellow allies will come to your aid as the mystery and secrets behind the planet’s moon begin to unravel.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Sicilian landscape, the journey begins on an island that, while initially portrayed as peaceful and picturesque, soon reveals a tale of magical abilities and a looming disaster that players must strive to avert. As the adventure and story progresses, the importance and acceptance of diverse races and beliefs will shine through preciously.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="P4W9jqIKzbU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/91c111ef0b65c5984fb8b21b24997e2f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/P4W9jqIKzbU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's what they had to say about it:</p>
<p>"At OutOfTheBit, we strive to push the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay. With Nanuka, we're taking players on an adventure that combines the charm of beautiful landscapes with original character design, all brought to life through thousands of meticulously hand animated frames." - Ali Motisi, Director of OutOfTheBit.</p>
<p>And also:</p>
<p>"At OutOfTheBit, we believe in the power of storytelling through games. While 'Full Void' explored the depths of isolation, with 'Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon,' we have another story to tell. A story that revolves around the themes of multiculturalism, the strength found in diversity and the beauty of mixing cultures.” - Ali Motisi, Director of OutOfTheBit.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810190/Nanuka_Secret_of_the_Shattering_Moon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it along on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Riot Games talk Vanguard anti-cheat for League of Legends and why it&#39;s a no for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While previously you've been able to play League of Legends on Linux, and there's some pretty die-hard fans using Wine to play it, that's set to end soon with Vanguard being introduced.</p>
<p>Cheating in online games is a constant battle for game developers, so I certainly appreciate it's a difficult subject to approach. Developers want players to have the easiest time getting into the game, that's obvious, but with so many cheats out there it's a difficult balancing act. They stated that "as many as 1 in 15 games globally has had a scripter or botter in it, but in some regions, this number is as high as 1 in 5" which is pretty problematic.</p>
<p>For those curious on their thoughts about Linux, and people playing LoL on Linux going forward they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: What about Linux?</strong></p>
<p>We've never officially supported Linux, and it's true that the current Lutris-based implementation for League (that uses wine) will not be able to satisfy the Vanguard driver requirements. Linux does not currently afford us sufficient ability to attest boot state or kernel modules, and the difficulty in securing it is only compounded by all the frustrating differences between distributions. Even allowing emulation is an exceptionally dangerous game, as many cheats could then just run on the host, manipulating or analyzing the VM in a way that would be invisible to Vanguard within it.</p>
<p>Half of anti-cheat is making sure the environment hasn't been tampered with, and this is extremely hard on Linux by design. Any backdoors we leave open for it are ones developers will immediately leverage for cheats, and yesterday, there were just over 800 Linux users on League. We have evaluated this risk to not be worth the payoff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And about having it be open source:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: Why not open source the driver?</strong></p>
<p>Anti-cheat is an iterative, indefinite battle. Many of the preventative checks that Vanguard makes to ensure system integrity are deliberately stealthy, bleeding-edge, and in some cases, built on total pillars of sand. We benefit extensively from the confusion that the system inflicts on cheaters, and letting them simply browse the detection methods would exhaust our supply faster than we could invent new ones. An <a href="https://github.com/RiotVanguard/Vanguard" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source anti-cheat application</a> would be totally useless (April Fools 2021).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it, you simply won't be able to play it on Linux with the introduction of Vanguard. We already knew this but at least they're trying to give more detailed explanations.</p>
<p>See their full blog post on the <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-vanguard-x-lol/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LoL website</a> which goes into plenty more detail on their struggle against cheaters.</p>

      <title>Fallout 4 is getting a fresh update and will be Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bethesda announced that Fallout 4 is getting a fresh update to bring some new features, along with getting it Steam Deck Verified later in April.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4s2bXQEbpcrsdCZhUYLHAi/fallout-4-is-getting-free-updates" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> it mentions April 25th along with next-gen console updates us PC players will also see "widescreen and ultra-wide support, fixes to Creation Kit and a variety of quest updates". On top of that we're also getting "stability, mods and bug fixes" and "Fallout 4 will also be Steam Deck verified" (it's currently only rated Playable by Valve).</p>
<p>For a game that's over 8 years old this is really nice to see!</p>
<p>Free Creation Club items are also on the way in a new "Echoes of the Past" quest that sees you try to stop "The Enclave from spreading their dangerous ideology and gaining a foothold in the Commonwealth". They said that along with workshop items and the Enclave Colonel uniform they're also including some other previously released content:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Enclave Weapon Skins</li>
<li>Enclave Armor Skins</li>
<li>Tesla Cannon</li>
<li>Hellfire Power Armor</li>
<li>X-02 Power Armor</li>
<li>Heavy Incinerator</li>
</ul>

      <title>Combined Arms (OpenRA) for Command &amp; Conquer just had a huge upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need some more RTS in your life? Combined Arms is one of my favourites. Built on the free and open source OpenRA, it brings together the Allies, Soviets, GDI, Nod and Scrin. The modders working on it have done some really impressive stuff with it and the latest version sounds awesome.</p>
<p>Version 1.02 released April 5th and brought with it some big new features like smart casting for unit abilities, 72 new maps, a whole bunch of new voice lines, new visual effects and much more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/997228061712845387gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/997228061712845387gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can play it completely free since it depends on OpenRA which is open source, plus the original C&amp;C games were set free a long time ago by EA. Although they are once again selling them on Steam in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/command-conquer-the-ultimate-collection-launched-on-steam-and-other-classics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Command &amp; Conquer The Ultimate Collection</a> for convenience. But Combined Arms will pull what it needs from the previous freeware releases for you. No set-up needed.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest stuff in v1.02 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Smart casting for unit abilities (by default only the closest unit to the target will fire &amp; ctrl can be used to force all selected units to fire).</li>

<li>Overhauled Mini Drone attachment (making them easier to attach and less glitchy).</li>
<li>Improved support power targeting visuals.</li>
<li>Vehicles/aircraft can be sold at Service Depots.</li>
<li>Multi-Queue Scaled - Removed Optimized Production upgrades. Associated discounts are permanently provided by the relevant T2/T3 structures being built.</li>
<li>Lowered selection priority for transport aircraft.</li>
<li>20 new 1v1 maps.</li>
<li>52 new team game maps (17x 2v2, 15x 3v3, 10x 4v4, 8x 5v5, 2x 6v6)</li>
<li>Added Testing Grounds map.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Artwork &amp; SFX</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New voice lines for many units: Chrono Prison, Battle Fortress, Mirage Tank, Cryo Launcher, Siege Tank, Sukhoi, Halo, Thief, Eradicator, Disruptor, Mammoth Tank, Titan, Juggernaut, Battle Drone, Mammoth Drone, X-O Powersuit, Comanche, Microwave Tank, Spectre, Venom, Acolyte, Templar and Heavy Flame Tank.</li>
<li>New voice announcements for upgrades: Seismic Missiles, Railgun Titan, Ion Mammoth, Hover Mammoth, Battle Drone, Intensified Microwaves.</li>
<li>Improved custom RA EVA voice line effects.</li>
<li>Added/updated transport loading and aircraft takeoff/landing sound effects.</li>
<li>Added IFV transform sound.</li>
<li>Added additional visual when units are upgrading.</li>
<li>Added brass casings ejected from vehicles/aircraft with machine guns.</li>
<li>New sound effects for Vulcan weapon.</li>
<li>Impact sound effects for Shard Launcher, Gun Walker, Shard Walker, Ravager, Lacerator.</li>

      <title>Cave-diving action roguelite UnderMine 2 announced by Thorium</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another interesting one from the Triple-I showcase is UnderMine 2, Thorium's follow-up to their pretty great cave-diving action roguelite and this one sounds like a good improvement over the first game.</p>
<p>They said it's been in development for three years now, building on top of the best parts of the first. Check out their teaser trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4-7OAiV8QTE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/06119b3ff08b675a2bb63e189bdbb404.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4-7OAiV8QTE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>New features announced for the sequel include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2 Player Local Co-op (online via Steam Remote Play) - Play through the entirety of the game with a friend by your side. UnderMine 2 supports drop in and out co-op with dynamically scaling difficulty. See what new item combos and strategic options open up with two players.</li>
<li>Playable Character Classes - Discover, unlock, and play as different characters including some favorites from UnderMine. Each playable character has unique stats, abilities, upgrades, and relics they can find. Each character significantly alters the feel of the game.</li>
<li>Branching Paths - New regions of the Undermine have been revealed, and each branches off into various other areas. Navigate it to complete builds, quests, and different objectives. Your final challenge depends entirely on your decisions throughout the run.</li>
<li>Arcana - Wield new, interactive relics called Arcana. Each adds a new ability to your character, from casting fireballs to summoning skeleton minions to rearranging time and space. Arcana can make an old character feel new by centering entire builds around their function.</li>
<li>Full Mod and Workshop Support - We’re shipping you the tools we use to make the game and making it as easy as possible to upload and download mods from Steam Workshop. We feel we’ve created a really great technical platform and are excited to share that with you.</li>
<li>And a lot more! More characters, more zones, more items, and more action all around!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear yet if UnderMine 2 will have Native Linux support like the first entry, if not no doubt it will work with Proton.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1869780/UnderMine_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Brotato: Abyssal Terrors is going to ruin my free time, especially with co-op</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh no, please no more, I have so little time as it is. Brotato: Abyssal Terrors has been announced as the first DLC for the excellent top-down arena shooter roguelite Brotato and it's full of goodies.</p>
<p>Not only is a content-filled DLC on the way but a free update is also coming with local co-op for up to 4 players, game balancing adjustments, bug fixes and even new content for everyone. Alone that's kind of huge, co-op for Brotato is something many have wanted to see. I can't wait to see just how crazy it is with multiple players!</p>
<p>The DLC though, damn, that's going to give you plenty more including: 20 new waves with new enemies, elites and bosses, 10+ new characters, 10+ new weapons and 30+ new items.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rn_9djqZZVg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/361278957c4dd187c46cc54571725eef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rn_9djqZZVg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It works to perfection on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. It's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1942280/Brotato/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and I suggest you do because it's fab. Brotato is easily one of my favourite games released in 2023 for sure.</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 gets a new trailer plus a demo for Steam Next Fest in June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the games I am truly most looking forward to getting my hands on is Streets of Rogue 2, which seems like it takes everything good about the first game and just expands on it greatly. Gimme.</p>
<p>At the Triple-I showcase a new trailer was shown off, and an announcement that a playable demo will be live for Steam Next Fest in June. The trailer below shows off plenty to be excited about including vehicles, lots of explosions and just pure chaos as we're all expecting from it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7AJBiX-N3Sg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b829aaf905f9f9c2c84493f503ba3659.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7AJBiX-N3Sg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Streets of Rogue 2 is the culmination of nearly 10 years of ongoing work on the series. I'm looking forward to giving a sneak peek with the demo, and getting more content into everyone's hands via Early Access later this year!” said Matt Dabrowski, creator of the Streets of Rogue franchise.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dozens of unique and quirky playable classes (i.e., Ninja, Werewolf, Investment Banker, Alien…)</li>
<li>Seamless, procedurally generated open world with a map 100 times the size of a single level from Streets of Rogue 1 and multiple unique biomes from bustling cities to creepy forests</li>
<li>An absurd amount of intertwined gameplay systems in the best tradition of immersive sims: destructible environments, hacking, smart NPC AI, mind control, farming, building, vehicles, etc</li>
<li>You can pet the dog. And also ride the dog!</li>
<li>Wreak havoc with a vast arsenal of items and weapons: shrink rays, bear traps, rat-summoning ocarina, Necronomicon, landmines, firearms, rocket launchers, and many more</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow Streets of Rogue 2 on Steam</a>. It's due for release with Linux support sometime later in 2024. And I highly recommend the first game too which is great fun in co-op available from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/streets_of_rogue" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/512900/Streets_of_Rogue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns is a Contra collab DLC releasing May 9th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fun looking one from the Triple-I showcase is Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns, a fresh new DLC for everyone's favourite survivor game. This is a collab between developer poncle and KONAMI's Contra team.</p>
<p>You thought Vampire Survivors would do Castlevania? Wrong. But you are getting guns. Those pesky creatures won't know what hit them. With the DLC you will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>11 gun-slinging characters</li>
<li>22 new weapons between base versions and evolutions. They're not all guns - some of them trigger explosions too!</li>
<li>1 large stage and 1 bonus stage</li>
<li>13 music tracks directly from the Contra series and 6 brand new covers</li>
<li>An explosively silly 6-chapters Adventure</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JL-73l_hCMg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cfbb2e05e723f9297f023a6ca8a2bd08.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JL-73l_hCMg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Releasing on May 9th for $2.49 / €2.49 / £1.99. Can't really argue with that price.</p>
<p>Speaking about the DLC the developer poncle said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As usual the DLC will add a new stage in Stage Selection, from where you'll be able to start the chain of unlocks to get the new characters and weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Most characters will offer cross-stats benefits for players who like min-maxing, and will be able to find special pickups typical of the Contra series, like Grenades or RapidFires.<br/>
<br/>
Most weapons will have a damage output slightly lower than usual to try paying a little homage to the historically high difficulty of the Contra series, but also there will be a lot Arcana interactions to customise the difficulty to your liking. In the same spirit, there are several weapons that require some aiming or that follow the typical arcade 8-angle constraints when firing.<br/>
<br/>
While we like to joke about the concept of just adding a ton of guns, actually there will also be melee weapons and most of the new projectiles are rather unusual.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, yes, the silly racing-stage seen in the trailer is real and will be playable!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vampire Survivors is Steam Deck Verified and also has a (unadvertised) Native Linux version.</p>

      <title>Lutris v0.5.17 brings critical bug fixes and a new way to run games with Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source game manager Lutris has a new release out, with brings in some critical bug fixes along with some new features needing testing.</p>
<p>One of the main additions this time is support for <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher" rel="noopener" target="_blank">umu</a>, the Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher, which allows you to properly run Proton outside of Steam. From the GitHub: "It is essentially a copy of the Steam Linux Runtime/Steam Runtime Tools that Valve uses for proton, with some modifications made so that it can be used outside of Steam" that other launchers like Lutris and Heroic can use.</p>
<p>The developer notes this new feature is experimental, but is also now the only way to use Proton in Lutris.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12070408881712835084gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12070408881712835084gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all that's <a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/releases/tag/v0.5.17" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fix critical bug preventing completion of installs if the script specifies a wine version</li>
<li>Fix critical bug preventing Steam library sync</li>
<li>Fix critical bug preventing game or runner uninstall in Flatpak</li>
<li>Support for library sync to lutris.net, this allows to sync games, play time and categories to multiple devices.</li>
<li>Remove "Lutris" service view; with library sync the "Games" view replaces it.</li>
<li>Torturous and sadistic options for multi-GPUs that were half broken and understood by no one have been replaced by a simple GPU selector.</li>
<li>EXPERIMENTAL support for umu, which allows running games with Proton and Vessel. Using Proton in Lutris without umu is no longer possible.</li>
<li>Better and sensible sorting for games (sorting by playtime or last played no longer needs to be reversed)</li>
<li>Support the "Categories" command when you select multiple games</li>
<li>Notification bar when your Lutris is no longer supported</li>
<li>Improved error dialog.</li>
<li>Add Vita3k runner (thanks <a href="https://github.com/ItsAllAboutTheCode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@ItsAllAboutTheCode</a>)</li>
<li>Add Supermodel runner</li>
<li>WUA files are now supported in Cemu</li>
<li>"Show Hidden Games" now displays the hidden games in a separate view, and re-hides them as soon as you leave it.</li>
<li>Support transparent PNG files for custom banner and cover-art</li>
<li>Images are now downloaded for manually added games.</li>
<li>Deprecate 'exe', 'main_file' or 'iso' placed at the root of the script, all lutris.net installers have been updated accordingly.</li>
<li>Deprecate libstrangle and xgamma support.</li>
<li>Deprecate DXVK state cache feature (it was never used and is no longer relevant to DXVK 2)</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mega Crit have announced Slay the Spire 2 during the Triple-I showcase, a game that no doubt will be exciting for many with how great the first is. You've got a good while to wait though, as it's going to be hitting Early Access in 2025. Good things come to those who wait though, as they say.</p>
<p>"Civilization has waited 1,000 years for the Spire to reopen its doors...<br/>
Return to the Spire and face friends and foes in this sequel to the quintessential roguelike deckbuilder. How high will you ascend... and what truths lie at the top?"</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer:</p>

Try risky builds or play it safe as you explore countless different strategies, find yourself in peculiar scenarios, and confront the Bosses of each Act.</li>
<li><strong>New Ways to Play! </strong>That aren't yet announced...</li>
<li><strong>Rebuilt from the Ground Up</strong> - Slay the Spire 2 was completely rewritten from the ground up in a new game engine! We're bringing in modern features, incorporating all-new visuals, and expanding moddability.</li>

      <title>The first handheld to use PlaytronOS is some Web3 thing - the SuiPlay0x1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/playtron-plan-to-launch-playtronos-a-linux-based-system-for-gaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Playtron and PlaytronOS</a>? They made an attempt at a big splash recently with plans to create a Linux-powered system to rival SteamOS (Steam Deck) and Windows across various devices and multiple stores. The first device has been announced and it's some weird web3 thing.</p>
<p>I should note, Playtron's CEO offered some details before the announcement, but didn't actually follow-up on providing me with <em>anything</em>. So I'm simply going by what has been announced and the seemingly <a href="https://sui.io/suiplay0x1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official page</a> for it is mostly blank, with just a newsletter sign up box.</p>
<p>It was announced at Sui Basecamp (Sui being a Web3 blockchain company) with the reveal from Mysten Labs. According to Sui it's called the SuiPlay0x1 and it will be released in 2025. As <a href="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1777990300138393895" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> on X (formerly Twitter): "SuiPlay0X1 runs Playtron's device-agnostic gaming operating system, enabling gamers to play both Web3 and Web2 games across PC and mobile."</p>
<p>And uh, it looks apparently like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5521319781712764354gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5521319781712764354gol1.jpg"/></a>Picture credit: Sui/Mysten Labs/Playtron</em></p>
<p>Those sticks and d-pad look rather terrible don't think? Why is it so flat? That does not look comfortable to game with. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/suiplay-0x1-is-an-open-steam-deck-like-gaming-handheld-with-multiple-game-stores/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesBeat</a> have some more details, noting it will have "native Sui blockchain integration via zkLogin and Sui Kiosk SDKs, enabling asset ownership directly connected to a device’s account system for the first time in the gaming industry" and it might cost somewhere around $500 and while it seems to have deep integration with Sui blockchain stuff, it will support other stores too. Doesn't seem like any technical specifications have been given out yet.</p>
<p>So if blockchain web3 stuff is your jam, then you might be interested in this I guess? Not one for me honestly.</p>
<p>Until Playtron actually get some agreements to be on more…<em>normal</em> devices, I don't really see it going anywhere. At least once they eventually release the first public builds of the Linux-based PlaytronOS we might see what they're really up to.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>Always nice to see more developers open up their games. ROTA released back in 2022 is now not only free, but it's also been made open source by the dev.

      <title>The incredible pixel-smashing game Noita got a huge free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Noita is something really special, a roguelite game where every pixel is physically simulated and it's easily one of the best games ever made. It's grown again with another big free upgrade out with the Noita Epilogue 2 Update.</p>
<p>Here you get to fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've created yourself thanks to numerous crazy wands. Explore a variety of environments ranging from coal mines to freezing wastelands while delving deeper in search for unknown mysteries. The interactivity at play with all the individual pixels in Noita always amazes me.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11886899501712762046gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11886899501712762046gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Yes I was on fire on the above screenshot, and the fire was burning every damn pixel around the level exit. Woops. Had to wait a bit on that one. Or I could have found a little pool, or covered myself in blood pixels from enemies. You know, <em>something</em> to put my flames out. Look, you never know what's going to happen, it's such a dynamic game.</p>
<p>So what's the new update all about? Well it adds in a whole bunch of new spells to add to your wands including some secret spells, 6 new enemies to tear into pixels, new chemical reactions (oh boy), new potion reactions, 3 new boss fights, a utility box item, new rare materials, a new easter egg, a new secret quest, a new small biome, new additional audio added in, various fixes for when you move really fast, lots of bug fixes and lots of improvements for modders. Plus more in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/881100/view/4212628592054084886" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>.</p>
<p>It's Steam Deck Verified and works great on Desktop Linux with Proton. Noita is absolutely not to be slept on.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Besiege is good fun having you construct various mechanical machines for destruction, and now it's all going to get a bit wet in The Splintered Sea expansion. </p>
<p>Announced for release on May 24th, In The Splintered Sea, players battle through a 10-level oceanic campaign, introducing new block types to bring more chaos to the high seas. Using elements of hydrodynamics, this expansion challenges players to explore new builds capable of above-water combat and undersea exploration. The developers said it was a huge technical challenge for them, one that's been multiple years in the making.</p>
<p>It also brings with it a new sandbox environment, allowing you to sail through a vast archipelago, while you explore ancient ruins, and put your engineering to the test on water courses. Using The Splintered Sea’s eight new aquatic blocks, you can spread your destruction across land and sea!</p>

      <title>Toaplan Arcade Shoot &#39;Em Up Collection Vol.4 is out now with more classics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're a shoot 'em up fan you've been eating good recently, with another quality set of games out now in the Toaplan Arcade Shoot ‘Em Up Collection Vol.4. This is the last Toaplan collection coming from Bitwave Games, and so to go along with collection 4 they've also put up a bundle in the Toaplan Arcade Shoot ‘Em Up Ultimate Collection for all 16 games.</p>
<p>The games included in this collection are:</p>
<p><strong><em>Grind Stormer</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13755137541712738663gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>"Grind Stormer, aka ‘V・V’, is a vertically scrolling shooter with gorgeous pixel art graphics and an upbeat FM soundtrack. Developed by an all-star team at Toaplan, the game is a superb early example of a manic shooter, a precursor to the ‘bullet hell’ shoot ‘em up genre so popular today. The Japanese version of the game, called V・V (pronounced V Five), features a selectable power-up system with gauges, providing a strategic gameplay element where the key to success is to use the appropriate weapon for each level and enemy encounter."</p>
<p><strong><em>Twin Hawk</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13859091961712738542gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>"Take on powerful tanks and battleships with in this military themed vertical arcade shoot ‘em up by Toaplan! Summon friendly fighter planes to avoid emergencies and increase firepower. A vertical scrolling shooter, gamers must defy the oncoming army and navy barrages, assisted by calling up a formation of six friendly fighters. In <strong><em>Twin Hawk</em></strong>, a strategic approach is the key to success, but the challenge ramps up when the last stage is cleared, entering Round Two of the conflict with the difficulty getting progressively harder with each loop of the game! Like the Japanese title of the game Daisenpu (Great Whirlwind) implies, the game will eventually come at you with full force, never letting go!"</p>
<p><strong><em>Truxton II</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9779976981712738500gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>"The sequel to Toaplan’s shoot ‘em up masterpiece, <strong><em>Truxton II</em></strong> is a thrilling slice of space action with an unforgiving difficulty level. Enjoy the visually stunning pixel graphics and vibrant music as you dodge the high-speed bullet rain and take on tough bosses. Casual players who dare to play<strong><em> Truxton II </em></strong>can take solace in the added easy mode, and the modern features of rewind and quick save that gives players a fighting chance to advance through the quick bullet rain and tough bosses."</p>
<p><strong><em>Dogyuun</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17781719201712738582gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>"A science fiction-themed vertically scrolling shoot 'em up game known for its stunning detailed pixel art, gigantic bosses, and menacing difficulty. Quite possibly the most rock n’ roll shooting game of all time, <strong><em>Dogyuun</em></strong> is packed with a huge enemy variety, providing a tough challenge even for hardened shmup’ veterans. <strong><em>Dogyuun </em></strong>is a visual spectacle of amazing pixel art graphics and detailed animation under the artistic vision of Hayashi Miho and Koetsu Iwabuchi and marks the debut of manga artist Junya Inoue as one of the graphic artists."</p>
<p>And of course each comes with all the improvements Bitwave worked on like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal Input Lag: Emulation, input processing, and rendering all complete on the same frame.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards for Single Credit, No Assist, and Assisted plays.</li>
<li>Rewind the game between 10-18 minutes, depending on the action.</li>
<li>Experience the game in Mirror Mode.</li>
<li>Assist Features such as auto-fire at multiple rates.</li>
<li>Very Easy Mode: Lower the difficulty to breeze through the adventure.</li>
<li>Rotate the gameplay in 90-degree increments.</li>
<li>Choose between Raw Input on Windows or Steam Input.</li>
<li>Hone your skills in the ultra-customizable practice mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/39256/Toaplan_Arcade_Shootem_Ups_4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/toaplan_arcade_shootem_ups_4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> but looks like only Steam has the Linux versions.</p>

      <title>Please, Touch The Artwork 2 gets a bunch of Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Please, Touch The Artwork 2 is a free and highly rated hand-painted cozy hidden object adventure out now, and recently it had some nice Steam Deck improvements. For those of you who want a little casual gaming on the go, something to relax with for a bit, this seems like a nice pick. And hey it's free so no complaints there.</p>
<p>From the April 5th <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2600140/announcements/detail/4203621392781134069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bugfix (gamepad + Steamdeck) in The City where you couldn’t move in the painting with the lady in front of the window.</li>
<li>SteamDeck: show onscreen keyboard for inputfields.</li>
<li>SteamDeck: automatically show/hide hand when playing with gamepad vs touchscreen.</li>
<li>SteamDeck: disabled windowmode and resolution selection because resolution is fixed.</li>
<li>Added numbers to levelnames to avoid confusion in level-order.</li>
<li>Made level names also clickable to start level.</li>
<li>Small fixes &amp; improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see even small fixes and improvements for the Steam Deck there, just to make it feel that little bit better. And a good excuse to give a fun free game a shout-out.</p>

      <title>Super Video Golf added a career mode - it deserves more attention</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Super Video Golf looks great for anyone who loves Golf, and it got a bit buried but the developer has continued to expand it with a recent update adding in a career mode. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified!</p>
<p>This 90s styled game offers up quite a lot including a free play mode, 8 player local and online support, a wide variety of course sizes including mini-golf along with various weather conditions. You can even play it at night if you wish. There's also a full tutorial and a driving range on top of that. There's also monthly challenges, leaderboards and even Steam Workshop support. What more could you want? I have no idea, I don't play Golf — but it looks genuinely good</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="O76bLODRlwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/427d00c686f34659f3085bccd5073195.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/O76bLODRlwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the new career mode added in you get to play through 6 seasons across 12 courses, over 36 games. If you rank in the top 3 you'll unlock various cosmetic items too which you can then use in the career or free play modes. There's a save system added in for it too, so you can drop out any time. The save system hasn't yet been added to the free play mode though.</p>

      <title>Linux continues to be above 4% on the desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to the StatCounter, Linux on the desktop has continued to rise and remains above 4%, with this being the healthiest it's ever looked on the desktop. </p>
<p>First hitting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/linux-on-the-desktop-breaks-4-for-the-first-time-on-statcounter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 4% in February</a>, their March data is now in showing not just staying above 4% but rising a little once again showing the trend is clear that Linux use is rising. Slow and steady wins the race as they say.</p>
<p>Here's how things have looked over the last year+</p>
<ul>
<li>January 23 - 2.91%</li>
<li>February 23 - 2.94%</li>
<li>March 23 - 2.85%</li>
<li>April 23 - 2.83%</li>
<li>May 23 - 2.7%</li>
<li>June 23 - 3.07%</li>
<li>July 23 - 3.12%</li>
<li>August 23 - 3.18%</li>
<li>September 23 - 3.02%</li>
<li>October 23 - 2.92%</li>
<li>November 23 - 3.22%</li>
<li>December 23 - 3.82%</li>
<li>January 24 - 3.77%</li>
<li>February 24 - 4.03%</li>
<li><strong>March 24 - 4.05%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Technically, ChromeOS is also Linux, and while people like to debate that if you do include Linux and ChromeOS together it would actually be <strong>6.32%</strong>. A number that is getting steadily harder for developers of all kinds to ignore. It terms of overall percentage, it's still relatively small but when you think about how many people that actually is, it's a <em>lot</em>.</p>
<p>Another look since 2009:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21253730361712665899gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21253730361712665899gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>For those thinking it may be due to Steam Deck with SteamOS, it's unlikely, at least not directly. StatCounter gather their info from web traffic across over 1.5 million sites globally. I doubt all that many browse the web regularly on Deck. However, indirectly? Possible, I've seen lots and lots of posts about people enjoying Linux thanks to the Desktop Mode on the Steam Deck. There's going to be various other bigger factors at play here though, like Linux nowadays actually being properly <em>good</em> on the desktop.</p>

<p>Speaking about more retro games like this being revived and released on GOG their team said "With classics so well known and beloved, we're surely kicking off 2024 on a high note – making it undeniably clear that we’re not slowing down on a mission of games preservation. This is not GOG’s final word on the subject, that’s for sure – we have much more up our sleeves, and we’re looking forward to expanding our relationship with SNK, as well as their catalogue of timeless gems on our platform. So, better get ready, because more is yet to come".</p>
<p>They also have an <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2024_snk_publisher_sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SNK publisher sale</a> going on.</p>

      <title>Explicit GPU Synchronization for Xwayland now merged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is finally here. Xwayland now has the code for Explicit GPU Synchronization merged after waiting over a year for everything to be ready. It's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/kdes-xaver-hugl-on-why-wayland-explicit-sync-is-such-a-big-deal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a pretty big deal</a> and should make NVIDIA GPU users especially happy in future.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/967" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merge request</a> that was originally opened by Erik Kurzinger from NVIDIA:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is our proposal for adding explicit GPU synchronization to the DRI3 and Present extensions, along with an implementation for Xwayland. While we at NVIDIA may be particularly keen to have this in place, since our driver lacks implicit sync support, a general consensus seems to be forming around the idea that explicit sync is the best path forward for the Linux graphics stack. Xwayland will likely remain an important component in that stack for some time yet, and therefore I feel that this work will be of long-term benefit to the community more broadly.</p>
<p>The design takes inspiration from the proposed Wayland wp_linux_explicit_sync_v2 protocol [1], making use of DRM syncobjs as the main primitive. I believe this offers a few benefits. One, having both X11 and Wayland use a similar mechanism for explicit sync will simplify development for client-side drivers, and two, it will also hopefully make it fairly straight-forward for Xwayland itself to add support for the Wayland explicit sync protocol, presumably once it's more widely implemented by compositors.</p>
<p>I've tried to keep this initial proposal focused on getting a usable GPU synchronization primitive in place, and adding support for it to the PresentPixmap request, believing this to be the most important part of the presentation pipeline. Other use-cases for this primitive are conceivable, for instance perhaps in the Damage extension, but I feel that those are best left for later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not much is left to get everything all hooked up nicely, with an upcoming NVIDIA beta driver that should have support for it next month. The code for GNOME has <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/3300" rel="noopener" target="_blank">already</a> been merged, KDE has a merge request <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/4693" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open</a> for it too, Mesa also already has it <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25709?commit_id=5f7a5a27ef1b630bd1aea0cc0b1256fadee9de8e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">merged</a> in.</p>
<p>Nice to see it finally there.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 41: The Worm Turns</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-40-the-cyborg-project/" target="_blank">Part 40: The Cyborg Project</a></strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Somewhat similar to SDL, the Allegro library is a cross-platform backend for low-level game routines. Although the project does see continued support to this day with the Allegro 5 branch, for much of its history Allegro was very much associated with the MS-DOS freeware scene that was still going strong well into the early 2000s. Seeing this wealth of game content, the Fedora contributor Hans de Goede decided to see if he could port some of these over to Linux.</p>
<p>One group which were receptive to this were the developers of <em>Worminator 3</em>, an expanded version of the original <em>Worminator</em> inspired by the action platformer games released by both Apogee Software and id Software in the early 1990s. Included with the source code is the actual email correspondence Hans de Goede had with Electroencephalogram Productions going over the change in licence, as well as further fleshing out the whole process of bringing the game over to Linux.</p>
<p>I have often found using Allegro to be mercurial, and this again proved true. With both the allegro-4.2.1-1.rh7.rf.i386.rpm and allegro-devel-4.2.1-1.rh7.rf.i386.rpm packages installed I was able to get <em>Worminator 3</em> to build without any complaints, but the compiled binary for whatever reason was unable to find the Allegro library. To get the game to launch I ended up just grabbing the allegro-4.2.1.tar.gz source archive to make a separate library file, and then preloaded that to start the game.</p>
<p>As the title implies <em>Worminator</em> begins as a loose parody of <em>The Terminator</em> film from 1984, but with the roles reversed as you instead take on the role of the killer cyborg hunting down the rebel worms and their leader Wrom Conner. As the story branches out though things do get more complicated, with the second episode new to <em>Worminator 3</em> having a more surreal tone that even includes some rather risqué content. All in all this added personality is appreciated, especially in a free software title.</p>
<p>The creativity also bleeds into the artwork, which while being simplistic is also varied with a lot of nice small touches, such as the dedicated animations the game will play when left idle. With <em>Worminator</em> starting its life out on MS-DOS the game also has a lovely MIDI soundtrack which Allegro does play with my MIDI synth hardware, all of which kept me engaged enough to play through the whole campaign in the course of a single day and a very pleasant evening.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5623967661712601270gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5623967661712601270gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/254365991712601271gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/254365991712601271gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Performance wise the game averaged around 30 frames per second at 640x480 resolution for me, which is slower than I might have expected, but did little to impact the game experience. Lowering the resolution further did speed up the game, but since it did not scale I would have been left squinting at a tiny game window surrounded by black borders. Speaking of variable speed, <em>Worminator 3</em> also includes a bullet time mechanic I never found the need to use, but then the idea was in vogue at the time.</p>
<p>In the same vein are the vehicle sections found late in the second episode, but these are at least more cleverly implemented as they are utilized in solving a couple of neat puzzles. The tank did however introduce the only lock up I encountered in the game, which happened while driving into a large swarm of enemies in the very last level. Overall I found that the second episode was in fact easier than the first, but it was also the more enjoyable of the two.</p>
<p>The final level of the first episode features a mean trap where the game will take all of your weapons away, and as you will only pick up ammunition for the weapons you currently hold, you will be caught short unless you backtrack after acquiring new ones. This left me stuck on my first attempt, and since you only get the one save slot, I ended up having to start the whole game over from scratch; you can restart the current level after you die, but one of the doors refused to open for me after doing that.</p>
<p>Apart from this <em>Worminator 3</em> does present a fair challenge, but if you still do not wish to meet it, you can instead subvert it by playing with the various modes listed in the cheats menu. Also included are skins that allow you to play as someone other than the Worminator, for those thirsting for even more variety and customization. There is even a built-in level editor you can use to create your own missions, so the possibilities here really are endless.</p>
<p>Keen Linux users may also notice that the same sound effect Knoppix uses when shutting down can also be heard in one of the levels, although this is probably just due to them pulling from the same royalty free audio library. The last five games I have played had all been brought to Linux by virtue of having their source code made available, so I think it is about time I tackled another commercially released product, and return to my original intent of playing through the Loki Software ports.</p>

      <title>Old School Rally plans full support for Steam Deck - got me feeling nostalgic</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I have truly fond memories of spending entire days playing rally games on the original PlayStation, and some later games on PC and Old School Rally really looks the part.</p>
<p>The developer has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2824660/announcements/detail/4131562530385124011" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam that "Old School Rally will fully support the Steam Deck right out of the box when the game launches. (Verified status pending Valve review)". Good to see developers continue testing their games on Steam Deck <em>before</em> release instead of after - more of that needs to happen.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UoM0bz7zZH8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bbd253cd4414561d01e14f2a10f91ebb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UoM0bz7zZH8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I almost thought I was watching a video of Colin McRae Rally for a moment there. I love how indie developers refresh older classics like this that not only look the part, but come with all the niceties you expect from a modern PC release at the same time.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>RETRO STYLE VISUALS - </strong>Carefully crafted retro style visuals, reminiscent of the late '90s rally games evoking a sense of nostalgia and charm, making it a must-play for everyone.</li>
<li><strong>RACE THE WORLD - </strong>With a variety of rally tracks from around the globe, race across different surfaces inducing dirt, tarmac and snow and challenge your driving skills.</li>
<li><strong>RALLY CARS - </strong>Choose from a diverse lineup of rally cars inspired by the legends of the past, each with unique characteristics and features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It enters Early Access on Steam later this year and they think it will take 6-10 months to complete.</p>
