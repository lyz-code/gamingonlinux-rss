      <title>StarVaders is deck-building meets grid-based tactics and it&#39;s basically perfect</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>StarVaders from developer Pengonauts is a colourful and action-packed mix of a deck-builder with fast grid-based tactical combat and it's a thoroughly great time. I've never seen another game so smoothly blend these two together. <em>Disclosure: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Here you pilot a mech to fight off swarms of alien invaders across a rogue-lite campaign, and the tight design of it shines right on through. It's a game that doesn't take you particularly long to blast through either at about an hour a run, which is part of what makes it so great. That, and just the overall fab design of it with multiple characters and lots of ways to build up your decks. Even the tutorial was good in this, with it getting you right into the action!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hd_wWZvVCNI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/08e56a3e2daef0f5c1ef69fdde429030.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hd_wWZvVCNI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The combat, while challenging, is not overly punishing. However, it definitely is a tough one to get through even on the initial difficulty level with the first character. But, there's tons of features and little touches that make it worth pushing through. Getting hit by enemies for example won't end up destroying you, not directly anyway, as you just build up useless junk cards in your pile.</p>
<p>Your main things to worry about are how many turns you've used, since most battles have a turn limit and how far down the grid the enemies are getting, which is the main point of the combat. These aliens are trying to get closer and closer, moving a step each turn and It's your job to use up all your cards and move around the grid to prevent that. If the invaders manage to get to the bottom 3 rows you'll start to build up Doom, if you build up too much Doom it's all over. Doom carries over between missions too, which is where a lot of the challenge comes in. If you hit the turn limit, enemies will build up Doom no matter where they are — so you need to take them out fast.</p>
<p>With lots of different enemies that have different abilities, strengths and weaknesses along with the boss battles that are their own little mini-game due to the boss creatures having their own special mechanics it sure does keep you on your toes.</p>
<p>Enemies have a big mixture of behaviours between shooting at you, spawning more enemies or obstacles, shields you need to take down first (with some becoming invulnerable the turn the shield goes down), firing rockets across a whole area making them hard to avoid and so on. There's lots to think about but it's never overloading on your brain.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14724096921748009369gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14724096921748009369gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10939017671748009371gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10939017671748009371gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I especially love how clear and accessible the game is to get to grips with thanks to the neat design. The battles are all across a small grid, and you can hover over anything to get a readout on what it is (including enemies and their abilities). On top of that, you get the chance at a do-over too. Did you mess up spectacularly? Well, you can spend your limited Chrono Tokens to wind back time to the start of your turn and see if you can do better. You can also earn back more of these tokens during combat by destroying certain types of enemies too and they get refreshed when you finish an Act.</p>
<p>You start off with one character and one mech (the Gunner) to choose from. Even just by itself, that would have been a great game due to the <em>heat</em> mechanics of the first mech. Heat is its card cost system, or mana that you might see in other deck-builders. Each card has a heat cost, and you have a maximum amount of heat you can build up per turn (it resets each turn). However, you can also go over your max heat to <em>overheat</em> and still use another card but you'll burn up that card and be unable to use it for the rest of the battle. A nice change compared to other similar deck-builders that allows a little wiggle room but with that big drawback. Remember those junk cards mentioned earlier? You can satisfyingly burn them up to get rid of them too.</p>
<p>However, once you manage to complete a full run the game will expand and open up to give you more characters with their own set of initial cards and uniqueness, and two other mechs that <strong>completely</strong> <em>change</em> the way you play the game which was a <em>huge</em> surprise. So to be clear: you pick a character with their own set of initial cards, and then pick a mech which comes with their own game mechanics for the battles. These layers add tons of replay value to the game to keep you going for hours.</p>
<p>The other two mechs you unlock replace the heat system from the Gunner with an energy system for the Stinger and a Mana system for the Keeper. The Keeper is the most different to the other two, as you're not inside a mech, instead you summon entities and haunt them moving them around the board. It's like three versions of the game in one.</p>
<p>However, one issue I have with it is how <em>long</em> it takes to unlock the two other mechs, which can be quite a while depending on how good you are at the game. However, leaning back into how accessible it is, there's options to skip the progression systems entirely to just play it your way with everything.</p>
<p>Like any good deck-builder, after each successful battle you'll be rewarded and here you can build up your deck to give you new tactical options during battles. There's some really fun cards here with lots of different combinations that become possible, which is why playing through it multiple times stays fun. Much in the same way that Slay the Spire had a firm grip on me, this very much did too.</p>
<p>As for the campaign, it's also nice and simple on the layout. You battle across the world, picking between nodes on the map that have different encounters in terms of enemy types and rewards. Initially you don't know exactly what will be inside until you've played through them to discover the enemies, and then picking between them gets a little easier.</p>

<p>Tested on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu Linux 25.04) with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a> it was flawless. Valve gave it a Steam Deck Playable rating noting it has small text and sometimes doesn't show the right icons. I've played a bunch on Steam Deck too and while some text is a bit on the small side, it's mostly fine. I didn't notice any gamepad or icon issues. It's a great fit for the deck with gamepad controls and I really enjoyed playing it on the go too.</p>
<p>Overall it's an absolutely wonderful game that's a seriously easy recommendation. The style of it is just wonderful. Even though it's turn-based with cards, it somehow almost feels like an arcade game, at least a little. With the crunchy sound design too it's all just fantastic. Really unique and inventive and absolutely crammed with content even though runs are short, I'm absolutely hooked on it. Go and grab it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Craft the ultimate deck from the 400+ unique cards and artifacts available.</li>
<li>Choose from 3 powerful mechs, each with completely distinct playstyles and mechanics.</li>
<li>Master 10 diverse pilots, each adding new cards, mechanics, and a personal backstory.</li>
<li>Use Chrono Tokens to rewind time, undo mistakes, or land that perfect combo.</li>
<li>Battle through the multi-part story campaign and uncover a secret finale.</li>
<li>Endless replayability with ascending difficulties, daily runs, and challenge modes.</li>
<li>Designed for clarity and intuition—no long tutorials, no wiki required, just pure tactical deckbuilding.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 gets NVIDIA DLSS 4 improvements and a Steam Deck / SteamOS fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 from Insomniac Games, Nixxes Software and PlayStation Publishing LLC has Patch 10 out now with some NVIDIA upgrades along with a fix for some Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>On the Steam Deck, if you initially tried loading it while offline, it would result in a persistent PlayStation Network account linking error and wouldn't let you play. Patch 10 has solved this, thankfully. You still need an internet connection to play it for the first time but at least now it won't prevent you playing in future.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The rest of the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Release Notes (1.520.0.0)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Integrated NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Transformer model for upscaling and Multi Frame Generation for supported GPUs.</li>
<li>Added option to toggle between Legacy and Transformer models for NVIDIA DLSS upscaling.</li>
<li>Added Max Generated Frames option to control the number of generated frames when using Multi Frame Generation on NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where in particular Steam Deck players who performed the initial boot while offline encountered a persistent PSN account link error message, preventing them from starting the game.</li>
<li>Stability improvements.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dune: Awakening will have BattlEye enabled for Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the release of Dune: Awakening, my one major concern with it has been swept away by the sands. Thankfully, the BattlEye anti-cheat will be enabled for players on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck to play it.</p>
<p>I've been trying to get a clear response on this for a while, even before we knew what anti-cheat system it would use. Thankfully, one of my press contacts today was able to speak to the developer directly to confirm "I'm pleased to say that that is indeed the plan" and that "Funcom are working with Steam to make this happen so rest assured".</p>
<p><em>Check out more <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat compatibility on our dedicated page</a>.</em></p>
<p>Excellent news. Would be a shame for players on Linux systems to miss out on what could end up being the biggest MMO for some time.</p>
<p>In other news, Funcom will be showing off the mid-to-end game in a livestream on May 28th across <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XSo4SPH3nA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, starting around 4PM UTC.</p>
<p>The most recent video, Dune: Awakening — Schools of the Imperium | The Mentat, shows off "A secretive and insular organization, the Order of Mentats conditions their adherents to store and analyze vast amounts of data at superhuman speeds. In Dune: Awakening, you can learn to condition your mind in this fashion to analyze the battlefield and become a master tactician and assassin"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FU9FxpHu-Ko"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4c5c2b69643ea569c5a5b84f0c7d3f6b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FU9FxpHu-Ko" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More info:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here are some of the Mentat’s early skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sentinel: Deploy a suspensor buoyed dart projector that uses motion detection to cover a field of fire. Trigger a second time to activate.</li>
<li>Poison Capsule: You have a hidden dart dispenser that fires off a specially prepared capsule filled with poisonous spores. On impact, a cloud of poison appears, building poison on all who remain within.</li>
<li>Shield Wall: You deploy a half-height Holtzman shield that provides cover during combat for you and your allies. It will also slow enemies who attempt to pass through it – giving you time to take them down.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first Mentat trainer is Samin Moro, who you will find at Riftwatch, a Harkonnen base. Show her you have what it takes to create and administer poisons and she may teach you the ways of the Mentat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do have a key request in, so hopefully I'll be able to take a look close to or after the release to see how it runs in the full game to give you a clear report.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After millennia of slumber, Vargard Nefershah mobilises her dynasty’s legions to annihilate the Adeptus Mechanicus interlopers who unknowingly settled upon her world. Across the galaxy, Magos Dominus Faustinius is summoned to bring his hard-won expertise to bear and ensure the Necrons do not succeed. The conflict soon becomes a crucible of unanticipated significance, drawing to it external actors stranger and more deadly still.</p>
<p>Two playable factions, two narrative campaigns, two highly unique play-styles and one important choice – who will you lead to victory in this arcane technological war of cold metal hatred?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game had a Native Linux version but it appears the sequel will not. So you'll need to play it with Valve's Proton. I've reached out to ask, but I fully expect it to not have a Linux port this time, the last game from Bulwark Studios didn't either.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s all the games to claim for Steam Deck / Linux from Prime Gaming as of May 23rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for May 23rd, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heroic-launcher-for-epic-gog-amazon-games-on-linux-steamos-v2-17-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on. For any games that use anti-cheat be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to see their status.</p>
<p><em>The table is sorted by the End date with those ending soon at the top.</em></p>

      <title>Multiple Warhammer games enter the GOG Preservation Program, and some games now exclusive to GOG</title>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine and Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War are getting remasters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition have been announced, refreshing two popular games bringing many enhancements to both. Both were announced recently during the latest Warhammer Skulls event.</p>
<p>For Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition there's no release date set yet. It will bring all these improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition delivers image-based lighting and upgraded unit textures, enhancing the overall presentation. Improved world lighting, unit reflections, more detailed shadows, surface gloss, and emissive lighting make for a superior experience, while retaining the classic Dawn of War feel. </p>
<p>Additionally, all units in the game have received texture upscaling of at least four times their original resolution, making for more detailed units, and a more readable experience.</p>
<p>Now on a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community, the Definitive Edition also includes an integrated Mod Manager and is compatible with over 20 years of lovingly crafted Community Mods.</p>
<p>An improved gameplay camera shows the battlefield like never before, working seamlessly on modern systems, including 4K displays. Increased draw distances make for a more cinematic experience, and the HUD and screen layout have been optimized for modern widescreen viewing.</p>

      <title>Splitgate 2 gets a Beta on Steam, works on Steam Deck but not other Linux systems for now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Splitgate 2 brings back the free to play FPS with portals from 1047 Games, with a Beta now available. However, it's another game that will not work on Desktop Linux, only the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The first game actually had a Native Linux version, with the sequel dropping that so you need to play it with Valve's Proton compatibility layer. Only if you're on a Steam Deck, that is. Buried in their support page <a href="https://support.splitgate.com/hc/en-us/articles/32048091883031-Open-Beta-FAQ#Accordion-is-splitgate-2-steam-deck-verified--3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you support Linux?</p>
<p>Linux support is still experimental internally and won’t be supported for the Open Beta, but we’re using the Steam Deck as a first step. Keep an eye out on our <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news page</a> and social media for any updates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, that's not noted in their main website <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a>, which only mentions Steam Deck.</p>
<p>If you try to launch it on Desktop Linux, like Ubuntu / Kubuntu you'll just end up seeing this error:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13089521921747989625gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's now listed on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FB6lTW04oWM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d024f99bf6df7ef7590648163d29429.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FB6lTW04oWM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I sent multiple emails to the developer well before release to speak about Linux / Steam Deck support, sadly they did not reply to any of the emails but at least we have our answer for now.</p>
<p>I'm hoping with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-big-upgrade-with-steamos-3-7-and-you-can-now-install-it-on-other-amd-handhelds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wider launch of SteamOS now available</a>, that we see less developers locking their games to the Steam Deck. Although, we may end up seeing them lock it to SteamOS directly instead.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a big upgrade with SteamOS 3.7 and you can now install it on other AMD handhelds</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just released SteamOS 3.7 to the stable channel, bringing a huge amount of improvements to the Steam Deck. This also brings official support for the Lenovo Legion Go S, as well as Valve now officially giving you the option to load SteamOS onto other AMD powered handhelds.</p>
<p>Valve have also launched a new SteamOS page, finally retiring the old SteamOS 2 from the original Steam Machine launch. A day many have been waiting for, bringing Linux gaming even more into focus, with Windows on handhelds often being a sore spot.</p>
<p>From the new SteamOS page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Does this mean I can install SteamOS on any device? </strong></p>
<p>We expect most SteamOS users to get SteamOS preinstalled on a Steam Deck or device that incorporates SteamOS. The only devices officially supported on SteamOS right now are Steam Deck and Legion Go S.<br/>
<br/>
We are working on broadening support, and with the recent updates to Steam and SteamOS, compatibility with other AMD powered PC handhelds has been improved. If you are interested in trying out SteamOS on your device and providing feedback, you can use the SteamOS Recovery Image and follow the instructions <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8778637651747988322gol1.jpg"/></p>

      <title>Deck-builder meets auto-shooter in Hordes of Fate : A Hand of Fate Adventure - demo now live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From the original creative team behind the Hand of Fate series, Hordes of Fate : A Hand of Fate Adventure is a mixture of deck-building and auto-shooting as yet another developer attempts to put their own spin on Vampire Survivor-like action.</p>
<p>I continue my quest to play every survivor-like bullet heaven game possible, and this could quite easily win me over with its nice world design along with the interesting deck-building mechanics to make it feel nice and fresh.</p>
<p>I especially like that the various encounters in the game are not all set in stone, it's all dynamic based on the cards you pick to set it all up. And, when you go to grab chests or do the encounters in the game, some of those are not a given and get you to pick from a set of cards that can result in success or failure. Some of them will give you multiple choice on the outcome too. So far, it seems like a really interesting blend that manages to feel familiar for anyone who has played a survivor-like yet different.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FqFMhr0E88o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a98f27a3a8425b1da72551bca5617d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FqFMhr0E88o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>This new title brings the franchise’s signature "cards come to life" deck-building into a fast-paced roguelite auto-shooter, complete with a deep progression system. As you play through it you can unlock new equipment, encounters, blessings, and powerful enchantments by discovering and completing encounter cards dealt into each stage. Fight through hordes of fiendish monsters and survive long enough to confront the powerful bosses in each of the game's challenges.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stack Your Deck</strong></p>
<p>Hand of Fate set the standard for deckbuilding roguelikes in 2016, and now we're allowing you to build your own autoshooter. Text encounters and quests drawn from your deck allow you to unlock Tokens and earn new cards to expand the possibilities and grow your power for each subsequent run.</p>
<p>Discover hidden encounter outcomes and earn powerful weapon enchantments that transform your equipment, branching their power in new directions and creating unique builds and playstyles, keeping each run fresh and unique based on the cards dealt and the choices you make.</p>
<p><strong>Dark Fantasy Bullet Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Defeat minions, upgrade your equipment, and delve ever deeper into the world of Hand of Fate. Collect and assemble a devastating array of weapons and enchantments, and unleash hell upon wave after wave of fearsome monsters in fast and frenetic combat.</p>
<p><strong>Heroes Call</strong></p>
<p>Unlock a collection of heroes from the Hand of Fate universe, each with their own auto-shooting weapon and perk cards that add to the deckbuilding possibilities of each run.</p>
<p>Each hero comes armed with a unique activatable weapon card that can turn the tide of battle when the course of combat and shapes their unique playstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Hand of Fate Reimagined</strong></p>
<p>Uncover new and reimagined encounters and equipment, visit new locations and play as familiar heroes from across the Hand of Fate universe, all from a top-down auto-shooter perspective.</p>
<p>Fight hordes of Hand of Fate enemies and monsters on a scale never like never before.</p>

      <title>Drop Duchy is an inventive mixture of Tetris with deck-building and combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving a really odd and unique blending of genres and game mechanics, Drop Duchy is a wonderful choice for you to pick up and play. <em>Note: key provided for me by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>Tested on Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04) with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>, it's been a perfect experience.</p>
<p>On the surface it seems very much like Tetris but it's also a deck-builder, that sprinkles in some basic combat too. At the basic level though, it's all very much about dropping blocks in the right places to build up the board in the best way possible. It can get a little complicated with all the different types of blocks but thankfully the tutorial and early gameplay is pretty great at showing you the ropes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="75RalDte2sE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/40b5c8eb7a4dd66b6d560fcb975e7003.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/75RalDte2sE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The idea here is that you go through an overworld of different nodes, each being a different type of board encounter to fill up with blocks. Some may be combat encounters, other just let you place down blocks to build up your resources to do upgrades and acquire more cards for your deck that form the blocks and eventually it all leads to boss battles.</p>
<p>Unlike say Tetris and other block-dropping games, the idea here is <em>not</em> to fill as little as possible or to remove things from the board. It reverses it by making you fill up the board completely in the way that gives you the biggest advantages in terms of gathering resources and building up your army. As you complete a whole line, the resources across that lined are then added into your totals for the current board mission. Complete multiple lines at a time and get bonuses.</p>
<p>One fun little addition is the reserve block option. At any point you can choose to reverse a specific block, instead of dropping it on the board. You can then swap this reserved block with another, if you feel the next is going to be a better fit. At the end of the round, the piece reserved will be discarded, so it's especially useful for enemy blocks to remove one from the round.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16338921101747921933gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16338921101747921933gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1575555021747921935gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1575555021747921935gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It turns it even into a very miniature city-builder due to the mechanics of dropping specific types of building blocks down, that all work together on the board to build you up. Very clever stuff in how it all comes together with the mixture of mechanics.</p>
<p>The battle system is on the basic side, but it works well with the main block-dropping mechanics here. You want to arrange the board in such a way that you get as many troops as possible across different types, all with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each troop building type gains bonus amount depending on what blocks they're placed next to, or what blocks you build up around them.</p>
<p>However, you're dropping down the enemy blocks to build up the board too. Everything here is about correct placement. It's not particularly punishing either, although it is a challenge. If you fail an encounter, it's not instant game over, since you have an overworld total health bar that you can fill back up as you play more of it to gather resources and currency as needed.</p>
<p>Once you're done and combat begins it's very much a simple game of numbers. You drag around units from point to point, either adding to each-other from your own forces or subtracting from the total based on the number of enemies at the point. Where it gets complicated is how different unit types have strengths and weaknesses, so you need to pay attention to this. Not just that, but when moving your units into a point full of a different type (say Archers and Axemen) they will combine into one type based on which type you have more of, so the order of movement is important too.</p>
<p>Combat isn't always forced either (except the boss battles), since the overworld map lets you often pick boards that don't have combat and let you focus on resources. Double-edged sword though, because avoid the combat encounters will end up making the boss battles more difficult in the end. The boss battles mix things up with their own little mini-game inside the board making them even more of a challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13429523951747921327gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13429523951747921327gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The biggest issue I have with it is the lack of an undo button, I am a repeat miss-clicker, and often I'll end up with pieces where I don't want them. It feels a bit punishing not to have this feature considering how absolutely vital the positioning is, so you have to be incredibly careful or restart the whole board. In a way, you could think it's cheating, but to me I think it's an accessibility / difficulty issue that should have been a feature of the game to give you at the very least 1 single undo.</p>
<p>Overall though it's really interesting to play, with lovely visual design and engaging game mechanics that's worth picking up. I'm terrible at Tetris but somewhat okay at this.</p>

      <title>MSI Claw handheld looks like it may get better Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A new draft patch series for the Linux kernel has been submitted, which should hopefully bring up expanded support for the MSI Claw handheld.</p>
<p>From developer Antheas Kapenekakis the<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250511204427.327558-1-lkml@antheas.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> draft patch series</a> brings the msi-wmi-platform driver into parity with the MSI Center M for Windows for all models of the MSI Claw. So this should include fan curves, power controls and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7870531211747920036gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As Kapenekakis explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This draft patch series brings into parity the msi-wmi-platform driver with the MSI Center M Windows application for the MSI Claw (all models). Unfortunately, MSI Center M and this interface do not have a discovery API, necessitating the introduction of a quirk system.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">While this patch series is fully functional and tested, there are still some issues that need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Armin notes we need to disable fan curve support by default and quirk it as well, as it is not supported on all models. However, the way PWM enable ops work, this makes it a bit difficult, so I would like some suggestions on how to rework this.</li>
<li>It turns out that to fully disable the fan curve, we have to restore the default fan values. This is also what is done on the OEM software. For this, the last patch in the series is used, which is a bit dirty.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sleep was tested with all values being preserved during S0iX (platform profile, fan curve, PL1/PL2), so we do not need suspend/resume hooks, at least for the Claw devices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's a draft there's still plenty that could change before it's accepted, merged and in a later Linux kernel release. Nice to see more work for various handhelds though, since it's a constantly expanding market. We also have work ongoing from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/manjaro-linux-lead-gives-more-info-on-the-new-zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-with-amd/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Manjaro team for the new ZOTAC ZONE with AMD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steamos-3-7-7-beta-brings-a-battery-charge-limit-option-and-improved-lenovo-legion-go-s-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve with the Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>.</p>

      <title>Embracer to spin off Coffee Stain, rebrand as Fellowship Entertainment and release 76 games in the next year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer have released their latest interim report, along with a statement on their plans to spin off Coffee Stain Group and go through a rebrand to Fellowship Entertainment.</p>
<p>With Coffee Stain, which was going by a working name of Coffee Stain &amp; Friends, they're now going to be called Coffee Stain Group. Embracer will turn them into a standalone group that will include the likes of Coffee Stain, Ghost Ship and Tuxedo Labs as well as certain studios from Amplifier Game Invest. The games under their belt include Deep Rock Galactic, Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Teardown, Valheim, and Welcome to Bloxburg.</p>
<p>This will happen by the end of 2025, which at the same time  Embracer Group AB is getting a rebrand into Fellowship Entertainment, with the previous working name being Middle Earth &amp; Friends.</p>
<p>As for game releases, there's going to be a lot. Embracer said they plan to put out 76 different games over the next year ("FY 2025/26") which includes titles like Metal Eden, Gothic 1 Remake, REANIMAL, Fellowship, Wreckreation, the next SpongeBob SquarePants game, NORSE: Oath of Blood, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core, Killing Floor 3 and Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. They also have a "handful titles yet to be announced".</p>
<p>Hopefully things will be more stable now for all the developers and other staff employed across the various companies that Embracer controls, which really is a ridiculous amount.</p>

      <title>The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller is a top premium-feeling controller</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I've been testing out the latest <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-wireless-controller/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller</a> for over a week solidly now, and I really think it's a properly great controller and a worthy successor. <em>Disclosure: the controller was sent to me for review.</em></p>
<p>Like a number of you dear readers (yeah you!), I have become something of a controller <em>collector</em>. I have various Xbox controllers, a PS4 controller, the Stadia controller, the classic Steam Controller and the list goes on. I also happen to have the first 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless Controller, which until the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller came along, was my absolute go-to for all gaming that didn't force my to pick up my mouse.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6060672061747910292gol1.jpg"/><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20810603001747910291gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As always, I'm not someone to bury the lede or extend articles with completely unnecessary fluff. I'm not paid by the word here (i'm <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paid by you</a>!). So let's get the message clear — this is an excellent controller, and if you're in need of a good wireless controller that isn't crazy expensive, then this is an ideal choice.</p>
<p>Thanks to Steam and Steam Input, and all the work Valve do to ensure devices work great on Linux, this controller is plug and play in both 2.4G mode and Bluetooth, with no issues in any of the games I've been blasting through over the last week. Steam detects it and away you go. This was tested on Kubuntu 25.04 and SteamOS (Steam Deck).</p>
<p>Everything about it just feels so damn good. It might not make me a better gamer, as I hide away on Easy difficult, but it sure makes me feel better about it.</p>
<p>The TMR Joysticks feel extremely responsive and smooth, and I especially like the feel of the triggers with the switch on the back to adjust them between linear Hall Effect triggers and non-linear tactile triggers. The triggers are smoother than the original and a bit longer too. Not a big fan of the new louder click on the shoulder buttons compared to the original though, I actually prefer the muted bump on the original, the shoulder buttons on this are <em>loud</em>. The refined D-pad feels a lot better too, it's still smooth for you to roll your fingers over, but there's a much clearer and more satisfying click on each button now. As for the ABXY buttons, they feel exactly the same as the original, which is fine because they already felt perfect.</p>
<p>What is a TMR Joystick anyway? Well, in the most simple terms: traditional controllers can wear out pretty quickly due to the direct physical contacts. Hall Effect is a big upgrade using magnets and electrical current, which should prevent wear-down and stick-drift. You can think of TMR as another upgrade over that, supposedly making them even more accurate and use less power too. And in this case, they feel amazing.</p>
<p>How does it compare to the original? Well, there's the problem. The original was already a damn good controller. This is just that but — even better. Unless you're a truly seasoned gamer, you might not tell a huge difference when it comes to the sticks and the triggers, but overall it is a nice big improvement for how it feels and how long it should actually last you (which is super important), it shouldn't wear out as quickly as other controllers. To be clear, my original was a personal purchase and while I still love it this is clearly superior in basically every way.</p>
<p>As for battery life, that hasn't been an issue at all. It hasn't run out a single time during my long lengths of gameplay. With the charging dock that comes with it, simply slotting it easily on top ensures it's always charged and ready to go. It's still probably the nicest controller dock I've ever used. No fiddling, you just drop it on top and away it goes charging.</p>

<p>There are, however, some <em>problems</em> with it that are unique to using it on Linux (and so Steam Deck / SteamOS systems). Starting with firmware updates, which you cannot do on Linux systems. For a while 8BitDo did put some earlier controller firmware updates on the <a href="https://fwupd.org/ " rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a> but they seemingly gave up and stopped doing that. So you need Windows for that. <em>Very Annoying.</em></p>
<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Wireless Controller comes with some extra buttons. There's one each side on the back where your fingers rest, and also an additional one each side next to the triggers / shoulder buttons. Sadly, you also won't be able to configure or use the extra buttons on it with Steam, at least not <em>yet</em>. It seems we should hopefully be getting that sometime soon though, as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/8bitdo-ultimate-2-is-getting-full-steam-input-support-for-more-buttons/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve appear to be working on it</a>. <em>Although, this might only be in Bluetooth mode.</em></p>
<p>Since their software is Windows-only, you also cannot configure the RGB LEDs or do any of the fine-tuning their software allows. Not that I've needed to do anything mind you but worth mentioning. There is a button on the device to change the LED colour though, but only a few select options built-in to cycle through and turn the LEDs off. The lighting is just fluff that brings down the battery though, you might as well turn it off. I'll admit though, the mode where the rings change based on your input direction on the sticks and d-pad looks quite cool.</p>
<p>It's also quite fun to see that 8BitDo have been contributing to Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), the popular cross-platform open source development library. They've been <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/12661" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">submitting code</a> to hook up support for this very controller, <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/12693" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">and again</a> and <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/12964" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">other controllers too</a>. So eventually it will be real easy for developers to fully support their devices.</p>
<p>One last little gripe, their naming is terrible. We have the Ultimate, Ultimate 2, Ultimate 2C, Ultimate 3-mode, Ultimate 2 Bluetooth and so on for support across different systems and button layouts. <em>It all gets rather confusing. </em></p>
<p>Overall: it's a very sturdy and truly premium on the look and feel with a very reasonable price considering all the features you get from it. At this pricing (£49.99 / $59.99), it's probably the best you can get. Great stuff from 8BitDo.</p>

      <title>Try out the Steam Playtest for Gobutiko and become the greatest dice-rolling goblin merchant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the upcoming game Gobutiko you are a goblin merchant, and of course being greedy you will haggle with your customers by rolling dice to wear them down and push the prices (hopefully) in your favour. The developer recently launched the first Steam Playtest, which has a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>More about it: "Leave behind your broken home, and live out your dream of becoming a merchant! As luck would have it, there's a Merchant Guild in a nearby village looking for fresh talent. Haggle your way into riches and prove to everyone that even a Goblin can be a great merchant!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="55hbj8lXpmM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/32be6ae4f6e21bc033d46b3948894050.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/55hbj8lXpmM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Haggle with the customers - To get the best deals you'll need to use your dice to pressure your customers into losing their composure and making it easier to push the prices in your favor. But be careful, they just might return the favor! Losing composure will force your shop to close early (can't have you yelling at your customers).</li>
<li>Customize your dice pool - Successfully selling an item multiple times will grant you effects that can be used to improve your haggling dice! When attached to your dice, these can change your roll values and/or add bonuses when used under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Build your shop - Not enough space? Tear down some walls! With your handy Build Kit, you can change your shop walls and floors until you've got just the right layout! Update your look by purchasing new walls and floor tiles from your local Merchant Guild.</li>
<li>Decorate - Fashion is the real end-game right? Show off your amazing taste to all your customers or sell it all and live in the woods. We won't judge! (Villagers might though)</li>
<li>Recruit new merchants to the guild - Invest your hard earned coin with the guild to help attract other merchants! Each new merchant will use their expertise to improve the village and bring new merchandise for you to sell in your shop.</li>
<li>Hang out at your local tavern - Relax at your local tavern every once in a while. Buy some food, relax at the bar, and chat with the locals! You might just learn about upcoming market trends. </li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in Early Access, the action-RPG adventure Katana Dragon from Tsunoa Games recently added Native Linux and Steam Deck support. It originally launched on March 28th, with the Linux version being added May 16th.</p>
<p>More about it: "Katana Dragon is an action, adventure and dungeon exploration RPG, where you play as the ninjas Shin and Nobi in their quest to end the curse that hangs on Sogen. Learn ninja skills, upgrade your Dragon Gems, equip the Cursed Seals and level up. Avoid traps, solve puzzles and fight powerful enemies. Your ninja way begins!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eSy6XcCLLt4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/07f47a01bce441d735eba3719781cfed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eSy6XcCLLt4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>EXPLORE A VAST WORLD - The beautiful lands of Sogen are waiting to be discovered. The whole map, their secrets, the challenges and even the dungeons have been hand designed.</li>
<li>MASTER NINJA SKILLS - Learn new ninja skills that will help you solve puzzles, defeat enemies and even reach new areas and discover their secrets.</li>
<li>FIGHT AGAINST ENEMIES - Fight against Gokais, powerful creatures capable of breathing fire, biting or even flying. Will you be able to register them all in your Gokairium?</li>
<li>DIVE INTO DUNGEONS - Explore dungeons, wells and caves to find treasures and test your training. Walk through rooms, avoid their traps, and fight against bosses in epic battles.</li>
<li>CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOOK - Change your appearance with different outfits: kimonos, armors, hats, masks, dresses and much more.</li>
<li>EQUIP &amp; UPGRADE YOUR DRAGON GEMS - Boost your stats using the power contained in Dragon Gems. Get them in different forms, sets, and rarities to suit your combat style.</li>
<li>BEWARE WITH CURSED SEALS - Cursed Seals are powerful but dangerous items which you can benefit from their power as you deal with their curse. No pain, no gain!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been almost completely overlooked, with only 7 Steam user reviews, but those early reviews sound very positive on how they feel about the game.</p>

      <title>Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS now listed for purchase in the UK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As the release of the Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS is approaching, multiple retailers now have it listed in the UK ready for delivery. Valve are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steamos-3-7-7-beta-brings-a-battery-charge-limit-option-and-improved-lenovo-legion-go-s-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still working on SteamOS support for it though</a>, which is perhaps just a little worrying as seems like it's coming out of the gate pretty hot.</p>
<p>Today I spotted it now live for sale in the UK across these stores below.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Lenovo direct:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/handheld/legion-go-series/legion-go-s/83l3003auk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z2 Go (1TB)</a> - £600</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/p/handheld/legion-go-series/legion-go-s-powered-by-steamos/83n6001nuk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z1 Extreme (1TB)</a> - £699</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Lenovo list both models with 32GB RAM. Lenovo also haven't correctly updated the page for the Z2 Go SteamOS version yet. It says it has SteamOS but the rest of the store page is just like the Windows version, whereas the Z1 Extreme properly lists SteamOS in the full info outside the specifications. Seems like they're still sorting the store pages.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Very:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.very.co.uk/lenovo-legion-go-s-steamos-handheld-pc-gaming-console-8in-wuxga-amd-ryzen-z2-go-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd/1601158643.prd" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z2 Go (1TB)</a> - £549</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Very list it with 16GB RAM.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Currys:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://business.currys.co.uk/catalogue/tv-entertainment/gaming/gaming-consoles/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-gaming-console-amd-ryzen-z2-go-512-gb-ssd-grey/N548198W?from=category&amp;heat=title" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z2 Go (5125GB)</a> - £498.99</li>
<li><a href="https://business.currys.co.uk/catalogue/tv-entertainment/gaming/gaming-consoles/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-gaming-console-amd-ryzen-z2-go-1-tb-ssd-grey/N530516W?from=category&amp;heat=title" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ryzen Z2 Go (1TB)</a> - £549</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Currys list both models with 16GB RAM. Curiously, they only list them on their Business store, not the normal store.</em></p>
<p>While it's good to see more devices with Linux beginning to ship, I really think the mixture of different specifications makes it more confusing for consumers.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.7 Beta brings a Battery Charge Limit option and improved Lenovo Legion Go S support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released SteamOS 3.7.7 Beta "Sunny &amp; Gizmo" with the noted changes including the new Battery Charge Limit option along with more work for the Lenovo Legion Go S.</p>
<p>A bit confusing this one, since Valve say in this SteamOS Beta how it includes the Battery Charge Limit option, which was actually rolled out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-battery-charge-limit-control-in-the-latest-beta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in May via a Steam Deck Beta Client update</a>. Presumably then, this is work directly in SteamOS to support it for more devices.</p>
<p>Valve are also working right up against the clock here for the Legion Go S, since the SteamOS version is due to launch really soon. From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/820329049655084698" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added Battery Charge Limit control to Settings -&gt; Power.
	<ul>
<li>This option allows you to set a maximum charge limit for your Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Limiting the charge limit to 80% can be beneficial for long term battery health. This can be useful if your Steam Deck is constantly being charged (e.g. docked), or very rarely has its battery depleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the performance overlay could spuriously appear and could not be disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where exiting a game from the overlay could result in the UI getting stuck until a button is pressed.</li>
<li>Desktop mode will no longer erroneously nag the user to install power profiles daemon.</li>
<li>Added support for updating controller and system firmware on the Legion Go S.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This update is available via the Beta and Preview channels in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s some Steam Deck Verified games coming in 2025 to get excited about</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As we enter the midpoint of 2025, you might be curious to know what upcoming games are Steam Deck Verified. I've looked under every rock on Steam and found a bunch you may want to add to your wishlist.</p>
<p>Being Steam Deck Verified means they should also run great on Desktop Linux and other SteamOS systems too. Although, do take the Verified with a pinch of salt on performance.</p>
<p>To make things easy for you the list is sorted so those coming sooner are at the top. Not the easiest list to do, since Valve don't actually test all that many games before they are released. There will no doubt be many more, but most get checked <em>after</em> release.</p>

<h4>Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition</h4>
<p>Date: Unannounced, take with a bigger pinch of salt.</p>
<p>The game itself hasn't even been announced yet, so we have no real details here but it has leaked multiple times and was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-rated-steam-deck-verified-but-still-no-official-announcement-that-it-exists/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified back in April</a>. So it's coming, it's Verified but we really don't know when. Technically, it doesn't even exist yet but clearly it's on the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18499660861747852482gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Note: their Steam Deck Verified rating was correct at time of publishing, but it's entirely possible some ratings may change before they are released.</p>

      <title>FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time is out today and Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>LEVEL5 Inc. are releasing FANTASY LIFE i: The Girl Who Steals Time today and the good news is that it's Steam Deck Verified. So it will work great on Desktop Linux and other SteamOS systems. The game does have Easy Anti-Cheat, which they've clearly enabled and so it's listed on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? A curious mixture of elements from the likes of Animal Crossing and Zelda, an action-adventure RPG wrapped up in a very cosy style with solo and online co-op play (supports Steam Remote Play Together) with an open-world setting. Their "Life" system sounds interesting, with 14 different jobs available in the game that you can switch between any time, with each having their own progression.</p>
<p>You can get an overview of the features in their previous video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="alqHzDtQvhE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3bc6c1d433863c8763ede8bf3fc28d9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/alqHzDtQvhE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For people who have played it during Advanced Access, a nice change to the multiplayer is being made with today's update to it so that "progress can be made on accepted quests even during multiplayer sessions" which was a pretty big oversight.</p>
<p>Looks like an incredibly sweet RPG, with the pre-release Steam user reviews already giving it a "Very Positive" rating.</p>

      <title>The latest HELLDIVERS 2 update is going to suck away lots of hours and it&#39;s discounted</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arrowhead Game Studios have just launched a major update to the popular co-op shooter HELLDIVERS 2, and with that there's many new enemies to face along with more customization options.</p>
<p>The game is still running rather nicely on Linux too, with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> being enabled for Linux since the original release. Not just that, but it's also <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/helldivers-2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">31% off on Fanatical</a> right now during their big sale which might actually be the lowest price for it so far.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Illuminate faction enemies.</li>
<li>New Weapon Customizations and Progression.</li>
<li>Crash fixes.</li>
<li>Weapon fixes.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous fixes.</li>
</ul>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MmXtgHs2ODg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b16c4a3dd9c571dff53d0dbc77199bc8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MmXtgHs2ODg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>I've put a ridiculous amount of hours into HELLDIVERS 2 at this point and I'm going to play a lot more thanks to this update. I still think they have one of the best implementations of a "battle pass" compared to most other games, with no time-limited silliness and they stick around so you can claim stuff from them whenever you wish.</p>
<p>Have you been playing it on Linux recently? How's your experience been?</p>

      <title>NVIDIA release fresh details on their current Wayland support and future plans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have put up a new official forum post going over the level of Wayland support available in their current Linux drivers, along with what future plans they have. This replaces the post they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/nvidia-detail-upcoming-linux-driver-features-for-wayland-and-explain-current-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">detailed last year</a>, with new information based on their current 575 driver series.</p>
<p>It's mainly going over the differences in support for features between Wayland and X11.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The important bits from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following features will not be supported on Wayland or Xwayland:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stereo rendering using GLX/EGL/Vulkan</li>
<li>Implicit SLI Mosaic
	<ul>
<li>This feature refers to when an application presents to a virtual display which is tiled across multiple physical displays.</li>
<li>Please see below for how “Explicit SLI” will be supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nvidia-settings will not offer same level of configuration.
	<ul>
<li>There is no cross-compositor method for configuration that would allow nvidia-settings to manage displays on Wayland as it does on X11. nvidia-settings will still provide details about the system and power usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following features will instead be available through <strong>Vulkan Direct to Display</strong> (VK_KHR_Display):</p>
<ul>
<li>Stereo rendering
	<ul>
<li>VK_KHR_multiview provides optimization for drawing multiple viewports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vulkan Explicit SLI
	<ul>
<li>Will be supported through VK_KHR_device_group</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Swap Groups
	<ul>
<li>Supported by VK_NV_present_barrier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Frame Lock and Genlock</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As for future plans, there's no time-frame for any of it and some of it depends on future upgrades to Wayland and its protocols to support it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's what NVIDIA want to do at some point:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>nvidia-drm modeset=1 parameter set by default</li>
<li>Display multiplexers (muxes) are typically used in laptops with both integrated and discrete GPUs to provide a direct connection between the discrete GPU and the built-in display (internal mux) or an external display (external mux). On X11, the display mux can be automatically switched when a full-screen application is running on the discrete GPU, enabling enhanced display features and improved performance, but no Wayland compositors currently support this functionality.</li>
<li>Advanced display pipeline features including warp and blend, pixel shift, and the COLOR_ENCODING/COLOR_RANGE plane properties.
	<ul>
<li>These features may be exposed through DRM properties to allow compositors to use them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>nvidia-drm Presentation Timing information.</li>
<li>VDPAU support on Wayland.</li>
<li>vGPU support on Wayland.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>The Wandering Village 1.0 due in July with a price rise coming real soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stray Fawn Studio just announced that The Wandering Village, a city-builder on the back of a giant walking creature, will fully release on July 17th.</p>
<p>It's currently 30% off until May 27th, and after that the price is planned to increase to $29.99 so you might want to lock it in now to save quite a bit on it. Great time too, with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/city-building-on-the-back-of-a-huge-creature-the-wandering-village-gets-a-big-story-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released story update</a> that expanded the game quite a lot.</p>
<p>They said that feature-wise, the current build is what will be in the 1.0 release. Right now they're focused on bug-fixing and quality to ensure a good release. However, the 1.0 release is not the end, as they plan to add plenty more content post-release. The "Onbu Update" was teased for after launch which will "further deepen how you can interact with Onbu" (the big creature you're building on top of).</p>
<p>A brand new trailer to show it off was also released:</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Project Lead of Manjaro Linux, Philip Müller, has given a status update with more info on their partnership with ZOTAC on the new prototype ZOTAC GAMING ZONE handheld.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-getting-a-ryzen-ai-9-hx-370-prototype-with-a-manjaro-linux-based-os/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ZOTAC gave a very brief announcement</a> of the new prototype ZONE that will come with an AMD CPU, which they've now been showing off during COMPUTEX.</p>
<p>From what we've learned it will have an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor with Radeon 890M graphics. Either 24GB or 32GB RAM with a 1TB SSD (M2 2280 NVMe). This includes a 7" AMOLED 1080p multi-touch display with HDR, Hall Effect joysticks and triggers, a 48.5Wh battery, a built-in kick-stand and shipping with Manjaro Linux instead of Windows.</p>
<p>What I missed, is that Müller from Manjaro made an official <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/development-q-a-zotac-gaming-zone/177928" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forum post</a> going over the partnership, like how they met with ZOTAC at Computex 2024 and Gamescom Cologne 2024 to discuss it. Things got going in January 2025 with more discussions and the Manjaro team have been working since March 2025 to get the needed Linux kernel drivers in place. They're currently working on porting the ZOTAC One Launcher to Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9942580281747823881gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>At the current stage they have most of the hardware working on Linux but they're still working on adding "missing functions to Zotac One Overlay" and porting the ZOTAC One Launcher to Linux.</p>
<p>Sounds like Manjaro are going the SteamOS route with their Linux version designed for handhelds, with a focus on Flatpaks for additional software along with KDE Plasma for the desktop mode along with it being an immutable OS.</p>
<p>As for when to expect it, they're currently aiming for a global Q3 2025 launch. Müller said they're working closely with AMD and ZOTAC, with plans to speak to Valve "in a later state of the project", presumably to ensure correct licensing to have Steam installed and configured out of the box.</p>
<p>ZOTAC themselves are still yet to put up any proper details of it on their website. ZOTAC also haven't replied to my press request about it.</p>

      <title>AMD announce the Radeon RX 9060 XT and a big FSR 4 &#39;Redstone&#39; upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun news coming out of Computex 2025 with AMD revealing two models of the Radeon RX 9060 XT, along with a big upgrade for FSR 4 named 'Redstone'.</p>
<p>AMD didn't give exactly much on the Radeon RX 9060 XT, with the press details on it being rather light. The basics specs and pricing for the cards are below:</p>

</div>
<p>For availability their original press announcement simply said it will be "later this year". However, during their actual livestream of Computex and their press materials sent over they said they will begin to be available on June 5th. This will include cards from the likes of Acer, ASRock, ASUS, Gigabyte, PowerColor, Sapphire, Vastarmor, XFX and Yeston.</p>
<p>Sounds like a reasonable card, with AMD claiming it will be at around 6% faster than the NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti across 40 games tested "without upscaling or frame generation".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/514392831747844839gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/514392831747844839gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17497838621747844838gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17497838621747844838gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Designed to unlock ultra-smooth gaming at 1440p, the Radeon RX 9060 XT is built for players who expect more. Equipped with up to 16GB of GDDR6 memory and 32 AMD RDNA 4 compute units, the GPU doubles ray tracing throughput compared to the previous generation, providing gamers with more realistic lighting, shadows, and reflections that bring virtual worlds to life.</p>
<p>Second-generation AI accelerators power features like FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4), which uses machine learning to boost frame rates and image fidelity under even the most demanding rendering conditions. HYPR-RX delivers a full suite of optimizations, including Radeon Super Resolution and Fluid Motion Frames for lightning-fast response times and immersive, tear-free visuals. With support for FP8 data types and structured sparsity, the RX 9060 XT is ready for the next generation of AI-assisted gameplay, creative tools, and generative experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for AMD FSR 4's Redstone update, it sounds rather promising, as AMD continue trying to catch up to NVIDIA. It's still for RDNA4 only, since it was designed for their latest generation of cards. It will include "Neural Radiance Caching", "Machine Learning Ray Generation" and "Machine Learning Frame Generation".</p>
<p>FSR 4 should be available in over 60 game titles by June 5th according to AMD.</p>

      <title>Latest Steam update fixes Steam Deck controller issues, plus numerous bugfixes for Desktop Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest stable Steam Client update for all platforms bringing numerous important bug fixes to Steam Deck and Desktop Steam.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods cross-platform app v0.11.1 brings full Cyberpunk 2077 support for Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods team just launched the latest update to their in-development cross-platform open source Nexus Mods app. This is the one that will eventually replace Vortex, and now it has full Cyberpunk 2077 support.</p>
<p>Support for Cyberpunk 2077 in the previous release was a "soft launch", but now they feel it's good enough for everyone to get modding. So it sits alongside Stardew Valley as the two main supported games currently. The rest (Baldur's Gate 3 and Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord) are hidden behind an experimental option you can enable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5887447181747757044gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As a reminder for Cyberpunk 2077 it offers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with the Steam and GOG Galaxy releases on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>Support for the most common types of mod: REDmod, archives, REDscript, and framework mods (e.g. Cyber Engine Tweaks).</li>
<li>Support for collections.</li>
<li>Health Check diagnostics for missing dependencies.</li>
<li>Health Check diagnostics to help set up a Linux environment to mod the game.</li>
<li>REDmod Load Order management and deployment.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more changes in this version including the new and improved load order tab for REDmod, and lots of smaller improvements to the UI flow to make modding easier than ever.</p>
<p>I'm especially happy about their focus on making Linux / SteamOS / Steam Deck modding as easy as possible, something we've been lacking for a long time. Like including proper instructions for Linux systems:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14466420961747757081gol1.png"/></p>
<p>All the rest of the changelog below:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>More Features</h4>
<ul>
<li>Updated the Health Check messages for Cyberpunk 2077 to match the structure of other diagnostic messages.</li>
<li>When hovering the cursor to resize panels, a solid line will now appear to better indicate which panel will be adjusted.</li>
<li>The app now has its own minimise, maximise and close buttons, removing the operating system "chrome" and saving more vertical space.</li>
<li>The tab bar is now hidden until there are at least two tabs in a panel.</li>
<li>Tabs can now be closed with a middle click.</li>
<li>Added mod thumbnails to the load order page.</li>
<li>Increased resilience to network errors during downloads.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technical Changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>On Linux, the app will only register itself as the default Nexus Mods download handler when not installed with a package manager.</li>
<li>Replaced the Stardew Valley preview UI elements with game-agnostic versions.</li>
<li>Added the core backend frameworks required for the "Undo" feature.</li>
<li>Added the core backend frameworks to allow the app to create and share collections.</li>
<li>Improved the stability of downloads by requesting the entire file rather than using range requests.</li>
<li>Use the recent rating for collections instead of "All time".</li>
<li>The app will now send headers with Nexus Mods requests to allow us to better track mod manager usage.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Games can be unmanaged via the command line (thanks to Michael-Kowata on GitHub).</li>
<li>Fixed missing colours to represent added, removed, or changed files on the Preview Changes page.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the app could end up in a state where the Apply button was not visible but the Launch button was disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the app would unnecessarily backup files during an Apply, leading to long processing times.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where the Apply action would not work correctly if two files have the same minimal hash.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when snapping to full screen with multiple panels open.</li>
<li>Fixed "No game installed with active loadout" error that occurred when a loadout had not been applied since managing the game.</li>
<li>When un-managing a game, loadouts for that game will be hidden to prevent a crash when trying to access them.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug where the app may incorrectly treat Premium users as free users if the app had been open for over an hour.</li>
<li>The app will now correctly close all background processes when exiting. This was preventing the UI from re-opening and blocking users on Linux from shutting down their system without manually killing the process.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Known Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Collection success ratings will sometimes not match what is shown on the website.</li>
<li>The Epic Games release of Cyberpunk 2077 is detected but not supported.</li>
<li>The app will attempt to run the REDmod.exe even if it is not installed, resulting in an error message.</li>
<li>The sort order for some columns does not work as expected.</li>
<li>The game version is not checked when adding a collection, meaning you can install outdated mods without being warned.</li>
<li>The table header sorting and active tab states are not saved and are reset each time the view is loaded.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Celebrating 10 years, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and older titles are heavily discounted</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you've still not had the chance to grab The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, now is your best bet with the 10th anniversary celebration giving huge discounts. CD PROJEKT RED have put the game, and the older titles in the series, on some of the best discounts they've ever had.</p>
<p>There's also a fancy new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TWOkT7l0yWQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2aa280c2a698ccb6a741431a6b06f555.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TWOkT7l0yWQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Celebrations also included an anniversary edition of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlRkbwmlNsg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">REDstreams</a>, which took place May 19th and featured Geralt’s voice actor Doug Cockle, alongside English Adaptation Director Borys Pugacz-Muraszkiewicz. The voice actor took a walk down memory lane, reminiscing on his time as the voice of Geralt, his experience with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and how the role has impacted him over the years.</p>
<p>The Witcher in Concert is also gearing up to introduce attendees to a one-of-a-kind live event featuring an ensemble orchestra and a blend of cutting-edge visuals and gameplay. Two anniversary celebrations are planned: Boston on May 31 and Poznań on June 15. All of this will lead up to the official tour kickoff at gamescom in Cologne on August 20, with tickets for the European leg of the tour already available for purchase on the official Witcher in Concert <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/pl/en/concert" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="">website</a>. New dates and locations will be revealed in the future, with newsletter subscribers receiving access to all official pre-sales.</p>
<p>The base game is 90% off across GOG and Steam (best-ever discount, but has been that low before). And it's 80% off for the complete edition. So you can get the full thing for about £7. An <em>absolute steal</em> for such a huge and engrossing game.</p>
<p>Works great on Desktop Linux with Proton and is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve.</p>
<p>A deal not to miss.</p>

      <title>RoadCraft runs surprisingly well on Steam Deck and great on Desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>RoadCraft is about to release from Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment, their next-gen heavy-machinery simulation and sandbox game from the team behind the popular SnowRunner and MudRunner. The good news - it runs on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. <em>Note: key provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<p>What is it? A calm slow-paced simulation game where you run a disaster recovery company restoring various sites devastated by natural disasters. Your tasks will involve clearing debris, rebuilding entire roads and bridges and getting your vehicles unstuck as you'll be dealing with some pretty terrible conditions often. There's some big differences to the previous games like Snowrunner with no fuel to worry about or damage, so it's not quite as hardcore and a bit more welcoming (and certainly easier to get into).</p>
<p>So in RoadCraft the main emphasis is about the journey, and finding the best route forwards using the best tools for the job. Often, multiple vehicles will be needed to complete a task and so it all builds up as you progress through. Getting stuck in the mud is still a huge pain in the ass though. But entertaining when you try all sorts of tricks to get unstuck.</p>
<p><em>Click the article images below to enlarge them.</em></p>
<h4>Steam Deck</h4>
<p>My testing was done on the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steamos-3-7-5-for-steam-deck-now-in-beta-with-big-upgrades-and-initial-support-for-more-hardware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS Beta 3.7.5</a>, since it's approaching release as the next stable version. Considering how big the changes are, I felt it didn't make sense to stick with the much older stable SteamOS release (but I checked, and it did run on SteamOS 3.6.24). The game is confirmed to work with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>, but then I switched to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a> since again, that should release soon as the new stable Proton version.</p>
<p>Don't go expecting incredible performance here though, this is a time to firmly keep expectations in check. Like a lot of bigger recent releases this is a game you'll be looking at 30FPS on the Steam Deck, with everything set to Low visuals. However, compared to some other big recent releases, I'm amazed it works to this level. Especially nice, since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/sadly-the-roadcraft-demo-is-currently-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo didn't work at all</a> originally. <em>No extras needed here, it was click and play.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5908707761747741084gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5908707761747741084gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15042860201747741083gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15042860201747741083gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I've seen numerous times where performance <em>can</em> go above 30FPS, if you set the in-game FPS limit to 60FPS, but it's far more stable and enjoyable if you just keep it to the set 30FPS in-game limit. I found there was a fair bit more stuttering at times unless I kept it to 30FPS. No matter what, there's still some traversal stutter when driving around as you pop through new areas, but it mostly smoothens out quite quickly, the drops are very momentary.</p>
<p>Turning off the FPS counter and just letting myself get absorbed by it was a wonderful experience — except the times where I forgot to put the handbrake on, put the Steam Deck down to have a drink or a bite to eat, and came back to find my vehicle had rolled into the mud and gotten stuck. Woops.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2781641881747744517gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2781641881747744517gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20129716891747744518gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20129716891747744518gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I'm impressed on how clear the game UI is here on Steam Deck, it really feels like a great fit for it. Everything is nice and readable out of the box with no tweaks needed. There's no UI or text sizing options though, not that I've needed them, but that would have been a nice addition to have for those that do need things just a bit bigger.</p>
<p>Even with lots of different controls, with each vehicle being quite different, it was clearly made with gamepad controls in mind too. They're all clearly shown on-screen and after a while it's pretty easy to get the hang of all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3159972011747746742gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3159972011747746742gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13455019091747749141gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13455019091747749141gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>For the exact settings I've been testing on Steam Deck with:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18533464031747738408gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18533464031747738408gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10141045911747738409gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10141045911747738409gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>These are all the <em>defaults</em> the game gave on Steam Deck, which <em>seem</em> to be the best way to play it. The Deck really can't handle bumping much of these up at all. Which is not surprising really. Even with details set to Low and FSR3 set to Performance, the visuals are still pretty good here, far better than a number of other bigger titles to the point that I've not had an issue with how it looks on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>What has surprised me is the battery life. On the Steam Deck OLED, you get a pretty reasonable 2.5+ hours. On the Steam Deck LCD it's just under 2 hours. So you'll still want to keep a charger or battery pack close by but very reasonable for this type of bigger game.</p>
<p>I would expect Valve to rate this as Steam Deck Playable as you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard to enter in any names. Apart from that though, everything else pretty much worked as expected with a mostly stable 30FPS experience. <em><strong>Update</strong>: just as I clicked publish, Valve set it as Steam Deck Playable.</em></p>
<h4>Desktop Linux</h4>
<p>Considering how it runs on Steam Deck, there's not a whole lot extra to say about Desktop Linux here. Testing again with the <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>, the game runs well although I did notice some minor graphical artifacts in places which may be due to the Mesa version used. On my Kubuntu 25.04 setup with AMD Ryzen 5800X, with the Radeon RX 6800 XT on Mesa 25.0.3 the performance has been great.</p>
<p><u>NVIDIA</u>: if you have an NVIDIA GPU, there's currently a driver bug with the game so it won't run out of the box. You can use <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/pyroveil/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pyroveil</a> to work around it and hopefully get it launching. As noted by the VKD3D-Proton developer on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8694#issuecomment-2893555768" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Back to AMD…it looks fantastic! Ultra settings with AMD FSR3 Native (just AA):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13703237731747753216gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13703237731747753216gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then AMD FSR3 Quality:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9642285601747753281gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9642285601747753281gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's barely a difference in visual quality, but a clear performance difference. And then with Frame Generation turned on, it's about double the performance:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19779592781747753366gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19779592781747753366gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>In motion, I cannot tell a difference with AMD FSR3 Frame Generation turned on, so the performance benefit there is great while being able to keep the graphics cranked up to Ultra where it looks awesome as you sort the roads out.</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p><em>The only part not tested was online co-op play due to the preview period but I don't foresee any issues there since there's no <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> nuisances here.</em></p>
<p>Part of what makes this one real interesting is that it's not all about you. While you're doing a lot of the work, you're then setting up routes for AI vehicles to travel through to deliver various goods. Spectating them as they go through your planned routes that you've sorted and cleared is so satisfying, although the AI drivers are complete <em>morons</em> and get stuck on the smallest obstacles. They will not try to avoid anything at all (including trying to drive through you), so you often spend a lot of time micro-managing your newly placed routes. Once you get a good route going for the first time after clearing everything and rebuilding though, it's lovely to see your work in action.</p>
<p>At its heart, RoadCraft is as much a puzzle game with you figuring out how to overcome every tiny little obstacle, as it is a challenging driving and mini-construction sim. If you liked Snowrunner or Mudrunner, you will most likely enjoy this although keeping in mind some parts of the sim have been simplified.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0YxFJTFi0Os"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b189e5184fda8816cfbd5dd6e035dc3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0YxFJTFi0Os" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Roadcraft is very much a game for people who have a lot of free time to get stuck in the mud, and you will, if you're an idiot like me. On both Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, it has been quite an enjoyable experience, although frustrating when you spend a bit too much time getting stuck. Very much like Snowrunner, you need to bring along a healthy dose of patience.</p>

      <title>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition is out now, needs a workaround on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GSC Game World have released the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition now which includes S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chornobyl - Enhanced Edition, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Clear Sky - Enhanced Edition and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat - Enhanced Edition.</p>
<p>If you own the originals, you should receive the new editions for free. The Enhanced Editions also include the originals.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AVWkOx4Cj6g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4900cb606d0aec6b927d8a7e6f37d983.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AVWkOx4Cj6g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Each game comes with an assortment of upgrades including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Atmospheric visual enhancements including God Rays, Dynamic Screen Space Reflections, and Advanced Global Illumination effects.</li>
<li>Redesigned water shaders, upgraded skyboxes, and wetness effects.</li>
<li>Improved visuals with upscaled textures featuring more detailed NPCs and environment.</li>
<li>Upgraded weapon Field of View and models.</li>
<li>Multiple bugfixes and quality of life tweaks.</li>
<li>Full gamepad support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This also makes the series a much better fit on the Steam Deck too. Plus there's also Steam Workshop support and Cloud Saves as well.</p>
<p>The only one I actually own is S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat, so that's what I picked for some testing today, along with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10 Beta</a>. Early reports from players on Steam have pushed all three Enhanced Editions rapidly into "Mostly Negative". Many noting it's a "blurry mess", so I wanted to see what's going on.</p>
<p>On <strong>Desktop Linux</strong>, the game will not run out of the box, and ends up giving a black screen with this error:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20538914521747749867gol1.png"/></p>
<p>You can get around that by spoofing a Steam Deck, using this launch option:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>On <strong>Steam Deck</strong> however, the game does work out of the box.</p>
<p>Once getting into S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Prypiat - Enhanced Edition and fiddling with some settings here's some unfiltered shots of it on Max settings at 2560x1440. Running on Kubuntu 25.04, AMD Ryzen 5800X, Radeon RX 6800 XT on Mesa 25.0.3:</p>

<p>To me, the game doesn't look particularly blurry, certainly not to the level the Steam user reviews are suggesting. There's some slight blurry bits the further you are away but the picture is overall quite clear. And on Max settings, it seems to run well enough on Desktop Linux. Even with the enhancements though, I would have expected performance to be a fair bit higher than it is.</p>

      <title>Steel Swarm: APOCALYPSE is a tank-battling MOBA set for Early Access in June</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steel Swarm: APOCALYPSE is an upcoming tank-battling MOBA that I'm pretty excited about for the huge battles and map destruction. And now the developer has revealed it's set to release in Early Access on June 24th.</p>
<p>I previously covered this one <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/steel-swarm-apocalypse-is-a-tank-battling-destructive-moba-that-will-have-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in April</a>, when they announced full Steam Deck support. Seems they're going a step further now, since they're also noting Linux support in the release <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199180/view/800062851651732420" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kx-u_InH0SY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65d0ead0be6490c85135f6e9590895a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kx-u_InH0SY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I like that it sounds quite different to other MOBAs. Instead of just a basic 5 v 5 with some AI minions in parts, there's a whole lot going on. Their focus is on a large-scale battlefield with over 100 minions per team, which is "per avenue" (lanes to battle through) resulting in there being thousands of units in each game. They say that "no other MOBA will compare" to the scale of this one.</p>
<p>The map destruction also looks like it could be fun as you reshape it as you go. You're in a tank, so you have a lot of firepower.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>Each decision leads to a new discovery, and hidden surprises await. No wrong choices in this one, no time limits, no score. It's all about just relaxing and creating and seeing what you can experiment with.</p>

      <title>Cosy vertical tile-stacking nature-building puzzle game Preserve is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Preserve from developer Bitmap Galaxy is a nature-building puzzle game where you build tiles in an interesting mix of horizontal and vertical gameplay that's just left Early Access. It's really sweet, great to unwind with.</p>
<p>Here you just keep on adding layers of nature until it all fits nicely together. The idea is that you're restoring and building up various diverse connected biomes and it really does look lovely while you're playing it. A soft casual puzzle game that won't make your brain sweat, accessible thanks to the clean and clear design and engaging enough to keep you going as you want to see what happens as you place all the tiles down to watch it come alive. Dorfromantik was one of their main inspirations for it, so if you've seen or played that, you know some of what to expect.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">Full release features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full Compendium</strong> - Players dive into detailed card mechanics, scoring, and gameplay strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards</strong> - Gamers climb the ranks and compare preservation skills.</li>
<li><strong>Platform-Specific Achievements/Trophies</strong> - Players celebrate their victories.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging Weekly Challenges</strong> - Compete with friends and build nature.</li>
<li><strong>Card Trading in Harmony Mode</strong> - More control over the deck and strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Puzzle Collection</strong> - More brain-bending nature puzzles.</li>
<li><strong>Brand New Jurassic Biome</strong> - Preservers uncover a prehistoric world of wonder.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>During Early Access it managed to get a Very Positive rating from Steam players. It launches with Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable (some small text / on-screen keyboard has to be pulled up manually).</p>

      <title>Upcoming Steam update should fix lag spikes on Linux when the Steam Overlay is disabled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For quite some time now Linux gamers have been reporting issues with lag spikes in various games on Steam when the Steam Overlay is disabled. It seems Valve may have finally found the cause and a fix is hopefully on the way.</p>
<p>There's been a bug report open on the Steam GitHub page since <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/11446" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">November 2024</a>, with hundreds of comments discussing the issue. One workaround has been to set this as a launch option for games:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">LD_PRELOAD="" %command%</code></p>
<p>However, that's only good if you know that workaround exists. Ideally, games should perform the same if you have the Steam Overlay enabled or disabled.</p>
<p>Writing on the GitHub, Valve contractor Timothee "TTimo" Besset <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/11446#issuecomment-2892172851" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> on May 19th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey all - thanks for the reports. We believe we have a fix for this issue, it hasn't made it's way through our release pipeline yet but I'll update here when we do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully then we'll see this problem solved soon.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 570.153.02 driver released for Linux with a couple fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released driver version 570.153.02, a new bug-fix release for their current main stable driver version for Linux gamers. In case you missed it: back in late April, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/nvidia-disclose-new-security-flaw-in-their-linux-gpu-drivers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA revealed a new security flaw</a> in their drivers so you're going to want to make sure you're up to date.</p>
<p>This is a small bug-fix release only, here's the changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications and compositors to stall when using NVIDIA as a PRIME Display Offload sink ("Reverse PRIME"), potentially resulting in a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that led to increasing memory usage in X11 OpenGL and Vulkan applications after suspend/resume cycles.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/ludaro-puts-a-roguelike-deck-building-twist-on-the-classic-board-game-ludo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ludaro back in mid April</a>, and now you can try this new chaotic spin on Ludo yourself, as they've just released a first demo for it. Love seeing more developers attempt to refresh classics like this!</p>
<p>Ludaro is a roguelike deck-building dice game with a unique twist on Ludo! Plan your moves, manipulate deterministic dice rolls, and unleash powerful Spirit Cards to beat the score. Upgrade tiles, collect quirky pets and stack wild combos as you battle in epic boss fights with game-changing modifiers.</p>
<p>Check out their recent trailer to get a glimpse of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FSyyM3cMs5Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a45e3f59c061b81fd351a07ef343eb84.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FSyyM3cMs5Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The demo is out now which has a Native Linux version. The full game is due sometime later this year. Should run great on Steam Deck too which is what they've said they're optimising it for.</p>

      <title>GOG add support for authenticator apps for two-factor authentication (2FA)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for keeping your games secure, as <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> have announced they've added support for authenticator apps for two-factor authentication (2FA). Previously GOG only supported sending a code via email, but now you can pick whatever auth app you want.</p>
<p>If you have email codes on, you have to first disable it. Then GOG will give you a QR code to scan via your favourite auth app (or a code to manually enter). As noted on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/news/you_can_now_use_authenticator_apps_to_keep_your_gog_account_secure" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG news post</a>. Not much more to it than that!</p>
<p>This is great to see. I hope Valve eventually follow this for Steam, as currently Valve only offer Steam Guard which forces you to use their mobile app, which they don't exactly put a lot of time into. Would be great if Valve also allowed you to use your favourite auth app.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">While you're here, perhaps take a look at some of the current sales on GOG like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20250515_witcher3_anniversary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Witcher 3 Anniversary Sale</a></li>

</ul>
<p>In case you missed it; GOG also recently announced they <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/gog-begin-rolling-out-dynamic-bundle-pricing-to-complete-your-collections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">finally added dynamic bundle pricing</a>.</p>

      <title>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft just announced that the Windows Subsystem for Linux is now officially open source. While it doesn't necessarily mean much for traditional desktop Linux, it's still a nice move.</p>
<p>For those who have never used it, or don't know what it is: it's a feature of modern Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine, without the need for a separate virtual machine or dual booting.</p>
<p>Writing on the official Windows blog the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/05/19/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-is-now-open-source/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> mentions that there's still a couple of bits that are not open source, but a big step forwards for it. It also goes over a brief bit of history of it like how they had to separate it from the Windows code-base to enable Microsoft to keep up with the growing community and feature requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years we’ve been incredibly lucky to have a strong community supporting WSL from day 1. We’ve been blessed with people sharing their knowledge, and spending countless hours to help track down bugs, find the best ways to implement new features and improve WSL.</p>
<p>WSL could never have been what it is today without its community. Even without access to WSL’s source code, people have been able to make major contributions that lead to what WSL is now.</p>
<p>This is why we’re incredibly excited to open-source WSL today. We’ve seen how much the community has contributed to WSL without access to the source code, and we can’t wait to see how WSL will evolve now that the community can make direct code contributions to the project.</p>
<cite>Pierre Boulay, Microsoft</cite></blockquote>
<p>We really have come a long way from the Microsoft of old.</p>

      <title>Search engines are getting worse, so OpenWebSearch funded by the European Union want to fix it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not gaming news but an important subject to cover anyway since it's something that affects me and GamingOnLinux directly, as well as all of you who regularly use a search engine. The <a href="https://openwebsearch.eu/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OpenWebSearch</a> might be one way to save us all.</p>
<p>It's certainly no secret that web searching is getting worse as all the AI enshittification continues. AI is more and more forced in your face, and the big few (Google, Microsoft) like to keep as much control as they possibly can. Just look at recent news, with Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates?id=492574" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cutting off</a> access to Bing Search APIs on August 11 2025 as they continue to pivot to AI.</p>
<p>Especially important for sites like GamingOnLinux, and pretty much any news site that isn't one of the big few that keep buying up all the others, as we might only be one algorithm change from not being shown in search results at all.</p>
<p>OpenWebSearch is one possible new ally in this internet fight, a European Union-funded project to build up a massive modern search index that doesn't depend on the big US giants. The idea is <em>not</em> to build a search system themselves, but to provide an open search API, so that others would be able to hook into it and make use of it.</p>
<p>They've just <a href="https://openwebsearch.eu/june-event-announcement-the-open-web-index-goes-public/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced recently</a> that it's going public in June:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After 2,5 years of intensive research and programming efforts, the entire Openwebsearch.eu project team is excited to grant access to its pilot of the first-ever federated pan-European Open Web Index (OWI).</p>
<p>From June onward, commercial and scientific development teams of any size as well as interested individuals are welcome to access and make use of almost a petabyte (and growing) of open web data under a general research license or – upon request – under a designated commercial license as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm very interested to see what becomes of this one. Hopefully something meaningful, but I remain skeptical on it doing much to make a dent in the sides of Google and Bing. Depends if they manage to get some search engines to make good use of it or not and if the licensing when it's out fully is actually reasonable.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-2 brings some essential fixes for Windows games on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/ge-proton-10-1-released-with-proton-10-and-fixes-for-marvel-rivals-oblivion-remastered-and-more-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big GE-Proton 10-1 version</a> that updated the community-maintained Windows compatibility layer to Proton 10, a smaller bug-fix release is out with some essential fixes. As is often the case with GE-Proton, the 10-1 release came with some issues so this hotfix <em>should</em> solve most of the reported problems.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about all the different Proton versions be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read my guide</a>. And my guide on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to install GE-Proton</a>. My usual advice is to stick with Valve's official Proton, unless there's something specific you need in GE-Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The changes in <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton10-2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GE-Proton 10-2</a> are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixes missing comma in proton script causing prefix issues (this was also a valve upstream issue).</li>
<li>Fixes accidental import of the steam ffmpeg libraries instead of the ones we build and ship (this was an accidental copy/paste when porting changes from Proton 10) -- this should fix video playback in a lot of titles as they worked in proton 9.</li>
<li>Removes setting ENABLE_HDR_WSI -- this option is only specific for the vk_hdr_layer. (<a href="https://github.com/Zamundaaa/VK_hdr_layer" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/Zamundaaa/VK_hdr_layer</a>) hack, which is -not- needed as of mesa 25.1 and can cause washed out colors. If you previously used this, it's advised to remove it, and update mesa to 25.1 if you want HDR.</li>
<li>added a few patches for allowing more launchers to work in wayland (epic, battlenet, star citizen).</li>
<li>added patch to allow 32 bit EOS overlay to work for Among Us.</li>
<li>added raw input patches for winewayland (un-accelerated mouse).</li>
<li>added touchpad scrolling support patch for winewayland.</li>
<li>xalia library updates imported from upstream.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Utopia Must Fall is easily one of the best modern arcade shoot &#39;em ups</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Utopia Must Fall from developer Pixeljam has absolutely absorbed my attention recently. It's easily one of the best modern arcade shoot 'em ups I've ever played. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>It's like a glorious mixture of Missile Command for your base to defend, with Space Invaders for some of the style and enemy behaviours along with a seriously mysterious moody atmosphere, one that really sucks you right in. So it's a mixture of classic retro arcade gameplay with some tower defence. Add to that the rapid constant progression with you upgrading constantly, there's a lot to love about this.</p>
<p>Spread across a few differently styled cities, you're tasked with one single objective — defend against the apocalypse. You do so by swinging a great big rail-gun that auto-fires. Its position is static, so all you do is swing left to right to align it as it fires as you try to take down every single enemy that appears on screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5551674071747659617gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5551674071747659617gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9251409841747659616gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9251409841747659616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The tricky bit is how your main weapon is a bit slow to align, although there are upgrades to speed up its rotation. The upgrade system is what's the shiny hook here. You choose your own path through it. After each day, you're able to pick certain contracts to power up something. This could be upgrading nuclear missiles with antimatter that end up sucking everything in, automated facilities to send out configurable drones to help you defend, increase gun fire rate (or twin guns) and so on.</p>
<p>You can re-roll some upgrades you get if you don't like them, which is done quite amusingly in-world, in the way of a Citizen Proposal. This might be something like constructing a decoy city, or invite the aliens for a chat. They don't do anything, other than let you re-roll upgrades but a fun touch.</p>
<p>On May 14th, they just launched a big update for the game including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Skill tree: fully overhauled upgrade system with interactive tree structure, graphical icons for every upgrade and 4 special 'opportunity' slots. Requirements, blockers, hierarchy and time constraints for regular upgrades are demystified.</li>
<li>Drones! Automated floating, modifiable allies that dodge hazards and chase enemies, equipped with onboard railgun turrets and adjustable behavioural parameters.</li>
<li>Drone-related upgrades: Deploy Drone Factory, Twin Drone Factory, Atomic Drones, Double-Barrelled Drones, Robotics Specialist</li>
<li>Watchtower mod: Q Disruptor - targets are temporarily timewarped to 0.25x regular speed</li>
<li>Opportunity Upgrades: Cheap Nukes, Work Retreat, Red Flag Day, Context Switch</li>
<li>New cities to defend: Cairo Horizon and HyperParis</li>
<li>Many other additions, improvements, tweaks, balances, fixes, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I've played a lot of retro games over the years, and a lot recently too but Utopia Must Fall stands apart from the crowd because it's just so satisfying and nicely designed.</p>
<p>It works well on Desktop Linux with Proton, although the Steam Overlay didn't seem to work for me. On Steam Deck, they're working on support but it's not yet ready. They <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2849680/discussions/0/597386590728345355/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">didn't seem</a> particularly happy last year that Valve already gave it a Playable rating.</p>
<p>Cheap too, with a 30% discount until May 28th and even when not discounted it's very reasonably priced. They even note this as a feature: "reasonably priced to help offset the unreasonable cost of everything else".</p>
<p>I just can't get over the atmosphere of it. Brilliant.</p>

      <title>You are the final boss in Noobs Are Coming, an over the top arena roguelike</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Solo developer Overboy has announced that Noobs Are Coming, their chaotic over the top arena roguelike, is set for release in 2025 with full Native Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>They said their main inspiration for the game is basically "The Binding of Isaac X Brotato", and it acts as a spiritual successor to their viral-hit game <a href="https://overboy.itch.io/mobs-inc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mobs Inc</a> from 10 years ago. Set in their own parody RPG universe, the point is to make unique broken builds across various different runs with each run being wildly different. The characters you play as are just as over the top as the builds you can make like a giant worm or a huge spider.</p>
<p>It supports solo play and local co-op for up to 4 players (or Steam Remote Play Together).</p>
<p>A new trailer is also live now:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n697S0D_amM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/13f27031fdde1f183d17baf7fbb4d236.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n697S0D_amM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As a big fan of Brotato and Isaac, I'm definitely keen to see what kind of madness this will offer.</p>
<p>The game is due for release in June but no specific date has been given yet.</p>

      <title>Chaotic spider-physics sandbox A Webbing Journey is out now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A game that finally made me think a Spider could be adorable? Nah, they still terrify me, but A Webbing Journey really is wholesome. Great idea for a game too with some fun physics and web-slinging.</p>
<p>Squirt webs all over the place, swing around and crawl over every surface in this sandbox game — you're a tiny critter on a big mission to help your favourite humans. This includes tasks like baking, doing the dishes and watering plants. All the things spiders can apparently do? No task is too big they say. If only spiders in my house were this helpful! Instead of hiding in my shoes or dropping on my head just as I'm falling asleep.</p>

The company was founded initially as a solo dev studio in 2017, later expanding to a six-person studio. Through a series of innovative and exciting experiments, the team eventually conceived the prototype for A Webbing Journey, which has since grown into their first commercial game and it's out now in Early Access with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Mineshaft is a tough but unique Tetris-like with crafting and mining for gems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mineshaft is a clever blending of genres that takes the very basics from Tetris but makes it quite an interesting challenge with resource gathering, tool crafting and puzzle solving. It's like a mini Minecraft / Terraria version of Tetris. <em>Note: key provided by the developer.</em></p>
<p>Here you have the standard falling blocks of different shapes, but these shapes have raw resources in them. Combine them in the right way and you can craft various tools, which will allow you to actually dig deeper into the map to collect more resources to keep going and go through quests.</p>
<p>It's quite different and a really nice spin on things and even includes local split-screen PvP battles.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DtHGHOPsgeo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/56a1755f151a879846cb5fb6ec147c72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DtHGHOPsgeo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Blocks aren't set in place when they drop either, so if you drop a shape on top of a single block, the rest will fall down the sides with physics. This is where the nice combo feature can come into play. A well-placed block can end up giving you multiple tools in a row, which can really help you break through the lines to get deeper. It's tough though to focus on multiple things as the same time, while quite a casual game, it really is a thorough challenge to get through even the earliest levels.</p>
<p>There's a lot of content already included with you dropping blocks across around 64 map locations, with various different biomes to drop blocks and mine through. There's also a whole shop and upgrade system to help you on your way. As you collect resources and then craft some coins, you'll be able to upgrade the equipment you can craft during a run to give you a lot of advantages - but still remains tough due to how you have to match up all the resources when dropping those blocks.</p>
<p>If you love a casual but engaging challenge and a fun spin on a classic it's one to take a look at. There's also a demo available and the game is currently in Early Access.</p>
<p><em>Played on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck with Proton, it worked perfectly.</em></p>

      <title>Sirocco Thugs is an upcoming first-person boomer beat &#39;em up with a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a focus on flashy kicking, punching and beating, Sirocco Thugs could be one to watch if you love boomer shooters but fancy smacking people with a lead pipe or knuckledusters instead while you do combos. There's a demo available on Steam right now and it works on Linux with Proton.</p>
<p><em>I especially like that the developer is called BRIAN DAMAGE — heh.</em></p>
<p>The developer says it takes place "in an authentic Southern Italian setting, the game puts you in the shoes of one man - Tugg DiMamma - embarking on a quest for revenge". You'll brawl your way through various hordes of thugs, and eventually come face-to-face with "the Don".</p>

      <title>Beyond All Reason, a free and open source RTS gets a big visual overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Beyond All Reason is an incredibly impressive free and open source RTS, with The Lightbringer update out now that's a huge advancement for the visuals. <em>If you love massive battles you need to play this one.</em></p>
<p>The update was getting so big, they've had to split it into multiple parts, mainly because they kept on adding more.</p>
<p>A full day / night cycle system should come in Part 2. For Part 1 that's out now you can look forward to seeing dynamic animated detail lights on units and buildings, with the developers noting they've added in "over 3,000 individual lights across nearly 400 units" and it looks seriously cool. On top of that there's screen-space raytraced shadows (SSRTX), shockwaves and heat distortions, major performance improvements for the UI along with it being clearer to read and lots more smaller details.</p>
<p>The amount of players continues to grow too. They said they've seen the daily active player count double since the start of 2025, "now surpassing 15,000 every single day".</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer</p>

<p>While the game is technically considered in Alpha, it's fully playable and has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>It will release on Steam eventually but they still have a lot of work ahead. For now, download direct.</p>

      <title>Microsoft finally solve the Linux dual-boot issue after 9 months</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in August 2024, Microsoft released an update for various versions of Windows including Windows 10 and 11 that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/microsoft-breaks-some-linux-dual-boots-in-a-recent-windows-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">broke dual-booting with Linux</a> on some setups. They've now finally solved it. <em>Only took them 9 months.</em></p>
<p>The issue came from a Windows security <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-server-2022#3377msgdesc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a>, something that was not supposed to affect systems where it detected a dual-boot but Microsoft failed on that causing problems for many to be unable to boot into their Linux installs. </p>
<p>From Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After installing the August 2024 Windows security update, (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5041160" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">KB5041160</a>) or the August 2024 preview update, you might face issues with booting Linux if you have enabled the dual-boot setup for Windows and Linux in your device. Resulting from this issue, your device might fail to boot Linux and show the error message “Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation.”</p>
<p>The August 2024 Windows security and preview updates apply a Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) setting to devices that run Windows to block old, vulnerable boot managers. This SBAT update will not be applied to devices where dual booting is detected. On some devices, the dual-boot detection did not detect some customized methods of dual-booting and applied the SBAT value when it should not have been applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Microsoft did tweak this so that from September 19, 2024 and later updates did not do this automatically, but the damage was already done.</p>
<p>As of the May 13, 2025 <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/may-13-2025-kb5058385-os-build-20348-3692-45f3b455-92fa-4297-9dde-1428b36e53ad" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> for Windows, this has now been solved. As the changelog notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT) and Linux Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)]</strong> This update applies improvements to SBAT for the detection of Linux systems.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Deck / SteamOS hits 19,000 games rated Verified and Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for players on Steam Deck and SteamOS, as the Steam Deck Verified system just hit 19,000 games that are rated either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Valve did also just recently announce a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/valve-announce-steamos-compatibility-ratings-an-extension-of-steam-deck-verified-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new dedicated SteamOS Compatibility</a> system too, although that will simply say if something is compatible or not. So if a game is Steam Deck Playable at least (or higher like Verified), it will also be SteamOS Compatible. At the end of April we also had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/proton-10-gets-a-first-beta-to-improve-game-compatibility-on-steam-deck-and-desktop-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first Proton 10 Beta</a> to increase game compatibility!</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">At time of writing there are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Playable 12,841</li>
<li>Verified 6,216</li>
<li>Unsupported 4,798</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of those that are Unsupported will be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">due to the anti-cheat</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the Steam Playtest for SWAPMEAT, a co-op body-part swapping third-person shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SWAPMEAT is an upcoming roguelite third-person shooter where you tear through alien worlds, harvesting body-parts to steal their powers. There's a new Steam Playtest demo available, which has a Linux version that will be live until May 22nd. This is the final playtest before launching later in 2025.</p>
<p>More about it: "In SWAPMEAT, players step into the boots of Meat Scientists working for the multi-galactic corporation Rangus Meats. Your mission? Raid the weirdest worlds in the cosmos, engage in exhilarating third-person combat, harvest DNA samples from the locals, and extract the planets’ meat cores. Whether solo or with a four-player co-op squad, you’ll battle alien weirdos and beefy bosses for their meaty trophies. As you loot body parts – from heads and legs to torsos – you’ll enhance your character with game-changing abilities, switching up playstyles on the fly using Rangus Meats’ patented Smart Meat technology."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bT6cH8280zY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b724acd6242aa76c5fad4d7255592a6b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bT6cH8280zY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking to their PR team over email, they confirmed it's getting a Native Linux release. The Playtest also has a Native Linux version. They mentioned "We can confirm, yes, the game is getting a native Linux release, for Steam OS specifically with YMMV on other distros." and "Jamie Stormbreaker, the CEO and Lead Game Designer at One More Game is committed to having the game support Linux, proper.".</p>
<p>Nice to see. Hopefully it works out well for them.</p>
<p>The game will be launching later in 2025.</p>

      <title>Valve refresh Steam&#39;s monthly top-releases charts, going all the way back to the release of Half-Life 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The crazy coders at Valve had been making the monthly top lists manually this whole time, but no more. They've given their monthly top-releases charts a fresh makeover and you can scroll all the way back to the release of Half-Life 2.</p>
<p>At least with them being automated, they'll actually release the charts consistently every month now. Valve said with the upgrade you can expect to see them arrive 14 days after the end of each month. Since it's automated, you can also now scroll back as far you want.</p>
<p>The charts use both the Early Access and 1.0 releases, so some games might appear twice across the years.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17633779821747383927gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There of course wasn't exactly much competition on Steam back in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topnewreleases/november_2004" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">November 2004</a>, with that being the only game released on Steam. This is long before Valve opened up to allow many more developers to put their games on Steam. Before direct publishing, before even Steam Greenlight.</p>
<p>With the refresh they've put the list up to 50 items, and when you scroll down on a full month they've also added filtering options now too like genre, platform and so on. DLC will also show up now too, if it's popular enough. Like with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topnewreleases/april_2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">April 2025</a> that's newly live, showing a Call of Duty season pass.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the fresh and up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for May 16th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. An easy way to build up your gaming collection with these games coming as part of your Amazon Prime subscription.</p>
<p>I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play. Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>You can install games from Epic, GOG and Amazon easily via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Heroic Games Launcher</a> with Prime giving you a code for each game for whatever store it's on.

      <title>Stellar Blade launches for PC on June 11, specifications and features revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SHIFT UP Corporation /PlayStation Publishing LLC today announced officially that Stellar Blade will be launching for PC on June 11. Finally, I'll get to see what people have been fussing over.</p>
<p>The PC release will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 resolution scaling and frame generation, NVIDIA DLAA image enhancement, and NVIDIA Reflex latency reduction features. Additionally AMD FSR 3 is also supported.</p>
<p>Big monitor owners will also be happy as it supports ultrawide resolutions and super ultrawide. There's also "High-resolution background textures", full input customization for gamepads and keyboards and some new content with new suits to wear.</p>

<p>On the official X/Twitter account, they also <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1921230656945668391" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">showed</a> a very brief clip of it on Steam Deck and it seemed to be running well enough but difficult to properly tell. They did also previously say it would be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/stellar-blade-to-be-optimized-for-the-steam-deck-and-other-umpc-environments/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">optimised for the Steam Deck</a>. Going by the specifications, it seems reasonable that this might perform well.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available for £59.99 on the main edition and £79.99 for the complete edition.</p>

      <title>Minecraft will finally let you craft saddles instead of hunting for them</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In a future Minecraft release that's now in testing, you won't need to hunt or fish for a saddle, as it's finally going to be an item you can just craft. <em>Seems the knowledge was finally found, it only took 15 years.</em></p>
<p>Why are they doing this now? Well, it sort-of makes sense. While it does reduce part of the point of exploring the world, since it's yet another thing you can just make yourself, Mojang <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/minecraft-is-getting-a-graphics-overhaul-with-the-vibrant-visuals-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced the Happy Ghast</a> that will let you ride it with a crafted harness anyway. So it was a bit odd for you to be able to craft the harness but not the saddle.</p>
<p>Related: be sure to check out my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/an-idiots-guide-to-setting-up-minecraft-on-steam-deck-steamos-with-controller-support/" target="_blank">idiots guide to setting up Minecraft on Steam Deck / SteamOS with controller support</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, this fresh update in testing was <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/craftable-saddles-and-fresh-music" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> by Mojang on May 13th. All you'll need are 3 bits of leather and 1 iron ingot and then you can ride away into the night.</p>

      <title>Nubs! Arena is a chaotic multiplayer brawler by ex-Awesomenauts devs, free for the first 24 hours</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Act fast if you want a brand new free game, as Nubs! Arena from ex-Awesomenauts developers has released and it's free for the first 24 hours. This is <em>not</em> a free trial, it's free to <em>keep</em> if you add it to your account within the time limit.</p>
<p>What is it? Nubs!: Arena is a fast-paced, party-style brawler with roguelite progression, over-the-top action, and enough chaos to ruin friendships (in a good way). Battle online with 4-20 players or locally with up to 4 players in unhinged free-for-alls.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bCsUuBaMdQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d6d83d13f776a77d6548caa1373fbe72.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bCsUuBaMdQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>All you have to do is scroll down on Steam and click the Add to Account button:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20105829551747316452gol1.png"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Extensive Character Customization – Craft a Nub that stands out in the chaos.</li>
<li>Multiple Game Modes – Battle solo or in teams with up to 20 people.</li>
<li>Fast-Paced, Action-Packed Battles with Roguelite Progression – One more match quickly turns into ten.</li>
<li>A Variety of Weapons &amp; Power-Ups – Some are powerful, some are absurd, and some are just… fish.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've verified that it works perfectly without any issue on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>. Pretty chaotic with the way the arena shrinks down like a Battle Royale after a while. Add to that the assortment of different weapons you can grab from chests during a round, there's a lot of ways for you to win or die. Could quite easily end up being my new coffee-break game and something to unwind with before bed.</p>

      <title>Shroom and Gloom is a first-person fungus-filled deck-builder with a demo you need to try</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're getting totally spoiled with unique deck-builders lately like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/the-fusion-of-deck-building-and-space-tetris-in-the-demo-of-moonsigil-atlas-has-totally-hooked-me/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moonsigil Atlas</a> that I really can't wait for. And now Devolver Digital announced they're publishing Shroom and Gloom with a demo up now and it's glorious.</p>
<p>What is it? A moody first-person, roguelike double-deckbuilder. Yes, double, you have two entirely different decks in this one. The style of it is the real draw though, it looks incredible in motion. There's a combat deck which obviously is used during fights, and then also a explore deck with special cards to help you get around the dungeons.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9109275751747315866gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9109275751747315866gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Part of what makes it unique are the enemies as they're also food. Numerous cards have special additions on them, which can turn dead fungi enemies into food cards. You can also then get a pot card for your exploration, and turn them all into a soup too. The shop system plays into this food system too, with new cards from the shopkeeper costing food, that you'll place into a bowl for them from your food cards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4847588581747315864gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4847588581747315864gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12682074931747315866gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12682074931747315866gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I've just thoroughly enjoyed exploring the various doors in the dungeon for the atmosphere, it's really great.</p>
<p>I've run through the demo which worked great on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10 Beta</a> and it is yet another game that I'm going to have to somehow fit into my wishlist, because it deserves to be there.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vL3TJj9mtMc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aed8a34c3ed58cd034210f68ac624802.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vL3TJj9mtMc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Double-Deckbuilding! - Build 2 distinct decks! Use the combat deck to survive fierce battles! Use the explore deck to navigate dungeons, modify your cards, and unlock new weapons and abilities!</li>
<li>Eye-ball melting art! - Hand-drawn art and animations collide with dozens of rich 3D spaces, bringing you into a surreal world of mushrooms and madness!</li>
<li>Infinite growth and monstrous mega-combos! - Shroom and Gloom offers unique ways for players to grow and modify their cards infinitely. Grow low level starting cards into over-powered attacks, or modify rare cards into game-breaking super-weapons!</li>
<li>Less blocking, more eating! - Why block your enemies when you could eat them instead! Shroom and Gloom features a bounty of ways for you to season, skewer or roast your foes, then eat them to restore lost health. Better yet, throw your roasted enemies into a pot, and cook up some game-changing soups!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A demo you have to try and it enters Early Access later this year.</p>

      <title>Denuvo will lock you out of games on Linux, SteamOS, Steam Deck if you keep changing Proton versions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Although for some of us this is a well-known problem, it has appeared again with the release of DOOM: The Dark Ages so it's worth a quick PSA to remind people about Denuvo activation limits with Proton on Linux, SteamOS / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's the thing — Denuvo Anti-Tamper games <em>do</em> work on Linux systems when running a Windows game through Proton. However, Denuvo has a set limit on the amount of activations it allows per-game. This is five systems it detects within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The problem is on Linux systems with Proton, you might be trying to find the best version of Proton to run the game with, especially so for new releases. If you <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keep changing your Proton version</a> this can trip up Denuvo and count each Proton swap as a new activation. What happens then? You get locked out for 24 hours.</p>
<p>An example shot below is Atomic Heart, which I intentionally tripped when swapping Proton versions just to show you what happens when you do:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19629230321747312375gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So keep in mind for games that have Denuvo Anti-Tamper to limit the amount of times you swap the Proton version.</p>
<p>You shouldn't often need to actually change the Proton version though. For games on Steam that have been through Steam Deck Verified or have a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/valve-announce-steamos-compatibility-ratings-an-extension-of-steam-deck-verified-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS Compatibility rating</a>, Valve will have picked the best version of Proton by default for it. However, some people like to use things like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a>, or change to a newer version of Proton than what Valve verified a game against, to potentially at times get a better experience.</p>
<p>How to find games that have Denuvo? They are supposed to be noted on Steam, you can see in the side-bar on Atomic Heart for example:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16864163731747310796gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Our friends at PCGamingWiki also <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Denuvo#List_of_games_using_Denuvo_Anti-Tamper" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">have a list</a> of Steam games with Denuvo.</p>

      <title>PartyDeck is a split-screen game launcher for Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now this is some seriously cool software and I love to see it. PartyDeck is a new tool that can help you run various games in local split-screen, even if they don't actually support it.</p>
<p>How? It runs multiple copies of the same game and sorts out all the connections for you, and will even automatically fit all the windows onto your screen. So it's not actual local split-screen, it's faking it but it's a fantastic idea to make gaming more accessible for people to play together.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">As the developer explains how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>KWin Session:</strong> This KWin Session displays all running game instances and runs a script to automatically resize and reposition each Gamescope window.</li>
<li><strong>Gamescope:</strong> Contains each instance of the game to its own window. Also has the neat side effect of receiving controller input even when the window is not currently active, meaning multiple Gamescope instances can all receive input simultaneously</li>
<li><strong>Bubblewrap:</strong> Uses bindings to mask out evdev input files from the instances, so each instance only receives input from one specific controller. Also uses directory binding to give each player their own save data and settings within the games.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime (Steam Runtime/Proton):</strong> If needed, the app can run native Linux games through a Steam Runtime (currently, 1.0 (scout) and 2.0 (soldier) are supported) for better compatibility. Windows games are launched through UMU Launcher</li>
<li><strong>Goldberg Steam Emu:</strong> On games that use the Steam API for multiplayer, Goldberg is used to allow the game instances to connect to each other, as well as other devices running on the same LAN.</li>
<li><strong>And finally, the game itself.</strong></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18831961931747307575gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There are various limitations, and the developer is honest about it being the "first serious software project I've ever done" and so it may be a little on the messier side.</p>

      <title>Popular stress-testing app OCCT is coming to Steam and includes a special build for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OCCT <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/stress-testing-and-hardware-monitoring-tool-occt-has-officially-released-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released a supported Native Linux version</a> of their popular fully featured stress-testing application, and now they've announced it's coming to Steam as part of a wider expansion.</p>
<p>Not only that, but they've announced the Steam release will also come with a "portable handheld edition of OCCT that runs flawlessly on the Steam Deck". Their Native Linux build was already compatible but this was optimized to give the best experience on Steam Deck now too.</p>
<p>When it releases on Steam it will be free but also have an "optional non-recurrent purchase, priced the same as on Patreon".</p>

<ul>
<li>Processor (CPU) – Evaluate your CPU’s stability and performance with various test modes.</li>
<li>Graphics Card (GPU) – Push your GPU to its limits with DirectX and CUDA-specific stress tests.</li>

      <title>Here&#39;s a statement from Valve on the reported Steam data breach</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been reports of a Steam data breach recently, and instead of jumping the gun I reached out to Valve first to see what was going on.</p>
<p>From what I can tell the reports originated on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> from "Underdark.ai" that claimed there was a "Massive Alleged Steam Data Breach: 89M+ Records for Sale". This was then picked up on X/Twitter, and then lots of news websites posted it up. The initial report mentioned the company Twilio, who told me earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that Twilio was breached. We have reviewed a sampling of the data found online, and see no indication that this data was obtained from Twilio.</p>
<cite>A Twilio Spokesperson</cite></blockquote>
<p>Next up, the full statement sent to me by Valve:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday we were made aware of reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers. We have examined the leak sample and have determined <strong>this was NOT a breach of Steam systems.</strong></p>
<p>We’re still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone.</p>
<p>The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to. <strong>The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data.</strong> Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages.</p>
<p>From a Steam perspective, customers do not need to change their passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event. It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We recommend regularly checking your Steam account security at any time at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices">https://store.steampowered.com/account/authorizeddevices</a>.</p>
<p>We also recommend Steam users set up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if they haven’t already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about their account and that account’s safety.</p>
<cite>Valve Press</cite></blockquote>
<p>Will update when I learn any more verified information.</p>
<p><em>Quick little update 11:09 BST — Valve have now posted it officially on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/533224478739530146" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Mesa 25.0.6 released with AMD GPU fixes for DOOM: The Dark Ages on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source Mesa 25.0.6 graphics drivers bug-fix release is out now, and thankfully this one comes with the updates needed to run DOOM: The Dark Ages on Linux with Proton when you have an AMD GPU.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/doom-the-dark-ages-needs-workarounds-on-linux-with-amd-gpus-a-fix-has-been-merged-into-mesa/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I recently reported about the issues</a> with DOOM: The Dark Ages, and it's nice to see it solved so quickly and <em>just</em> ahead of the game being released properly in a few hours. There's also issues solved for Skin Deep, Psychonauts, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Hunt Showdown 1896, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,  Tomb Raider IV - VI Remastered and Dota 2 across different drivers.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>radv,driconf: Add radv_force_64k_sparse_alignment config.</li>
<li>driconf: Add workarounds for DOOM: The Dark Ages.</li>

      <title>Rogue Worlds is a free chaotic tactical roguelite platformer out now with Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Worlds is a new free chaotic tactical roguelite platformer that's a spin-off of Aura of Worlds, a paid bigger game from developer Cognitive Forge. It looks really good and can't argue with that price.</p>
<p>Here, the environment is your toolkit and your key to salvation. You'll outwit deadly traps, swing across dangerous gaps, wield the strength of enemies against them, and turn hazards into chaotic advantages at every turn. The game has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Check out their trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RkVpiC0YxY4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a65e7f3792f44e1fbf8c2fdd8c7c634e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RkVpiC0YxY4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Diverse Level Themes: Tidal corridors lined with mines, flickering lights in underground ruins, rising lava pits, and carnivorous gardens. Each environment brings unique dangers and opportunities.</li>
<li>Creative Abilities: Master parkour, cloak from enemies, or even enthrall foes to fight on your side.</li>
<li>Multi-Use Objects: Light your way with a lantern—or throw it as an improvised flaming Molotov.</li>
<li>Challenging Boss Fights: Outsmart colossal adversaries by using both your reflexes and the environment to your advantage.</li>
<li>Handcrafted Pixel Art &amp; Animations: Beautifully detailed pixel visuals bring the world to life.</li>
<li>Unique Musical Score: An immersive soundtrack that evolves with your adventure.</li>
<li>Permanent Progression: Unlock new items, character backgrounds, and more to customize your journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>On the subject of how it's connected to their previous games, Aura of Worlds, they said "Rogue Worlds offers a focused, free start to the creative survival gameplay that defines Aura of Worlds. While it stands on its own, it’s also part of a larger, evolving universe, with Aura of Worlds receiving ongoing content updates, expanded biomes, new items, challenges, and more surprises still to come. Progress made in Rogue Worlds carries over to Aura of Worlds, allowing players to seamlessly continue their journey with unlocked gear, rescued allies, and upgraded options intact. Whether you’re discovering the series for the first time or jumping in from the full game, Rogue Worlds is a fast, flexible, and chaotic entry point built to reward experimentation and improvisation."</p>
<p>So it's sort-of like a really big demo, but also not a demo because it stands on its own. A smaller free companion game that can be played by itself.</p>

      <title>The fusion of deck-building and space-Tetris in the demo of Moonsigil Atlas has totally hooked me</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonsigil Atlas has a demo out now and it's already shot right up to the top of my wishlist. The idea of fusing a Slay the Spire styled deck-builder with something sort-of Tetris-like is just incredibly slick.</p>
<p>I wrote about it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/moonsigil-atlas-is-a-deckbuilding-roguelike-with-tile-based-energy-thats-tetris-meets-slay-the-spire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earlier in April</a>, quite interested in the idea and the developer sent over a pre-release key for the demo that I've <em>thoroughly enjoyed</em> playing through. For a deck-builder, it's incredibly refreshing and thoroughly different to play through thanks to the main game mechanic of fitting pieces onto a board.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2447696861747241812gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2447696861747241812gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>How it works: you fight in battles where your cards need to be placed onto the centre board. The cards all have different shapes, so part of the strategy is knowing not just what card to use but where <em>exactly</em> to place it onto the board too. Enemies you face can also place their own shapes on the board to mess with you, some of which can have really annoying effects on your cards that you need to watch out for.</p>
<p>There's no mana system, which makes it initially a little odd, as you can just keep on using cards and placing shapes as long as you think they'll be useful each round. In a way, the board itself is your mana. I especially like how the card upgrade system allows you to remove specific tiles you select from individual cards, so you can make some of them easier to slot together with other cards when placing them on the board later on.</p>
<p>Trailer is below if you missed me covering it previously:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aTEJ9InXqfI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cca04806e6fdc7af121eb08674600cf4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aTEJ9InXqfI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really fun idea and wonderful visuals and audio too.</p>
<p>Go give the demo a run through and let me know what you think in the comments. The demo has over 100 cards, two playable characters and various different enemies to battle.</p>

      <title>Rescue Ops: Wildfire could be a good one for co-op fans where you fight raging infernos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rescue Ops: Wildfire is an upcoming immersive firefighter simulation game where you (and friends, if you have any) get to attempt to put out dynamic, unpredictable mega-fires.</p>
<p>Mixed across two modes you'll be able to play through a mission-based campaign playable alone or with up to 4 total players. There's also going to be a sandbox mode to really test yourself on the frontlines. I'm definitely interested to see their fire reaction system that they said reacts to wind strength and direction and can "spread across vast hectares of terrain, no two fires or the way you approach them will ever be the same".</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With climate change giving rise to more frequent and extreme wildfires around the world, more than ever before brave firefighters heroically walk into the fire and flames to protect our communities. In Rescue Ops: Wildfire, players will experience the intensity of being on the front lines of one the world’s most dangerous professions, built from the ground up for solo or cooperative play.</p>
<p>From the fire station to the front line, you’re in control. The initial emergency call to the fire station is just the first step, and it’s then that you’ll have to use the many varied tactics, tools, strategies, and mechanics at your disposal to battle the blaze. Operate a fleet of ground and aerial vehicles to assess and travel to the incident site, locate and rescue trapped or injured civilians, call in tactical support, wield forest clearing equipment, and take the fight directly to the mega-fires with intricate and immersive water hose systems and gameplay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fight to control massive dynamic wildfires and determine the best strategies in Campaign and Sandbox mode, alone or with players worldwide.</li>
<li>Operate a fleet of ground and aerial firefighting vehicles including fire engines and helicopters.</li>
<li>Call in tactical support to gain the upper hand: deploy water bombers, have a water supply delivered, or ask for ground support to establish an attack or defense line.</li>
<li>Gear up with cutting-edge equipment, developed with the support and expertise of professional firefighters.</li>
<li>Charge into maps inspired by the world’s wildest regions, each with unique terrain and challenges.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully there won't be any problems with running this one with Proton on Linux / SteamOS. I like the idea of it and the short glimpse we get in the reveal trailer seems like it could actually get pretty intense. </p>

      <title>More Intel CPU security flaws revealed with Branch Privilege Injection</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We only just had the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/vusec-reveal-training-solo-more-security-issues-for-intel-and-arm-cpus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Training Solo from VUSec for Intel and Arm</a>, and now we have another security flaw in Intel CPUs with Branch Privilege Injection.</p>
<p>This was detailed by COMSEC, the computer security group of the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (D-ITET) at ETH Zürich in their <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/microarch/branch-privilege-injection/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new research post</a>. </p>
<p>Who is affected? They said "All intel processors since the 9th generation (Coffee Lake Refresh) are affected by Branch Privilege Injection. However, we have observed predictions bypassing the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier (IBPB) on processors as far back as 7th generation (Kaby Lake)". And while their testing has been on Linux, it is a hardware issue so all systems will be affected by it.</p>
<p>Explaining it they said "Branch Privilege Injection (<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-45332" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CVE-2024-45332</a>) brings back the full might of branch target injection attacks (Spectre-BTI) on Intel. Intel’s hardware mitigations against these types of attacks have held their ground for almost 6 years. In our work, we demonstrate how these mitigations can be broken due to a race condition in Intel CPUs".</p>
<p>Their video example:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jrsOvaN7PaA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b969abc5ed117c16afe29e3546f2d59.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jrsOvaN7PaA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for updates to fix the problem, unfortunately it seems that will come with another performance cut "Intel has developed a microcode update for affected processors and provided us with one to evaluate on Alder Lake. We were able to verify that the microcode update stops our primitives that we use in the paper to detect the vulnerabilities. Our performance evaluation shows up to 2.7% overhead for the microcode mitigation on Alder Lake. We have also evaluated several potential alternative mitigation strategies in software with overheads between 1.6% (Coffee Lake Refresh) and 8.3% (Rocket lake). Please refer to our <a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/wp-content/files/bprc_sec25.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">paper</a> for more details."</p>
<p>Intel has since put up a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-01247.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security advisory</a> on it.</p>
<p>Another time to keep an eye on system and BIOS updates.</p>
<p>AMD / Arm are not affected by this one.</p>

      <title>Rift Riff is a beautifully designed tower defense game about pumping juice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rift Riff is all about jumping through portals (okay Rifts, whatever) and extracting precious juice. Monsters don't like you doing that though but the juice must flow. It's out now with Native Linux support. <em>Note: key sent by the developer.</em></p>
<p>The gameplay loop in this one is <em>incredibly</em> satisfying with an easy to follow learning curve. Split between two sections — The first is where you run around a special world filled with rifts that allow you to access various scenarios, along with the option to grab new towers and upgrades. The second are the scenarios themselves where you get thrown into when you step through a rift.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6025877471747226616gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6025877471747226616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>The maps are quite simple but well-designed with some invitingly clean and wonderfully vibrant art.</em></p>
<p>Once you enter a level, you have a quick run around to find the specific point you need to place down your home tower (the Extractor), which is what does all the juice pumping. Placing down your Extractor then brings up your tactical options of what towers you've unlocked that you wish to bring with you. You've only got a limited amount of slots to fill with different types of towers, and you're then locked into using them for the run of that particular level, so choose wisely depending on what types of critters are going to come at you in waves.</p>
<p>Which is another point that's nice about it. You know what enemy types you will encounter at each enemy rift and where they will come from.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20224757241747223952gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20224757241747223952gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11790846861747223951gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11790846861747223951gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>After picking your tower types, you'll then directly run around the map to place down all your towers in specific points across the map. Each tower costs a certain amount of juice, so careful placement and watching the waves is the key to winning here. As the waves go on, your home tower will be pumping that delicious juice allowing you to continue to place down <em>more</em> towers and upgrade them.</p>
<p>For each scenario you complete you're then given prisms to take back with you to the special world to unlock towers, paths to more rifts, companions and tower upgrades. It's not entirely linear either which is another interesting idea here. As you unlock more, extra paths will open up but you can mostly do them in whatever order you want, as long as you have the tower types and upgrades you think you'll need.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3489457601747224251gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3489457601747224251gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A little bit of minor backtracking here at times, but it's all simple and easy and takes a few seconds to run across so not really a problem at all.</p>
<p>During the scenarios you're an actual person running around the map too, which also serves a purpose. You're not some faceless entity dropping down towers from above. You're the one directly interacting with the world and getting that juice pumped, and you even have some little critter following you that does a small attack, with the option to unlock new companions that have different attacks too.</p>
<p>Check out the full feature trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ePCOuvXU-t0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/65d47e13a8dd21a47d39634ca0ba1914.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ePCOuvXU-t0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the game mechanics involving the enemies are quite unique too, with them having an assortment of different behaviours. Some might just make a run for your Extractor, others might attack the first tower they encounter or only attack towers on fertile ground while they move towards the Extractor.</p>
<p>I was quite burned out after playing endless hours of Bloons TD 6, which is a great game and a fun time in co-op, but thankfully Rift Riff has given me a renewed energy and love of the tower defense genre. Absolutely worth picking up if you love a game that will challenge you without being punishing, while blending in some fun mechanics to keep you on your toes and get you thinking. Accessible difficulty too with the ability to restart not just the whole scenario you're currently on, but the last wave as well. Plus, if you find your towers aren't placed well, you can just refund their full cost back.</p>
<p>Really nice smooth controller support too, making it a great game to get comfortable with and great on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck too.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-1 released with Proton 10 and fixes for Marvel Rivals, Oblivion Remastered and more on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider has released GE-Proton 10-1 bringing over all the changes from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/proton-experimental-updated-to-fix-missing-saves-and-a-new-proton-10-beta-fixes-gamepad-breakage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10 Beta</a> to this community-made compatibility layer, along with lots of specific game fixes for Linux / SteamOS + Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Want to learn more about all the different Proton versions? Be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read my guide</a>. And my guide on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to install GE-Proton</a>. I'll repeat though for people who don't click: you should stick with Valve's own normal Proton unless you need something specific from GE-Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the GE-Proton 10-1 release the main Proton updates are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>GE-Proton rebased on top of Valve's Proton 10 Bleeding Edge.</li>

<p>There's a number of known issues with Wine on Wayland outlined in the release post, that I suggest you read if you were wanting to try the newer Wayland support.</p>
<p>Often with such a major update we end up seeing a few Hotfix builds after, so keep that in mind this may come with new issues.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 update brings new server options like Friends Only and relaxed chat rules for all players</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are on a bit of a roll lately with multiple nice Team Fortress 2 (TF2) updates coming in to fix up various issues. The latest changes the networking options for making your own game, allowing you to set who can join it.</p>
<p>Following on from the updates on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/team-fortress-2-updated-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes-thanks-to-the-community-having-the-source-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">May 1st</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/team-fortress-2-gets-another-update-with-fixes-from-the-community-and-relaxed-in-game-chat-restrictions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">May 12th</a> that pulled in lots of community-made fixes, the May 13th update now allows for Friends Only servers. More players can actually chat in the game now too with the rules being relaxed.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Re-enabled all players to be able to use voice commands and party chat.</li>
<li>Added more detailed options for server visibility and privacy when creating a server.
	<ul>
<li>The "Use Steam Networking" checkbox has been replaced with a dropdown, allowing the creation of Local, Friends Only, Unlisted and Listed servers -- defaulting to Unlisted.</li>
<li>Using map command by default will no longer create a join-able game.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on exit under Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A quick follow-up release came after, as Valve forgot to allow you to join your own server if it was set to Friends Only, because you can't be your own Steam Friend. Oops.</p>

      <title>ZOTAC GAMING ZONE Handheld getting a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 prototype with a Manjaro Linux-based OS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hardware vendor ZOTAC have announced they're working on a new ZOTAC GAMING ZONE Handheld, with a prototype that will be shown off at COMPUTEX 2025 running Linux. The event takes place May 20-23 May, and so hopefully they will be giving out plenty of details then.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Their press announcement was short on any real details simply noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ZOTAC GAMING ZONE Handheld returns with an updated prototype variant, powered by the AMD Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 370 APU, and running an all-new Manjaro Linux-based OS specifically designed for Handheld PCs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19080341711747213429gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - The original ZOTAC ZONE</em></p>
<p>Interesting to note they're going with Manjaro Linux, or at least some variant of it, presumably because Valve have still yet to actually release that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public SteamOS 3 version</a> they announced previously. Valve are at least making steps towards this, with their newly announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/valve-announce-steamos-compatibility-ratings-an-extension-of-steam-deck-verified-for-more-devices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS game compatibility rating system</a>. Or, perhaps ZOTAC simply want a bit more control and don't want to use SteamOS directly. That is the benefit of Linux after all, vendors can customize it exactly how they want, and still get great game compatibility on Steam with Valve's Proton.</p>
<p>Since it's only a prototype, it doesn't mean it will actually see a release. And could end up just shipping with Windows instead like we've seen before like with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AYANEO NEXT LITE</a>.</p>

      <title>Saleblazers mixes shopkeeping and co-op survival with a fresh patch adding UI scaling for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Saleblazers is an Early Access survival game that seems to be a little more on the unique side, with it adding in a shopkeeper element and now it should play better on Steam Deck and perhaps from your sofa on a living room PC too.</p>
<p>Back in April they added in full controller support, so controls should no longer be an issue. With the latest update they've also now added in full UI scaling. Helping you make it be more readable on a small screen or at a distance. They've also made it so it will default to larger scaling on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Nice to see more developers focus on this! It's such a huge accessibility issue with some games having a tiny UI, which is why I'm glad <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/steam-will-soon-list-what-accessibility-features-games-support-on-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve are rolling out accessibility details on Steam pages</a> soon.</p>
<p>The most recent game trailer:</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How long can you survive on a hostile island as a humble shopkeeper? Live off the land, build a cozy shop, and defend against nightly horrors in this open world survival shop simulator for 1-8 players.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wield anything you can pick up as a weapon and hone in on unique roles and playstyles.</li>
<li>Build your own custom retail empire.</li>
<li>Hire NPC employees to run your store for you.</li>
<li>Construct electricity generators to hook up powerful late-game items such as self-checkout machines.</li>
<li>Sell everything to dynamically reactive AI customers with unique needs and budgets.</li>
<li>Gather, fish, farm, craft, buy, fight for, or steal to stock your shelves (beware of the police!).</li>
<li>Main narrative campaign takes you on a treacherous journey across 3 unique handcrafted biomes, each with its own boss, stories, and challenges.</li>
<li>Survive a hostile island environment solo or with friends.</li>
<li>Side quests, mini-bosses, and special orders make the open world come alive.</li>
<li>Spend your free time fishing in the local waters or tending to your garden.</li>
<li>Enable PvP invasions and proximity voice chat for unexpected fun.</li>
<li>Dedicated server (beta) support.</li>
<li>Research and craft 150+ items.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It currently has a Very Positive rating on Steam and Valve previously rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>

      <title>Granvir: Zero Front is a fresh 3rd-person customizable mech-combat prologue out on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love customising mechs and going into battle? Granvir: Zero Front is a new prologue, acting as a long-term demo for the bigger game of Granvir that's due out later. Seems to be worth a look if you love mech action. It's now available on Steam, it's free and has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Save data from this will also carry over to the full game whenever it releases.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HNXPPHE4SL4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/beac91b4b68d8823103d3c5f6e242c17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HNXPPHE4SL4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm a bit of a sucker for games like this, no doubt I'll be spending quite a few hours in it building my mech. Like a nice cross between Mech Warrior and Armored Core.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Granvir: Zero Front is a third person shooter action roguelite featuring mech building. Experience the prelude to the Millennium Horizon campaign in Granvir as the first resistance response to the Millenium Company invasion. Players battle through a route of their choice reaching extraction and completing side objectives at the cost of valuable resources. Between battles, players can swap out parts for upgrades found on the battlefield and manage their campaign by taking on loans to afford ammunition, aiding the locals for support in battle and more.</p>
<p>No campaign is the same as you manage time, resources and your route to each objective. Each zone impacts what services and resources are available. Use down time between missions to refit and upgrade your Granvir to prevail.</p>

      <title>DOOM: The Dark Ages needs workarounds on Linux with AMD GPUs, a fix has been merged into Mesa</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With DOOM: The Dark Ages about to release for everyone on May 15th, and with Advanced Access available, it seems it needs some workarounds to run on Linux with AMD GPUs. This is likely what <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steamos-3-7-6-preview-for-steam-deck-released-fixing-a-doom-the-dark-ages-launch-issue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve already solved in SteamOS for Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>On the Mesa driver GitLab, a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/34944" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">request</a> titled "radv,driconf: Add workarounds for DOOM: The Dark Ages" was merged around 2 hours ago. It notes that the game "crashes and/or misrenders" without the workarounds it provides.</p>
<p>Looking at the code it adds in a new "force_64k_sparse_alignment" configuration setting for AMD RADV (the open source AMD Vulkan driver) and then enables <em>radv_force_64k_sparse_alignment</em>, <em>radv_zero_vram</em>, <em>radv_disable_dedicated_sparse_queue</em> and <em>radv_disable_dcc_stores</em> settings by default in the driver. Which then allows it to run.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1293183581747134022gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see this fix arrive in a Mesa release soon.</p>
<p>Going by the current Mesa release calendar the next bug-fix update is 25.0.6 that's due May 14th (tomorrow) and 25.0.7 due out May 28th. For the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/mesa-25-1-open-source-graphics-drivers-are-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released Mesa 25.1 series</a> the first bug fix update there with 25.1.1 should be due May 21st.</p>

      <title>City-building on the back of a huge creature, The Wandering Village gets a big Story Update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village is such a sweet idea for a city-builder, taking place on the back of a huge walking creature. It's in Early Access with Linux / Steam Deck support and a big new update just arrived.</p>
<p>The Story Update brings with it the chance to finally learn more about the world and its inhabitants. The new Story Mode adds in many new characters and a main quest that sheds more light on the past - and future - of the world and its inhabitants, adds over 10 side quests, multiple new soundtracks, new world map locations and an intense final showdown. Sounds like fun and a unique addition to the game.</p>
<p><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5397957851747128298gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I was absolutely hooked on this one when it released but it did suffer from a big lack of content. However, over the last year they've really expanded it across multiple updates that have really helped. The Ruins update back in March especially with the addition of the new biome to walk through, which came with lots of additional content.</p>
<p>Really can't wait for this one to be content-complete to dive in for another full play-through. It's already great right now though with all these updates.</p>
<details class="spoiler_container"><summary class="spoiler_header">Full patch notes, click me</summary>
<div class="spoiler-content">
<h3>What's New</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Story Mode": Introduces many new characters and a main quest that sheds more light on the past - and future - of the world and its inhabitants, adds over 10 side quests, multiple new soundtracks, new world map locations and an intense final showdown</li>
<li>Added "Food Compostation" research - allowing the Compost Heap to turn food into compost/biogas</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Save files will now show an icon representing the corresponding game mode</li>
<li>Updated icons for all game modes</li>
<li>Various fixes for RTL languages in the UI</li>
<li>Completely reworked how the world map is generated - this should hopefully fix a whole category of map-related bugs. Map bugs may still be visible when loading an existing save file, but they should not affect gameplay too much and should fix themselves after a while</li>
<li>Performance improvements across the board</li>
<li>Gamepad: Radial menu resets when using tools and reopening. No direct filters anymore.</li>
<li>Gamepad: Left on the D-Pad now navigates to the sidebar</li>
<li>Gamepad: Reworked and improved navigation for Research window</li>
<li>Gamepad: Improved navigation for Glossary</li>
<li>Show resources in food stand even if it is disabled</li>
<li>Festival section in Onbu command bar shows all available buildings on a single line</li>
<li>Improved readability for difficulty mode entries in Glossary</li>
<li>Updated sound effects (radio tower, clay deposit)</li>
<li>Resources in food stand can now be traded (e.g. for scavenging events)</li>
<li>Improved display of long titles in Glossary</li>
<li>Proper icon for experimental health potion and some other Onbu missions</li>
<li>Removed obsolete popup when building a monument for the first time</li>
<li>Reworked most game systems to use persistent deterministic random number generators. This should make some random effects that should be consistent actually consistent (such as outcomes of scavenging decisions, spawn locations of wild plants etc), and it helps us to reproduce issues more reliably in the future</li>
<li>Ending credits got a makeover and special soundtrack</li>
<li>Gamepad: hide sidebar glyph while menus are open</li>
<li>Gamepad: costs and rewards of scavenging missions can now be navigated</li>

      <title>RimWorld in space, colony sim Stardeus gets a major upgrade with ship combat</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kodo Linija and publisher Paradox Arc have released a massive update to Stardeus, that's a bit like a RimWorld in space with ship-building. Now, it has ship to ship combat too.</p>
<p>The Ship Combat update introduces ship-to-ship combat and NPC ships from various factions. You can choose to fight these battles and NPC ships can also fight amongst themselves. Additionally, you can now also interact with NPC ships outside of combat which opens up various trading opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10368724341747127361gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">There's various new ship to ship interactions in the update including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hail: </strong>Any ship can hail another to initiate a chat and trigger interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Attack: </strong>A ship can attack another or join an ongoing battle.</li>
<li><strong>Give Gift:</strong> A ship may offer gifts to improve faction relations.</li>
<li><strong>Ask Fuel:</strong> A low-fuel ship can request fuel, affecting relationships.</li>
<li><strong>Trade:</strong> Some ships are open to exchanging goods.</li>
<li><strong>Extortion:</strong> Pirates may demand ransom under threat of combat.</li>
<li><strong>Follow:</strong> A ship may tail another out of curiosity or with later intent.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid: </strong>Threatened ships try to escape and hyperjump away.</li>
<li><strong>Ignore:</strong> Ships may ignore you, which can be a relief when it’s pirates.</li>
<li><strong>Surrender:</strong> Only in combat, and not guaranteed to work.</li>
<li><strong>Insult:</strong> Throw insults and see what happens.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update also improves Hyperspace travel with new engine types that allow warping directly to distant sectors. Another new feature, Return Beacons, lets players mark and revisit previously explored locations for fast travel. There's also various UI enhancements, a number of new story events, quests, weapons and more.</p>
<p>With this update it's really turning into a much bigger and more interesting game.</p>

      <title>Linux GPU Control Application (LACT) gets a new fan control UI, automatic fan mode threshold on Nvidia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux GPU Control Application (LACT) is a wonderful open source app that allows you to tweak various settings for your GPU on Linux. The latest update brings some great new features, like the new fan control UI.</p>
<p>With the new fan control you're able to actually drag around the points, instead of using a series of sliders. It's a much nicer system, giving you fine-grained control over moving it all around to exactly where you want it. And, it just looks cool. There's also a new option in the UI to set which temperature sensor is used for the curve although they said this specific part "this only works on 6000 series and older AMD cards due to hardware limitations)".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2138753401747126629gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2138753401747126629gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the other major changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Automatic fan mode threshold on Nvidia</strong></p>
<p>Most Nvidia GPUs support turning the fan off below a certain temperature, but this only works in the automatic fan control mode. When using manual controls such as a custom fan curve in LACT, the GPU limits possible fan speeds between 30% and 100%.<br/>
	It is now possible to work around this by switching the fan control to automatic below a configured temperature, allowing the fan to turn off at lower temperatures even when using a custom curve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>More information reporting</strong></p>
<p>There is some new information that is now reported by LACT:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenCL details, including supported versions and basic hardware properties</li>
<li>GPU instruction set version on AMD</li>
<li>ROP count on AMD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New config API</strong></p>
<p>There is a new API for GPU configuration in the unix socket that reuses the same format as the config file.<br/>
	Thanks to this new API, the GUI will now ask confirmation for all settings (and automatically revert if not confirmed), while previously this only worked for clockspeed/voltage settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Finished GUI refactor</strong></p>
<p>All UI components now use the Relm4 library to define GTK UIs. This also resolves some problems with the UI starting to lag after applying settings serveral times related to GTK signals handling in the old implementation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Black Mesa &#39;Resonance Decade&#39; update out now with Linux and Steam Deck improvements and a big sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crowbar Collective just released a major update to their Half-Life remake Black Mesa, which includes a whole lot of improvements to celebrate their ten year Steam anniversary.</p>
<p>There's a lot of upgrades for Linux / Steam Deck players here, as it pulls in all the changes from the Beta to the Stable version of the game. To go along with the celebration, the game is 90% off until May 19th so it's truly the perfect time to grab it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7333588061747125964gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>No matter how you choose to play the game, this upgrade should make the experience a lot smoother across the Native Linux version and the Windows version with Proton.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This could potentially be Crowbar signing off from Black Mesa and turning their full attention over to their new game, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/rogue-point-is-a-new-tactical-shooter-from-half-life-remake-black-mesa-developer-crowbar-collective/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Rogue Point that was announced in November 2024</a>.

      <title>Counter-Strike 2 gets weekly missions and a Linux Wayland fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just recently, Valve updated Counter-Strike 2 to entice players to keep coming back with a new permanent weekly mission system. Additionally, a just released update improves the game on Linux with Wayland.</p>
<p>For the new weekly mission system you'll get one mission each week, which will give you some bonus XP. The mission can be seen and accessed via the Main Menu and Play Menu. Along with that update that landed on May 8th, Valve also added in a bunch of new community maps across Competitive, Casual and Deathmatch.</p>
<p>With the update that came May 12th, if you're on Wayland / Linux there's also a nice bug fix noted "Various fixes for running on Linux with SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland". Plus "Various crash fixes and stability improvements" for smoother gameplay.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11068335221747123548gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>CS2 is still the most played game on Steam. With a 24 hour concurrent player peak of 1,530,261. More than double Dota 2, which is the next most popular game.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 gets another update with fixes from the community and relaxed in-game chat restrictions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the latest small update to Team Fortress 2. Following on from the update <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/team-fortress-2-updated-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes-thanks-to-the-community-having-the-source-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released at the start of May</a>, it's another that pulls in some community-provided fixes thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code being available as part of the Source SDK update</a>.</p>
<p>Quite an interesting change here is to do with the chat, as Valve noted they have "Relaxed in-game chat restrictions for certain accounts". The TF2 Reddit was very <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1kl1sc0/free_to_plays_can_use_chat_again_this_is_not_a/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">excited</a> about this one, as it seems certain accounts that couldn't chat before now can.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The full changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed HUD scope animation exploit (GitHub fix from mastercoms).</li>
<li>Fixed case where the door model for Match Status HUD wasn't initialized before setting the submodel (GitHub fix from rabscootle).</li>
<li>Fixed money not automatically being collected in Mann vs. Machine respawn rooms (GitHub fix from mastercoms).</li>
<li>Fixed stuck Mann vs. Machine bots sometimes causing spawn softlocks (GitHub fix from Mentrillum).</li>
<li>Fixed Mann vs. Machine ammo canteens not affecting energy weapons (GitHub fix from Mentrillum).</li>
<li>Fixed 'Shell Extension' achiemevent not working for energy weapons (GitHub fix from Mentrillum).</li>
<li>Fixed not being able to deploy parachute after landing and becoming airborne without jump button (GitHub fix from FlaminSarge).</li>
<li>Fixed some heap allocated KeyValues leaks (GitHub fix from Dmitry Tsarevich).</li>
<li>Relaxed in-game chat restrictions for certain accounts.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I expect we're going to see a lot more updates for TF2 with the community able to hack away at the code now. Nice to see for Valve's still popular game from 2007.</p>

<p>With SteamOS Linux from Valve about to expand onto devices other than the Steam Deck, like the upcoming Lenovo Legion Go S, Valve just announced a SteamOS Compatibility rating system. I was wondering how Valve were planning to handle this, although they never replied to my email on it. Seems they were cooking in the background as always.</p>
<p>This new system is an extension of the Steam Deck Verified system and will sit along side it. Covering any device that will run on SteamOS that's not a Steam Deck, although you only get a small subset of checks compared with Deck Verified. For the new system it will simply say if games are <strong>Compatible</strong> or <strong>SteamOS Unsupported</strong>.</p>
<p>Valve say they "expect over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate". Which isn't a surprise, since Steam Deck Verification <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/steam-deck-hits-18000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit over 18,000 Playable + Verified back in March</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10318916731747083615gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10318916731747083615gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Realistically, Valve can't do a whole lot more than that. Especially when they eventually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release the previously announced public SteamOS 3 Beta</a>, you'll be able to run it on practically anything. So this seems to make the most sense. There's not a whole lot of times where a game will be unsupported, unless they do some annoying kernel-level anti-cheat (we're tracking <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat game compatibility on a dedicated page</a>).</p>
<p>Just like with Deck Verified, it's all automatic and done by Valve directly. Developers don't need to take any action. Although, ensuring their games work with Proton right now or have a supported Native Linux version would of course help it along. Valve said if there's already a Steam Deck rating, it will automatically get a SteamOS Compatibility rating. For titles that don't yet have one, the same process will apply as it does right now where they go into a queue and Valve will regularly put games through it with Steam Deck and SteamOS ratings appearing then together.</p>

      <title>VUSec reveal &#39;Training Solo&#39;, more security issues for Intel and Arm CPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Researchers at VUSec have revealed what they're calling "Training Solo", a set of security issues across Intel and Arm CPUs that sound pretty annoying and serious.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">It's all thoroughly complicated stuff, so they've included a TL;DR (too long; didn't read) in the project post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We present Training Solo, the first systematic analysis of self-training Spectre-v2 attacks that break the core assumption behind domain isolation—even when implemented perfectly. Our work shows that attackers can speculatively hijack control flow within the same domain (e.g., kernel) and leak secrets across privilege boundaries, re-enabling classic Spectre-v2 scenarios without relying on powerful sandboxed environments like eBPF. We created a new test-suite to analyze the branch predictor in a self-training scenario.</p>
<p>We present three new classes of self-training Spectre-v2 attacks, backed by two end-to-end exploits on recent Intel CPUs that leak kernel memory at up to 17 KB/sec. Along the way, we uncovered two new hardware issues (CVE-2024-28956 and CVE-2025-24495) that completely break the domain isolation and re-enable traditional user-user, guest-guest, and even guest-host Spectre-v2 attacks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Going over the blog post they list the three different issues and what generations of CPUs they affect:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>History-based attacks</strong>: "Affected: All Intel CPUs with eIBRS, including Intel’s latest generation Lion Cove which features the BHI_NO feature. Selected ARM CPUs, see vendor website".</li>
<li><strong>Indirect Target Selection (ITS) (CVE-2024-28956)</strong>: "Affected: Intel Core 9th-11th, Intel Xeon 2nd-3rd".</li>
<li><strong>Lion Cove BPU issue (CVE-2025-24495)</strong>: "Affected: Intel CPUs with Lion Cove core (Lunar Lake / Arrow Lake)".</li>
</ul>
<p>Best make sure you check for some updates soon. You'll need a mixture of Linux kernel updates and firmware for this.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck sales still going strong over three years later</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Back in February we hit the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/happy-three-years-to-the-steam-deck-the-linux-gaming-machine-that-changed-everything/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three year mark of Valve's Steam Deck</a> with SteamOS Linux, and as we approach the release of the public <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3 Beta for more devices</a>, here's an updated look at the sales charts.</p>
<p>I've been tracking this for a while now, based on Valve's public Global Weekly Top Sellers list. I last showed an updated list of this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/steam-deck-sales-drop-hard-following-the-nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">back in January</a>, when it initially seemed like the Nintendo Switch 2 announcement had put a dent in sales, which turned out to be an error.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Valve don't like to give out sales numbers, so we have to rely on their own lists which are for <em>revenue</em>, not units sold. So keep in mind that <em>one</em> Steam Deck is equal to <em>multiple</em> of the most expensive games. However, it does still mean they're selling quite a lot regularly when you think about how many hundreds of thousands of copies get sold of the top games each week.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the latest on how it's doing in the Global Weekly Top Sellers chart:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11013784011747051351gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11013784011747051351gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When you look at the last year, the Steam Deck position averages about #4, which is good news for the long-term health of the platform. We are gradually seeing more bigger games releasing that the Steam Deck simply cannot handle, so it will be interesting to see how the sales change over the next 1-2 years. Although, when you look at the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-april-2025-balatro-still-top-but-oblivion-remastered-sneaks-in-second/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most played games for April 2025</a>, it shows that there's an interesting mixture of games new and old in there.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/330-million-hours-played-on-steam-deck-in-2024-up-64-from-2023-steam-year-in-review-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's own year end review of 2024</a>, they noted that Steam Deck had 330 million hours playtime, which was a 64% increase compared with 2023. I do wonder how 2025 will look when compared! I should also note that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a> commissioned market research firm IDC back in February, who <em>estimated</em> nearly 6 million handhelds (multiple vendors) had been sold since 2022 with the Steam Deck number around 4 million.</p>

      <title>Europa Universalis V from Paradox will only support Windows, no Linux or macOS this time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/paradox-interactive-announce-europa-universalis-v/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">big announcement of Europa Universalis V</a> from Paradox Interactive / Paradox Tinto. Now we know it will only officially support Windows.</p>
<p>Quite a break in tradition here for an in-house Paradox strategy title. Their previous games Victoria 3, Imperator: Rome, Stellaris, Europa Universalis IV, Crusader Kings II + Crusader Kings III and Hearts of Iron IV all had both Native Linux and macOS support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17457657691747048326gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Originally, their press team couldn't give me an answer when asked if Linux would be supported, simply telling me the press release info was all they were giving out. However, on the official Paradox forum there's a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/mac-support-or-even-steam-deck-support.1743143/post-30349122" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reply</a> to a post asking about macOS from Paradox Tinto's Studio Manager, Johan Andersson, that clearly says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are currently no plans for anything else than Steam and Windows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least on Linux, you should hopefully be able to run it with Valve's Proton. Still, a shame to see such a big series move away from direct support.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta update brings controller fixes, plus an essential game fix for Desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a Steam Beta update for Steam Deck and Desktop that has some essential fixes, one of which was quite a nuisance bug on Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The May 9th update for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529846144626329322" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Deck</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed controller not working intermittently after Steam restart.</li>
<li>Fixed games failing to connect to the Steam process when the Steam process id contains certain values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desktop Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed regression causing friends and chat windows to not load properly when Steam shows the login window at startup.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That controller not working issue has been happening for ages, so it's nice to see it solved now — hopefully. This is in the Beta / Preview update channels you need to opt into. In case you missed it, another recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/steam-deck-gets-a-battery-charge-limit-control-in-the-latest-beta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Beta update also finally added a battery charge limit option</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">And for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545608743298008902?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Desktop</a>:</p>

      <title>End of 10 is a campaign to move people over to Linux with Windows 10 support ending</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Windows 10 is close to being dead now, with support ending this year. So why not try out Linux? Instead of getting a whole new system and having to deal with the increasing amount of AI junk and adverts in Windows 11.</p>
<p>This is where the <a href="http://endof10.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">End of 10</a> campaign has stepped in to get events sorted, and to help more people get into Linux.  Considering that Microsoft are still forcing various requirements for Windows 11, that a whole lot of PCs can't do, it makes sense to try and do something about it that doesn't end up resulting in forcing people into buying new hardware.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4989910651747039214gol1.png"/></p>
<p>On their website that have a growing list of places to get direct help, events you can appear at to get help and instructions on downloading and installing Linux. They also list some pretty standard reasons for trying Linux like it being cheaper, there's no adverts, you having more control and so on.</p>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://endof10.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">End of 10 website</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps something worth sharing to some friends and family that will soon be dealing with this issue.</p>
<p>And hey, with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/fedora-linux-42-is-out-now-with-kde-plasma-desktop-promoted-and-x86-programs-on-arm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fedora 42 out now</a> that has KDE Plasma being promoted to a flagship edition status, there's never been a better time to try it out. KDE Plasma is my favourite desktop environment since it has a lot of customization possibilities, but also resembles a more Windows-like UI compared with GNOME. Worth getting some more people you know to give it a shot.</p>

      <title>TF2 mod Open Fortress is coming to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open Fortress is a mod for Valve's Team Fortress 2 and now it's getting a standalone release on Steam, thanks again to Valve adding the TF2 source code to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Source SDK</a>. A number of other mods are getting Steam releases like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/04/team-fortress-2-legacy-not-to-be-confused-with-team-fortress-2-classic-is-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2 Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-classic-is-coming-to-steam-thanks-to-valve-adding-tf2-to-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Team Fortress 2 Classic</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10957253921747038192gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open Fortress is a fully custom mod that builds on Team Fortress 2’s world-famous gunplay to create a smooth, stylish experience inspired by old-school FPS games. The Open Fortress experience is lovingly hand-crafted to ensure the best possible vibes, remaining true to the essence of TF2’s mid-century aesthetic while taking earnest inspiration from seventies action flicks. Featuring all new maps, all new guns, and an original soundtrack inspired by the funky tunes of the era.</p>
<p>Set several years after the Gravel War, Open Fortress envisions a new age in the Team Fortress universe. In the futuristic world of 1979, the heart of mercenary gunfighting has shifted from covert war in the Badlands of New Mexico to a worldwide free-for-all! Battle it out on a level playing field to seize weapons, power-ups, and a place on the podium from your foes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Alpha release is available via <a href="https://openfortress.fun/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their website</a> for now. Currently, the Steam page only has Windows system requirements, so it's not clear if the standalone release will have a Native Linux version.</p>
<p>You can also follow their official account on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/openfortress.fun" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental updated to fix missing saves and a new Proton 10 Beta fixes gamepad breakage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released two Proton updates just as the weekend hit, both containing some essential fixes for running Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck. So here's all that's new for Proton Experimental and the latest Proton 10 Beta.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The update for <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> was a small one but it has an important fix for potentially missing saves:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam Cloud downloads could interfere with new Proton prefix creation leading to missing Steam Cloud saves. If any saves are missing after Proton 10 use, check for directories containing <code class="inline-code">corrupted_pfx</code> in the name in your Steam Library - the missing files should be present there.</li>
<li>Fixed some games using DirectStorage not working with Intel GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good reminder that you should only be using Proton Experimental for <em>testing</em> or when you <em>need</em> the specific fixes included for certain games. Issues will appear since it's a testing area for Valve. Stick to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">main numbered versions of Proton</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the <strong>Proton 10.0-1f (beta)</strong> release it should hopefully fix up gamepads, for people who were reporting issues with them disconnecting during gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam Cloud downloads could interfere with new Proton prefix creation leading to missing Steam Cloud saves. If any saves are missing after Proton 10 use, check for directories containing <code class="inline-code">corrupted_pfx</code> in the name in your Steam Library - the missing files should be present there.</li>
<li>Fixed Space Engineers crashing on a steam deck after changing controller setting with a fresh Proton prefix.</li>
<li>Fixed gamepads randomly stopping working on some setups.</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.6 Preview for Steam Deck released, fixing a DOOM: The Dark Ages launch issue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the release of DOOM: The Dark Ages on May 15th, Valve have released an update for SteamOS for Steam Deck to get it to actually run.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean it will actually perform well, just that the game will actually run on SteamOS. Good for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when Valve actually release that Beta for more devices</a> too. Considering DOOM: The Dark Ages has Ray Tracing as a <em>requirement</em>, it probably wasn't going to run great on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/529846144626329379" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SteamOS 3.7.6 Preview: It Runs DOOM</p>
<p>Note: This update is for the Steam Deck Preview channel, and includes new features that are still being tested. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a launch failure with DOOM: The Dark Ages.</li>
