      <title>Europa Universalis IV is now finally available on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After many years being released on Steam back in 2013, <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/europa_universalis_iv" target="_blank">Europa Universalis IV</a> from Paradox has finally arrived on game store <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>. So for those of you who prefer it, for their DRM-free stance, now is your time.</p>
<p>This classic grand strategy game gives you control of a nation through four dramatic centuries. Rule your land and dominate the world with unparalleled freedom, depth and historical accuracy. Write a new history of the world and build an empire for the ages. During GOG's Black Friday sale, it's also 80% off, so seems like a good time to grab a copy.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KviqRb6vHfk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ecf58da4af6aa9736b7b3a7002e48dd9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KviqRb6vHfk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep Historical Settings - Start before the Renaissance on a map of the world as it was then. Choose from any of hundreds of nations and then rule up to the Age of Revolutions. Or, if you wish, start your game at any date in the span, with historical monarchs and other leaders.</li>
<li>History come to life - Hundreds of dynamic historical events are yours to experience, from merely troubling civil wars to world changing moments like the Protestant Reformation. Discover and settle the New World, or resist European conquest.</li>
<li>Fill your pockets - Control the flow of trade by developing your trade power in key provinces, using ships and governmental policy to bring the wealth of the world to your own ports.</li>
<li>War and Peace - Build alliances into iron bonds, cemented by royal marriage or play a flexible hand, keeping your options open. Strike when your enemies are weak, using your armies to grab new land and new potential riches.</li>
<li>Good rulers, good times - Your nation’s pace of development will be heavily influenced by the person on the throne. Experience rapid development under a skilled monarch only to see things slow down when a less competent heir takes over. Plan for the future by spending monarch power wisely.</li>
<li>Scientific revolution - Four hundred years of research into new ways of war, administration and trade are available. Unlock new weapons, new buildings and new ship types. Over time, you can embrace national ideas that represent both your historic legacy and your ambitions for the future.</li>
<li>From grand voyages of discovery to religious wars to revolutionary governments, the entire history of the early modern world waits for you to rewrite it in Europa Universalis IV.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also quite a <em>lot</em> of DLC, which you can see on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20221123_launch_europa_universalis_iv" target="_blank">main page</a>.</p>

      <title>Quiet survival adventure Aquamarine got a big free Explorer&#39;s Edition upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Aquamarine has some great artwork but it seems the initial release didn't stick with a lot of people, which hopefully the new free Explorer's Edition upgrade will solve. The developers said they have "listening to our players' comments since the game initially released in January 2022, and have brought their feedback and suggestions to this huge, game-changing update".</p>
<p>What's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Overall <strong>difficulty has been refined and balanced for multiple game modes</strong>, including NORMAL, RELAXED, EXPLORE, and EXPERT</li>
<li><strong>New game mode EXPLORE</strong> introduces the option to safely experience the world &amp; story without consequences</li>
<li><strong>New game mode EXPERT </strong>introduces a "hardcore" difficulty option for those looking for a serious test of their survival skills and knowledge of the planet's ecosystem</li>
<li>A <strong>brand-new save system</strong> has been added, giving players three individual save slots to load and reset as they wish</li>
<li>Multiple <strong>accessibility options</strong> have been added, including an optional tool-tip system that explains the functions of each of control</li>
<li>New <strong>environment art and creature animations</strong> have been added to each exploration area</li>
<li><strong>Localization</strong> has been added in English, French, Spanish, Chinese (Simplified), and Thai</li>
<li><strong>Full gamepad support</strong> has been added</li>
<li>Plus tons of bug fixes, polish updates, performance optimizations, and much more...</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Next-Gen update to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with FSR 2.1 should be fun for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, in case you haven't heard, is getting a free next-gen update releasing on December 14th and it might make it even better on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>While it is already Steam Deck Verified, a few additions to the new version sound like they might improve it. The big one is FSR 2.1, which should allow you to get some better performance and battery life with it. It's worked wonders for other games, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0Bgy5Eabw" target="_blank">Dying Light 2</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvuDVGMPQNk" target="_blank">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Another nice addition is the ability to scale up subtitles, dialogue text and NPC chatter (things all games should have!).</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Eqvcbfsk8IU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e72e3b43753c1992873acd4d5c00abe7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Eqvcbfsk8IU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of what's been announced includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved visuals - Ray Tracing, improved Screen Space Reflections, improved foliage, better textures and more visual improvements are coming to the game. Enjoy them to the fullest thanks to FSR 2.1 and DLSS 3 support!</li>
<li>Camera, controls and UI changes - Rediscover the Continent from a new perspective — we've added an alternative camera option that'll bring you closer to the action. Combined with the alternative Quick Sign Casting option, map filtering and the option to dynamically hide the minimap, it will make exploration even more exciting than before!</li>
<li>Photo mode - Capture the moment with the added photo mode! Does that mean there will be a The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt photo mode contest in the near future? Maybe.</li>
<li>Integrated mods - We've included some community-made favourites in addition to our own modifications.</li>
<li>Quest fixes - You've been asking for them — and we couldn't say no! The next-gen update has also been an opportunity to revisit some of the issues in the quests. The free next-gen update brings fixes to <em>From Ofier's Distant Shores</em>, <em>Scavenger Hunt: Wolf School Gear</em> and more!</li>
<li>Netflix DLC -We have a very special treat for all of the fans of the Netflix show! Enjoy alternative looks for Dandelion and Nilfgaardian soldiers, as well as a new quest, inspired by the show, where you'll be able to get diagrams for new equipment for Geralt. What's the quest? Shhh! No spoilers!</li>
<li>Cross-progression - A feature you know from Cyberpunk 2077 — play the game how you like, wherever you like and carry over your latest save between platforms.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe I'll finally do a full play-through thanks to all these additions coming. Sounds quite exciting! Nice to see that's it's going to be a free update too, not some kind of "remastered" edition you have to pay extra for.</p>

      <title>Tower-defense base-building mining game Lumencraft adds procedural maps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lumencraft is a really interesting game that blends together elements of tower-defense, base-building, mining and a little Deep Rock Galactic in a top-down view. A big new release is out now and it's Steam Deck Verified with Native Linux support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8376991151669293033gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8376991151669293033gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the new version include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>​​​​​​Procedural maps: from baked handcrafted maps to 100% procedurally generated roguelike levels!</li>
<li>New Weapon: Lumenal Discharger - a dramatic armament charged with a lightning beam.</li>
<li>Balance changes:many costs changed from metal to Lumen, requirements added for some upgrades (eg. have a building placed)</li>
<li>New Steam achievements: unlock 80 new achievements - some are easy and some are tricky!</li>
<li>New languages: the game is now available in French, Spanish and Russian.</li>
<li>Improvements and fixes: various UI, VFX, and sound changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been loving watching this one grow, it scratches multiple gaming itches at the same time but the lack of variety in the levels was a downside they've now nicely solved so you can play fresh each time. A full release is planned next year, and their roadmap suggests they will add online multiplayer if its enough of a success to fund it.</p>
<p>My main issue with it currently, is that in full-screen it doesn't cover the KDE Plasma menu at the bottom. A little annoying on desktop but not a problem on Steam Deck of course.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/lumencraft?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713810/Lumencraft/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>KDE has a fundraiser for all their work like the Plasma desktop (used by Steam Deck)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE have put up a <a href="https://kde.org/bluefriday/" target="_blank">new fundraising platform</a>, with an aim to make it easier for people to donate with a tongue-in-cheek anti-black-friday event they're calling Blue Friday.</p>
<p>Developer Nate Graham mentioned in a <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2022/11/23/a-better-fundraising-platform/" target="_blank">blog post</a> that their previous way of raising funds was split between two platforms, one for single donations and a totally different one for reoccurring donations. They've now put up a new one that allows you to specify if your donation is one time, monthly or annually.</p>
<p>The donations will go towards all their work in things like the Plasma desktop environment, that Valve ships for the desktop mode on the Steam Deck, Plasma Mobile for phones and tablets, all the various KDE apps like the Dolphin file manage or KDE Connect and much more.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will be a success, as KDE have been going from strength to strength lately and they're currently hiring for a <a href="https://ev.kde.org/resources/callforproposals-platform2022/" target="_blank">Software Platform Engineer</a> to work on many different parts of the KDE system as a whole.</p>
<p>The fundraiser has a current goal of €15,000.</p>

      <title>WW1 FPS &#39;Isonzo&#39; is getting a free expansion on December 5th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Isonzo from M2H, BlackMill Games is set to get bigger on December 5th, with the release of a free expansion featuring the Germans.</p>
<p>The Caporetto expansion for Isonzo will be free, with an option for players to expand their visual customization options for the German Empire with the Royal Units DLC. As per their roadmap, this is one of three expansions that are planned and all will be free. They have multiple new maps planned to be added in too, along with a new game mode planned next year.</p>
<p>Here's the expansion teaser:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w58hPwegk1I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cfb75e8dd023abc1af26734175b76b4e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w58hPwegk1I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Wow, that was sure a <em>teaser</em> huh? </p>
<p>The full complement of Isonzo classes are represented in the new German Empire faction including the Mountaineer, with uniforms, weapons and equipment based on historical research to authentically recreate the German army as it was on the Italian Front. They're a fully fledged fighting force consisting of the previously revealed Stoßtrupp and the Rifleman, amongst others, and are ready to take the fight to the Italian defenders of Monte Kolovrat – the first of three maps to be added as part of the Battle of Caporetto Offensive.</p>
<p>Jos Hoebe, Creative Director and co-founder of the WW1 Game Series says: “We’re looking forward to releasing the free Caporetto expansion for Isonzo this December 5 – the first of several free updates we have planned. It expands Isonzo to cover more of the key aspects of the war on the Italian Front, adding both German Empire troops and the first part of a new German Offensive.”</p>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 2 has a Native Linux port available now, more stable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As promised recently, Rogue Legacy 2 from Cellar Door Games now has a Native Linux version available to give you the best experience possible on Steam Deck and Linux desktop.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck, the Windows version with Proton was suffering from crashing issues that the new Native Linux version should solve. You will need to opt into this manually in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu and select the Steam Linux Runtime.</p>
<p>"Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be a Ranger. She could also be vegan. It’s a new experience every time. Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4VFRTUxPIwA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77ae6b365edfac51ccdeedba90f53b99.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4VFRTUxPIwA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Have to admit, not only is it a great action-platformer metroidvania but it also has a little comedic flair thrown in too. Can't tell you the amount of laughs I had when an heir's ability was "Super IBS" that enabled them to fart, allowing higher jumps and it was as amusing as expected.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9350650551669222840gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9350650551669222840gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In my time playing it, I can confirm it's another quality port. The only weird issue I encountered was a Stadia Controller forcing the camera to pan upwards, but it was fine with keyboard and an Xbox controller. Admittedly that's going to be a very tiny amount of people seeing it. Other than that, very smooth and stable across both desktop Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Enjoy the challenge in games like Dead Cells? You'll probably like this a lot too.</p>
<p>On desktop with Fedora, as expected it's silky smooth on max settings. On Steam Deck, keeping it to 40Hz (45Hz in the below video though, as my monitor doesn't work with 40Hz) resulted in a smooth experience too, along with some great battery life. Another quality title not to be missed.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253920/Rogue_Legacy_2/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a> and it's 25% off in the Autumn Sale.</p>

      <title>Sid Meier&#39;s Civilization VI gets a &#39;Leader Pass&#39;, breaks it on Linux and macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Firaxis Games recently launched their new Leader Pass for Sid Meier's Civilization VI, and it seems they broke it on both macOS and Linux.</p>
<p>The Linux and macOS versions were done by Aspyr Media, who don't really do ports any more. The store page on Steam still shows both as clearly supported though, and the new Leader Pass indicates both are supported platforms too. However, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/289070/discussions/0/340412628172881722/" target="_blank">macOS</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/289070/discussions/0/144512942755435118/" target="_blank">Linux</a> support topics on Steam are filling up with people reporting the game is now broken or has major issues on these platforms.</p>
<p>For the Linux version, it seems the update actually <em>downgraded</em> the game to a much older version "1.0.1.104" (I was able to use an old <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/04/civilization-vi-has-a-final-free-update-of-the-season-hinting-at-more/" target="_blank">workaround</a> - see the bottom, to get it to launch) with the latest being 1.0.12.9. Even for people on macOS who have managed workarounds, some are reporting other major <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/289070/discussions/0/340412628172881722/?ctp=265#c3589960830785074484" target="_blank">problems</a> like Civ Vi eating all their RAM.</p>
<p>At least for Linux users, a workaround is to use Proton on it to run the Windows version. Here though, some users report the 2K Launcher doesn't work, but for me it was fine. You can skip the 2K Launcher on Linux with Proton by adding this as a launch argument for the game on Steam:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">eval $( echo "%command%" | sed "s/2KLauncher\/LauncherPatcher.exe'.*/Base\/Binaries\/Win64Steam\/CivilizationVI.exe'/" )</code></p>
<p>It's a shame, as it shows even though they're selling it clearly as supported, seemingly no one at Firaxis / 2K / Aspyr is even testing either Linux or macOS now.</p>
<p>I've reached out to the publisher to see if they have anything to say about what is happening, although they never replied  to my initial email asking about the new DLC. I've also reached out to Aspyr Meda directly about it. Will update if either reply.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 515.86.01 fixes Spider-Man Remastered, plus black screen issues on RTX 30</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released a fresh update to their stable driver series for Linux with 515.86.01 with some fixes.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in version <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/194662/en-us/" target="_blank">515.86.01</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to correctly limit the allowed values for GPUTargetFanSpeed to match the existing valid fan speed ranges for supported NVIDIA GPUs. The valid ranges are 30%-100% for Ampere or newer GPUs, and 1%-100% for older GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs when starting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crash with Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also being a bit confusing on the 525.53 that went into Beta <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/nvidia-52553-beta-is-out-now-for-linux/" target="_blank">earlier this month</a>. Depending on where you look it's either <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/194315/en-uk" target="_blank">Beta</a> or it's <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/194518/en-uk" target="_blank">not</a> — both links are the same driver on different pages and one shows it not in Beta. Seems not even NVIDIA know what their own drivers are doing huh?</p>

<li>Dock + 65W Charger + 2TB M.2 SSD - $259.99 (Use the code JS40 to save $40, you can get one at $219.99)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even better, for people who already purchased one, they're going to be sending you out a free 65W charger or if you email them you can get $20 sent back to you. They don't exactly need to do this, companies run sales and change up bundles all the time but this is a nice touch.</p>
<p>Why are they now including a charger? According to testing, Valve's official charger wasn't providing enough power to ensure the SSD could continue to be powered so they're ensuring people get the best experience.</p>
<p>You can see my previous little overview of it in the below video:</p>

      <title>Valve puts up Proton Next (7.0-5) to provide easier testing of future upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proton Next has been announced by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1595247355879911424" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, as an easier way to check out and test the upcoming stable releases of new Proton versions for Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It is mostly the same as the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/proton-70-5-is-coming-soon-improving-steam-deck-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Release Candidate for Proton 7.0-5</a> that was put up in October. However, it's now its own entry in Steam as Proton Next. This makes it far easier to test, since you can set it to games individually, instead of opting into a Beta with the current main version of Proton.</p>
<p>This new Proton Next will only become available when there is a new version of Proton ready for testing, and once stable it will be retired. So games you've set to it, would likely just get bumped to the main version of Proton since it would replace it.</p>
<p>Here's what's now available in Proton Next as version 7.0-5:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The following games are now playable:
<ul>
<li>Rift</li>
<li>Unravel 2</li>
<li>Airborne Kingdom</li>
<li>Nancy Drew: Legend of the Crystal Skull</li>
<li>Re-Volt</li>
<li>Aspire: Ina's Tale</li>
<li>Battle Realms: Zen Edition</li>
<li>Deathsmiles II</li>
<li>Primal Carnage: Extinction</li>
<li>Pico Park Classic Edition</li>
<li>Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind</li>
<li>Darkstar One</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Emperor Tomb</li>
<li>Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fix Batman: Arkham City GOTY launching in the background on Steam Deck when set to fullscreen.</li>
<li>Fix Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered displaying dialog about outdated drivers on AMD systems.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake) having no audio.</li>
<li>Fix Return to Monkey Island not reacting to mouse clicks after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix upsidedown videos in VRChat and many other games.</li>
<li>Fix Call of Duty Black Ops II Zombies and Multiplayer hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fix Bail or Jail crashing when opening the Terms of Serivce.</li>
<li>Improve GTA V situation with not loading textures.</li>
<li>Fix Red Dead Redemption 2 crashing after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fix Final Fantasy XIV Online launcher functionality after game update.</li>
<li>Fix cutscene stutter in Disgaea 5.</li>
<li>Fix Thrustmaster HOTAS having non-functional dial in Elite Dangerous.</li>
<li>Fix Planet Zoo randomly crashing.</li>
<li>Fix SCP: Secret Labratory not being playable after a recent game update (again).</li>
<li>Fix Tekken 7 crashing at launch.</li>
<li>Fix Armello hanging on exit.</li>
<li>Fix Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization freezing after the tutorial.</li>
<li>Fix Space Engineers intro video not playing correctly.</li>
<li>Fix Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen videos not playing correctly.</li>
<li>Implement network video support for VRChat.</li>
<li>Update dxvk to v1.10.3-28-ge3daa699.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">Changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>To opt into it, go into the Properties of a game on Steam and go into the Compatibility menu. Tick the box on the right and select Proton Next from the dropdown:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20952225211669198408gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20952225211669198408gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>You can do the same on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>There's a few version of the official Proton now so here's a brief explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proton Experimental - Gets regular updates, with features and fixes not ready for everyone and can include some breaking changes that need new driver versions.</li>
<li>Proton Next - The upcoming new stable version of Proton that needs testing.</li>
<li>Proton Hotfix - A few extra fixes for specific games.</li>
<li>Proton 7.0-x - The current stable series of Proton used for most Windows games on Linux / Steam Deck.</li>
<li>There's also the Proton 6.3 series, Proton 5.0 series, Proton 4.2 and so on - these are all older stable versions left up in case specific games need them.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Watch your wallet run away from you as the Steam Autumn Sale 2022 is here</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I hear the faint sound of my wallet trying to escape, as the Steam Autumn Sale 2022 is now live with the usual massive discounts on thousands of games. Running until November 29th at 10am PT / 6pm UTC.</p>
<p>On top of that Valve are also kicking off the Steam Awards, with a brand new category (inspired by the Steam Deck) of "Best Game on the Go". Who bets Vampire Survivors wins that? I wouldn't be surprised.</p>
<p>Their trailer is below for the event:</p>

<p>This time I've gone over and picked out some deals for you on games I know that are good (that I've actually played). I'll be mainly sticking to <u>Steam Deck Verified</u> titles, with a note in brackets if they have a Native Linux version or the rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> (also not going below a Gold rating on ProtonDB for desktop Linux).</p>

      <title>Armello gets full Linux support restored with cross-platform online play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is really great to see! Armello from developer League of Geeks has a fresh <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/290340/view/3494259338696364285" target="_blank">update</a> out, and it restores full Linux support. Armello is a lot of fun to play with friends, and quite a few hours were put into it by me at the original release playing it online together with our contributor Samsai.</p>
<p>For those who don't know what it is: Armello is a grand swashbuckling adventure that combines three styles of play; The deep tactics of card games with the rich strategy of table top board games, combined with a character role-playing system.</p>
<p>So what happened? <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/armello-removes-advertising-linux-and-macos-support-due-to-their-party-system/" target="_blank">Back in July</a>, the developer stopped advertising Linux (and macOS) support on it, due to an update that pulled in a whole new online system with their service provider actually dropping both platforms, so they were stuck. Thankfully, their provider has now hooked up full support for both and so League of Geeks "pounced on the opportunity to restore Party functionality here".</p>
<p>With the update it now means players on Linux and macOS are once again fully supported, advertised as being so and have access to cross-platform online play (with everyone even consoles) with the party system.</p>

      <title>Ubisoft making a return to Steam with Assassin&#39;s Creed Valhalla on December 6th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Linux desktop and Steam Deck players! Assassin's Creed Valhalla is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on December 6th.</p>
<p>Yet another company who tried vanishing to their own launcher, or to the Epic Store, is returning to Steam. Not really surprising though, considering Steam is still the biggest PC store around. I'll be giving it a run on Steam Deck when it releases, so I'll let you know what to expect from it.</p>
<p>This is not the only title coming to Steam, as Ubisoft confirmed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-valhalla-headed-to-steam" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a> that Anno 1800 and Roller Champions will also be getting a Steam release.</p>
<p>Hopefully Ubisoft Connect won't be too problematic for Proton, so that players on Linux desktop and Steam can get to play them too. Considering how big a title like Assassin's Creed Valhalla is, I've no doubt if there's major problems that Valve would promptly look into getting it working.</p>

      <title>Nintendo goes after SteamGridDB, likely for people doing emulation on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems with all the people emulating games on the Steam Deck and how popular doing so has become, Nintendo has continued to take notice and fired off some DMCA requests to have images taken down (thanks <a href="https://gbatemp.net/threads/nintendo-issues-dmca-takedowns-for-specific-switch-games-to-art-library-sharing-site-steamgriddb.621911/" target="_blank">GBAtemp</a>).</p>
<p>To get started with: what is SteamGridDB? It's a website that hosts various images for various games, to help you add fancy artwork into Non-Steam games you add into your Steam Library. So instead of seeing Steam's default image for Non-Steam games, you get it all looking nice. Naturally, this means people will be uploading plenty of images they don't own, and often the official game images for various games on other platforms for when people are doing emulation.</p>
<p>Nintendo being clearly unhappy with this, fired off many DMCA requests and now you might spot several images across the likes of (each link an example of one removed): <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272687" target="_blank">Pokémon Scarlet</a>, <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272686" target="_blank">Pokémon Violet</a>, <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272688" target="_blank">Splatoon 3</a>, <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272690" target="_blank">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>, <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272689" target="_blank">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, and <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/grid/272446" target="_blank">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20183999121669121277gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20183999121669121277gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's not just for emulation though, it has game pictures for tons of games that you can use as an alternative to the official images included with Steam.</p>

      <title>Steam Play compatibility tool Luxtorpeda moves to Godot Engine for the UI</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a Steam Play compatibility tool (like Proton), that allows you to run various games on Steam with Native Linux game engines.</p>
<p>What's the point? Well, many games on Steam are old and no longer updated. However, a growing amount have community-build game engines that dramatically upgrade them and Luxtorpeda allows you to just install them directly in Steam. I previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">did a guide</a> on how to use it, and while focused on the Steam Deck the same applies to using it on a Linux desktop:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BxIKfWGdSh0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e793555e6ab33bed36d08111e87bfb2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BxIKfWGdSh0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From what the developer told us in the <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Discord</a>, here's what's changed in Luxtorpeda version 60:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* Move GUI to Godot, using godot-rust<br/>
    * godot-rust allows for the underlying code for downloading, extracting, etc to stay the same in rust, and then allow for fairly simple communication between Godot and rust, using the Godot signal method. The Godot layer handles user input and the UI, and rust handles all the pieces behind the scenes<br/>
    * This move makes maintaining the UI easier, with being able to use the many built-in Godot features and the editor<br/>
    * Controller and window support, such as DPI, is now handled by Godot, instead of custom code on top of SDL2<br/>
    * Instead of opening individual windows for each action (like choices, download progress, etc), one Godot window is used for the full flow until the game has closed, which should make the UI flow better<br/>
* Progress is now shown for install and setup steps, to make it clearer to the user what is going on<br/>
* [striezel] misc - fix a typo<br/>
* [striezel] Update crate dependencies<br/>
* [striezel] update actions used in GitHub Actions workflow</p>
<p>The big part of that is moving the UI to Godot, using godot-rust to keep all the logic inside rust. This was mainly to take advantage of Godot's easy to use editor and all the GUI tools available. This should make creating and maintaining UI easier. If you run into any issues with it, please feel free to open a issue about it or talk to me on discord.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a quick example, with Morrowind in Steam set to use Luxtorpeda, you will see after downloading the UI that allows you to pick what to run it with:</p>

      <title>Pixel-art open-world pirating adventure Arcane Waters is now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I just finished watching all of Black Sails (which was fantastic) and was in the mood for some pirating fun, so the Early Access release of Arcane Waters makes for good timing. This is a new pixel-art open-world single-player and online pirating adventure game. </p>
<p>Featuring a great big mix of gameplay mechanics including trading, exploration, combat, and farming. You get to explore handcrafted sea and land maps, sail to visit remote towns to trade goods, hunt for treasure in dangerous waters and lands filled with monsters, or play against other pirates in PvP sea battles. After you've done all that, go back to your farm to tend to your crops and make some more monies to buy and upgrade your fleet.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nV5wIPazemk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a719bcbc60c2b23692440dfa3de1b07d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nV5wIPazemk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer expects to remain in Early Access until some time next year. Currently it has a few of the unique regions ready to explore, with 7 planned for the full game but they said the core gameplay elements are done and included in the game right now.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Embark on thrilling online co-op voyages. Work together with a group of up to 6 real-life people and explore unchart- ed territories. Rogue pirates and monsters await you in the waters and on land. Can you survive and get the treasure waiting for you at the end?</li>
<li>Battle in intense online PvP arenas. Two teams of up to 24 fight against each other in MOBA-like arenas. Destroy the enemy’s towers and base before they destroy your’s!</li>
<li>Farm, craft &amp; trade. When you need a break from all of the action, enjoy farming, crafting new equipment and trading your items all across the world!</li>
</ul>

      <title>SteamOS 3.4 gets a fix for Resident Evil 4, plus new Steam Deck Client Beta out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released two updates for the Steam Deck. One being an OS update for SteamOS 3.4 and the other being another Deck Beta Client update. Both of these updates are available in the Preview channel. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>For the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3497637038418713123" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.4 Preview update</a>, the only change is a regression fix that gets Resident Evil 4 working again. Nice to see they're taking on reports from players, like another previous update fixing Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>Here's what's in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3497637038418820025" target="_blank">Steam Deck Client Beta</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed controllers being treated as Xbox One controllers by default when defining their layout</li>
<li>Fixed the L3/R3 buttons not being detected for some third party PS3 controllers</li>
<li>Added Left and Right Stick Deflection as an option for Gyro Activation Buttons. Stick deflection is no longer considered a part of "Touch" (Cap Sense) on SteamDeck.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed getting the wrong personalization (colors, etc.) for streaming PS4 controllers</li>
<li>Fixed streaming Bluetooth controllers not turning off</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you didn't see it, here's a look at the new Spider-Man: Miles Morales on Steam Deck and getting it to run smoothly at 30FPS with some changed settings:</p>

      <title>Half-Life 2, Portal, Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2 all get upgraded with DXVK 2.0 Vulkan</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the recent release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/vulkan-based-d3d9-10-and-11-translation-layer-dxvk-version-20-out-now/" target="_blank">DXVK 2.0</a>, the Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan translation layer, it pulled in DXVK-Native for Native Linux builds and so Valve has upgraded Half-Life 2, Portal, Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? Well, the original Linux ports used TOGL to convert the original Windows Direct3D rendering system over to OpenGL. Then Valve began updating each of them all to DXVK last year to give them better performance on Linux desktop and Steam Deck. With DXVK 2.0, they're ready to take advantage of all the extra performance improvements to be found there.</p>
<p>Why the need for the translation between graphics APIs? This was before Source 2, which eventually gained Native Vulkan support, so these older ports didn't have it available. Portal 2 additionally noted in the update it had "Fixed some controller input bugs" as well. Nice.</p>
<p>Great to see Valve support their classic titles for so long.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will find out whatever <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/valve-filed-a-computer-game-software-trademark-for-neon-prime/" target="_blank">NEON PRIME</a> actually is from Valve soon.</p>

      <title>Inspired by F.E.A.R., the retro FPS &#39;Selaco&#39; is getting a big demo upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Possibly one of the most promising retro-styled FPS games coming to Linux, Selaco is getting a huge demo upgrade next month. Built with GZDoom, it's ridiculously impressive with so much going on it's hard to believe it's using that game engine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Selaco is a brand new original shooter running on GZDoom, featuring thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart AI and a fleshed out story taking place within an immersive game world. It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing traditional retro-FPS elements from QUAKE and DOOM, along with some more modern features. Together with professional artists who work in the industry, several having worked on successful throwback FPS games in the past, Selaco is a fully fleshed out world full of character, action, and mystery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arriving on December 16th, here's what's coming to the updated demo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full gamepad &amp; Steam deck Support</li>
<li>Level-design Enhancements</li>
<li>Hundreds of Quality of Life Improvements</li>
<li>Improved AI</li>
<li>Rebalanced Gameplay</li>
<li>Art Pass</li>
<li>Performance Optimizations</li>
</ul>
<p>See their new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ECS1fBJMgpQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f9597c1e7805eaee27155a15e737ecae.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ECS1fBJMgpQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I cannot wait to get my hands on this. The initial demo was very impressive and a lot of fun to play, and these upgrades to it sound quite fantastic.</p>

      <title>Take on Chess-based enemies in the roguelike Chess Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another developer attempting to turn the classic Chess into something weird and wonderful. Chess Survivors takes set pieces and moves from Chess, sticks it into a blender and out came a grid based, quick-turn, roguelike.</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access, the developer said they plan to keep it under development there for at least until Summer 2023. During development they plan to add in more unique characters, abilities, game modifiers, new enemy types based on Chess pieces, mod support and more. So far, it seems like they've crafted an interesting take on the survivor phenomenon (think Vampire Survivors) especially since it uses fast-paced turns instead of throwing a constant overwhelming force at you in real-time.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3yNzoyMPmLY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6f1024a23aa9aff7d9478248f7f4bd2b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3yNzoyMPmLY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Chess based enemies and player movement.</li>
<li>Unique runs by choosing a Character, Starting Ability, and Relic.</li>
<li>Casual quick 10-21 minute play sessions, for busy gamers.</li>
<li>Unlock new characters, cosmetics, and relics.</li>

      <title>This might be the most expensive and over the top Steam Deck bag I&#39;ve seen yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WaterField Designs, maker of various luxury accessories for different types of hardware, has announced their "<a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/complete-case-for-steam-deck?variant=40417097449555" target="_blank">Complete Case for Steam Deck</a>" ready for all your travelling.</p>
<p>It will hold pretty much everything you could need a for a full experience. There's space inside for all of this together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steam Deck console</li>
<li>Steam Deck dock</li>
<li>Two Charging blocks</li>
<li>Controller</li>
<li>75% Keyboard</li>
<li>Mouse</li>
<li>HDMI Cable</li>
<li>Ear buds</li>
<li>Micro SD cards</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup, it will carry all of that and the bag itself is not even particularly big either. They managed to make it snugly hold plenty, while not looking ridiculous — quite a feat that. The problem though? The price. It's an eye-watering $239 and there's even a special strap you can add for another $24.</p>

      <title>Broforce is coming back for more action in 2023 with &#39;Broforce Forever&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Broforce Forever is the name of a new free update coming to the crazy action-platform Broforce, sometime in early 2023.</p>
<p>It originally came out in 2015, following the initial idea in the Ludum Dare 23 Game Jam where it was called Rambros. News of a new update coming makes me rather happy, as it's probably one of the most fun action-platformers ever made. It's completely ridiculous in all the best ways.</p>
<p>You don't have to take my word for it, on Steam it has an "Overwhelmingly Positive" user rating from over 40,000 people. Featuring parodies of various well known action stars, explosions and a fast-pacing it's just a whole lot of fun in a small package.</p>
<p>Check out the teaser below:</p>

      <title>Crysis 2 &amp; 3 Remastered finally land on Steam, work great on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being Epic Store exclusive since last year, Crysis 2 &amp; 3 Remastered are finally available on Steam and they run rather nicely on Steam Deck. Now the full trilogy is finally on Steam.</p>
<p>I remember playing through the original Crysis on Windows at release back in 2007, and my PC at the time could only just about run it. To see all three working so well, in their updated form, on a Steam Deck that runs SteamOS (Linux) is quite incredible really. Technology really has moved on and times like this make me really see it. Honestly, I've been massively impressed with how both look and run on the Steam Deck with pretty reasonable settings on both too:</p>
<p>Here's plenty of gameplay of both, with timestamps in the video between the two games so you can get a good look at how they run.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wPnW1nw9sck"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d108f6ab93178bed410dc561c7b88800.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wPnW1nw9sck" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>If you're after a good shooter series, overall it's one not to be missed. Although, plenty of people feel that the original Crysis is better than then Remastered version, but 2 and 3 are much improved in the Remastered versions.</p>
<p>Where to buy:</p>

      <title>System76 upgrades the Thelio Major desktop with a removable I/O shield</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thelio Major, System76's high-end Linux desktop is going through a big upgrade that's due out on November 28th.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thelio Major is System76's most powerful gaming system, placing some of the largest GPUs on the market in a machine engineered for quiet, effective cooling. This custom cooling system uses a phase-change cooling method to move heat away from the components, and large fans to quickly and quietly exhaust hot air. The goal: To ensure these powerful components run as close to their top performance as possible.</p>
<cite>System76</cite></blockquote>
<p>One of the major design changes, is that it will finally have a removable I/O shield like most other cases. While the case is design specifically by System76 for their systems, it's nice to see this now an option so you can easily change the motherboard for future upgrades. In a press note, they said the change should roll out to other Thelio models in future too.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of the new refreshed Thelio Major include:</p>
<ul>
<li>13th Gen Intel Core i7 or i9.</li>
<li>Up to 72TB of Storage.</li>
<li>Wi-Fi 6E.</li>
<li>Up to NVIDIA 3090 Ti graphics.</li>
<li>10 Gb Ethernet.</li>
<li>Removable I/O shield for future upgrades.</li>
<li>PCIe 5.0 M.2 storage compatibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>They also shared a video talking a little about the R&amp;D process:</p>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III for Linux updated to v2.2.0, Immortal Empires beta available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A whole month later, Feral Interactive have updated the Native Linux port of Total War: WARHAMMER III to be in parity with Windows at version 2.2.0 and it's a big update. Not only that, but this update finally brings the huge Immortal Empires beta to the Linux version, <em>three months</em> after it became available for Windows.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights in 2.2.0 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Changes to settlements and garrisons to reduce the frequency of settlement battles.</li>
<li>Additional flavour for some of the special settlement garrisons—including Karak 8 Peaks, Black Pyramid, Skavenblight and more—by allowing them to use additional units.</li>
<li>A character experience rebalance, reducing the importance of victory types and focusing on enemy unit destruction.</li>
<li>Tweaks to the victory objectives of several legendary lords, including those of the Lizardmen, High Elves and Empire.</li>
<li>A game mode split option has been added to ranked multiplayer, letting you join separate queues and giving you greater control of your online experience.</li>
<li>Adjustments to AI aggression, strategy and overall game difficulty.</li>
<li>Plus, monsters are invading the old world in the form of Regiments of Renown III, and a new endgame crisis brings ruin-death to all! Yes-yes…</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Linux version also now has support for the Champions of Chaos DLC, which is again, multiple months late for Linux.</p>
<p>Here's the changes overview trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pQDafMXk_6A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e766881fb4bc82d654d04cbda762df17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pQDafMXk_6A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It is nice to see that Feral are actually keeping the port up to date, but the time between it being available on Windows and on Linux is not great. Hopefully they will be able to get that time down in future. Still a shame the Linux port doesn't support cross-platform online play too, so if you want to play with people on Windows you will need to run it through Proton.</p>

      <title>Box64 and Box86 get more games running on Arm plus DXVK 2.0 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Box64 and Box86 are userspace emulators to run traditional x86 and x86_64 applications on Arm, and the 0.2 release of both are a nice big step forward. For those of you with Arm devices (like the Raspberry Pi), these two projects definitely sound interesting and will expand what you're able to do.</p>
<p>Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>DXVK 2.0 working.</li>
<li>Unity3D games now work.</li>
<li>Reduced memory footprint.</li>
<li>Added support for wrapped libfuse so AppImage works.</li>
<li>Discord working.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm currently trying to re-do my Raspberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu, so I can test more things like this but it's proving a bit of a nuisance. Hopefully I'll be able to sort it for an overview video in future.</p>
<p>Box86 <a href="https://github.com/ptitSeb/box86/releases/tag/v0.2.8" target="_blank">v0.2.8 changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Wrapped more vulkan function, dxvk 2.0 now works</li>
<li>Added support for overriden malloc/free functions</li>
<li>Improved elf loader</li>
<li>Improved dlsym handling with RTLD_NEXT</li>
<li>Added BOX86_DYNAREC_SAFEFLAGS to allow finetuning Dynarec generated code handling of flags accross function calls and returns.</li>
<li>Added BOX86_BASH to setup x86 bash binary, so shell script can be run in x86 world</li>
<li>Added BOX86_ROLLING_LOG to have details log only on crash</li>
<li>Improved TLS Size handling (Unity3D games now works)</li>
<li>Improved <code class="inline-code">execv</code> family of function to have better box86 integration</li>
<li>Added a few more wrapped libs, like FAudio</li>
<li>Improved gtk, SDL2, GL, vulkan (and more) wrapping</li>
<li>Improved Signal Handling and memory protection traking</li>
<li>Added some basic support for statically linked program. Thread are not working yet, but memory allocation and file access does.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also noted:</p>
<p>"With the use of the new SafeFlags, some C# Windows program now runs fine (it's forced when the Vara family of software is detected). With the basic support of statically linked program, old emulator like modeller for linux works. Program with threads like mugen for Linux still doesn't. The bash integration is useful for device with no binfmt integration or for script that check the machine it's running on"</p>

<li>Some signature fixes to some wrapped functions (in libc)</li>

Plus apps like TeamSpeak 3 Client and Server or Discord.</p>

      <title>How to fix the EA app on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/valve-fix-new-ea-app-in-proton-experimental-for-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">did an update</a> in Proton Experimental that did get the EA app working again. The problem is that it doesn't stick and the EA app will break itself. It might work fine for a few launches, and then suddenly another it just won't work.</p>
<p>It can be really problematic, especially on Steam Deck, as it might cause a spinning Steam logo of doom that requires a reboot of the Steam Deck to get rid of the broken loading.</p>
<p>Here's one way to fix it: what you'll need to do, is remove the Proton files for the game (it works for any game using the EA app). For Steam Deck players, here's a brief video guide that also warns you about save backups and points you in the direction of where you might need to go to make a backup:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NaPNJSGqxyQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0029a2afc776defa2dbe1a8ed0790cf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NaPNJSGqxyQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><strong>Steam Deck:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set EA games to Proton Experimental. Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box -&gt; Select Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Make a backup of save files (IMPORTANT) as they might be removed during this. I cannot stress this enough, find where the save files are and copy them somewhere safe. JUST DO IT. You can find the Windows folders for games in the “compatdata” folder, and then the ID of the Steam game.<br/>
For example: <code class="inline-code">/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/*game_id*/</code></li>
<li>In the games Properties - Developer - Delete Proton Files</li>
<li>Launch the game again</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desktop Linux:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Set EA games to Proton Experimental. Properties -&gt; Compatibility -&gt; Tick the box -&gt; Select Proton Experimental.</li>
<li>Make a backup of save files (IMPORTANT) as they might be removed during this. I cannot stress this enough, find where the save files are and copy them somewhere safe. JUST DO IT. You can find the Windows folders for games in the “compatdata” folder, and then the ID of the Steam game.<br/>
For example: <code class="inline-code">/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/*game_id*/</code></li>
<li>Delete the ID folder mentioned above.</li>
<li>Launch the game again.</li>
</ul>
<p>For save backups, each game is different, it's best to look it up using your favourite search engine first. <a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home" target="_blank">PCGamingWiki</a> might list where the save files are.</p>
<p>This is the easiest fix I've found so far, that doesn't require the use of Protontricks or swapping Proton versions that could cause other issues (like a broken Proton Prefix) or anything else. Not all games need a save backup, but it's best not to rely on Steam Cloud (and some games don't have it).</p>

      <title>Valve update desktop Steam Stable Client with the New Big Picture Mode option</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released a new desktop update for the Steam Stable Client, and along with it comes the option to use the New Big Picture Mode. However, they broke it on Linux, at least for NVIDIA.</p>
<p>You can try out the New Big Picture Mode by launching Steam with "-gamepadui" as an option to go into it directly or with "-newbigpicture" to launch Steam normally but have the Big Picture button go into the new mode.</p>
<p>It worked mostly fine (outside of a few bugs) for me on desktop, until they also added a special boot-up video for the New Big Picture Mode that was in the last Beta and now everyone has it in the Stable update. For some reason, at least on NVIDIA, you hear the intro video playing but it doesn't actually display anything. So far the only <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/8916" target="_blank">people reporting it</a> are on NVIDIA, so I'm unsure if it's on AMD GPUs too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2510637751668692688gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2510637751668692688gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - the New Big Picture Mode on Fedora Linux</em></p>
<p>Hopefully it won't be too long before Valve or NVIDIA figure out what the issue is. I would quite like to use it on my desktop too as it's a nice improvement.</p>
<p>Here's all <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/166019" target="_blank">the changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Big Picture Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Big Picture is now available for testing. You can read more about it in this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3394051164709183116" target="_blank"><u>blog post</u></a>. Modify your Steam client shortcut and add -gamepadui on the command-line to automatically start Steam in the new Big Picture Mode. Alternatively, pass -newbigpicture to start in Desktop mode and have access to the new Big Picture Mode at any time.</li>
</ul>
<strong>General</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced client startup times for users with large game libraries</li>
<li>Fixed issue where launching a game would take longer to start if there was no network connection</li>
<li>Fixed VR flags not showing up in app details for some games</li>
<li>Center the popup controller configurator window when viewing controller layout</li>
<li>Fixed circular download progress indicator being broken in game entry list</li>
<li>Fixed downloads page crashing when starting in offline mode</li>
<li>Downloads page now properly responds to online/offline status</li>
<li>Updated “Steam News” popup dialog (again)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Sign In</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix a case where if the sign-in UI had cached credentials which had become invalid, it could get stuck and not accept valid credentials thereafter</li>
<li>Fixed an input focus bug requiring an initial click on the sign in UI before you could type your username or password</li>
<li>Fixed issues with dragging or closing the sign in window, and related display scaling issues, on computers with nonstandard desktop scaling</li>
<li>Fixed an edge case in handling of invalid cached credentials affecting reauthentication</li>
<li>Fixed issue with sign in refresh UI when the user had already signed in once during the current session.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Input</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gyro Enabling: The "Touch" option is now available to controllers which do not have capacitive touch sensors - Moving joysticks out of their deadzone now counts as a "Touch".</li>
<li>All controller types can each now optionally choose to use a Nintendo-style layout. This flips the A and B button and X and Y button universally in Steam and in games.</li>
<li>The Xbox extended features driver has been updated for Windows 11</li>
<li>Fixed hang when the Amazon Luna controller rumbles on macOS</li>
<li>Fixed issue with the touch binding in As Mouse mode releasing before the end of a swipe</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remote Play</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed occasional long hitches during Windows desktop capture</li>
<li>Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo controllers while streaming</li>
</ul>
<strong>SteamVR</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that caused some OpenXR app images to not appear properly in SteamVR</li>
</ul>

      <title>Thousands of years later, The Bible has arrived on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I had to do a double-take to ensure I wasn't seeing things: The Bible is now available on Steam in the form of a Kinetic Novel. Yes really, a developer going by "Bible Games" has actually put it on Steam. This release supports Linux with a Native build too (Ren'py engine) because of course it needs to reach all God's children — something like that anyway.</p>
<p>Not only does it provide the good book, it also comes with an original soundtrack and an voice over from beginning to end. On top of that, there's even a trivia section so you can really prove your knowledge,</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19312471391668625966gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19312471391668625966gol1.jpg"/></a><em>I don't think it really needs much of an explanation? Or maybe it does? I heard it's a bit unbalanced and gives lots of conflicting information that doesn't hold up well.</em></p>
<p>While some might think this is a little odd, or even a silly gimmick, it's managed a "Very Positive" rating on Steam so clearly some are enjoying their time spent in it with reviews like "I will become the greatest Bible player" and "atheists approved".</p>
<p>Even better, it has achievements, because as God knows, people sure do love earning things on Steam. Going by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/ymbhx3/comment/iv45eg9/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> post, the developer mentioned they did this because other ways of reading it on a PC were apparently bad.</p>
<p>Again, yes this is a real Steam "game" release, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2167220/The_Bible/" target="_blank">see it over here</a>.</p>
<p>Oh they even made a little trailer for it:</p>

      <title>Retro inspired RTS Rusted Warfare adds shaders, new units and other huge upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rusted Warfare is a great RTS for people who love the classics. One I discovered years ago on Android and then it later had a PC release. A big new release version 1.15 adds in loads to it. A game built for <em>large</em> battles. If you loved Total Annihilation, you will love this too.</p>
<p>Some of what's new in 1.15 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Shaders - Team colour shaders and shader effects like shockwaves, water ripples and more.</li>
<li>New unit - Heavy AA Ship.</li>
<li>New unit - Spy Drone.</li>
<li>Stats - game history shown with graphs on post game win/lose screen and Stats / leaderboard button in replays.</li>
<li>Mods can now replace the streaming resource system with something else.</li>
<li>A new decal drawing system - can be used for a lot of new things from selection interfaces, custom health bars, fake 3d effects, 3d voxel units, animations, etc.</li>
<li>Over "100% faster rendering on PC" with lots going on.</li>
<li>Big dynamic logic improvement for modding, with new dynamic numbers, unit and string types, dynamic text, arrays, memory, unit references, messages sending, events, etc.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus quite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/647960/view/3389548848365069095" target="_blank">a lot more</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.0 gets a Movie Maker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> 4.0 slowly approaching release, the developers are still hooking up some huge features to this free and open source game engine like a <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/movie-maker-mode-arrives-in-godot-4" target="_blank">Movie Maker</a>. This is something other game engines have too, so it's nice to see it land in Godot. This should make it easier for developers to make trailers of games, and use Godot for other projects too.</p>
<p>From their blog post it could be used for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recording game trailers for promotional use.</li>
<li>Recording cutscenes that will be displayed as pre-recorded videos in the final game. This allows for using higher quality settings (at the cost of file size), regardless of the player's hardware.</li>
<li>Recording procedurally generated animations or motion design. User interaction remains possible during video recording, and audio can be included as well (although you won't be able to hear it while the video is recording).</li>
<li>Comparing the visual output of graphics settings, shaders, or rendering techniques in an animated scene.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some advantages they listed instead of just plain recording gameplay:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use any graphics settings (including extremely demanding settings) regardless of your hardware's capabilities. The output video will always have perfect frame pacing; it will never exhibit dropped frames or stuttering. Faster hardware will allow you to render a given animation in less time, but the visual output remains identical.</li>
<li>Render at a higher framerate than the video's target framerate, then post-process to generate high-quality motion blur. This also makes effects that converge over several frames (such as temporal antialiasing, SDFGI and volumetric fog) look better.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also showed an example video made with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e047PL2KyP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/81180860c14d197e1fca4d40211fcc16.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e047PL2KyP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Godot 4.0 is shaping up to be a truly ridiculously big upgrade for game developers. Earlier this month the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/dev-snapshot-godot-4-0-beta-4" target="_blank">4th Beta</a> of Godot 4.0 went out.</p>

      <title>Unreal Engine 5.1 rolled out with plenty of Linux improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Epic Games announced that Unreal Engine 5.1 is now available, and along with all the usual big new features, they continued improving their Linux support in this release. You can see the official release <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-1-is-now-available" target="_blank">post here</a>, release <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/unreal-engine-5.1-release-notes/" target="_blank">notes here</a>.</p>
<p>After quietly making the Linux Editor for Unreal Engine <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/unreal-engine-5-editor-quietly-gets-a-proper-linux-version/" target="_blank">properly official</a>, it's nice to see them continue to make developing games on and for Linux better. In their press email, they mentioned how over "half of all announced next-gen games are being created with Unreal Engine" which is quite a few.</p>
<p>Going over the changelog, here's what's new and changed for Linux in Unreal Engine 5.1:</p>
<blockquote><strong>Clang 13 Support</strong>
<ul>
<li>Clang 13 is now the required version when compiling for Clang-based platforms such as Linux.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux IDE Workflow Improvements</strong>
<ul>
<li>In UE 5.1, we improved support for VS Code as a default option for IDEs in Linux. Error handling and messaging is also present when you have multiple IDEs and the code accessor fails to find the correct one.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New / Fixed</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved process for exporting to Raspberry Pi 4.
<ul>
<li>Added a new vendor ID for Broadcom.</li>
<li>Split ASTC and ETC2 support into separate texture formats for Vulkan, as ASTC may not be supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>USD: Added support for the usdMtlx plugin on Windows and Linux The usdMtlx plugin included with USD adds a file format plugin for reading MaterialX documents and translating them into UsdShade shading networks.</li>
<li>USD: added support for the usdAbc plugin on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</li>
<li>Added .so and .dylib as files to consider as library files to help reduce relinking on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Implemented a quick workaround to allow munmaps to happen with Mutex unlocked. Currently, We can't define UE_ALLOW_OSMEMORYLOCKFREE on Linux as we'll deadlock with the OsAllocatorCacheLock.</li>
<li>Mutex locks Munmap calls on Linux can take quite a bit of time (few ms in some cases). This should allow these to happen without the Mutex and remove some hitching.</li>
<li>Updated Mac and Linux to use libcurl 7.83.1.</li>
<li>Enabled the experimental Unreal Cloud DDC on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>Added all files under Unreal Build Tool output directory to fix an issue running build setup on linux builders.</li>
<li>Added support for IsGamepadAttached on Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for Linux to search (using "which") for CLion outside of the default expected location.</li>
<li>Linux windows now have a reasonable minimum size, and no longer can be scaled down to 1 pixel wide/tall.</li>
<li>UE on Linux now locates any standalone Rider installation if it is either installed to the default location "/opt" (Rider Installation Guide), or anywhere else that is on the PATH.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where global shaders would get cooked for Linux Server platforms if it had any targeted RHIs enabled.</li>
<li>The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) library that powers the Web Browser Widget has been updated to use Chromium's "Ozone" rendering backend under Linux. As a result, the Web Browser Widget now renders correctly in Linux environments that lack an X11 server, such as desktops running Wayland without the XWayland compatibility layer, and headless environments such as containers.</li>
<li>Fixed missing quotes in GenerateProjectFiles.sh.</li>
<li>Fixed QMake project generator defines.</li>
<li>Added DumpGPU viewer script for Linux and Mac. Currently requires the Chrome Browser to view the dump files.</li>
<li>Fixed landscape not updating on changes to water on Mac and Linux.</li>
<li>The GPU Dump Viewer now dumps both <em>.sh and </em>.bat so a dump can be opened either on Mac, Linux, or Windows regardless of the platform the files were dumped from.</li>
<li>Platform Linux for the LiveLinkOverNDisplay Plugin was whitelisted in nDisplay.</li>
<li>Changed the minimum driver version for Nanite on Vulkan, and also added a check for Linux.</li>
<li>DriverDenyList support was added to Linux.</li>
<li>Added DriverDenyList entries for Vulkan on Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>Added support for OpenVDB and Blosc on Mac and Linux in addition to Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed audio crashing when outputting audio with Blackmagic on Linux.</li>
<li>Enabled ShotGrid plugin for Linux.</li>
<li>SwitchboardListener: Fixed expansion of %TEMP% in file destination paths on non-Windows platforms. This was causing a crash attempting to launch nDisplay devices running on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see so many additions and fixes for Linux, hopefully it will continue to see this kind of attention.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 37 is out now with official Raspberry Pi 4 support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bit of a delay due to security issues with OpenSSL, Fedora Linux 37 is officially <a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-37/" target="_blank">out now</a> with all the usual assortment of major software updates.</p>
<p>Their main edition Fedora Workstation, continues using the GNOME desktop which bumps it up to <a href="https://release.gnome.org/43/" target="_blank">GNOME 43</a>. That along includes a lot of additions like the new Quick Settings menu, more applications upgraded to GTK 4, the Files app got refreshed, the Calendar / Contacts and Calls apps all got upgraded, Device Security Settings and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8144162721668529308gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8144162721668529308gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots more is new like official Raspberry Pi 4 support with working accelerated graphics, plus upgrades to various programming languages and system libraries as they continued to follow their "<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/project/#_first" target="_blank">First</a>" foundation (where they get stuff in early) like Python 3.11, Golang 1.19, glibc 2.36, and LLVM 15. It also includes Mesa 22.2.2 graphics drivers and the 6.0.7 Linux kernel.</p>
<p>For their other Spins that come with different desktops you get KDE Plasma 5.26.2, Xfce 4.16, Cinnamon 5.4.12 and there's other desktop environments available too.</p>
<p>With this release they slimmed the installation a bit, with Firefox language packs now as subpackages so you can remove the "firefox-langpacks" package if you don't need localization.</p>

<p>Fedora continues to be my go-to system, as it really works quite nicely on desktop. Hopefully my 36 - 37 upgrade will go smoothly but I usually wait a week or so to make sure any kinks are ironed out.</p>
<p>Do you use Fedora? Let us know in the comments what you're excited about in this release.</p>

      <title>Mixing factory management, Tower Defense and RTS - Mindustry 7.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best open source games around, Mindustry from AnukenDev just had a MASSIVE new release out that took quite some time to make. This update was in development for over a year!</p>
<p>It's like a mixture of Factorio with an RTS and Tower Defense blended in together, it's really quite something.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7233548371668516603gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7233548371668516603gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's new in 7.0 includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A whole new campaign that includes a new planet, with its own tech tree and 100+ new blocks to research.</li>
<li>15 new units to research and construct.</li>
<li>A new class of tank units.</li>
<li>A new variant of insectoid walkers.</li>
<li>Hovercraft units with unique weapons and abilities.</li>
<li>Various new forms of factory transportation.</li>
<li>Units can now be selected and commanded to positions or enemy targets, similarly to other RTS games.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Considering how long it took, the developer mentioned they've burned-out a bit and so they will be taking a break from any feature updates for a couple of months but they will do smaller maintenance releases during this time to fix up issues as they appear.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1127400/Mindustry/" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support it, or grab it free on <a href="https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry" target="_blank">itch.io</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Popular Half-Life 2 mod Entropy : Zero 2 is getting full Linux support for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583720/Entropy__Zero_2/" target="_blank">Entropy : Zero 2</a> is a very popular and well reviewed Half-Life 2 mod, and the developer has recently <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1583720/announcements/detail/5025482135637312982" target="_blank">announced</a> the public testing of Native Linux support and Steam Input gamepad support. Available now in the "deck-testing" opt-in Beta, you can try it for yourself!</p>
<p>What is it? "The pessimistic, wisecracking, door-kicking zealot known as 'Bad Cop' is back.</p>
<p>Command a small army of Combine synths and soldiers on a Northern campaign to capture Dr. Judith Mossman.</p>
<p>Tread in the wake of Gordon Freeman at Nova Prospekt. Explore the mysterious 'Arbeit Communications' facility. Discover what lies beneath. Drive an APC through the arctic wastes. Confront the rebels on their doorstep and uncover a long-forgotten secret."</p>

<p>Why are they doing it this now? They're going for <em>full</em> Steam Deck support and they said having it run Native on the Steam Deck avoids various font issues they saw with Proton. Nice to see more developers, even on mods like this, opt for full direct Linux support.</p>
<p>Once it's properly ready, I look forward to giving it a full run through!</p>

      <title>YoYo Games open source the GameMaker HTML5 runtime</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun one for open source fans and game developers, as YoYo Games have <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/html5-open-source" target="_blank">open sourced</a> their HTML5 runtime. It's now available on <a href="https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-HTML5" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, under the Apache 2 license.</p>
<p>The idea is to give developers a better idea of how it all works, plus it means that if there's something essential developers need, they can look to add it in themselves when creating their games. Open source (and even "source available") is just far better than hidden proprietary code.</p>
<p>YoYo Games will continue to update it, so it's not just a code-drop and forget type of deal. They are also encouraging others to create Pull Requests to improve it.</p>
<p>Their own Gurpreet S. Matharoo mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a developer, having access to the HTML5 source helps me understand how functions work behind the scenes, so I can get the most out of them.</p>
<p>I find the source easy to understand, as it’s written in JavaScript, which is similar to GML Code in terms of readability and usage. It’s a breeze compared to reading a source written in C or C++.</p>
<p>In addition to getting to look behind the curtain, I can now submit my own changes if I happen to come across bugs or functions that I can improve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like it makes it easy for game devs to tweak and test it too, with the GameMaker Beta allowing you to pick a different runtime and select your own downloaded version of the code. So you can easily test it locally for your own games, and before potentially sending fixes directly to the new GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Good stuff. Hopefully this is the start of more of GameMaker being open.</p>

      <title>Spider-Man: Miles Morales gets Steam Deck Verified ahead of release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello web slingers! Good news for you, as Spider-Man: Miles Morales has been formally Steam Deck Verified ahead of the release later this week. Yes, it's releasing this week (November 18th), and I didn't realise it was that close either. Going to say goodbye to my backlog for a while again I think.</p>
<p>Sharing the news via Twitter, Nixxes Software <a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1592185956710453248" target="_blank">said</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21189211841668512354gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21189211841668512354gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Nice to see it get full testing, just like we saw with Spider-Man Remastered. I look forward to playing a good few hours in this one too.</p>
<p>Will you be picking it up? Might want to ensure you've got the space ready, as it will take up at least 75 GB (probably more for us, due to shaders and Proton files). So it might be time to pick a couple to remove ready, unless you have a nice big SD Card.</p>
<p>I'll be doing my usual video of such a big release, should be up later on release day.</p>

      <title>Rhythm Doctor now has Native Linux support in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After originally improving Rhythm Doctor for the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/popular-and-unique-musical-game-rhythm-doctor-gets-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">earlier this year</a>, they've now decided to do Native Linux support with it available now.</p>
<p>What is it? Save patients with your rhythm mastery! Rhythm Doctor is a rhythm game where you heal patients by defibrillating in time to their heartbeats. Learn each patient's unique heartbeat and defeat boss viruses trying to sabotage your rhythm, all set to heart-pumping, soul-soothing music.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/774181/view/3395178347899045124" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux compatibility:</p>
Added native compatibility with Linux! Make sure to disable “Force the use of a Steam Play compatibility tool” so Steam will download the native version. (big effort from huantian!)<br/>
 
<p>- Should work on most modern Linux distributions, but have only tested on Ubuntu, Arch, and NixOS. Requires GTK for file pickers and xdg-open for opening files, these should also be installed on most distributions.<br/>
- Note: True window dance on Linux has been disabled, as it doesn’t seem to work well with all Linux desktop environments or window managers. Window dance is set to Simulate by default instead.<br/>
- Make sure to keep an eye out for any Linux related issues or bugs, such as issues with the file chooser or explorer, or custom level saving and loading. If you find any, contact us via our discord server: <a href="https://7thbe.at/discord" target="_blank">https://7thbe.at/discord</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also included a sweet little update image for it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11338981668427066gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There was also quite a number of gameplay changes included, for anyone who already played it. Sounds like playing it might be a little easier now, with some frame offset issues solved plus various improvements to the level editor were also included.</p>
<p>See the official trailer below:</p>

      <title>shapez 2 an automation, management &amp; factory-building game announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For fans of games like Factorio, the original shapez was a pretty fun take on the automation and factory-building genre and it's getting a bigger follow-up with shapez 2. It will include Native Linux support once again too.</p>
<p>It's going from 2D to 3D too, with the aim to be much bigger and have a higher production value this time. However, they will include the option to switch between 2D and 3D modes which could be quite interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20724308781668426545gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20724308781668426545gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The goal is the same as before: build up a huge factory in order to process increasing numbers, types, and colours of shapes. Build machines, place down long conveyor belts and design vast transport networks. However, this time it will spice things up with a layers system, letting you build across 3 layers you can swap between and build across all of them.</p>
<p>Not only that, the machines themselves will be more open so you can see them actually doing the cutting. Sounds like it could be pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Additionally, the maps will look to be more interesting. Instead of a basic flat map, shapez 2 will have island you need to craft to expand your building area. Linking in with that, mass transport that gives you access to a sort-of train like system to get goods everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6408518841668426627gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6408518841668426627gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>No release date set yet.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2162800/shapez_2/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Salt and Sanctuary gets Cloud Saves and OSK support for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Salt and Sanctuary has seen an update recently which brings with it Cloud Saves, along with better Steam Deck support. The update initially landed for the Windows version, but it has now been put into the Linux and macOS versions too.</p>
<p>Version 1.0.0.9 brings with it</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cloud Saves.</li>
<li>Bigger inventory size.</li>
<li>Quite a few bug fixes.</li>
<li>Various gameplay improvements and co-op updates.</li>
<li>Support for automatically bringing up the Steam Deck on-screen keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Cloud Saves being the most important thing here, since now you can nicely switch between a PC and a Steam Deck, and continue your game from where you left it. Hopefully we will see more developers go back and add that into their games for a better player experience.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.4 rolls out in Preview for the Steam Deck - it&#39;s a massive upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has done another weekend drop here, with a Preview version of SteamOS 3.4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3383920059429575957" target="_blank">now available</a> for the Steam Deck. This is easily one of the biggest updates they've done to the system since release, and there's so many changes that improve the experiences across the whole device.</p>
<p>This includes massive upgrades to the Desktop Mode, an upgraded Arch Linux package base, the performance overlay was changed for Level 2 to show the details along the top of the screen instead of going down the left, external drive upgrades and a whole lot more.</p>
<p>New style of Level 2 for the Performance Overlay:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12409952431668247579gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12409952431668247579gol1.jpeg"/></a>Looking good!</em></p>
<p>Currently SteamOS 3.4 is using kernel 5.13 (with various Valve patches) and Mesa 22.2.0.</p>
<p>Words and pictures are great but here's a video showcasing some of the changes:</p>

<p>M2H and BlackMill Games have released another update to the WW1 shooter Isonzo, this time it's better news for the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Along with their continued updates improving various parts of the game, as it did launch in a bit of a buggy state, although enjoyable they mentioned "Linux performance improvements" were part of this patch so if you're sticking with the Native Linux build you might have a better time now.</p>
<p>Since I last tried it, I have some other good news. They seem to have fixed shadows on the Native Linux build on NVIDIA GPUs too so everything isn't blindingly bright.</p>

      <title>Call of the Wild: The Angler gets updated to fix the launch crash on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Call of the Wild: The Angler from developer Expansive Worlds launched on Steam on August 31, and sadly it was broken but now they've fixed it. This is the same team that made the rather good theHunter: Call of the Wild, and while it hasn't been reviewing as well it's still good to see it getting updated.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck, it would just crash during launch. In Hotfix version 1.1.2, they said "It aims to fix the issues Steam Deck users were encountering when trying to launch the game. We knew how important it was for Deck players and we appreciate the patience you've shown while we worked on a solution.".</p>
<p>Additionally they seem to plan further improvements as they also said "While this is not full Steam Deck support yet, we're currently looking into making The Angler fully compatible with Valve's handheld in the future."</p>

      <title>A Plague Tale: Requiem gets Steam Deck support in a new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently rated as Unsupported on Steam Deck by Valve, A Plague Tale: Requiem from Focus Entertainment and Asobo Studio has a new update out to help.</p>
<p>Going by various reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1182900" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, it was possible to play it, but it wasn't a great experience so hopefully this update actually improves things as they claim.</p>
<p>They didn't go into any real specifics (annoyingly) on what's actually changed other than now being "compatible" with the Steam Deck. The full <a href="https://forums.focus-entmt.com/topic/64215/patch-notes-update-09-11-22" target="_blank">patch notes</a> are below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patch Notes common to all platforms</strong><br/>
<u>Changes &amp; Updates</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Balanced difficulty in “Nothing Left” and “Dying Sun” final arena fights.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Optimization</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized AI, rats, terrain and navmesh to reduce framerate drops and freezing issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Bug Fixes</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed HDR issues creating crushed highlights (not applicable to Nintendo Switch).</li>
<li>Fixed random crashes or blockers that could happen in some chapters.</li>
<li>Fixed blockers or animation bugs that could happen during some crank interactions.</li>
<li>Fixed issue during reaction between Ignifer pot and Odoris in specific cases.</li>
<li>Fixed a script issue that could make the pine cones thrown by Hugo in “Under a New Sun” invisible.</li>
<li>Improved cart collisions to prevent going out of the map.</li>
<li>Fixed minor visual bugs in some chapters.</li>
<li>Fixed unexpected change of audio language when changing other options.</li>
<li>Fixed minor issues in German language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patch Notes specific to PC</strong><br/>
<u>Changes &amp; Updates</u></p>
<ul>
<li>The game is now compatible with Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Optimization</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new graphics options to improve visual and performance customizations (Frame limiter, Resolution optimizer, SSAO, DOF, Screen Space Shadows, Motion Blur).</li>
<li>Improved auto setting graphic profiles to better match PC configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Bug Fixes</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed specular flickering issues with DLSS.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's likely with the optimizations they did, along with the graphics options settings, they're now setting them at sane defaults for the Steam Deck to make it have an acceptable performance level. An educated guess, but most likely what they've done. Still good to see even more developers actually fix things directly for the Steam Deck like this.</p>

      <title>Tetris Effect: Connected gets some fixes for Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1003590/Tetris_Effect_Connected/" target="_blank">Tetris Effect: Connected</a>, the reinvention of one of the most popular puzzle games of all time, has a big new update out that should solve some Linux and Steam Deck problems.</p>
<p>It was <a href="https://twitter.com/parkerreed/status/1565097500293210113" target="_blank">pointed out</a> to me a while ago, that for some reason the developers had locked out the ability to change the game resolution when playing it through Proton. This seemed to affect people playing in desktop mode, docked to a monitor and on desktop Linux too.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it was a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1003590/discussions/0/3492004456593230612/" target="_blank">bug</a> and it has now been sorted.</p>
<p>From the V1.3.3 <a href="https://www.tetriseffect.game/2022/11/10/all-platforms-patch-1-3-3/" target="_blank">patch notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[STEAM DECK] Added support for selecting your LOCATION on a Steam Deck.  If you have not set your LOCATION yet, the setting screen will pop up when you select EFFECT MODES or MULTIPLAYER &gt; RANKED MATCH. This setting can now also be changed in OPTIONS &gt; GAMEPLAY &gt; LOCATION.</p>
<p>[STEAM DECK] Added support to change the GAME RESOLUTION settings on a Steam Deck when docked to a monitor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see developers pay attention and improve Steam Deck / Linux with their games. They even did their own Steam Deck video a while ago on it:</p>

      <title>Stadia refunds are starting to begin, no word on Controller Bluetooth yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Google has announced that they've now begun the process to refund years of Stadia game purchases, as the service is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/google-gives-up-on-stadia-will-offer-refunds-on-games-and-hardware/" target="_blank">shutting down</a>.</p>
<p>In the updated FAQ entry, Google noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting 9 November 2022, Stadia will attempt to automatically process refunds for all purchases of games, add-on content and subscription fees other than Stadia Pro made through the Stadia Store. We ask for your patience as we work through each transaction and ask that you refrain from contacting customer support as they will not be able to expedite your refund during this time. We still expect the majority of refunds to be processed by 18 January 2023.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google said if you don't have a Google account now, they will still process the refund. If there are any card issues (lost / stolen / new card), you should at some point receive an email giving you instructions on how to still get your Stadia refund. They also said some people may need to sign up with Payoneer to get their refund, in some special cases where they cannot process it directly.</p>
<p>The same date has been given for Hardware purchases which include the Stadia Controller, Founder's Edition, Premiere Edition and Play and Watch with Google TV packages but you keep the hardware after the refund.</p>
<p>Sadly though, it seems there's still no update on them enabling Bluetooth in the Stadia Controller so it's wired-only which is a pretty big shame if they don't do it. It's a really comfy controller to use but they are under no obligation to enable Bluetooth, since they're refunding the hardware completely. <em>At least I own a bit of weird computing history now…</em></p>
<p>As for moving progress from Stadia to elsewhere they said that <a href="https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport/status/1575922767593078793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575922767593078793%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyBulletn/status/1575558847250411521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575558847250411521%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">Bungie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IOInteractive/status/1575818132492636162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1575818132492636162%7Ctwgr%5E6298c279f704794f1a1287af7d45f5dc34a93632%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fubisoft-bungie-and-others-working-on-stadia-game-save-transfers" target="_blank">I/O Interactive</a>, <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/stadia/sp-technical/issue/1709/where-are-my-game-saves-located-1" target="_blank">CD Projekt Red</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsColourTV/status/1582853316727275522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582853316727275522%7Ctwgr%5Eafc6ee3e194990b1733f7c6ec8cea5cefe606d5f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Frockstarintel.com%2Frockstar-games-announced-transfer-progression-for-red-dead-online-stadia-players" target="_blank">Rockstar Games</a> and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/10/20/elder-scrolls-online-stadia/" target="_blank">Bethesda</a> have already shared plans on that but it's down to each developer and publisher to sort it.</p>

      <title>dbrand issued an update on Killswitch replacements, Dock compatibility and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the recent issue dbrand had with their <a href="https://dbrand.com/killswitch" target="_blank">Killswitch</a> magnets causing issues with some Steam Deck fans, they've issued an update on how it's going and other changes due to Dock compatibility.</p>
<p>Firstly, for the Killswitch Case redesign, it sounds like it's going well. In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/yrryt8/project_killswitch_dock_compatibility_and_more/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, they showed off some fresh pictures of the new lock design without magnets, along with an upgraded kickstand that now includes Micro SD card holder slots:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1819318081668166975gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1819318081668166975gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699528481668166976gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3699528481668166976gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13414741071668166977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13414741071668166977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As a result of the changes, the kickstand they say is now "10% lighter" too.</p>
<p>When to expect them? They are on target for January 2023.</p>
<p>Remember when they said reservations would get free Portal Stick Grips that didn't happen? They apologised and said they've now had time to make more so if you did place the reservation and ordered, they will be sending them out.</p>
<p>The other subject is Docking Station compatibility. The Killswitch Case does not fit in a lot of docks, like the official Valve dock. So they're now going to be doing a USB-C extender so you can actually plug it in and a low-profile plastic "bucket" that serves as an adapter so it can actually sit in the dock with the case on. dbrand said they are not aiming to make a profit on those, as they will be "priced according to parts and labor" and that anyone who received the older magnetic version of the case would get them free in the upcoming reshipment of the new case. For everyone else, you can buy them standalone or add them to your order.</p>
<p>Here's how the USB-C extender and bucket look:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12004355141668166977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12004355141668166977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The bucket looks fine but wow that USB-C extender sure does look ugly and out of place, they probably can't make it much shorter though so it will have to do.</p>
<p>I do find it odd they only posted this on Reddit, and not in an email to actual customers though. I guess they assume they will reach most people there but if you don't go on Reddit, you would miss it.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Beta improves on-screen keyboard and offline mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two areas that could use some love are being tweaked, with a new Steam Deck Client Beta <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3383920059425809022" target="_blank">available now</a> with various fixes and upgrades. This is available in Beta and Preview. To change over you can find it in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Offline Mode especially has been a nuisance for a lot of people, just not working as expected in many areas so it's nice to see Valve make some more fixes there too.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed downloads page crashing when starting in offline mode</li>
<li>Downloads page now properly responds to online/offline status</li>
<li>Virtual Keyboard now has a maximum width, so that it doesn't stretch to an unusable size on large screens in Docked mode</li>
</ul>

<p>Valve are also being odd with Deck Verified again. They've recently moved Battlefield 1 from Playable to Unsupported, even though on Proton Experimental it works amazingly well and I only just recently did a video (below) to show it off and I was really impressed by it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="esHemt9SSQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/590e52f8f39a7de87d451d48efe52a8b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/esHemt9SSQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Valve did the same for It Takes Two, Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered and other EA games. So it's quite likely this is as a result of the recent switch from Origin to the EA app, despite them already fixing it in Proton Experimental — something they seem to have no problem setting by default for other games. I'm going to put this down to some sort of Deck Verified testing issue that isn't taking Proton Experimental into account.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 525.53 Beta is out now for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA GPU owners on Linux, it's your time to test something new. NVIDIA have released a Beta driver with <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/194315/en-uk" target="_blank">version 525.53</a>.</p>
<p>As always with anything with a Beta tag: here be dragons. It may have issues that will be solved in the next Stable release, so if you want a solid experience stick to your current drivers. It's not usually too long before NVIDIA drivers go from Beta to Stable.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused Dynamic Boost to not engage on certain Ampere GPU based notebooks.</li>
<li>Added support for Dynamic Boost on notebooks with AMD CPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that resulted in stutter when moving windows in GNOME.</li>
<li>Added support for the EGL_MESA_platform_surfaceless extension.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to prevent the creation of display layouts that exceed hardware size limitations when using the SLI Mosaic configuration page, and to display a warning if such a layout is created manually in the Display Configuration page.</li>
<li>Removed the hard dependency on GTK 2 when building nvidia-settings from source. nvidia-settings may now be built with support for GTK 2 only, GTK 3 only, or both GTK 2 and GTK 3.</li>
<li>Updated the open kernel modules to support Quadro Sync, Stereo, rotation in X11, and YUV 4:2:0 on Turing.</li>
<li>Updated an error message that nvidia-installer displays when kernel header files cannot be found to print full paths for the missing files.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to use "command -v" in place of depending on "which" to determine the availability and location of certain tools.</li>
<li>Implemented support for over-the-air updates in the Proton and Wine NVIDIA NGX build. This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Updated the Vulkan driver so that the following extensions no longer depend on nvidia-uvm.ko being loaded at runtime:
<ul>
<li>* VK_KHR_acceleration_structure<br/>
* VK_KHR_deferred_host_operations<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_query<br/>
* VK_KHR_ray_tracing_pipeline<br/>
* VK_NV_cuda_kernel_launch<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing<br/>
* VK_NV_ray_tracing_motion_blur<br/>
* VK_NVX_binary_import<br/>
* VK_NVX_image_view_handle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to allow use of the "--add-this-kernel" feature by non-root users.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a more accurate progress bar when building the kernel modules.</li>
<li>Updated nvidia-installer to display a warning message if a Vulkan ICD loader is not detected.</li>
<li>Reworked nvidia-installer's support for DKMS: the kernel modules will now be optionally registered with DKMS after the installer has already built and installed them on its own. nvidia-installer will now register the kernel modules with DKMS by default when the dkms(8) utility is detected on the system.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Vulkan driver which could lead to corruption in geometry and tessellation control shaders.</li>
<li>Added a new CUDA Debugger implementation for Pascal and newer architectures as a part of the driver package: libcudadebugger.so (previously released separately as "CUDA GDB Developer Preview").</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to correctly limit the allowed values for GPUTargetFanSpeed to match the existing valid fan speed ranges for supported NVIDIA GPUs. The valid ranges are 30%-100% for Ampere or newer GPUs, and 1%-100% for older GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression in 515.76 that caused blank screens and hangs when starting an X server on RTX 30 series GPUs in some configurations where the boot display is connected via HDMI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered would sometimes crash with Xid 13 errors on Turing and later.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vulkan-based D3D9, 10 and 11 translation layer DXVK version 2.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a>, the translation layer that converts Direct3D calls to Vulkan for use with Wine and Proton, has a big new release out with <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.0" target="_blank">version 2.0</a>. This is one of the ways that Proton performs so well for Windows games on Linux desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>For this, you will need to ensure you have up to date drivers, they said any Vulkan 1.3 capable driver and Wine version are required now. The new recommend versions are:</p>
<table class="table-stripes-tbody">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Driver</th>
<th>Required version</th>
<th>Recommended version</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>AMD (RADV)</td>
<td>22.0</td>
<td><strong>22.2</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nvidia</td>
<td>510.47.03</td>
<td><strong>520.56.06</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intel (ANV)</td>
<td>22.0</td>
<td><strong>22.2</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As for what's new? A lot! As expected from a major version bump.</p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/dxvk-native" target="_blank">DXVK-Native</a>, that provides Vulkan support for Native Linux applications has now been upstreamed and merged into DXVK directly so that it "can be used as a drop-in replacement to port D3D applications without having to change rendering code". This is really great and for developers who are looking to port their games, it's breaking down another barrier.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting changes is to shader compiling. Unless games already have their shaders ready, like you see in Steam when it downloads them for you, there will often be a lot of stuttering as the game builds it up with DXVK as you play. That's now changed! If you have drivers that support what's needed, the "shaders will now be compiled at the time the game loads its D3D shaders, rather than at draw time" resulting in reduced or eliminated shader compile stutter. There's some caveats with this though like some games only loading their shaders as you play anyway, 32-bit games may stutter and NVIDIA uses more space.</p>
<p><em>I cannot stress how excited I am for the above on both Steam Deck and Linux desktop!</em></p>
<p>Other highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>D3D9</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the likelihood of running out of address space in 32-bit D3D9 games</li>
<li>Reading from an active render target in D3D9 games is now properly supported, which previously caused rendering artifacts on newer AMD hardware and required driver-level workarounds. This affects a number of games, including GTA IV.</li>
<li>The D3D9 alpha test implementation was changed to more closely match the behaviour of Nvidia's implementation, which fixes inaccuracies in various games.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>D3D10</strong>
<ul>
<li>Removal of some unused bits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>D3D11</strong>
<ul>
<li>DXVK now exposes D3D11 Feaure Level 12_1 with the following newly added features:
<ul>
<li>Tiled Resources up to <strong>Tier 3</strong>, provided that the corresponding Vulkan sparse binding and sparse residency features are supported</li>
<li>Conservative Rasterization up to <strong>Tier 3</strong>, provided that the corresponding Vulkan conservative rasterization features are supported.</li>
<li>Rasterizer Ordered Views, provided that the corresponding Vulkan fragment shader interlock features are supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closer to Windows behaviour for "immediate contexts and deferred contexts", might help "improve compatibility to third-party libraries and mods that hook into the D3D11 immediate context specifically, and reduces CPU overhead since some frequently used code paths are now more specialized for each context type".</li>
<li>More optimizations to reduce CPU overhead in games like Assassin's Creed: Origins and God of War.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also numerous game-specific bug fixes including issues solved for: Alan Wake, Alice Madness Returns, Anomaly: Warzone Earth, Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon Age Origins, Empire: Total War, Final Fantasy XV, Grand Theft Auto IV, Heroes Of Annihilated Empires, King Of Fighters XIII, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, Sonic Generations, Spider Man: Shattered Dimensions, The Ship, Warhammer Online and Ys Seven.</p>
<p>Incredible work from all involved to make Linux gaming better than ever.</p>
<p><em>For Steam Deck users: you'll have to wait for SteamOS updates to bring in a new driver for support for all the features. Some of it is not yet ready in the Mesa GPU drivers for either desktop or Steam Deck.</em></p>

      <title>Fantasy strategy game Winter Falling: Battle Tactics now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Combining elements and being inspired by the likes of FTL and Total War, Winter Falling: Battle Tactics is a pretty unique strategy game. It released recently into Early Access and it has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Something I covered briefly back in 2020, the free prototype can still be played on <a href="https://rarykos.itch.io/winter-falling-price-of-life" target="_blank">itch.io</a> so you can get a feel for it but the new Steam release is much expanded and the developer said they plan to keep it in Early Access until at least 2024. It's a bit of an odd strategy game to describe that's a bit like an icon-view of Total War battles but with resource management too. A small and tightly designed strategy game that's worth a look if you love smaller experiences that somehow still feel grand overall.</p>
<p>Have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="gUKR08lhcf8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/626c106ff427cc6e1b2f92f67f6a9407.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/gUKR08lhcf8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>COMMAND your army in battles:</strong> Battles play out in real time, but you can play at your own speed, just pause and ponder.</li>
<li><strong>Plan your STRATEGY outside battles:</strong> Manage your army on the world map. Will your troops be well-fed? Will you loot cities to fill your chest?</li>
<li><strong>Craft YOUR BATTLES:</strong> Use the <u>in-game map editor</u> to create your own battles, share them easily with a copy-paste!</li>
<li><strong>MODDING Support:</strong> Create your own units, your own weapons, your own races!</li>
<li><strong>Inspired by the CLASSICS:</strong> Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat, FTL, Total War.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Soulstone Survivors might dethrone the likes of Vampire Survivors for me</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soulstone Survivors is a new Early Access game that arrived with Native Linux support on November 7th, it's also now already one of my favourite games. It works great out of the box too and it appears to be getting quite popular, with a Very Positive user rating and over 14,000 people playing it right now.</p>
<p>Styled like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and many other action horde-style games, you run around using various abilities taking down tons of enemies with completely over the top action. Here there are hundreds of skills, a lot of characters, a lot you can upgrade and they have plans to add in a lot more.</p>
<p>Here's some footage:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_CCubu42vF0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7bd364dca0eb2987bea5f47355831f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_CCubu42vF0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It works great on desktop Linux too! On Fedora Linux, even on max settings it never dropped below 60FPS while I had a video rendering in the background. Seems like they did a good job on the Native Linux build! Really impressed with the quality as well as the gameplay action.</p>
<p>While Vampire Survivors is fun, there’s no doubt in my mind about that and my many hours in it were great, this just has a much better gameplay feel to it and honestly, I prefer the graphical style here too a lot more. The game design just feels more coherent as a whole, although it’s not without flaws. Visibility is an issue, especially on the initial sandy level but no doubt they will work on it. The ridiculous amount of content on top of the satisfying loop will have me coming back often.</p>
<p>Current Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore almost 150 unique Active Skills (and growing!).</li>
<li>Unlock and play with 14 Characters, with many more to come.</li>
<li>Experiment with hundreds of Passive Skills and Runes to customize your characters.</li>
<li>Progress through the Skill Tree with your Soulstones.</li>
<li>Face and defeat powerful Bosses.</li>
<li>Choose Curses that increase your challenge in interesting ways.</li>
<li>Overcome extreme challenges to craft legendary weapons.</li>
<li>Complete dozens of achievements and unlock new powers.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 2 had a major upgrade, and Native Linux support is coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this was unexpected. Rogue Legacy 2 from Cellar Door Games just had a massive upgrade and they've announced Native Linux and macOS versions are on the way.</p>
<p>Inside the rather long <a href="https://roguelegacy2.com/patchnotes/v110" target="_blank">patch notes</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even More for the Masses – Now that RL2 has been released on the Nintendo Switch, we're working on native versions for Mac and Linux that we hope to have ready soon. And as a sweet cherry on top, the game has been fully translated in Japanese!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seems game porter and FNA developer Ethan Lee had a hand in this, as mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1590422739873304576" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</em></p>
<p>This fresh update also overhauled the game engine behind the scenes that they said better performance was a goal, with no part of the game left untouched but the experience should remain the same (apart from being smoother overall).</p>
<p>If you've not played it the game is a "genealogical rogue-LITE", that has all the usual bits like randomized runs, changing characters and so on with persistent upgrades but it's all about family. Each time you die your heir rises to take their place and carry on your run, and each is different.</p>

      <title>FSR 2.1 is a game-changer for Cyberpunk 2077 on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 from CD PROJEKT RED recently had a big <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/46420/patch-1-61-list-of-changes" target="_blank">1.61 patch</a> out, and with it came support for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 2.1.</p>
<p>Previously CP2077 only had FSR 1.0 and the amount of improvements between 1.0 and 2.1 for FSR is crazy. The picture quality is massively improved, as shown with my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0Bgy5Eabw" target="_blank">Dying Light 2 video</a>, and for Cyberpunk 2077 the difference is quite striking. Picture quality pretty close to native resolution, with a vastly improved FPS and frame-timing. It's like a complete night and day difference.</p>
<p>Have a look at the comparison below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wvuDVGMPQNk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f0f6152dd1ebf46b81bae8f7d13ad55b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wvuDVGMPQNk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm <em>amazed</em> by it. Until now, I was really struggling to get enough enjoyment out of Cyberpunk 2077 because it's such an intensive game on your system. On my Fedora Linux desktop, it's simply unplayable, as the controls don't work properly and my character keeps staring at the floor or ceiling and I've never figured out why. On Steam Deck though, it controls well and now thanks to this — looks and performs much better too. </p>
<p>Hopefully more developers will go back to add in FSR 2.1 to their games, it's awesome.</p>
<p>You can buy it for Linux / Steam Deck directly on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you have an issue with text sizing in CP2077 on Steam Deck (and fixing some being distorted with FSR 2.1), here's a mod you can try:</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets Halo Infinite working again on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having issues with the latest major update for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240440/Halo_Infinite/" target="_blank">Halo Infinite</a> on Steam Deck or Linux desktop? Valve has already released a Proton Hotfix update to sort it.</p>
<p>The fix is available in "Proton Hotfix" which is a completely <em>separate</em> version of Proton compared with the default Proton 7 and even Proton Experimental. So if you have it set to Proton Experimental currently, which is where Valve initially got it working, you need to <em>unset</em> it (remove the tick in the compatibility menu) and so it will pick up the Proton Hotfix on Steam Deck. For <em>desktop</em> Linux, you will need to force it to Proton Hotfix manually. If you have any trouble, search for Proton Hotfix in your Steam Library to make sure it is installed and updated.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8ihZSkw_fOM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a59b5e53360f4c9ee89d4389a203361.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8ihZSkw_fOM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I tested Proton Hotfix on Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux desktop — works for both. Great job Valve and CodeWeavers on the compatibility fix there so quickly.</p>
<p>Some of the big stuff that's new in Halo Infinite includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Network Co-Op Campaign</li>
<li>Campaign Mission Replay</li>
<li>New Campaign Achievements</li>
<li>Forge Mode (Beta)</li>
<li>Progression Improvements</li>
<li>Winter Update Battle Pass</li>
<li>Upcoming Events</li>
<li>New Multiplayer Mode: Covert One-Flag</li>
<li>New Multiplayer Maps</li>
<li>Matchmaking Improvements</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam Client Beta adds a new launch option for Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve are working fast to clean up this New Big Picture Mode taken from the Steam Deck, with another Steam Client Beta for desktops <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948454656201" target="_blank">out now</a>.</p>
<p>There's now two different launch arguments you can use, depending on how you play with Steam. There's the original "-gamepadui" to launch directly into the newer Big Picture Mode but there's also now "-newbigpicture", which will start in desktop mode but allow you to launch into the new Big Picture Mode (so the button doesn't launch into the old one).</p>
<p>The full changes below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed inaccurate regions where clicking would allow dragging the Friends List</li>
<li>Fixed inaccurate location of context menus for the Friends List</li>
</ul>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Added command-line argument -newbigpicture which will cause the Steam Client to use the New Big Picture Mode, while starting in Desktop mode. This is separate from -gamepadui, which will cause the Steam Client to start in the New Big Picture Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed various issues where UI would show in the main window instead of the Overlay</li>
<li>Added work-around for crash caused by older NVIDIA drivers that prevented showing additional information in the Settings =&gt; System panel</li>
</ul>
<p>Steam Input</p>
<ul>
<li>The Xbox extended features driver has been updated for Windows 11</li>
<li>Fixed hang when the Amazon Luna controller rumbles on macOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote Play</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo controllers while streaming</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A look at how to do it from before in case you missed it:</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a few extra fixes in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released another small <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3425577645381338803" target="_blank">Beta</a> update last night, which pulls in a few useful sounding fixes for the Steam Deck. This is available in Beta and Preview. To change over you can find it in Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added error dialog for when the user clicks on a mailto link</li>
<li>Set scale for startup movies so that the top and bottom of the movie are cropped for 16:9 aspect ratio in docked mode</li>
<li>Fixed issue in desktop mode that sometimes made it difficult to drag the Friends List</li>
<li>Fixed glyphs for third party Nintendo Switch controllers while streaming</li>
<li>Fixed inaccurate location of context menus for the Friends List in desktop mode</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could prevent exiting offline mode in the same session where the client entered offline mode</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it, I did a little video on Battlefield 1 on Steam Deck recently and I was quite impressed overall by how it runs and it's pretty fun:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA PhysX 5.1 SDK goes open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available now under a BSD license, today NVIDIA put up the NVIDIA PhysX 5.1 SDK as open source which is great to see from team green.</p>
<p>Something they now use in NVIDIA Omniverse, their real-time graphics collaboration platform, it wasn't entirely clear if they would open it up like previous versions but now they have. Great for game devs and anyone else who wants to see what they're doing with it.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/open-source-simulation-expands-with-nvidia-physx-5-release/" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<p>“Having a powerful, open-source tool for physics like NVIDIA’s new PhysX 5 library is a critical part of the realism delivered by the Open 3D Engine,” said Royal O’Brien, Executive Director at the Open 3D Foundation and General Manager of Digital Media and Games at the Linux Foundation.</p>
<p>“As PhysX use cases spread to other important 3D domains like simulation and digital twins, we are excited to see NVIDIA working with open source, allowing everyone to harness the innovation and collaboration that these communities can bring,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p>What is PhysX exactly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PhysX is a library for representing three dimensional worlds made of discrete entities named actors which can in turn be composed of multiple shapes. PhysX lets the user create and destroy such actors, and tracks their explicit or proximity based interactions. Actors can either be static, be moved around by the user, or be moved by PhysX according to the laws of classical mechanics. PhysX’ dynamics simulation capability includes support for collision, joints and actuation using maximal and/or reduced coordinates. Furthermore, the world may be queried by the user using a number of different tools ranging from simple ray-casts to sweep and overlap tests. PhysX provides extensions for special purpose functionality such as vehicle simulation.</p>
<p>PhysX is designed to be robust, high performance, scalable, portable, as well as easy to integrate and use. These capabilities make PhysX suitable as a foundation technology for game engines and other real time simulation systems.</p>
<cite>NVIDIA Documentation</cite></blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA said in the announcement their plan is to also bundle Flow (combustible fluid, fire and smoke simulation) and Blast (a destruction library) which don't depend on PhysX, but they've decided to include that too under the same open source license.</p>
<p>Seems like NVIDIA plan to up open more of Omniverse too as time goes on.</p>
<p>Source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Nebula is a starship colony sim with RPG adventures styled like RimWorld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/inspired-by-factorio-and-rimworld-space-colony-building-sim-stardeus-out-in-early-access/" target="_blank">Stardeus</a> is not the only RimWorld inspired space colony sim around, with Nebula being another that plans to release in 2023. It recently finished crowdfunding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/chaossystematic/nebula-2/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with $87,290 from backers. You can support it still via their <a href="https://chaossystematic.myshopify.com/" target="_blank">SlackerBacker</a>.</p>
<p>In Nebula you build up your starship, and then guide it through space and explore "millions" of star systems and planets that feature "diverse factions and unique environments". So it's basically a blending of RimWorld and Stardeus together. See the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BTx19RQMki8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5df9ec48382be1f4e23ab77917d1881a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BTx19RQMki8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Certainly sounds and looks good, although it is very ambitious. With space and planet exploration, along with your colonists each having simulated physical and personality traits there's a lot going on. The quest system sounds like a lot of fun too having you do all sorts of things including retrieving valuable artifacts and defending locals from invasions.</p>
<p>Thanks to the amount of funding they gathered a few extras will be added in like animal taming, a full soundtrack, Z-Levels (underground exploration), moons, vehicles and more. Seems like it's worth keeping an eye on.</p>
<p>In the Kickstarter FAQ, they confirmed their plans for other platforms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the Early Access phase, we are also planning to bring Nebula to the Mac and Linux platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Follow it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946440/Nebula/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Sonic Frontiers works on Steam Deck and Linux desktop although it has issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Frontiers is a big new release on Steam from SEGA and it does work out of the box on Steam Deck, although it has certain issues.</p>
<p>For starters, I noticed that unless I limited it to 30FPS in the game settings, the lighting would flicker and be unplayable. Searching around, I'm not the only one that saw this although some were lucky and did not. Hopefully either a game update or Proton update will eventually fix it for everyone. Shadows can be problematic as well, keeping that setting on Low solves any issues there too. Valve has marked it as Unsupported for now but it does work.</p>
<p>Using the latest GE-Proton, it also remains mostly smooth with the DXVK_ASYNC setting. Here's a video look:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5NiAUGPAYIg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f291b292e481cd68109e3dc1129a28b8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5NiAUGPAYIg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>For an example of the flickering, see <a href="https://youtu.be/qya0jTFZiRs" target="_blank">this unlisted video</a> (there's plenty of worse areas).</em></p>
<p>As for <em>desktop</em> Linux, it seems to be better there with an NVIDIA GPU on max settings. It definitely doesn't stick to 60FPS even with my 2080Ti and a Ryzen 7 5800X with plenty of drops down here and there at 1080p depending on what you're doing, but overall it remains somewhat smooth.</p>
<p>Here, the lighting issue at 60FPS still seems to be present but at times it can be easy to miss. When running around, you can see a brief flick between light and dark that doesn't happen often, whereas on the Deck, the flickering of lighting is <em>constant</em> unless in 30FPS.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6055856081667917497gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6055856081667917497gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Sonic Frontiers on Fedora Linux.</em></p>
<p>Seems like overall it needs a fair bit more optimisation, as a game like this performing like it does doesn't seem right. Playable and seems quite fun actually but performance is an issue, as are the graphical issues noted especially so on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/sonic-frontiers?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1237320/Sonic_Frontiers/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells gets a free indie cross-over update, Terraria 1.4.5 will see Dead Cells content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Two games are doing an indie crossover, with a Dead Cells update out now and the next Terraria update will also include some Dead Cells content.</p>
<p>For Dead Cells that's updated already, the developer added in quite a bit including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Terraria - 'The Guide' and the heavenly sword Starfury! Striking enemies with this gloriously pink sword causes fragments of stars to fall from the sky, dealing critical hits to other enemies around you. The drawback is that it's a relatively slow and static weapon, but chuck a few dodge rolls in there and you'll be fine.</li>
<li>Shovel Knight - King Scepter! Shovel Knight will be shoulder bashing your enemies to launch himself into the air, then spinning around the screen drilling enemies into the ground with critical hits. Bouncing on an enemy let's you charge again, so see how long you can keep the chain going!</li>
<li>Hotline Miami - Jacket and his trusty Baseball Bat are swinging into Dead Cells, with not one, not two, but three different masks. The Baseball bat crits on stunned enemies, so you're basically required to hit enemies while they're down... Look out for the damage number VFX pulled from Hotline Miami too!</li>
<li>Katana ZERO - Throwable Objects stun your enemies, allowing you to close the distance and get some shots in, or give you time to charge the katana's dash attack... You've only got 3 charges of throwable stuff, so you'll need to kill enemies to refill your stash.</li>
<li>Slay the Spire - The Diverse Deck translates each of the 4 classes from Slay the Spire into one complex skill. You will initially gain a passive power from one class. You can play with this passive for as long as you like, then activating it provides a one-off boost effect, and the skill moves on to the next class.</li>
<li>Risk of Rain - The Laser Glaive is irresistibly drawn to enemy after enemy, rebounding around the screen dealing damage to as many foes as possible. It gains damage after each extra enemy it hits and will start dealing crits after hitting multiple enemies. Not bad for crowd control...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You can buy Dead Cells from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a>, <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/dead_cells?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, Re-Logic have <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-is-coming-in-2023-including-terraria-x-dead-cells.116264/" target="_blank">announced</a> Terraria 1.4.5 will be coming next year, and with it some Dead Cells content. They're not saying exactly what though. Sounds like work on it hasn't begun yet so more details to come next year on that.</p>

      <title>Steam gets a whole lot of improvements for the new Big Picture Mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Still not quite ready yet it seems but Valve are pushing out lots of changes for the new Big Picture Mode, taken from the Steam Deck. Released in a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3388422948450355513" target="_blank">Steam Client Beta</a>, there's quite a lot of improvements and fixes this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/235584031667913529gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/235584031667913529gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New Big Picture Mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some scaling issues that led to UI being offset slightly in various places</li>
<li>Center the Big Picture Mode window when not running in fullscreen mode (i.e. when -windowed is passed as a command-line argument)</li>
<li>Fixed issue where navigating to the Steam Store would sit at the loading screen (e.g. after exiting BPM to return to the desktop UI, and then back to BPM)</li>
<li>Fixed some issues where the UI would not navigate properly within the Overlay</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the controller configurator would not be displayed within the Overlay for some games that Steam calls to open it</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the incorrect Patch Notes were displayed</li>
<li>Fixed issue with the Virtual Keyboard also showing in the main window when it was invoked within the Overlay</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the footer would update in the main window when the user was navigating the UI in the Overlay</li>
<li>Removed Steam Deck specific dialog warning the user about running multiple games</li>
<li>When installing a game always show the install location picker if there is more than one library folder, and automatically focus the default library folder when the dialog shows up</li>
<li>Add a toggle to Settings-&gt;Display-&gt;Advanced to force GPU accelerated rendering for GPUs that are in the embedded browser's blocklist</li>
<li>Fixed automatically switching audio devices on launch on Linux</li>
<li>Fixed the old version of Big Picture Mode opening when hitting the Steam/Guide button on the Steam window</li>
<li>Fixed issues where the main window would close and then be reloaded:
<ul>
<li>When selecting a friend in the previously or recently played</li>
<li>When selecting a guide in a game's Community Feed</li>
<li>When selecting the "Downloading" label on a game's detail page</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Center the popup controller configurator window when viewing controller layout</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Steam would be unable to connect in some cases after suspend/resume</li>
<li>Fixed recently played games not showing up in the MRU list on the notification area icon or the Recent Games shelf in library</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The bug where opening the Steam menu (at least on Fedora KDE Plasma + NVIDIA) shows what's behind the Big Picture Mode window is still present, annoyingly. Hopefully Valve will solve that one soon as well. Trying to open the Quick Access Menu (Xbox button + A for example) sometimes brings up the main Steam menu first too, it's a little too quick to react at times. Still, even in the rough state it's still in right now, it's going to be a lot better than the original Big Picture Mode.</p>

      <title>Surprising probably no one, most people use the Steam Deck as a handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently, I ran two different polls to find out how people with a Steam Deck used their device (or if they didn't much) and the results are out now.</p>
<p>The key thing about the Steam Deck, is that while it is a handheld it's also a full Linux PC with a desktop mode. Many docks are available for it from different brands now and even the official Docking Station from Valve is out and has been for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/no-more-steam-deck-reservation-queue-m-buy-it-now-plus-docking-station-available/" target="_blank">about a month</a> now.</p>
<p>So I was keen to find out how what percentage of people actually used it mainly docked, partly also because I use now the vast majority of my time with it docked. Turns out, not a whole lot of other people do.</p>
<p>From over 4,000 votes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">our YouTube Channel</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5824387571667836197gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5824387571667836197gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While on <a href="https://twitter.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">our Twitter</a> from over 1,000 votes paints a very similar picture.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3946000081667836359gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3946000081667836359gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>What a shock, over 70% of people using a handheld use it as a handheld. I know, it's not breaking news but I found it interesting, because of how much I use it docked myself and how I've seen a lot of comments of others doing the same. Turns out though, it's a really small amount of people overall.</p>
<p>I suppose it didn't help that the docked experience wasn't great at release, and it still has plenty of issues now, like I noted in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/thoughts-on-the-official-steam-deck-docking-station/" target="_blank">my article on the official Docking Station</a> not always displaying on my TV.</p>
<p>Another bit I wanted to highlight, was a really interesting comment on the GOL YouTube Channel about this from user "MechanicalMonk", which I <em>can't</em> link to as the original poll was <em>removed</em> to add an extra missed option. Anyway, they mentioned that people buying the Switch would have done so <em>anyway</em> because it's Nintendo and many people use it exclusively docked as it just happens to be a handheld (although, there is the newer handheld-only Lite). On the other hand, people would have been far less likely to buy the Steam Deck if it wasn't a handheld and so it favours that. Just an interesting thought.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? How do you use it?</em></p>

      <title>American Truck Simulator - Texas releases on November 15th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SCS Soft have announced the big American Truck Simulator - Texas DLC will be releasing on November 15th.</p>
<p>A DLC no doubt many have been waiting for to take in the sights. One exciting element to it that SCS detailed in a previous <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2022/10/texas-space-industry.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, is that the Space Industry will be nicely featured in this DLC. They mentioned how "Texas is home to state-of-the-art development and test sites for multiple commercial space firms, and research shows that the space industry is big work for the state, bringing in 11 billion dollars per year in revenue and providing hundred of thousands of jobs. So it wouldn't be right for us to miss this out-of-this-world opportunity to include it in our upcoming Texas DLC for American Truck Simulator".</p>
<p>Thanks to their work you'll be able to see some pretty fun spacey things as you travel around, including a certain famous space centre that they said is really worth passing by in your trucks. </p>
<p>See their 3 minute trailer below:</p>

      <title>AMD becomes a &#39;Diamond&#39; sponsor of OBS Studio</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">OBS Studio</a> announced that AMD have become a Diamond Sponsor of the OBS Project, helping fund future development. Great to see, as OBS Studio is easily one of the most popular free and open source applications around and something I use near-daily.</p>
<p>It was announced on <a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1588301361275441154" target="_blank">Twitter</a> with a short message just confirming it, with no other details.</p>
<p>What it means is that AMD are now funding OBS with at least $50,000 per year, joining NVIDIA and StreamElements at the same level. OBS also has many additional sponsors including YouTube, Logitech, Twitch, Facebook and others giving over plenty of funding and other help to the project.</p>
<hr/>
<p>This really is amazing to see. The last few years have seen so many positive stories like this for free and open source projects. Blender is another that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/volkswagen-begins-funding-blender-development/" target="_blank">keeps pulling in</a> more funding, Godot Engine just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/godot-engine-now-has-its-own-dedicated-foundation-for-funding/" target="_blank">launched their own Foundation</a> and even the Kdenlive video editor funding campaign I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/kde-are-raising-funds-for-the-kdenlive-video-editor/" target="_blank">mentioned previously</a> has reached over the original goal.</p>
<p><em>Good times for FOSS projects.</em></p>

      <title>Comedy point and click adventure Plot of the Druid is now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The point and click adventures just keep coming! Plot of the Druid has released featuring some more sarcastic British humour and classic, hand-drawn art. It's currently in Early Access, with Native Linux support. Another that was funded via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/plot-of-the-druid/plot-of-the-druid" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with the developer receiving $32,303 to help make it real.</p>
<p>"A disgraced druid apprentice goes on a quest to prevent the world from going crazy by restoring balance to the forces of love, wisdom, and wealth. A mystical comedy adventure with sarcastic British wit, hand-drawn cartoon art, and an innovative shape-shifting ability for solving puzzles. Plot of the Druid is a classic-modern point-and-click game that’s reminiscent of Simon the Sorcerer, Discworld, and Harry Potter."</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 7-39 released improving Overwatch 2 for Steam Deck &amp; Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> is the community-maintained version of the Windows compatibility layer Proton, not endorsed by Valve but it can get more games running on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. A new release version GE-Proton7-39 is out now.</p>
<p>Here's the change highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>proton-wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to git</li>
<li>overwatch 2 freeze fix added (may help other games)</li>
<li>pulled in upstream proton nvapi fixes</li>
<li>enabled gamedrive option for ESO by default</li>
<li>mono updated to 7.4.0</li>
<li>no-longer-required protonfixes removed for Sonic Adventures 2, Farcry 5 EAC, Origin (thanks Bitwolfies)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For those curious on how to set up Overwatch 2 on Steam Deck, I did <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/heres-how-to-play-overwatch-2-on-steam-deck-linux/" target="_blank">cover that before using the Bottles app</a> but since GE-Proton has some fixes in this release and the previous GE-Proton release, here's a video guide on how to do Battle Net and Overwatch 2 directly through Steam:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DTJ2dh_mv3Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/551f809ccdbd0011870592d8c007f403.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DTJ2dh_mv3Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Text Guide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download ProtonUp-Qt from Discover.</li>
<li>Install GE-Proton7-39 from ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Close and reload Steam.</li>
<li>Download the Battle Net launcher.</li>
<li>Add the Battle Net installer into Steam. Add Game (bottom left) -&gt; Non-Steam game, select it from the list in your Downloads folder (select All Files from the bottom of the file picker to see it).</li>
<li>Right click on it in Steam, go to Properties and select Compatibility. Tick the box and select GE-Proton7-39.</li>
<li>Install it and then remove the shortcut.</li>
<li>Add a new shortcut to the installed Battle Net launcher exe file. Again setting the compatibility on it to GE-Proton7-39.</li>
<li>Now you're done. You can load it and install Overwatch 2 or anything else from Battle Net and run it inside Steam directly without another app like Bottles or Lutris.</li>

      <title>Cemu emulator for Wii U now provides an AppImage</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get the Wii U emulator <a href="https://cemu.info/" target="_blank">Cemu</a> working on Linux? It's now a little easier, as they've providing an AppImage with the latest release.</p>
<p>Version <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases/tag/v2.0-14" target="_blank">Cemu 2.0-14 (Experimental)</a> just went up and this is the first to offer the AppImage, which should work across various Linux distributions and perhaps make it easier on Steam Deck as well. Nice to see they keep improving it little by little, as they slowly move towards the full 2.0 release that's open source.</p>
<p>They're not yet providing a full changelog between the small releases of the 2.0 release, with these still being listed as the main changes since the last major release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cemu is now <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu" target="_blank">open-source!</a></li>
<li>Preliminary Linux builds are available <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases" target="_blank">on github</a>, but be warned that they are still very rough around the edges</li>
<li>Going forward, we simplified the versioning a bit by using shorter version numbers for stable releases (2.1, 2.2, 2.3..). This version (2.0) is an exception in the sense that it follows the pattern of a stable release but is very much experimental.</li>
<li>Updated all dependencies. Most notably SDL (input &amp; motion) and wxWidgets (UI)</li>
<li>Fixed a crash in the H264 video decoder. Resolves crash on Smash title screen</li>
<li>Made nsysnet a little less crash prone. Fixes crash in Call of Duty: Black Ops II</li>
<li>Fixed a logging related crash that could occur under very specific circumstances. Seen in Wind Waker if letting the game idle on the title screen for 2 minutes</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when the path to Cemu.exe contained unicode characters</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could happen when loading .elf homebrew</li>
<li>The account list in the title manager save exporter is no longer empty</li>
<li>Latency for wiimotes should be a bit better now</li>
<li>Added symbol/function list to debugger + other small debugger/assembler improvements</li>
<li>Implemented API: coreinit.FSOpenFileExAsync (used by some homebrew)</li>
<li>Many more under-the-hood changes and fixes</li>
<li>Some more work towards a Stop&amp;Restart emulation feature. Not ready yet but we are getting there</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dota 2 set to remove OpenGL support, new hero announced and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out an <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3398555399443921912" target="_blank">update</a> for Dota 2 and there's some major changes coming, along with another new hero set to enter the fold.</p>
<p>As part of the 2022 Battle Pass: Part II update Valve announced that NVIDIA Reflex support has been added, and they've said that this is the last major update that will have OpenGL support as everyone will need to be using Vulkan on Linux after that. OpenGL removal was previously announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/09/dota-2-to-drop-opengl-and-32bit-vulkan-default-on-linux-and-ti-21-tickets-on-september-22/" target="_blank">back in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>For right now though Valve has added Diretide, their annual event with a new Candyworks game mode. This update also comes with a second Cavern Crawl map and the release of another round of rewards.</p>
<p>As for the new hero, they're named Muerta and they arrive in early 2023:</p>

<p>What else?</p>
<p>Oh, there's also a little sprinkle of Portal with a Cave Johnson (voiced by J. K. Simmons) announcer pack that had its own fun trailer that even pulled in Valve CEO Gabe Newell. Amusingly, Newell calls himself both "G-Money" and "G-Fat" during it.</p>

      <title>Star Labs new StarFighter sounds like a great Linux laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Labs announced their new <a href="https://starlabs.systems/pages/starfighter" target="_blank">StarFighter</a> a little while ago, but it seems it only just recently went live on their actual store with the full info on what to expect from it.</p>
<p>However, they don't seem to have quite settled on what screen it will have. Currently, it advertises a 16-inch 2560x1600 QHD 165 Hz IPS matte screen, but writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/starlabsltd/status/1587851541007982602" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it seems they are split between that or a 4K version and so the final build might end up with a 4K 60Hz screen instead.</p>
<p>It features a choice between Intel Core 12th generation and AMD Ryzen 7 processors, up to 64GB RAM, up to 18 hrs battery life, a removable webcam, a wireless killswitch, a backlit keyboard, a full-glass haptic trackpad, WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C With Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 for charging and expansion, HDMI, 3 x full-size USB 3.0 port, Micro SD slot, coreboot and EDK II support, a 65 watts over USB-C charger and easy Firmware updates.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20034595371667563310gol1.png"/></p>
<p>As usual, you'll also be able to configure it with various Linux distributions including Ubuntu, elementaryOS, Linux Mint and more. It's not available for a few months yet with no exact date set it seems.</p>

      <title>Slay the Spire is getting an official Board Game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love Slay the Spire and want to take it into the real world? There's a Board Game being made for it.</p>
<p>As a big fan of the game with many hours in it on Linux, I feel like I need it but the price is a little on the steep side at $100 for the set. Popular though, as the crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/contentiongames/slay-the-spire-the-board-game" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> managed to get funded in only a few minutes and is currently sat pretty at close to $2 million USD in funding — wow.</p>
<p>It's a pretty intricate and luxury board game though, along with a smaller company producing it so the price does sort-of make sense when you take things into account. It's not Monopoly after all. Sure does look fantastic too! The co-op aspect of it sounds pretty fun too.</p>
<p>You can see an overview from YouTube channel The Brothers Murph below:</p>

      <title>Warzone 2100 version 4.3 is out now with a new &#39;Super Easy&#39; mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The free and open source RTS <a href="https://wz2100.net/" target="_blank">Warzone 2100</a> has a new release out, bringing with it a new difficulty mode if you struggled through the campaign. Quite a success story this one. Originally a fully commercial game developed by Pumpkin Studios and published by Eidos Interactive that was eventually set free. I wish more developers did this eventually.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1182895431667560040gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1182895431667560040gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Main improvements in version 4.3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New “Super Easy” difficulty for campaign.</li>
<li>Additional new “Aftermath” soundtrack (from Lupus-Mechanicus).</li>
<li>Add “LOD Distance” Graphics option, to adjust texture sharpness at distance (defaults to “High”).</li>
<li>Add new Video Options (“Minimize on Focus Loss”, “Alt+Enter Toggle”).</li>
<li>Add Flatpak builds (for Linux).</li>
<li>Support for bidirectional text using fribidi.</li>
<li>Improve Cobra AI yet again (balances against defensive / system research when 1v1 on high oil maps).</li>
<li>Show the rank a unit will have if it were produced next.</li>
<li>Add console message when limits change.</li>
<li>Update campaign balance (and fixes) for: Alpha 2, Alpha 6, later Beta missions, Beta-end, Gamma 2.</li>
<li>+ Lots of bug fixes and multiplayer balancing changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
