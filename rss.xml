      <title>Croc Legend of the Gobbos remaster will be a GOG exclusive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/argonaut-games-announced-a-return-with-a-remaster-of-croc-legend-of-the-gobbos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in August</a> I reported on the new remaster of the classic Croc Legend of the Gobbos, and today it has been revealed it will be a <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> exclusive on PC. The release will have both the classic version and the remastered version available on GOG.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Wsd8f6P4uJA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/252304dc1454571f901355204ab3d18e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Wsd8f6P4uJA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Remaster</strong><br/>
<br/>
With enhanced HD graphics, modern control mechanics with an updated camera, retro video modes, and the same delightful gameplay that charmed all of us in the 1990s, you’ll dive into a beautifully recreated world filled with vibrant colors, captivating landscapes, and playful challenges to ignite your imagination. The remaster offers a true blend of nostalgia and modern gameplay, ensuring an authentic experience that pays homage to the original while inviting a new generation to discover its timeless magic.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Classic</strong><br/>
<br/>
While we suspect that the original Croc needs no introduction, here’s how it was described to gamers all the way back in 1997:<br/>
<br/>
<em>Croc's Got The Moves!<br/>
<br/>
Help Croc, the humble little green crocodile, rescue his peace-loving Gobbo friends from the grasp of the evil sorcerer Baron Dante. Guide him through a beautifully-rendered 3D world on a free-wheeling, free-roaming adventure against Dante’s impish assistants the Dantinis!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>5 different 3D worlds to explore including volcanoes, ice glaciers, and underwater caves</em></li>
<li><em>Free roaming, stunningly rendered real time 3D gameplay lets you go anywhere as you run, jump, climb, swim…</em></li>
<li><em>More than 40 levels, enemies galore, and bosses to keep you busy!</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release: “The Croc remaster aims to reignite the imaginations of players with its enhanced HD graphics, updated modern controls, and an authentic gameplay experience that will transport players back to the golden age of gaming,” said Jez San, Argonaut Games’ founder.</p>
<p>“Croc Legend of the Gobbos is both a nostalgic return for retro-gamers and an exhilarating new adventure for first-timers. We have dedicated ourselves to bringing this remaster to as wide an audience as possible so that fans of PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC on GOG can experience the magic and enjoyment of Croc," added Jez San.</p>
<p>“Croc represents the heart of our mission: preserving and celebrating the legacy of gaming. By offering both the classic and the remastered versions in one package and keeping all our games DRM-free, we’re ensuring that players not only relive the magic but have the true sense of ownership, as well. We’re the ultimate destination for gamers who want to experience timeless classics as they were meant to be played, and we couldn’t be happier for Croc to become a part of this adventure,” said Bartosz Kwietniewski, Head of Business Development at GOG.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">follow it on GOG</a>.</p>
<p>So with that you'll need some form of Wine / Proton to run it on Linux / Steam Deck. My favourite being the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/heroic-games-launcher-2152-released-fixing-amazon-gog-and-epic-games-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a>.</p>

      <title>AYANEO tease the AYANEO 3 as a &#39;revolution&#39; and a &#39;completely new concept&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unlike Valve who confirmed again recently they are <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/valve-still-waiting-on-a-generational-leap-for-steam-deck-2-but-its-coming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waiting for a generational leap for a Steam Deck 2</a>, AYANEO are doing yet another handheld with the AYANEO 3.</p>
<p>A few days ago AYANEO put up a <a href="https://ayaneo.com/article/855" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> full of fancy marketing wording like how it's a "revolution in AYANEO's product definition, changing gamer's imagination of handheld consoles" and that it's "not only a technological leap, but also a completely new concept, which to some extent foreshadows the future possibilities of handheld devices".</p>
<p>The marketing speak continues with zero actual details on, well — anything at all really. They're really hyping this one up though claiming it "symbolizes the new direction of gaming handheld" and that the "future has arrived". <em>Okay then. Whatever you say.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SE7dawzHuAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ea22264beb61ddf628632cb5b74b464.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SE7dawzHuAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Obviously it will ship with Windows, just like all their previous handhelds, but it likely won't be too long after release until it's supported by the likes of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steamos-alternative-bazzite-adds-support-for-onexplayer-plus-improvements-for-rog-ally/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">popular SteamOS alternative Bazzite</a> which supports lots of different handheld gaming PCs. AYANEO did try for Linux once, and then promptly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/ayaneo-next-lite-no-longer-ships-with-steamos-like-holoiso-linux-windows-11-instead/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">backtracked on that</a>.</p>
<p>What to expect? Good question. Most likely is AYANEO adding in the latest generation of AMD chips inside to give it another boost in performance. Aside from that? Well their marketing lingo makes it sound like it might have a new shell design. Who knows, I guess we'll find out soon won't we.</p>

<p>It supports 2-4 players with no special controller required, just a phone or tablet will do like their other games. All modes in this one support English, French, Italian, German, Castilian or Latin American Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese. Jackbox also said they'll be ensuring localised answers are available for the UK and Australia.</p>
<p>As usual for Jackbox, it has full Native Linux support. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oPqck0NjkPs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/371743c1b66bcd7a2527ff1f2351d9fc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oPqck0NjkPs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">The currently included game modes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hilo: Can you guess the most popular one-word cat names? How about the least? In Hilo, compete to find the most and least popular answers to a wide variety of questions. The rankings may surprise you! It turns out a lot of people named their cat Frank. That's a freebie.</li>
<li>Speed: In the fast-paced Speed, think on your toes to uncover as many answers on the list as possible, as quickly as possible. It’s everyone for themselves in a race against the clock! Each round the points increase, and the stakes get a little higher! Can you handle it?</li>
<li>Squares: Two teams compete to claim three squares in a row on the grid. Guess popular choices for the first squares, semi-popular choices for the middle squares, and least popular choices for the final squares. We guarantee, you've never had a more heated argument over attractive fictional characters than you will playing Squares.</li>
<li>Bounce: In Bounce, two teams control a paddle that sits on a scale between most popular-to-least popular answers. Work with your team to guess an answer that puts your paddle in the right place to intercept a bouncing ball and stop your opponents from scoring a goal! But be careful! The ball gets faster with each answer!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Personalized experience: Customize your game with content filters, streamer settings, or accessibility options.</li>

      <title>Which Way Up: Galaxy Games is a gravity-bending party platformer inspired by Mario Galaxy</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gravity-bending party platformer Which Way Up: Galaxy Games from Turtle Flip Studio plans to release in early 2025 with a demo available and it's crowdfunding on Kickstarter to help it expand. Inspired by Mario Galaxy, you compete in various acrobatic gravity events in this low-gravity platformer.</p>
<p>More about it: "Perform graceful gravity gymnastics, sprint away from the relentless pull of a black hole and launch your competitors into space as you battle through round after round in this gravity-defying party game! Keep playing to unlock new events! Cherry-pick your favourites for a winning edge.</p>
<p>Which Way Up gives you a unique freedom of movement not frequently felt in platformers. Experience running on walls and ceilings, orbiting around planets, or falling across an entire level by manoeuvring through gravity fields. The varying designs of the levels &amp; game modes can make you feel like you are enclosed in a small room or that you might float away into the emptiness of space. Each game mode has different objectives, creating many opportunities for chaos, sabotage and mischief."</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/turtle-flip/which-way-up-galaxy-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crowdfunding on Kickstarter</a>, the campaign looks to fund support in its leadup to launch, as well as being able to fund additional platforms, more content, and more stretch goals to be revealed.</p>
<p>It will have full Native Linux support, with a demo available to try. They also plan to ensure it's optimized for Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental gets a big change for video playback in games on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new update to Proton Experimental with a big change for how they handle video playback, and hopefully give a nice compatibility boost for Windows games on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The update released today, October 23rd, has a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> that notes fixed or improved video playback for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gal*Gun 2</li>
<li>SOULCALIBUR VI</li>
<li>Call of Cthulhu</li>
<li>All-Star Fruit Racing</li>
<li>Greedfall</li>
<li>Onimusha: Warlords</li>
<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</li>
<li>Indigo Park: Chapter 1</li>
<li>Agony Unrated</li>
<li>TELEFORUM</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/857883721729708099gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Call of Cthulhu</em></p>
<p>In the linked GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8186" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issue</a> developer Arek Hiler mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Living true to its name <em>Proton Experimental</em> will serve as a vehicle to <strong>roll out and test a new implementation of media source</strong>. While it improves video playback in many games and enables us to fix even more things in the future, the change is substantial and may cause regressions.</p>
<p>We've done extensive internal testing and made the changes available via the bleeding-edge beta branch already. Now it's time to push this experiment even further - into the default Proton Experimental.</p>
<p><strong>In case of regressions in video playback please report them here.</strong><br/>
There's a beta branch named <code class="inline-code">old-media-source</code> (select Proton Experimental in your Steam Library -&gt; cog icon -&gt; Properties -&gt; Betas -&gt; and select the branch from the beta participation drop-down).</p>
<p>If you face any issues please make sure that they are not present with <code class="inline-code">old-media-source</code> before reporting them here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">While the above list notes improved games, there's also some games with known issues right now with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resident Evil 7 videos fail to play.</li>
<li>Resident Evil Village videos fail to play.</li>
<li>Quantum Break videos have green flashes and intermittent crashes.</li>
<li>Shin Megami Tensei III has intermittent video playback failure.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's changes like this that's why I always advise you to stick to the main versions of Proton, the latest being Proton 9, unless you specifically need Proton Experimental - as it can come with breakage.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA detail new GPU driver vulnerabilities in their October 2024 Security Bulletin</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA have released a security bulletin to detail new security issues, so it's time to update your GPU driver once again.</p>
<p>There's six vulnerabilities being disclosed today, although the date stated is October 22nd, they only emailed it today. Only <em>one</em> of the issues noted actually affects the Linux display driver (and Windows), the rest are <em>just</em> for Windows. Here's the note on the one for Linux:</p>
<p>CVE‑2024‑0126 - "NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability which could allow a privileged attacker to escalate permissions. A successful exploit of this vulnerability might lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering."</p>
<p>If you're on driver versions 565.57.01, 550.127.05, 535.216.01 or later you're secure. Otherwise, you should probably go and update. So that explains the tiny one-liner update I covered for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/nvidia-565-57-01-beta-has-wayland-and-hdr-improvements-plus-dxvk-and-vkd3d-optimizations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">550.127.05 release yesterday along with the 565.57.01 Beta</a> that was also released at the same time.</p>
<p>See more in their <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5586" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security bulletin</a>.</p>

      <title>The Rogue Prince of Persia now Steam Deck Verified with a big update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming in a day late for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-verified-round-up-your-late-october-2024-highlights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my recent Steam Deck Verified round-up</a>, The Rogue Prince of Persia from developer Evil Empire and publisher Ubisoft is now Steam Deck Verified with a big update out.</p>
<p>More about it: "Experience a fast-paced, challenging but accessible roguelite as you master acrobatic moves and flow seamlessly between platforming and combat. Find new weapons, equip trinkets with special effects and upgrade them to make your own builds. Discover new characters, information and areas as you try to find a way to save Persia from a Hun invasion and become the hero you have always wanted to be."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What to expect from the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 new Medallions with an all-new system.</li>
<li>The Book of Heads: more secondary objectives.</li>
<li>The Rescue levels: more platforming challenges.</li>
<li>Tons of tweaks, fixes &amp; polishing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Speaking in a post on Twitter (X), the developer <a href="https://x.com/Studio_Evil/status/1849107939576971713" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since the last update, The Rogue Prince of Persia is Steam Deck verified!</p>
<p>A few notes though :<br/>
1. We will continue improving performance throughout Early Access.<br/>
2. The hub and later biomes may experience occasional drops in frame rate.<br/>
3. We still recommend setting the FPS to 30max in the options."</p>

<p>This comes at the same time as news that Ubisoft has disbanded the team behind Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0j8p8l26pgo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BBC</a>). However, there were no layoffs this time around, instead developers have been moved to other projects.</p>

      <title>Get your own UFO in the latest No Man&#39;s Sky update during a really weird Expedition</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games have updated No Man's Sky again, bringing with it a reality-bending new Expedition with The Cursed.</p>
<p>Unlike some previous updates, this doesn't include some major new features elsewhere, as it seems firmly focused on this new Expedition that runs for the next two weeks. There are of course plenty of bug fixes across the whole game though.</p>
<p>So what's The Cursed all about then? Taking place in a "sort of twilight realm, straddling the boundary between one reality and the next", here the very boundaries of reality are crumbling and things will start getting pretty weird. During it you can get a few new items like an exclusive jetpack customization and the Boundary Herald Starship which looks very much like a classic UFO blended with a Millennium Falcon,</p>

      <title>EA Anti-Cheat arrives for Battlefield 1 breaking it on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here. EA Anti-Cheat has now been rolled out into Battlefield 1, breaking another multiplayer game on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux.</p>
<p>We've known it was coming for a little while <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/08/battlefield-1-gets-ea-anticheat-in-september-will-be-left-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as I reported back in August</a>, EA were planning this roll-out originally for September, but it seems it was later delayed until a day ago where it's only just now become live. Battlefield 1 joins the likes of Battlefield 2042, Battlefield V, EA SPORTS WRC and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 that added EA Anti-Cheat <em>after</em> release and <em>all</em> now broken on Linux platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7736225661729686272gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>They aren't the only games completely unplayable for Steam Deck / Linux as this EA Anti-Cheat is also in EA SPORTS FC 25, EA SPORTS Madden NFL 25, F1 24 and EA will continue using it for future multiplayer games so we can expect them all to be unplayable at release. </p>
<p>How long until they roll this out into Apex Legends to replace Easy Anti-Cheat? It must be only a matter of time now.</p>
<p>Anti-Cheat continues to be the biggest issue for gaming on Steam Deck / Linux, like how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/grand-theft-auto-v-gets-battleye-anti-cheat-breaks-online-play-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V is also now broken</a> due to adding in BattlEye with Rockstar refusing to enable it for Proton.</p>

      <title>Creepy retro horror game Fear the Spotlight is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fear the Spotlight from Cozy Game Pals and Blumhouse Games is a retro-styled horror game that looks like it would fit right in on the original PlayStation. It's just be re-released on Steam with Linux support. <em>Note: key provided by fortyseven.</em></p>
<p>Originally released last year, the developers took it off Steam to expand it a little with new content and fix up various reported issues. The result? A seriously tension-filled love letter to PS1 survival horror, with little nods to Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and a perfect fit for your 2024 Halloween to get in the mood.</p>
<p>Starring a bit of an odd couple, Vivian and Amy, who are very much the opposites in terms of style and personality. One night they decide to break into their high school to find a spirit board to hold a séance, and as you might expect from a horror game — it doesn't exactly go to plan.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cEo__9Fd3w8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0abbe577f8a7f351f1dfca18e1358807.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cEo__9Fd3w8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's quite interesting is that you get to play through two different stories here. The first one that serves up as an intro into all the game mechanics, the setting and the atmosphere and then a few hours in once you finish the main story it will flip (in a way I won't spoil) so that you get a taste of things from another perspective.</p>
<p>It's not a particularly scary game (although definitely creepy) that relies on the atmosphere and not jump scares or combat. Fear the Spotlight is all about hide and seek from enemies, and all the disturbing sounds to make your heart race a little. There's plenty of puzzles to do as well, which will change how you interact with the game from the third-person exploration into more of a point and click interface that nicely splits up the exploration (and gives you a chance to breathe a little easier). The puzzles aren't particularly challenging either, so overall it's one that would be quite a nice entry into the genre and for perhaps a slightly younger adult / late teen audience to appreciate.</p>
<p>As long as you can stand the retro visuals, you're in for a bit of a treat. Visually, I think the retro look works a lot better with these types of horror games than it does other genres, it just seems more fitting somehow and Fear the Spotlight really does look and feel the part. Not an overly long game either that you can likely finish between 5-6 hours, so it won't take you forever to get through either (which works in its favour).</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support. Although, the Native Linux version has an issue where the audio will go to the wrong output (a bug that happens on Steam Deck too). So you have to manually switch it over in your system settings. Another bug I encountered was the Linux version repeatedly locking itself to 20FPS. Neither bugs are present when playing the Windows version with Proton 9.</p>

      <title>Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux (UMU) v1.1.3 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing to improve compatibility with Windows games on Linux outside of Steam, the Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux (UMU) has another release out now.</p>
<p>Following on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/unified-linux-wine-game-launcher-umu-gets-a-first-official-release/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first official release in early October</a>, this release focuses on various bug fixes and ensuring it works well for Lutris and the Heroic Games Launcher.</p>
<p>A refresher on what it is: forming part of <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Open Wine Components</a>, it's <em>not</em> a launcher in the sense of it being an app like Steam, Heroic Games, Lutris, Bottles, Legendary and so on. Instead, it's a tool that various apps can use to run Windows games on Linux, acting as a copy of the Steam Runtime Tools and Steam Linux Runtime that Valve uses for Proton to allow Proton to properly run <em>outside</em> of Steam. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/zoom-platform-store-announces-new-tool-to-run-windows-games-on-linux-with-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Zoom Platform store have begun using it</a> too.</p>
<p>From the v1.1.3 <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher/releases/tag/1.1.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that prevented heroic and lutris from using UMU as a game installer instead of wine</li>
<li>Fixed issue where sometimes DISPLAY envvar would get lost between handoff from umu to pressure vessel</li>
<li>Refactor/cleanup of window management code under gamescope -- both lutris and heroic can fully install and run games inside gamescope while both inside or outside of flatpak now.</li>
<li>Winetricks is now fully useable through UMU and GE-Proton/UMU-Proton</li>
<li>Updated apparmor bwrap permission profile to recommendations from upstream apparmor folks</li>
<li>Added a basic shim script to allow performing modifications inside the pressure vessel container after UMU handoff has happened.</li>
<li>Cleaned up standalone flatpak script to prepare for submission upstream</li>
<li>Fixed a few places that needed lock files in place to prevent prefix corruption if multiple instances are running</li>
<li>Missing 32 bit dependencies added for Nix packaging</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're still working out github task attachments for releases being automated. For now we're manually attaching from the latest 1.1.3 builds in the actions section. Thanks for baring with us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A refactor was submitted to Lutris to allow full UMU functionality on the lutris side:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/lutris/lutris/commit/3a45272a35dd61f32bd164660d670f9737c4146a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lutris/lutris@<tt>3a45272</tt></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lutris and Heroic also should be receiving the permissions they need in flatpak soon if not already:<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint/commit/7aa23001f49beb946a58ecfd445e66d7e0349637" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">flathub-infra/flatpak-builder-lint@<tt>7aa2300</tt></a></p>

      <title>Escape Simulator gets a free Talos Principle DLC out now, plus a paid DLC in December</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape Simulator from Pine Studio continues doing some really cool additions, with The Talos Principle getting a little free crossover DLC out now. As long as you have the base game, you can grab this DLC for nothing (permanently).</p>
<p>It's a one room pack, although they said it's bigger than the standard ones and take you around 45 minutes to finish it. It also looks really great and fitting with the style of Talos. </p>

<p>The developer said: "As huge fans of the series here at Pine Studio, we’ve worked hard to capture the essence of its deep philosophical themes, mind-bending puzzles, and breathtaking environments. In this DLC, players will face a series of intricate puzzles and challenges inspired by The Talos Principle universe. Whether you are a veteran of Escape Simulator or a fan of The Talos Principle, we believe this room will offer a unique, engaging experience that bridges the gap between these two beloved puzzle game worlds."</p>
<p>Additionally an Escape Simulator: Mayan DLC will release on December 5th with four new rooms, new outfits, a new soundtrack a more:</p>

      <title>Science fantasy roguelike epic Caves of Qud releases December 5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Freehold Games and Kitfox Games have announced the thoroughly strange and unique science fantasy roguelike epic Caves of Qud is leaving Early Access on December 5. A day I've long been waiting for to really fully dive into the world, especially so with the refreshed tutorial and the finished up story.</p>
<p>A fresh Beta release is available right now that has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Repolished the tutorial with new graphics, some new dialog, and several bugfixes.</li>
<li>Added a tutorial sequence to teach resting until healed.</li>
<li>We did a big refactor of the options menu, cleaning up option categories and text, gating advanced options behind a checkbox, and deleting some deprecated options.</li>
<li>We did a refactor of the control bindings menu, cleaning up binding categories and text and deleting some deprecated bids.</li>
<li>Stunning Force now deals damage in up to 3 increments based on proximity to the center of the blast, as it's supposed to.</li>
<li>Fixed several small bugs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>1.0 release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="87TKcq4tcJ4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/52258000d8bb63ab7374b84c18b68a7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/87TKcq4tcJ4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The price will be going up in a week too, so grabbing it right now would be a good idea. At the release they'll also be putting out a "Dromad Deluxe edition" that will include the game, an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack, with in-game companions for your character. The DLC includes pets that were originally exclusive to their Patreon supporters plus some new ones too.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 565.57.01 Beta has Wayland and HDR improvements, plus DXVK and VKD3D optimizations</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA today released two new Linux drivers. The big one is the NVIDIA 565.57.01 Beta, along with a one-liner update in the stable 550.127.05 release.</p>
<p>The stable release driver <strong><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/233004/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">550.127.05</a></strong> mentions "Fixed a bug which could cause applications using GBM to crash when running with nvidia-drm.modeset=0".</p>
<p>While the bigger NVIDIA <strong><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/233008/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">565.57.01</a></strong> Beta includes various new features and fixes I've split below for easy reading.</p>
<p>New Features &amp; Improvements</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Re-enabled GLX_EXT_buffer_age on Xwayland. This extension had been previously disabled on Xwayland due to a bug which is now fixed.</li>
<li>Added support for mmap of exported DMA-BUF objects.</li>
<li>Added several new per-plane and per-CRTC vendor-specific properties to nvidia-drm. These properties may be used by Wayland compositors to program the GPU's color pipeline for HDR hardware acceleration.</li>
<li>Introduced a driver optimization to mitigate the performance loss from the 'd3d9.floatEmulation' option in DXVK.</li>
<li>Updated the framelock settings page of the nvidia-settings control panel to use the GTK3 theme text color rather than defaulting to white for the text color, improving legibility with some themes.</li>
<li>Implemented support for VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control.</li>
<li>Reduced some cases of stutter with OpenGL syncing to vblank while using GSP firmware.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bug Fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause suspend/resume to fail when using the NVreg_PreserveVideoMemoryAllocations option: <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/issues/472</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the cursor image to be truncated on Gamescope: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1099</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused FarCry 5 running through DXVK to display a black screen.</li>
<li>Fixed some performance regressions that were observed with Vkd3d 2.9.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause flickering in some applications when using Unified Back Buffer (UBB).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause incorrect and/or washed out colors to be displayed with HDR scanout: <a href="https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=482780</a></li>
<li>Implemented support for VK_EXT_depth_clamp_control.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which could cause applications using GBM to crash when running with nvidia-drm.modeset=0.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause kernel crashes upon attempting KMS operations through DRM when nvidia_drm was loaded with modeset=0.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Auto-battler dungeon crawler Skull Horde announced by dev of BORE BLASTERS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BORE BLASTERS developer 8BitSkull have announced their next game, Skull Horde, which will be released in 2025 with Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>In Skull Horde you play as a flying skull necromancer as you raise an ever-growing skeletal army and battle through procedurally generated dungeons, collecting casket-loads of boons and loot and unlocking powerful perks to upgrade the your little horde and achieve each soldier's fullest necrotic potential. </p>
<p>Their teaser trailer is below, although it has no gameplay footage at all:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vGag1TvgQI4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cd048269138e6ff73cf516358c2a11c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vGag1TvgQI4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since that was a lot of nothing, here's some screenshots of what it actually looks like:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7731976401729600540gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7731976401729600540gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5863610851729600541gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5863610851729600541gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17105484651729600541gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17105484651729600541gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20952884851729600542gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/20952884851729600542gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Procedurally Generated Dungeons: </strong>Explore different procedurally generated dungeons, each with unique enemy types that demand different battle strategies. Different challenges require creative builds to overcome, lest you be sent to the grave yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Realtime Auto Battling:</strong> Battles in <em>Skull Horde</em> are duked out in real-time, and your minions do battle independently. Develop your squad, choose where to explore, when to move on, and when to send your enemies six feet under.</li>
<li><strong>For Whom the Bell Tolls?:</strong> Test out different playable characters with unique special abilities to see which one fits your particular style of death dealing. </li>
<li><strong>Rise from Your Grave: </strong>Raise the dead and put them to work, battling swarms of wretched flesh soldiers. Diversify your army or merge unit types to gain stronger versions and unlock unique abilities.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful Loot and Boons: </strong>Each dungeon type is filled with chests and shrines with powerful loot and boons to collect, but don’t get greedy–lest you risk being overwhelmed by the horde.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Their previous games <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/bore-blasters-will-be-your-next-fixation-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BORE BLASTERS</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/03/fates-of-ort-is-an-rpg-where-time-stops-until-you-move-its-absolutely-great-and-its-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fates of Ort</a> are really good, so hopefully this is too.</p>

      <title>AutoForge is Terraria mixed with Factorio, devs plan Steam Deck and controller support soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending the mining and side-scrolling from Terraria, with the building and automation from Factorio — AutoForge looks interesting. Maybe this will scratch an itch you didn't know you had.</p>
<p>More about it: "A 2D automation sandbox adventure. Build an automated factory with Mana-powered machines, progress through an expansive tech tree, explore a vast and wonderful world, upgrade yourself with ancient technologies, and defend it all from invasions."</p>
<p>Currently in Early Access since March, the developer released a new trailer and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1960480/view/4552668120494283642" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of what's to come next. For players who like to kick-back and relax there's good news as right up next on their list is Steam Deck support, controller support and UI improvements. After that they're planning a whole lot more extra content and eventually mod support too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5c8jg3Qt7hM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/61bf9433f6c07840ccf6c1dbac2cd3b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5c8jg3Qt7hM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Currently it has a Steam Deck Playable rating, so hopefully it can get bumped up to Verified. It has a Silver rating on ProtonDB but a lot of the reports are old.</p>

      <title>Get over 60 games free with Prime Gaming right now - many work on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another round up of some free games you can get to play on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux thanks to Prime Gaming. You just need to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then you can head over to Prime Gaming to redeem them all.</p>
<p>Trying a slightly different format to last time sorting them into a nice table for you. Hopefully you find this useful. I'll use the Steam Deck Rating from Valve (<img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Verified, <img alt="steam deck playable" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_playable.png"/> Playable, <img alt="steam deck unsupported" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_unsupported.png"/> Unsupported and <img alt="steam deck not rated" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_notrated.png"/> Not Rated), plus the <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> rating to help you decide on what to play.</p>
<p>Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>
<p>Here's the current list as of 22nd October, 2024:</p>

      <title>Portal 2 project lead wants Valve to return to single-player games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During PAX Aus 2024 not only did we get the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-officially-comes-to-australia-in-november/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck for Australia</a> announcement, but the project leader on Valve's own Portal 2 did an interview with KIWI TALKZ.</p>
<p>The interview goes over many things about what it was like at Valve, scepticism around the original release of Steam itself, there's a Q&amp;A section and so on. One bit that sticks out is how even the lead on Portal 2 really hopes that Valve return to more single-player games.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from what Josh Weier said in reply to a question that brings up how the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/risk-of-rain-creators-hopoo-games-join-valve/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Risk of Rain creators Hopoo Games joining Valve</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've been out of Valve for 7 years now. So I don't really have a lot of insight into what they're doing. When I left the company had certainly shifted away from thinking about single player and they were very interested in VR and they were very interested in the counter-strikes and DOTA and kind of more games of service. That never resonated with me, I'm a single player person, I don't care for games as a service, I don't want to do that so that was a big reason I was like eh I'll go do something else. I'd love to see them get back to those roots because obviously that's the thing I think they did incredibly well. And I want to play that as a customer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Full interview video is below, the particular section above is about 53:00 in:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="t9K83HkJb3k"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2e374fb124f5ae788418459d83ca104.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/t9K83HkJb3k" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Always good to hear more behind the scenes from people who used to work for Valve. You don't get this kind of insight too often, with Valve continuing to be a pretty tight-lipped company.</p>
<p>What single player game would you have as your number 1 for Valve to bring out next?</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors: Ode to Castlevania is the latest expansion to the smash hit survivor game that started it all, and it's coming on Halloween. This is their third collab and it's a huge one too.</p>
<p>The developer said "Vampire Survivors would have been a very different game hadn't it been influenced by Castlevania in the first place, so this is straight up the definition of a dream coming true". You can expect to see over 20 characters, over 40 weapons, 1 new huge stage, over 30 music covers and much more.</p>
<p>With the new stage they said it's the biggest one yet, with multiple biomes to battle through, with special icons on the map to help you get through it. There's also going to be a free 1.2 update patch that will include zooming on the map, performance improvements, a UI revamp for picking music and more.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aGAlK-DIeAE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c0cf319ca85e04aa7bfdf7d143c7351.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aGAlK-DIeAE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developer poncle also confirmed more free updates are coming.</p>

      <title>Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak from Remedy aims for Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well this is excellent news. I'm a big fan of Control and the world of Remedy Entertainment games and their new multiplayer spin-off FBC: Firebreak should get Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>So what is it? "FBC: Firebreak is a cooperative first-person shooter set within a mysterious federal agency under assault by otherworldly forces. As a years-long siege on the agency’s headquarters reaches its boiling point, only Firebreak— the Bureau’s most versatile unit—has the gear and the guts to plunge into the building’s strangest crises, restore order, and blast their way back from the brink."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tBO__RWUbKM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ad752c97232dfe49479e60b152b2c76b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tBO__RWUbKM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will be released on Steam in 2025 and in their official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2272540/discussions/0/4695657408664075439/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> post they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you know Remedy’s games, they tend to look amazing but have high PC requirements. With this game, while the graphics will be great, we want to ensure that more people can play, so we are going to aim for a wider range of PC hardware, <strong>including Steam Deck</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours.</em></p>
<p>Anti-cheat is still a constant source of problems for Linux / Steam Deck gaming, so hopefully being a co-op shooter they might not even need any. Although some other co-op games do have it, it all depends what their plans are, but at least the Steam Deck is already firmly in their minds to support.</p>
<p>Nice to see that Steam won't be seeing a delayed release here either, no Epic exclusive deals like with Alan Wake 2, which Epic Games were the actual publisher of.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Cleared Hot looks like the nostalgic helicopter shooter I need</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With fond memories of playing the likes of Desert Strike for endless hours, Cleared Hot looks exactly what I've been wanting in a modern take on it. Developed by Cfinger Games and now MicroProse Software are jumping in as publisher it's sounding really promising.</p>
<p>In Cleared Hot, players step into the cockpit of a fully upgradeable attack helicopter. You get the classic arcade shooter action blended nicely with modern physics-based mechanics. Players will shoot, dodge, and use creative tactics to move squads across dynamic battlefields while using an innovative rope and magnet system to interact with the environment. From picking up vehicles and redirecting heat-seeking missiles to throwing rocks at enemies, the game offers a truly unique and emergent take on how players can achieve battlefield control.</p>

<p>This is quite a funny one. Taking the basic idea of snake where you're constantly growing, but you control a wobbly car that can jump.</p>
<p>Due to the controls and the level layouts, it's actually a lot of fun and surprisingly challenging once you get a really long line going. The added little challenges are nice, from what little there was in the demo its really promising and I definitely can't wait to see more from this for a bit of casual fun. Worth keeping an eye on for sure.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Addictive Gameplay: Build the longest caravan, use jumping to make your line even more complex!</li>
<li>Unique Levels: Specific cars, tricks and missions in each level — no two drives are the same!</li>
<li>Colorful Cartoon Style: Enjoy colorful, retro-inspired graphics with a playful vibe and music to match it!</li>
<li>Endless Fun: Compete for high scores and see how long you can keep your caravan intact!</li>
<li>Over 100 missions to complete.</li>
</ul>

<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3171910/PAKO_Caravan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It's due for release later this year with Linux support. There's a demo that went up for Steam Next Fest but it's not clear if the demo will stick around. </p>

      <title>Duake puts the Doomguy in Quake</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mashing two of the greats together, Duake brings the Doomguy along with their full arsenal into the classic Quake. Created by a modder with a slightly amusing name, Magic Nipples, this isn't just some basic mod that just dumps a Doom model into Quake, it includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Doomguy, and his arsenal of weapons (duh).</li>
<li>Added 2 HUD types for the full Doom hud and a Doom 64 like minimal HUD.</li>
<li>Added the rifle to replace the nailgun.</li>
<li>Completely redone episode 1 of Quake with colored lighting, colored water, new props, enemy placement, and the inclusion of some episode 2-4 enemies on hard difficulty.</li>
<li>Added a new wall demon enemy as seen above.</li>
<li>Added a spectre mode for the Fiend.</li>
<li>Reworked some of the enemies to have different attacks or adjusted attacks.</li>
<li>Reworked the Chthon fight to be much more interesting.</li>
<li>Added a few new secrets here and there.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer even made a trailer for it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tVOYmYUWkmE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fa785f07b3c66ab2fa1683643773c06d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tVOYmYUWkmE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For it you do need to own a copy of Quake as it uses the PAK files from it. There's also currently only a downloadable Windows build, but I've verified that it seems to run nice with Wine.</p>
<p>Could be your fun distraction for the week.</p>

      <title>Free and open source strategy-shooter Unvanquished 0.55 brings big enhancements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unvanquished is having a bit of a big moment, with some fresh coders doing some great work on this strategy-shooter that's similar in basic idea to Natural Selection. <em>This project was originally forked from the classic Tremulous.</em></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://unvanquished.net/unvanquished-0-55-awesomeness-has-arrived/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> announcing the release of Unvanquished 0.55 they've overhauled quite a lot of the visuals which includes fixes to some long-standing bugs, while also doing some <em>huge</em> optimizations.</p>
<p>There's a <em>lot</em> of really technical stuff most users likely won't understand from a new skybox that made the sky rendering go from 1000 triangles on the CPU every frame to just 12, to screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO) optimizations and doing more precompute with shaders rather than doing things every frame. The gist, as the developers say, the "engine and the game are now much more faster than ever".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19032581121729503147gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19032581121729503147gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9644015541729503145gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9644015541729503145gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Unvanquished 0.55 on Linux, click to enlarge the pics.</em></p>
<p>They dropped the requirements to run it down to OpenGL 2.1 and mentioned even a "Raspberry 3B+ can sustain up to 60 FPS on the lowest preset". Quite impressive really.</p>
<p>Not just performance work they've also fixed up and improved many parts of how the game looks like new weapon models, fixed fog, fixed various sprite rendering, dynamic lights are now less blocky, a fix for a 9 year old soft particles bug where some visuals didn't even show and improvements to the user interface.</p>
<p>There's also some new graphical toys included to modernize the look and rendering of the game with OpenGL 4.6 in an experimental stage like reflection mapping, plus a material system that will bump a lot of the rendering from the CPU to the GPU. Also AI improvements, lots of translations work and there's more to come now this release is out.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 comes to Steam in January 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Excellent news. PlayStation Publishing, Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software are bringing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 over to Steam on January 30, 2025. However, as with seemingly all Sony PC ports now, it will require a PlayStation Network Account despite being a single-player game and so will lock out various regions where the PSN is not supported.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wOJaeD0Si04"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/974f5b363179323d38796366ea145b17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wOJaeD0Si04" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Bringing Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered and Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales to a new audience on PC together with Insomniac and Marvel Games has been a great experience for us at Nixxes,” says Julian Huijbregts, Community Manager at Nixxes. “We are excited to continue this collaboration and bring Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 to PC with a suite of enhanced features, including enhanced ray-tracing options, to take full advantage of a variety of setups and configurations. Stay tuned for more details on features and recommended specs closer to launch.”</p>
<p>It will come in two editions.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Edition:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The complete game</li>
<li>All the latest updates since Marvel Spider-Man 2’s PS5 launch, including:</li>
<li>14 new suits</li>
<li>New Game+</li>
<li>Ultimate Levels</li>
<li>New Symbiote Suit Styles</li>
<li>Time of Day options</li>
<li>Post-Game Achievements</li>
<li>Action Figure Mode in Photo Mode</li>
<li>Screen Reader and Audio Descriptions</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Digital Deluxe Edition:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The complete game with updates listed above</li>
<li>5 exclusive suits for Peter Parker</li>
<li>5 exclusive suits for Miles Morales</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Arachknight Suit (Peter)</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Shadow-Spider Suit (Miles)</li>
<li>Early unlock for the Web Grabber gadget</li>
<li>+5 skill points </li>
<li>Additional Photo Mode items</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They haven't yet revealed all the usual PC extras, which will no doubt come in a future blog post when they continue their marketing towards release like they've done for previous PC ports.</p>
<p>Okay, now I really need to actually play through Miles Morales…but I think a replay of the first one is also due.</p>
<p>How do we think this one will run on Steam Deck?</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamOS alternative Bazzite adds support for OneXPlayer plus improvements for ROG Ally</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite is a SteamOS alternative that just keeps getting better. So while Valve have yet to release the Steam Deck version of SteamOS for others, Bazzite could be one of your best choices for Linux on handhelds.</p>
<p>The latest release has been <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-update-onexplayer-support-ally-goodies/4517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> under a new versioning scheme. They're no longer doing versions like Bazzite "3.8" (which this would technically be) instead matching the upstream Fedora versioning so they say this is "Stable (F40.20241013)" and the last before they swap over to the newer Fedora 41 for the base of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Anyway, what's new?</strong></p>
<p>Say hello to Bazzite on OneXPlayer devices like the X1 (AMD), X1 Mini, OneXFly variants and Mini Pro. They say it includes "full RGB support, back buttons, turbo button and a lot more custom features for them such as choosing what the turbo button and keyboard button do". Although there's still "a long way to go" with features missing like "fan curves, battery capacity limits, and vibration intensity + some other minor issues".</p>
<p>The fun part? OneXPlayer will be helping out as they said "we are proud to state that OneXPlayer will be helping us on that journey".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6159632261729273405gol1.jpeg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - OneXPlayer X1 with the new Steam Controller emulation</em></p>
<p>They've also hooked up support for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/hori-announced-a-special-gamepad-for-steam-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new HORI Steam Controller</a> too. Still haven't seen word on a release for it outside of Japan though, annoyingly!</p>
<p>Owners of the ROG Ally and Ally X will also be happy with this update as they've improved their "Modern Standby patch series" to <em>eventually</em> make it possible to allow background game downloads. As for what's updated for right now: it includes fixes for controller issues and sleeping, and hopefully it also fixed a bug where the Ally gets stuck at 6W after sleeping. Other improvements for the Ally series include "the frame limit slider to include all framerates from 12hz to 120hz AND to work while VRR is on or off" which is the code done in Gamescope <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/gamescope-gets-improved-rog-ally-support-hinting-at-more-progress-for-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I previously reported on</a> - so it was actually for Bazzite. On top of that they said there's a fix for "the VRR toggle to work alongside the framerate limiter".</p>
<p>Sounds like Bazzite development is going really well.</p>
<p>Be sure to see more on the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> to try it.</p>

      <title>Drova - Forsaken Kin is an impressive pixel-art action-RPG for you to check out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Drova - Forsaken Kin from developer Just2D and publisher Deck13 was released recently, and if you love action RPGs it's one you need to check out. <em>Note: key provided by Deck13.</em></p>
<p>A grim dark fantasy pixel-art action-RPG that has gameplay inspired by Gothic and Morrowind where it won't hold your hand, with visuals inspired by Baldur's Gate 2 (so the publisher tells me). Very much its own beast though, one you're going to need to slow down and spend a bit of time with to take it all in, so it's great that it has such a good atmosphere that you won't want to put it down. That intro section especially really suckered me right in, I just wanted to know more and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Ov9kmm4TM94"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/94774606b1e336051d35187885d47263.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Ov9kmm4TM94" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the combat, I have no doubt there will be a few soulslike comparisons to it. I would understand <em>why</em> if others said so, as the combat can be a little bit on the punishing side. There's a lot of game mechanics going on to understand too.</p>
<p>You have single and double-handed weapons (both melee and ranged), off-hand weapons, spells you get from scrolls, you have to dodge enemy attacks and watch for their tells to not get stomped, combo moves if you time things right and more. Weapons have to be drawn out to attack as well, or put away to actually inspect or interact with the world. <em>I've been genuinely surprised by how good Drova is.</em></p>
<p>Enemies don't scale to your level either, so if you get lost (and you probably will) you're going to need to be careful. Walk off too far before you're ready, and something will probably make a meal out of you.</p>
<p>I like the exploration side of it too, where you go into a special inspect mode to be able to see a bit more, although you cannot attack while you're doing so. But, it enables you to often find certain items and enemies hidden away by trees, bushes and more. Speaking of exploration and its inspiration, prepare to get lost. The map system is deliberatly rubbish, with the map just being pretty basic and you need to manually place markers with ink purchased from vendors. So you need to stock up and pay attention while exploring, and remember to mark your map.</p>
<p>Since it's an RPG, it does have a level system too, however, you need to find certain NPCs to sort through your skills and abilities.</p>
<p>There's a few silly English grammar errors here and there in the writing but it doesn't really distract from the experience, not as much as some of the "hmms" and grunts from random NPCs while you're around them – that's quite annoying to hear repeated in the background.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>30 - 40 hours of playtime.</li>
<li>An interface which doesn’t tell you what to do.</li>
<li>Flow based combat system with multiple weapon classes and magic.</li>
<li>Tailored story based on your actions and dialogues.</li>
<li>Join one of two factions to survive in this world.</li>
<li>Unique pixel art style.</li>
<li>Seamless open world with no loading times attached.</li>
<li>Multiple possible endings.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is playable on the Steam Deck although no rating from Valve yet. On Steam Deck it felt pretty good, and performed well in the sections I played. One problem was naming my character, with the keyboard needing to be manually pulled up and it didn't take the input correctly so hopefully they solve that.</p>
<p>Overall, a fantastic entry into the action-RPG genre worth exploring. Having a lot of fun with it and I think you will too.</p>

      <title>Russian roulette with a shotgun, Buckshot Roulette will add multiplayer on October 31</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Buckshot Roulette is a clever game putting a spin on the lethal game of Russian roulette but with a shotgun and items to help you along the way. At the end of October you'll be able to betray your friends too.</p>
<p>I was absolutely hooked on this when it came to Steam, and now perhaps I will be again. The short rounds mixed with the tense atmosphere — it's great. The multiplayer update lands on October 31st with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New items for strategic mutual annihilation. No pills included.</li>
<li>Round customization from more health points to item load outs for your convenience.</li>
<li>Brand new music from Mike Klubnika.</li>
<li>A bunch of new faces kindly provided to us by Volta Standard Electronics.</li>
<li>And the special sting of betrayal from your friends and loved ones.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Halls of Torment hits 1 million sales - more free updates planned</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Halls of Torment has been a great hit for developers Chasing Carrots, with it hitting 1 million sales on Steam. So great to see another game made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> doing so well, especially nice that it is Steam Deck Verified and has a Native Linux version too.</p>
<p><em>What is it? Imagine Vampire Survivors and the original Diablo had a baby. It's a little like that.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2218750/view/4512135723845697648" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they said "It’s a great achievement for us so close after the release, and we’ve decided our journey won’t end here. We want to move further after leaving Early Access. We are currently working on some additional free content, fixing more bugs, and improving the game’s performance.".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JdQweTEsOUE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/12e755eacdb544b3aa69cb5d13f9b108.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JdQweTEsOUE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Additionally they have a little <a href="https://open.codecks.io/hot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of some things they're working on. Plus they want to make a Supporter DLC that will include "character and UI skins, the soundtrack, and maybe an additional surprise" which they will use as a sort of test for DLC integration and if things go well they will use it to properly extend the game (along with free updates).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2218750/Halls_of_Torment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Red Rogue Sea looks like a deck-building pirating version of FTL: Faster Than Light</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I adored FTL: Faster Than Light and Red Rogue Sea looks like a sweet evolution of the gameplay with pirates and deck-building. Announced yesterday by Firemage Studios this is one to stick on your watch list for sure, I can easily see myself spending hours and hours in this one.</p>
<p>"Red Rogue Sea is a roguelike strategy game that puts you in the shoes of a pirate captain and their crew. You will manage your vessel as you sail through the treacherous waters of the archipelago, interacting with the scum that inhabits it. Make decisions that impact the outcome of various events and the overall narrative."</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L4Ib1sWZqQA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1682230db33b979365b5505ebaf07605.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L4Ib1sWZqQA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unlock your fleet: Gain access to new ships and factions enabling the use of diverse strategies to outwit the fleet of the fearsome Admiral White.</li>
<li>Manage Your Own Vessel: To survive events and battles, you’ll need to command your crew with a firm hand and ensure that all ship systems and resources are used in the most optimal way. Prove that you’re a natural-born strategist!</li>
<li>Build Your Tactical Deck: In the heat of battle, you’ll command your crew to execute various actions through a deck of tactic cards that you can build and upgrade, gradually adapting it to your playstyle.</li>
<li>Immersive Narrative: Red Rogue Sea features a complex archipelago of islands inhabited by adventurers, wrongdoers, fortune seekers, and of course, ordinary folk. You’ll sail from island to island, interacting with different events and learning more about the place, its people, and the tales of legendary treasures sought by generations of pirates. Your actions will shape the course of your own story, leading you down different—and dangerous—paths.</li>
<li>Pirate’s Nest: In each game, you’ll create a unique captain and choose a ship to command. These seas are dangerous, and it’s likely your greed will eventually lead you to a watery grave... but that won’t stop you from trying again with another pirate captain!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3200220/Red_Rogue_Sea/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a> - it releases sometime in Spring 2025. Going by the Steam page it will have Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Assassin&#39;s Creed Mirage arrives on Steam as Ubisoft return to Valve&#39;s store</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Things are not going exactly well for Ubisoft right now, and so they continue returning to Steam with Assassin's Creed Mirage released today. This follows on from its release a year ago where it was only available via the Epic Games Store and Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>If you missed the news recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/assassins-creed-shadows-and-star-wars-outlaws-head-to-steam-as-ubisoft-return-to-same-day-releases/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft are moving back to same-day releases</a> on Steam! We have Star Wars Outlaws to come in November, and Assassin's Creed Shadows later since it was delayed.</p>
<p>As usual though it does use Denuvo with a machine activation limit, so if you're playing on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck, you'll want to be careful on switching around <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> versions for it otherwise you'll get locked out for 24 hours. On top of that it also uses the Ubisoft Connect Launcher, which at times had some issues in Proton but it should work mostly fine.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IRNOoOYVn80"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/147bd1bbb109d0c60bb21b8a3e63e29c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IRNOoOYVn80" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for Steam Deck compatibility? No official Valve rating yet but Ubisoft stated in a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3035570/view/4509883924033497574" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> it will get a "Playable" rating soon with an update planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is playable on Steam Deck. While it is currently displayed in the “Unknown category”, the “Playable” Steam Deck label will be coming in the next few weeks through a new update.<br/>
This next update will allow to launch the game on Steam Deck with low settings by default to best optimize the experience.<br/>
Note that applying higher settings may impact the experience and lead to instability when playing on Steam Deck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035570/Assassins_Creed_Mirage/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">50% off on Steam</a> until October 24th.</p>

      <title>Valve makes a big improvement for Native Linux games in a Steam Beta update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released a new update to the Steam Client Beta for Steam Deck and Desktop, with some Steam Input changes and some improvements for Linux too. It's the same across Desktop / Deck since it's a Steam Client update.</p>
<p>The changes for Steam Input include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Always show the controller tab in app properties for non-Steam shortcuts.</li>
<li>Added Invert X and Invert Y to Mouse Regions.</li>
<li>Scroll Wheel mode can now be chosen from the dropdown in SIAPI games (Inside of Edit Loadout, not Quick Settings).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>More interesting for us are the Linux-specific changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Steam developers can now select which Steam for Linux runtime to use for native titles. Please consult the partner site for more details.</li>
<li>Native titles will execute in 'Steam for Linux runtime 1.0 (scout)' by default, instead of the legacy runtime environment.<br/>
	This behavior is consistent with Steam Deck and promotes better compatibility across all Linux desktop distributions.<br/>
	Note that this new feature can be turned off globally with "-compat-force-slr off" on the Steam client command line.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Taken from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/4507632124224426488?l=english" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for the October 17th Beta.</em></p>
<p>What exactly is the Steam for Linux runtime? From the <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/blob/main/docs/slr-for-game-developers.md" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official guide</a> (linked from <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/platforms/linux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamworks</a>): "A collection of container environments which can be used to run Steam games on Linux in a relatively predictable container environment, instead of running directly on an unknown Linux distribution which might be old, new or unusually set up."</p>
<p>This way developers can ensure their Linux games run the same across different distributions. Now having Desktop Linux match Steam Deck by default, and letting developers pick, just seems like a thoroughly great change to me.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods new cross-platform app adds support for Heroic Games Launcher and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The newer in-development open source and cross-platform Nexus Mods app just expanded, and it's sounding awesome. Much easier modding is coming for Linux and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this is <em>not</em> finished (nowhere near done) with the amount of games supported right now being limited, but they do keep gradually expanding it. Like with the version 0.6.2 release that's out now for testing, which has added in support for modding Baldur's Gate 3! That's in addition to Stardew Valley and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>For Linux desktop and Steam Deck modders you'll be pleased to know this release also now supports the Heroic Games Launcher. This means games installed via Heroic from GOG can now be modded via this Nexus Mods app, although in this case the REDmod for Cyberpunk 2077 via Heroic was disabled but you can <a href="https://nexus-mods.github.io/NexusMods.App/users/games/Cyberpunk2077/#automated-deployment-for-redmods" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sort that</a> inside Heroic itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21406310501729174236gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Nexus Mods app on Linux</em></p>
<p>There's also been some UI improvements, and they're starting to show when a mod needs an update in the app too. On top of that there's some bug fixes like using the correct Wine prefix on Linux.</p>
<p>Really exciting to watch this app grow so we can finally have really easy multi-game modding on Linux / Steam Deck through a supported app. For now though, each update does need you to wipe things so it's more about testing and giving feedback to help shape the future but it's certainly getting there.</p>
<p>Just imagine in say a year or so when someone asks about modding on Linux / Steam Deck, and all you have to say is "use the Nexus Mods app" and away they go. Every little wall being smashed to make it easier will get more people to stick.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App/releases/tag/v0.6.2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all the details and the <a href="https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/NexusMods.App" rel="noopener" target="_blank">main GitHub page</a>.</p>

      <title>Play Golf as household objects in the challenging House Hopper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>House Hopper instantly reminded me of WHAT THE GOLF?, taking the basic idea of Golf and turning it into something totally absurd.</p>
<p>In this one you're inside a house taking on the form of a household object, starting off as a dish scrubber and you have to flip yourself all around the house, across different surfaces and just attempt to keep going. It's basically a 3D physics platformer with the levels being the house itself. It's as funny as it is frustrating and with the demo live on Steam you should definitely give it a go.</p>
<p>The controls are a little funky to get used to, and there will be many mishaps where you've launched yourself just that bit too short or too far, and end up somewhere annoying — which is all part of the fun here. As you go through you also get to unlock more objects to become, each with their own unique shape that will change how you flip and land.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PmH17jK2hlA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f4db5f53e66da020db338722315ae931.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PmH17jK2hlA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Looking forward to seeing more from this game and from the developer Random Games Generator.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2209890/House_Hopper/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux version. The full game is due to release on November 8th.</p>

      <title>Melt Them All is a bit like a retro action rogue-lite Factorio with tower defense</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stripping down automation sims to the basics, adding in some tower defense and a little rogue-lite action with retro visuals and you have Melt Them All. Combining all the fun elements of each into a tiny package that's good for short bursts, and it's incredibly cheap too. <em>Note: this was a personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that you can make fuel out of aliens, but you first have to destroy them and then mine away at their little bodies to get the ore. You have to drag around a cart to pick up the ore, and then gradually expand a production chain with lots and lots of conveyor belts.</p>
<p>There's a little survivor-like flavour here too with character buffs to unlock as you go as well, or perhaps a new item to be able to build to spend all your credits. A great distraction when you don't want something too in-depth but with fun game mechanics to keep you wanting to play more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TW9-Cfr2E5A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11d388befe37ab2ac08add560e986ef7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TW9-Cfr2E5A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The tutorial isn't particularly great but easy enough, and the mechanics are all pretty simple so it doesn't really take long to understand everything you're doing.</p>
<p>Like a lot of smaller games on Steam, it's been a bit buried with only two user reviews. But it's a nice little mix-up on all the survivor-likes coming out lately.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252500/Melt_Them_All/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Goeland is like Untitled Goose Game but you&#39;re a seagull in a town that&#39;s a bit too peaceful</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving off some early Untitled Goose Game vibes, Goeland is a non-linear open-world adventure where you're one of the most annoying birds on the planet - the seagull. <em>You can tell I live near the sea right?</em></p>
<p>Created by indie dev Bryan Martinet, you play as a mischievous seagull in a small sandboxy open world, interacting with characters and environment to solve enigmas, achieve quirky goals or take on self-imposed challenges and of course — poop on everyone.</p>
<p>In an email Martinet mentioned: "Earlier this year, I lost my job in the AAA game industry (Eidos Montréal) due to the waves of layoffs hitting the industry. I took it as an opportunity to create this game on my own. It’s been a challenging yet rewarding experience, handling every aspect of game development."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="2sD3nLCHg4E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d74005a54abe8f258f01bbb87ef33fed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/2sD3nLCHg4E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems like a fun idea! After playing a bunch of the demo I'm looking forward to seeing what other chaotic things the developer adds in. Being able to fly around and having a lot of freedom to explore will be great. The demo area is of course limited, but this small slice is promising.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play as a mischievous seagull wreaking havoc on a quiet island.</li>
<li>Engage in open-ended, sandbox-style gameplay.</li>
<li>Solve puzzles and complete objectives using stealth, creativity, manipulation.</li>
<li>Interact with various items and NPCs to cause chaos and amusement.</li>
<li>Shape and transform your surroundings based on your actions.</li>
<li>Help adorable stranded animals find their way to the ocean.</li>
<li>Enjoy charming visuals and a delightful, whimsical and dynamic soundtrack.</li>
<li>Experience dynamic reactions from the environment and characters.</li>
<li>Explore multiple areas within the island, each with its own unique challenges.</li>
<li>Interact with charming characters and assist them in their quests.</li>
<li>Enjoy relaxing gameplay with no time limits or pressure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo has a Native Linux version that works great. Have a look and try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531840/Goeland/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a> now. The full game release date has not yet been announced.</p>

      <title>Dunebound Tactics really is one to watch for strategy fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dunebound Tactics has been announced by Terahard Studios and if you're anything like me and love your strategy games, this looks like one to watch for sure.</p>
<p>After reading up on it and checking out the trailer I'm getting a sort-of Sunless Sea / Sunless Skies vibe from this with the exploration and interactions, except you're in some sort of sand-crawling ship and there's the addition of turn-based tactical combat with plenty of destruction.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="v1YgHbn-ye8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1849f0a2d4712b93b2182b76af0218cf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/v1YgHbn-ye8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Personally, I'm a huge tactics fanatic. We built our very own tactics engine with RPG elements from the ground up for Dunebound Tactics! I'm excited both for the technical innovations as well as the freedom we gave our game designers to create an amazing experience. The art in this game is the best we've managed so far connecting all the little details to squeeze performance and quality." — Aris Tsevrenis, CEO of Terahard Studios</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>

      <title>TRON: Catalyst announced from Bithell Games and Big Fan Games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently we had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/devolver-launch-big-fan-games-a-label-for-indie-devs-to-work-on-licensed-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Devolver Digital announce Big Fan Games</a> to get more games made from major licenses (tv, movies, comics etc) and the first is TRON: Catalyst.</p>
<p>This debut project from Big Fan Games brings in Bithell Games to make it who also worked on Thomas Was Alone, John Wick Hex, Tron: Identity and others. Set in the same world that Bithell Games created for Tron: Identity, it's a standalone game though that you can enjoy without playing Identity.</p>
<p>More about it: "In Disney TRON: Catalyst, players are introduced to Exo, a highly resilient and resourceful program with an incredible ability to initiate time loops. With this newfound power, Exo takes on the overlords of a crumbling Grid all while evading Conn, a malevolent agent of CORE. Exo must gain control over her mysterious abilities and uncover the unexplained ‘Glitch’ that threatens the Grid.</p>
<p>As Exo, players will battle on-foot and on Light Cycle to complete missions and gain crucial insights that will help them on their quest. While learning from her mistakes, Exo ​ will also need to navigate warring factions to unlock new paths and uncover the secrets of the Arq Grid."</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-16 released with mod support for various Bethesda games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're modding Bethesda games on Linux / Steam Deck, GE-Proton 9-16 could make things a little easier for you.</p>
<p>As your reminder: GE-Proton (or Proton-GE) a community-build of Proton, nothing to do with the official Proton from Valve. You'll find GE adds specific fixes that Valve often can't (due to legal reasons), and sometimes other special additions, but GE comes with less testing and support. Usually you only want to use it for specific games until they work properly in Valve's Proton, <em>or</em> for using Proton outside of Steam like in Heroic and Lutris. See more about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton in my guide</a>.</p>
<p>In GE-Proton 9-16 one of the main additions is a change to how Bethesda games will launch like the Fallout series, Skyrim, Oblivion and Starfield. If GE-Proton detects a known mod executable for these it will launch that <em>instead</em> of the original - something that will just save players a fair bit of messing around. Seems like a nice change!</p>
<p>Another addition is that games run with UMU (Unified launcher for Windows games on Linux), for using it outside of Steam like in Heroic Games, is that games will now have the <code class="inline-code">/mnt</code>, <code class="inline-code">/run/media</code> and <code class="inline-code">/media</code> and the user's home folder added as drives that games can see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7527689401729065035gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Skyrim</em></p>
<p>There's also a few other game-specific fixes, and the usual additions of new code from the official upstream projects.</p>
<p>Here's the full <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton9-16" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton:</p>
<ul>
<li>import upstream makefile changes</li>
<li>import upstream proton changes</li>
<li>import upstream steam_helper changes</li>
<li>import upstream vkd3d-shader changes</li>
<li>update wine to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>updated dxvk to latest git</li>
<li>update vkd3d-proton to latest git</li>
<li>update dxvk-nvapi to e4bad70</li>
</ul>
<p>Protonfixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed issue with game_titles not being pulled correctly for UMU</li>
<li>game_titles are now looked up as part of included umu-database csv instead of trying to send online website api call</li>
<li>games run with UMU will now have /mnt,/run/media,/media/, and the user's home folder added as drives u:,v:,w:,x: respectively inside the prefix if they are not empty. This is to allow users to install or import games outside of the prefix more conveniently. A typical scenario for this would be if you have your games pre-installed on a different mounted drive, or somewhere else in your home folder outside of the prefix and you want to add them without reinstalling the game, OR if you want to install the game to one of those mounts instead of the C:\ drive inside the wine prefix. With steam, users don't really have to worry about this because steam handles the drive mounts and the install locations, however we found that outside of steam users were trying to use the Z: drive (which is symlinked to root (/)) -- which is of course containerized and read only, and therefore also unable to provide a proper drive size, resulting in users being told they don't have enough space. With the new drives added into the prefix it should fix this, allowing users to access their mount locations or existing game folders for installation or importing via the new drives instead of Z:.</li>
<li>Mod support for various bethesda games has been added (Thanks Root-Core). If a mod executable is found for bethesda games it will launch the mod executable instead of the original:<br/>
	mapping = {<br/>
	'22380': ('FalloutNV.exe', 'nvse_loader.exe'), # Fallout New Vegas<br/>
	'22370': ('FalloutLauncher.exe', 'fose_loader.exe'), # Fallout 3<br/>
	'377160': ('Fallout4Launcher.exe', 'f4se_loader.exe'), # Fallout 4<br/>
	'22330': ('OblivionLauncher.exe', 'obse_loader.exe'), # Oblivion<br/>
	'72850': ('SkyrimLauncher.exe', 'skse_loader.exe'), # Skyrim<br/>
	'489830': ('SkyrimSELauncher.exe', 'skse64_loader.exe'), # Skyrim SE<br/>
	'1716740': ('Starfield.exe', 'sfse_loader.exe') # Starfield<br/>
	}.get(game_id, ('', ''))</li>
<li>protonfix added for metal gear solid 2 (thanks FranjeGueje)</li>
<li>protonfix for Kindom Hearts HD Remix added for steam version (already existed for egs version) (thanks Internetbestfriend)</li>
<li>protonfix added for Gothic Playable Teaser (thanks Root-Core)</li>
<li>Star Citizen protonfix updated (no longer requires EAC workaround)</li>
</ul>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 1 source code released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rogue Legacy, a rogue-lite from Cellar Door Games, that originally released in 2013 has now had the source code released. The game has Native Linux support and is rated Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/CellarDoorGames/status/1846246914406195662" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Twitter / X the developer noted they've been working with game porter and FNA developer, Ethan Lee, to make this happen who will be maintaining it going forward.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8915973611729018609gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The game is <u>not</u> open source though, to be completely clear on that. It's source available under a <em>custom</em> license with certain restrictions, much the same as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/01/vvvvvv-from-terry-cavanagh-has-the-source-code-opened-up-to-celebrate-the-10-year-anniversary/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VVVVVV</a> and is actually based on the license that Terry Cavanagh used for it. This is also only the source code, it does <em>not</em> include the assets - so you still need to own a copy of the game.</p>
<p>In their own <a href="https://x.com/flibitijibibo/status/1846249473741410725" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Ethan Lee posted on Twitter / X that they intend to take on community contributions to it, and they're in progress on upgrading it to use SDL 3 that's currently in Beta.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3823223841729018862gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Really great to see more developers open up the code for their older games. This way they can practically live on forever. It would have been even better if it was fully open source, but having it open like this is still a great resource for developer curious on what goes on behind the scenes to learn from as well.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/flibitijibibo/RogueLegacy1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the GitHub</a> for the source code.</p>
<p>You can buy the game from:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/rogue_legacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a></p>

      <title>Intel and AMD join up to form the x86 ecosystem advisory group to shape the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems AMD and Intel may be feeling the pressure from Arm? Today both companies announced the forming of a new x86 ecosystem advisory group to help shape the future of the platform.</p>
<p>It's not just them though they've pulled in Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) and Tim Sweeney (Epic Games), along with companies including: Broadcom, Dell, Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., Lenovo, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Red Hat as founding members.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are on the cusp of one of the most significant shifts in the x86 architecture and ecosystem in decades – with new levels of customization, compatibility and scalability needed to meet current and future customer needs,” said Pat Gelsinger, Intel CEO. “We proudly stand together with AMD and the founding members of this advisory group, as we ignite the future of compute, and we deeply appreciate the support of so many industry leaders.”</p>
<p>“Establishing the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group will ensure that the x86 architecture continues evolving as the compute platform of choice for both developers and customers,” said Lisa Su, AMD Chair and CEO. “We are excited to bring the industry together to provide direction on future architectural enhancements and extend the incredible success of x86 for decades to come.”</p>
<p>Their plan is to come together to find new ways to expand the x86 ecosystem with their intended outcomes to be:</p>
<blockquote>

      <title>Valve still waiting on a &#39;generational leap&#39; for Steam Deck 2 - but it&#39;s coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve gave us the strongest wording yet that a Steam Deck 2 is actually real, although it's still clearly going to be some time away before there's enough of an upgrade.</p>
<p>Recently we had the news that the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-officially-comes-to-australia-in-november/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck is finally going to release in Australia</a>, and so now Valve have another market opened up for future hardware launches. So, a few Australian websites managed to get Valve to open up a little to discuss the future and it's sounding good.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reviews.org Australia</a> here's what Steam Deck designer Lawrence Yang said about a Steam Deck 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to us, and we’ve tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence. We’re not going to do a bump every year. There’s no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that’s kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that’s only incrementally better. So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we’re excited about and we’re working on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also mentioned in the interview is how they really love seeing all the devices from other companies, even if they're not a fan of the constant device refreshes. There's plenty of other good stuff mentioned in the full interview so be sure to go give it a read.</p>
<p>It's not exactly the freshest news though if you've been following along, since I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/08/steam-deck-2-is-absolutely-coming-new-booklet-from-valve-confirms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously covered Valve's little handbook for the Asia launch</a>, that did make it seem pretty clearly like more was planned. Still, Valve reiterating it so <em>strongly</em> is a great sign.</p>
<p>Until then we've still got plenty to look forward to like the final release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6</a> (it's in Beta) which will bring another big lot of system improvements. And, whatever this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ARM64 and Android stuff</a> is for (likely a new VR set).</p>

      <title>All three Szymanski brothers are working on a chaotic Harry Potter inspired game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate is the latest game from the Szymanski crew who you might know from the likes of DUSK, My Friendly Neighborhood and other games. It's basically a Harry Potter rip-off that's pretty comically good.</p>
<p>I know calling it a rip-off might seem <em>harsh</em>, but — just look at it. I do mean it in the nicest possible way as well. What you get is an overly silly wizarding sandbox game to run around in and cause some ridiculousness either alone or with friends.</p>
<p>Testing it on Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a>, it does work well. Although you need an extra install step before playing with the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime that pops up.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17583098911728992207gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Running around you can collect wizard biscuits, which are the currency here, that look suspiciously like delicious party rings. This allows you to buy things from the shopkeeper, rather than steal them and have them chase you down with a massive sword.</p>
<p>After a while I lost count of the amount of times I died. You can die in <em>so many stupid ways </em>it's pretty funny. From being bounced around and squashed between things, to stepping on pads and having the walls move and turn you into a pancake there's a lot to find. At one point I used the beginner spell on a random girl standing around, and she came up to me and just insta-slapped the life out of me — ouch.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Secret Agent Wizard Boy is going undercover again to topple the international crime syndicate run by Grumblemort. He must use his wits to infiltrate Grumblemort's wizarding school and crack the evil vault deep within the castle. Or, Wizard Boy could choose to ignore his mission entirely and instead use knowledge of spells and espionage to wreck havoc and destruction.</p>
<p>He can also team up with fellow Wizard Boys in cooperative(?) multiplayer to explore (blow up) the castle together.</p>
<p><strong>FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A multitude of spells to learn and inflict on others.</li>
<li>Physics-based mayhem.</li>
<li>Open-ended goals to accomplish (or ignore) however you see fit.</li>
<li>Online multiplayer.</li>
<li>Retro-themed third person action, straight from the days of Unreal Engine 1.</li>
<li>Landmines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It's janky bootleg Harry Potter that looks like it was made for the PS1 with silly physics. Give it a try.</p>

      <title>Tenebris Somnia looks awesome blending live-action cutscenes and retro horror</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a unique one here. Tenebris Somnia was announced from Andrés Borghi, Saibot Studios and publishing help from New Blood Interactive. They even pulled in Airdorf, creator of FAITH: The Unholy Trinity, to serve as Executive Producer on it.</p>
<p>It's a 2D survival horror adventure game like the classics with a feel like Silent Hill and Resident Evil mechanically. However, what really makes this one stand out is the blend of retro pixel-art main visuals for the gameplay, and then it totally flips with live-action cutscenes. It's…strange, but it <em>works</em> and when it jumps into a live-action scene it really does make quite the impact before it flips back to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Testing the demo on Kubuntu Linux, it worked perfectly with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton version 9.0-3</a> and I definitely think you're going to want to try it for yourself if you like puzzles and horror. See <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my guide</a> if you don't know how to use Proton.</p>

      <title>Be careful with pachinko roguelike Ballionaire as it might suck away your entire week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ballionaire from developer newobject and publisher Raw Fury has a demo up for Steam Next Fest, and you're really going to want to keep an eye on that clock when you hit play. It has already become my latest absolute obsession. </p>
<p>Inspired by pachinko machines but it adds in some roguelike flavour, and the result is something that has just completely captured me and I'm going to be playing it all night. Drop a ball down the vertical machine, where you've placed various triggers to try and build up a lot of money. It quickly turns into absolute chaos, with the ball bouncing around everywhere and it's just a thorough delight to play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410606501728985610gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12410606501728985610gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ballionaire on Linux</em></p>
<p>The idea here is that you go across various boards where you have to pay a tribute in money gained from the pachinko machine. Each tribute you manage to hit, will bring you to a new round where the needed tribute is higher, so it can get quite challenging. So it's up to you to build up the board, and hit various insane combinations that might even break the game to absolutely smash the goal and become a Ballionaire.</p>
<p>In a way it feels like a merger between Peglin and Balatro. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kJ4CLsPA31g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/062f41e5e0435749d7082e2e4fa8029c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kJ4CLsPA31g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Fun fact: it's another <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> game.</em></p>
<p>I fully expect this to be a <em>huge</em> hit at release. It's great to play with wonderfully inviting visuals and just so entertaining to see the ball get smashed around while you see your money ticking upwards. Especially nice when you've got a good combination going, and the ball just manically bounces between them all for a while, as you sit back and take a well-earned sip of your favourite drink and just watch it all happen.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2667120/Ballionaire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and as far as I can tell it works to perfection. No release date just yet, but the publisher made it sound like it was <em>really</em> soon.</p>

      <title>Fractured Alliance gives off some real classic Command &amp; Conquer vibes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you adore your classic base-building real-time strategy games? You may want to keep an eye on the in-development Fractured Alliance. I grew up playing the likes of Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Tiberian Sun and all the rest and so this one feels like it's whispering sweet things directly into my ear.</p>
<p>Looks to be something of a spiritual successor to me both in terms of game mechanics and the style of it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery as they say, and it pleases me to see more game developers attempt to get more into this genre. Seriously, this looks and sounds like what could have been a lost Westwood game if they kept going. I need it.</p>
<p>Check out their new prototype trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zSf_0-ekIBU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9568b7cd5243f9b34a2e2cb9b80a5430.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zSf_0-ekIBU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Lots of different unit types, nice varied map styles, super weapons, weather effects and more — yep I'm sold.</p>
<p>At release they play to offer a full single-player campaign, along with various types of online battles too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2583660/Fractured_Alliance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. They also have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/fracturedalliance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.</p>

      <title>The props fight back against the humans in Puropu Defense Squad </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PlayTogether Studio who made Run Prop, Run! and the Mad Experiments: Escape Room series have put up a demo and release date for Puropu Defense Squad. A mixture of a shooter and tower defense.</p>
<p>A curiously silly setting too. An alternate universe where Props have come alive. Yes, Props, the things you would disguise yourself as in certain hide and seek games. Now they must "protect their existence against Earth's relentless human invaders". You assume the role of an elite warrior of the Puropu Defense Squad and your mission is clear: build defences to stop enemies from reaching your precious Extractor, the lifeblood of your civilisation.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TTAv8w9G5DE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0644c92af68aa4b8d123d77910ebb395.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TTAv8w9G5DE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Getting some serious Orcs Must Die vibes from this, seems like a whole lot of chaotic fun. The good news is that it has a demo up now you can play for Steam Next Fest that was expanded with more content, and it will release with Native Linux support on December 9th.</p>
<p>Features (from their press email):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Action</strong>: Immerse yourself in a seamless blend of third-person shooting and strategic tower defense. Build a vast arsenal of traps, turrets, and barricades, each upgradeable to fend off waves of enemies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unique Characters</strong>: Choose from a diverse roster of quirky heroes, each offering radically different playstyles. Whether it’s the explosive might of Mr. Box, the tactical genius of Grey, the swift strikes of Tomusashi, the transpercing Ryush, or the blinding lights of Denkyu—every character brings something unique to the battlefield. Customize them by unlocking new talents in each hero's talent tree, and by acquiring a variety of items and XP-based upgrades to tailor your playstyle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-op Campaign</strong>: Embark on a challenging campaign solo or with up to 3 friends. Use powerful abilities and clever tactics to defend your Extractor against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. Unlock new items, characters, and content as you complete challenges. Tackle new difficulties in Elite, Heroic, and Infinite modes, where only the most strategic players will survive.</p>
</li>

      <title>That didn&#39;t last long - the Junk Store for Steam Deck has its Steam page removed (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/first-steam-deck-plugin-on-steam-will-bring-gog-and-epic-games-compatibility/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">A few days ago</a> I wrote about the Junk Store coming to Steam, a special plugin for Steam Deck to bring GOG and Epic Games compatibility unofficially - but it seems to be a short lived idea.</p>
<p>It is already available as a free and open source plugin for the Decky Loader plugin system, but this was going to be completely standalone, and a paid product for the convenience of just having it right on Steam.</p>
<p>Even though Valve had clearly reviewed the Steam page, and so would have seen what it actually was to even allow the page to go live, it seems Valve <em>may</em> have backtracked on that. It's not clear though if this was done by Valve, or by the developer, the Steam page is just gone. Looking on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3250950/history/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> the note mentions "This app has been retired and is no longer available on the Steam store."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18469908521728978917gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18469908521728978917gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Junk Store</em></p>
<p>Perhaps not really surprising. While Valve do allow a lot of weird stuff on their store, a launcher that has a primary purpose of launching other games from other stores might have been a bridge too far.</p>
<p>I've reached out to both Valve and the Junk Store developers to find out exactly what happened, and will update if I get any reply from either party.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update - 16/10/2024 - 07:20 UTC</strong>: the Junk Store developers posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1g4hi6x/its_true/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> that it was Valve who took it down. It was taken down not due to the Epic or GOG features, but specifically because it modifies Steam itself.</p>
<p>Here's what Valve support said to them:</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 44: The Legend of Kobo</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-43-demons-and-angels/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 43: Demons and Angels</a></strong></p>
<p>A lot of early UNIX and therefore Linux games struggled with the fact that the X toolkit was geared towards constructing staid graphical user interfaces, rather than for the speed and flexibility needed by games. Both <em>100 Great Linux Games</em> as well as the <em>Linux Games &amp; Entertainment for X Windows</em> compilation included many valiant attempts, which while all being admirable in their own way, failed to sustain much in the way of scrutiny. One X11 game that does is <em>Xkobo</em>.</p>
<p>Inspired by Namco’s 1981 arcade title <em>Bosconian</em>, <em>Xkobo</em> was created by the Japanese coder Akira Higuchi and released for a diversity of different UNIX derived systems starting in 1995. The original source code tarball archive of the final 1.11 version from 1997 has build issues when trying to do so on newer versions of Linux, forcing me to use an older compiled binary from 1998 instead included in the xkobo-1.11-1.i386.rpm package to play the game.</p>
<p>For an X11 based game, <em>Xkobo</em> is remarkable in how smooth and fast it is to play. While having the expected limitation of being restricted to a small game window, the art itself is polished and the scrolling seamless. I am often not enamoured by "shmups" in this style, but the puzzle element here of tactically dismantling the enemy fortresses by targeting the coloured nodes helped to keep me engaged, at least until the game descends too close to being bullet hell.</p>
<p>Even then, <em>Xkobo</em> does mercifully allow you to start over from the stage after the one you last cleared when your lives run out. This means you can tackle the game in bursts, as <em>Xkobo</em> would wear out its welcome if it forced you to solve it all in one sitting. There are 50 stages to the game, although I have only cleared 22 of them so far myself. For those without the patience, you can also play through any stage with infinite lives through the use of the "-cheat" launch flag.</p>
<p>There is also a "-doublesize" flag that increases the size of the game window at the cost of using much more memory, but with 512 MB of RAM installed in my machine, I can go ahead and laugh in the face of danger. Even on my overpowered for the time computer however, the game will still slow down if a lot of explosions are drawn on screen at the same time. This can be further mitigated through the use of "-fast" flag, which again consumes more memory in exchange for a faster algorithm.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15983347151728930889gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15983347151728930889gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15358656701728930890gol6.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15358656701728930890gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>A modified branch of <em>Xkobo</em> by Kenneth Nielsen also exists which fixes the game to build with the new strong type checking found in later compilers; Nielsen would later merge this with a fork by Wolfgang Jährling which adds some new levels and enemies to the game. This formed the basis of the RPM packages distributed by Dag Wieers for use on later Red Hat Linux and Fedora releases, with most players likely completely unaware there had ever been any changes.</p>
<p>A separate fork of <em>Xkobo</em> by Masanao Izumo was also developed which added sound effects to the game, work which would later be built upon by David Olofson to craft <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> starting in 2001. This reworked <em>Xkobo</em> to use SDL as well as further modernizing the game. I was unable to get any version of <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> past 0.4.1 to compile on Red Hat Linux 7.3, which was when the game engine switched to OpenGL being loaded dynamically, but any version before that works.</p>
<p>Work on <em>Kobo Deluxe</em> continued past 2007, and the game can still be found packaged with many modern Linux distributions, but David Olofson himself has moved on to other projects. One of these was his more experimental <em>Kobo II</em> prototype, which eventually lead to the release of <em>Kobo Redux</em> in 2017. This is still available for purchase from itch.io, although further updates have stalled due to life and health challenges on the part of Olofson.</p>
<p>The more I played these expanded versions of the game though, for all of their bells and whistles, I could not help but feel that sometimes less is more. The original <em>Xkobo</em> is a great example of what can be done when you focus on just the core gameplay loop paired with a consistent set of art assets. It may seem simple when put against the variety of game modes and explosion of effects offered by its inheritors, but there is an elegance here that still shines through after all of these years.</p>
<p>There is a reason why SDL and SVGAlib, and to a lesser extent GGI and Allegro, were embraced by Linux game developers. Magic can come out of people working against imposed limitations however, and games like <em>Xkobo</em> succeed by this. This is not to say that a bit of pizzazz is always unwelcome, especially when you have your own multimedia toolkit to promote and the beer of your sponsor to sell. It is time for us to cut to commercial.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest - October 2024 edition is now live with lots of demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here! The big Steam Next Fest event returns to suck up all your free time, as tons of game developers hope you'll try out their demos. An event that can easily be overwhelming in sheer numbers, but a whole lot of fun to get a glimpse of what's to come next.</p>
<p>Valve's official trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="T5WV8qqalew"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc3dadc43df4545d75574aef9b000d0d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/T5WV8qqalew" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As per usual I'll be going over and highlighting games individually over the next week on anything interesting I think that's worth a dedicated shout-out in an article. Something worth noting is that plenty of games that will have an official Native Linux version don't have a Linux demo, and there's a fair few that <em>do</em> have a Linux demo that for some reason don't show it. However, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> is a thing and will no doubt run most of them. <em>There's also a quite a number of games featured that don't have a demo at all - annoyingly, and some will only go live with the event.</em></p>
<p>Going over the press-preview here's a few that could be worth a look, just a bunch to get you started. Rather than pointing out the big obvious stuff you likely already know about, these could be gems to keep an eye on. Most of these are supposed to have Linux support at release too:</p>

      <title>Streets of Rogue 2 delayed again but a demo is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>My most anticipated game of the year keeps running away from me. Streets of Rogue 2 is no longer entering Early Access on October 22nd, but at least a demo is out now.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2165810/view/7199658258492782196" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So first off, why the delays? Well, the TL;DR is “Big Open-Ended Game + Solo Programmer = Unpredictable Timeline.” October 22 seemed like a viable date back in July, but ultimately despite my best efforts, I felt the game needed a bit more time in the oven. My sincere apologies for the delays, I fully understand how annoying it can be to look forward to something only to have the rug pulled. That’s why we won’t be announcing any more specific dates until it’s a 100% lock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12560066721728918028gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12560066721728918028gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's no specific date being given now but it will be in the "near future", so I imagine still this year.</p>
<p>Good news though — you can play the demo right now on Steam for Steam Next Fest. Although the demo only has a Windows version, I've checked and it works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a>. If you don't know how to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton see my guide</a>.</p>
<p>With the demo the developer mentioned it's now close to the EA release with a solid foundation, but it needs a lot more polish to "bring the core game loop and progression system to where they need to be, and bugs are still a little too prevalent" so it's still a bit rough.</p>
<p>The addition of vehicles is great! At one point I was driving along taking a shortcut, where thought I could make it over this little pond. Clearly I wasn't paying enough attention, as I drove into a bunch of chickens who shortly after descended on the vehicle and blew it up. Those are some powerful chickens.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1037845281728917090gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1037845281728917090gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13575548471728917092gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13575548471728917092gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I've also been mauled by a bear, I chased someone into a road because I wanted their gun and a car nicely finished them off for me, gave blood for money, raided many trashcans and at one point caused a riot so big it levelled most of the initial starter city — woops.</p>
<p>Even with my short time in it so far, I've already done and seen some truly hilarious things. I really enjoyed the first game, and just wanted more of it in a bigger setting and it seems Streets of Rogue 2 may very well deliver on that.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2165810/Streets_of_Rogue_2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Daily Dungeon gives you a fresh dungeon-puzzle every day inspired by Wordle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember when Wordle appeared and the world seemingly went mad for it? How about a dungeon-crawling puzzle game inspired by it? Daily Dungeon is for you.</p>
<p>Created by Vijay Pemmaraju, here's what they said in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vijay.io/post/3l672nt25gn2r" rel="noopener" target="_blank">social media post</a> I spotted recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i made a game called <a href="https://dailydungeon.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dailydungeon.net</a> a couple years ago. it's a daily puzzler inspired by wordle that you can play on any device with a browser. check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

<p>The idea of it is simple and it gives you a fresh dungeon to run about in each day with keys to collect to open doors, puzzles to solve to gain artifacts and beat it in the quickest time possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11171399471728913838gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11171399471728913838gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The puzzles in it have a fun mixture from memory games, to rearranging letters to make a correct word and more. You might also find some secrets - maybe. Once you manage to finish a run you're then given a stats screen with the number of steps taken, the time, badges earned and an option to share the details of it like my quick run today:</p>

<p>That's a really slow time due to taking the screenshot and testing stuff. <em>Don't judge me on it.</em></p>
<p>I just thought it was a great idea and thought you might like it too.</p>

This bundle includes the likes of:</p>

      <title>OBS Studio 31.0.0 Beta 1 released bringing multiple new features</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The best tool for video recording and livestreaming is about to get another upgrade with OBS Studio 31.0.0 Beta 1 out now.It's in Beta meaning it's not quite ready for everyone, but a good time to test everything works as expected ahead of the next stable release.</p>
<p>For this release NVIDIA Kepler GPUs are no longer supported for NVENC, NVIDIA users also need to upgrade at least to driver version 550.54.14.</p>
<p>New features include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added NVIDIA Blur Filter and Background Blur.</li>
<li>Added preview scrollbars and zoom/scale indicator.</li>
<li>Added v210 format support for AJA device capture.</li>
<li>Added Amazon IVS service integration.</li>
<li>Added QSV AV1 Screen Content Coding.</li>
<li>Enabled first-party YouTube Chat features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5526299951728297353gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5526299951728297353gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - OBS Studio on Linux</em></p>
<p>Some Linux-specific changes too:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Disabled the (currently unsupported) built-in Automatic Scene Switcher when using Wayland on Linux.</li>
<li>Changed display and window capture on Linux to not capture implicitly.</li>
<li>Improved screensaver inhibit functions on Linux in Flatpak</li>
<li>Fixed two crashes with the QSV encoder on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Support for Ubuntu 22.04 was also removed, so you'll need to upgrade for it.</p>
<p>There's various other bug fixes and improvements like an NVENC upgrade. See the <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/31.0.0-beta1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a> for more.</p>
<p><em>Notice: This article originally went up last week, a bit too early, the Beta was properly released two days later so it has been republished today.</em></p>

      <title>Mini Royale is a battle royale with toy soldiers and fun game modes - demo available now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're after a new shooter that will have Linux support, Mini Royale looks like it could end up being a good choice.</p>
<p>More about it: "Step into the world of Mini Royale, where the battlefield is a kid’s bedroom and the warriors are green army toy soldiers! This action-packed battle royale pits you against other players in epic combat as you fight to be the last soldier—or team—standing in a chaotic, larger-than-life environment."</p>
<p>Ahead of Steam Next Fest today, the developer has upgraded the demo to bring on a new game mode that sounds like a lot of fun. The mode is called "Color Conquest" where 4 teams of different colours battle to eliminate each other. The fun part: if you die, you join the killer's team. So at some point, someone will make their last stand against everyone else, and potentially do well enough to repopulate their own team.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Qd4kGADVIFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ec68f087b53545973d2c2d9d9e09203.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Qd4kGADVIFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On top of that, there's also a more standard battle royale mode for solos, duos and trios, plus support for custom games. Although of course the demo is limited on what you can do.</p>
<p>Some nice game mechanics in it with various different types of weapons you can customize with attachments, there's weapon levels (a bit like Fortnite) you can upgrade, interesting movement systems with a grapple gun and parachutes to zip across the map and more.</p>
<p>Visually it looks great, and the map design is a lot of fun too. So far in the demo I've managed a few games, and it does seem to perform really well with their Native Linux version.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1657090/Mini_Royale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a> with the demo that will hopefully get populated during Steam Next Fest to try properly. I'm looking forward to properly diving in this evening.</p>

      <title>TUXEDO reveal the Stellaris 16 Gen 6, a more compact desktop-replacement laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After showing off the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/the-tuxedo-gemini-17-gen3-is-a-big-powerful-desktop-replacement-class-laptop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TUXEDO Gemini 17 - Gen3</a> back in September, TUXEDO have now revealed a slightly more compact desktop-replacement laptop with the Stellaris 16.</p>
<p>What they said about it: "At first glance, the new TUXEDO Stellaris 16 - Gen6 may not appear exceptionally "compact" with its overall z-height of just over 2.6 cm and weight of 2.5 kg.</p>
<p>However, a second look with having the Linux high-end laptop's specifications in mind makes it clear: this is the fastest hardware on the planet in an enclosure that strikes the golden mean between portable case dimensions and high cooling capacity for either fastest high-end hardware on par with upper-class desktop PCs or quieter fan noise at very high working and gaming performance."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8686940631728902627gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Moving past the marketing speak for a moment, what are you getting? Full Linux support of course, as standard for TUXEDO systems. The base config on offer comes in at €1660 (excluding tax) and that will give you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display: 16'' WQXGA IPS | 16:10 | 240 Hz (2560 x 1600), 100% sRGB, G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Processor: Intel Core i9-14900HX.</li>
<li>GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (up to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090)</li>
<li>RAM: 16GB DDR5-5600.</li>
<li>Storage: 500GB Samsung 980 SSD.</li>
<li>Wireless: Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211 (802.11ax | 2.4, 5 &amp; 6 GHz | Bluetooth 5.3)</li>
<li>Power: 99 Wh battery.</li>
<li>For ports you're getting in total: 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen1, USB-C 3.2 Gen1, 2-in-1 audio jack (headphone &amp; microphone), Card reader (SD/SDHC/SDXC), HDMI 2.1, Gigabit ethernet, DC-in, Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>So while it is indeed pricey, that's a ridiculous amount of power in a still pretty small case overall. You could do some serious gaming on that.</p>
<p>See more on <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-Stellaris-16-Gen6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their website</a>. They said the shipping starts mid-November.</p>
<p>I'm curious to know if there's any TUXEDO computers customers reading GamingOnLinux, be sure to give over your experiences in the comments. </p>

      <title>Slimbook reveal the new powerful AMD powered EVO ultrabook</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slimbook have announced a fresh powerful AMD Ryzen powered ultrabook, the EVO, and it looks like a wonderful device. If you're after a new laptop from a company with top Linux support, this should be on your radar.</p>
<p>Coming in a €999 with the €100 discount for pre-orders, it's due to arrive in December. So what do you get for that price? Quite a lot actually and they expect it to end up as the "best-selling computer in our history".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9684717121728900571gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Main specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS 8 cores 16 threads, up to 5.1GHz.</li>
<li>Graphics: AMD Radeon 780M.</li>
<li>Display: 14” WQXGA 3K (2880x1800) 16:10 sRGB 100% sRGB refresh 125 Hz 400 nits.</li>
<li>Ports: 2x USB-C 3.2 Gen2 + DP 1.4 + PD 100W.</li>
<li>Ports: 1x USB-A 3.2 Gen2 + 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen1.</li>
<li>Keyboard: backlit.</li>
<li>Material: aluminum.</li>
<li>Connectivity: Wifi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2.</li>
<li>RAM memory: up to 96GB at 5600 MHz DDR5 (16GB DDR5 on base model).</li>
<li>Disks: 2x SSD NVMe PCIe 4.0 M.2 up to 8TB (500GB NVMe on base model).</li>
</ul>
<p>This unit is a replacement for their previous flagship model, the ProX, and it comes with many other improvements. Fans of security and privacy will be pleased to know it has a physical webcam lock, there's now a Gigbit ethernet port, a SD / SDHC / SDXC card reader, Nahimic 2412 speakers they say "provide less muffled sound and less distortion during over-amplification compared to their predecessors" and dual high-performance fans that are "designed for gaming laptops but optimized for quiet operation in a slim profile".</p>
<p>You can order it with your choice of Linux including Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu MATE, KDE neon, Debian, Linux Mint, Fedora, Manjaro and more. Windows is also an option but bumps up the price by at least €170.</p>
<p>Overall it really does sound great.</p>

      <title>Minetest breaks the chains of being a Minecraft clone with a new name — Luanti</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minetest, a voxel game engine created to be something like a Minecraft clone, is finally smashing apart the chains to become more its own unique thing.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://blog.minetest.net/2024/10/13/Introducing-Our-New-Name/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> the team explained why it was originally created and how it's grown with a huge community. Minetest itself of course, is just a voxel game engine, a platform for various games. And so with that in mind, it needed its own identity to finally throw off the "Minecraft clone" comments and so the era of Minetest is now over with the introduction of <strong>Luanti</strong>.</p>
<p>The name is a play on the Finnish word luonti (“creation”) and the programming language used for games and mods, Lua. Combined together, that's Luanti. They're still in the process of getting all bits of it renamed, so it may take a while.</p>
<p>Seems quite a fitting name and I like the idea behind it, although it's not particularly memorable, but then again for most people it will be the <em>games</em> made with it that create the memories. If you missed it we also had MineClone2, a game for <s>Minetest</s> <em>Luanti</em>, recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/mineclone2-inspired-by-minecraft-gets-renamed-to-voxelibre/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">change its name to VoxeLibre</a> as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7592450361728899419gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7592450361728899419gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>Open source Theme Hospital engine &#39;CorsixTH&#39; v0.68.0 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Theme Hospital originally from Bullfrog Productions is a true classic, one I spent a ridiculous amount of time playing and the CorsixTH project is doing fantastic work to keep it alive for modern platforms. A new release of this open source reimplementation has been released with version 0.68.0 now available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6948188941728896112gol1.jpg"/><br/>

<p>You need the data files from the original game which you can buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/theme_hospital?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG.com</a>.</p>
<p>For Linux you can grab the CorsixTH engine from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/com.corsixth.corsixth" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p>Getting it working was ridiculously easy too. I installed the classic from GOG using the Heroic Launcher, pointed CorsixTH to the folder and it just worked. Nice. </p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.6.18 Beta released, still not quite the true end of the line</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When will it end? Will SteamOS 3.6 ever become stable? The end of the line has come, and gone, a few times now.</p>
<p>You thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-beta-gets-big-game-recording-improvements-plus-steam-deck-steamos-3616-beta-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.16</a> "End of the Line" was going to be it? Wrong. You also thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/steam-deck-steamos-3617-beta-released-with-another-quick-fix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.17</a> "End of the End of the Line" would be the one — also quite clearly wrong. Now we're onto <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/4511009460896477896" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.18 Beta</a> "The Color at the End of the End of the Line".</p>
<p>Could this actually be the one to push SteamOS 3.6 over the finishing line into a stable release? Only the code magicians at Valve will know the answer to that.</p>
<p>From the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This update is for the Steam Deck Beta and Preview channels, and includes new features that are still being tested. You can opt into this in Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel.</p>
<p>General</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a possible crash when using Steam Deck as the Remote Play host</li>
<li>Fixed colorspace for Game Recording</li>
<li>Improved color range when using Remote Play to Steam Deck</li>
</ul>

      <title>Steam purchases now clearly state you&#39;re just getting a license not ownership</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doing the rounds across the net right now is a small update to the Steam checkout process when you're making a purchase, to make it clear you don't own what you buy.</p>
<p>Valve added a note (I don't entirely know when), to mention how "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam" with a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement. As you can see in my shot below taken today when testing a purchase:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9233828001728818534gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9233828001728818534gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Of course, there's already a lot of misinformation going around about this from people on social media. To remind everyone: this has <em>always</em> been the case. The Steam Subscriber Agreement says (if you bothered to read it, you all read agreements right?) "The Content and Services are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services".</p>
<p>So while this has always been the case, it is still somewhat buried because most people just quickly scroll through these things to get access to what they want. At least now, Valve has put it upfront every time you make a license purchase on Steam.</p>
<p>Why is all this happening now? You can likely thank a new California law on this (<a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AB 2426</a>) that is summarised as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Existing law makes it unlawful for any person doing business in California and advertising to consumers in California to make any false or misleading advertising claim. Existing law makes a person who violates specified false advertising provisions liable for a civil penalty, as specified, and provides that a person who violates those false advertising provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>
<p>This bill would, subject to specified exceptions, additionally prohibit a seller of a digital good from advertising or offering for sale a digital good, as defined, to a purchaser with the terms buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good, or alongside an option for a time-limited rental, unless the seller receives at the time of each transaction an affirmative acknowledgment from the purchaser, or the seller provides to the consumer before executing each transaction a clear and conspicuous statement, as specified. By expanding the scope of a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GOG took the opportunity to jump into this as well on Twitter / X with a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> suggesting they will be adding a note onto their checkout process too, to say that their offline installers they offer cannot be taken away from you:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8988360621728818791gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8988360621728818791gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The new law <em>doesn't</em> seem to actually affect GOG, since in the main bill text it does specifically note it does not apply if they have access to a permanent offline download. However, it should be noted GOG also sell you a <em>license</em> as per their own terms. So while the new bill may not apply to them, this little jibe only really properly works <em>if</em> people are backing up all of their GOG purchases. Since you only get a license, rights holders <em>could</em> still technically get GOG to entirely remove them.</p>
<p>I should also note that this situation is the same for most physical media too, it's not a digital distribution only issue for consumers. Much like GOG's offline installers, you have access to your physical media whenever you want, but you still only get a license for the media you have on disc - you do <em>not</em> own it.</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers gets booted from Steam Deck plugin store Decky Loader</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a bit of unfortunate drama going on right now in Steam Deck land, with the Steam Deck plugin NonSteamLaunchers for Decky Loader getting the boot. Both projects I've covered a fair bit (see plenty in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Deck tag</a>), and they're quite popular, so this is a bit of a PSA on what's happened.</p>
<p>If you've not heard of or not used the <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NonSteamLaunchers</a> project: it's a way to pretty darn easily install the likes of Amazon Games, GOG Galaxy, Epic Games and various other launchers with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>. It can be used standalone on desktop, or as a <a href="https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Decky Loader</a> plugin.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Roy, the developer of NonSteamLaunchers reached out directly to notify me that NonSteamLaunchers was delisted from the Decky Loader plugin store. Something that will end up causing issues for users of it.</p>
<p>Trying to find out what happened is a bit difficult, since the situation really isn't very clear. Speaking to the Steam Deck Homebrew team behind Decky Loader, they provided me this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck Homebrew has decided to remove the NonSteamLaunchers plugin from the Decky Plugin Store after being shown statements on Steam Deck-related subreddits from its creator in a report. These appear to show continued harassment of members of these communities. We have also discovered harassment from the creator in our own server. We decided to delist the plugin from our store alongside banning its creator to prevent potential abuse of our community and plugin store.</p>
<p>Decky plugins can be downloaded outside the Decky Plugin Store, but we have decided to separate ourselves from NonSteamLaunchers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to Roy as well, they offered this statement of their own to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't believe I said anything racist or wrong to anyone regarding race or color or bigotry of any type or orientation of any kind. I will continue holding this stance and will not move from it. I still don't really know what I did wrong for my plug-in to be taken away so fast but I just want to apologize to the steam deck community for causing any sort of drama and for failing them as a developer. Unfortunately I don't know what has transpired but I am obviously not wanted in their environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully a resolution will be found for the benefit of the Steam Deck community for these popular tools. For now, NonSteamLaunchers fans will need to grab the tool directly.</p>

      <title>Comedy 2.5D puzzle-platformer Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator gets a demo and new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A single-player comedy adventure 2.5D platformer developer by a former Disney ride designer, Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator looks and sounds great.</p>
<p>Coming from Adventure Works, a small production studio lead by Jeffrey Ashbrook, a former Disney parks designer and a producer on the Millennium Falcon ride at Disney’s Hollywood Studios. What we've seen of it looks incredibly promising and I'm personally looking forward to seeing more from this one. The game will have Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>They just released a brand new demo ahead of Steam Next Fest, and to go along with it there's new trailer too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mh6Fo0WNths"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/baa002950d9e6e34d20011a75560d24f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mh6Fo0WNths" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On the origins of the game, Jeffrey Ashbrook, founder at Adventure Works, said "I always wanted to create a game inspired by those cinematic story-driven adventures I loved growing up. I was such a big fan of ‘80s adventure films like Indiana Jones and The Goonies, and large-scale games like the Uncharted and Metal Gear Solid series, those seamless blends of cinematics and gameplay to create a memorable experience for players. Even with only a handful of devs from around the world , we wanted Ari to be that same kind of experience you used to get from much larger teams: full 3D cutscenes, ensemble casts of characters, and a story that you could really sink into if you wanted, so we’ve set our sights high and really hope people enjoy what we’ve been creating."</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thrilling cinematic adventure:</strong> Embark on a rip-roaring, feel-good journey inspired by classic blockbuster adventure films.</li>
<li><strong>Eccentric ensemble cast:</strong> Interact with an eccentric and loveable cast including 11 fully voice-acted characters.</li>
<li><strong>Nostalgic puzzle platforming</strong><strong>: </strong>Journey through 13 levels and 6 distinct environments - from freezing tundras to scorching deserts.</li>
<li><strong>Stunning in-game cutscenes:</strong> Feast your eyes on stunning in-game cinematics from the mind of a former Disney producer.</li>
<li><strong>Unique tools and abilities:</strong> Unlock a repertoire of quirky tools to solve mysteries, utilize environmental elements, and tackle treacherous terrain.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184020/Ari_Buktu_and_the_Anytime_Elevator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out on Steam now</a>. There's no set date for the release yet but the demo is live now.</p>

      <title>ZEPHON from the devs of Warhammer 40,000: Gladius releases November 8</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Proxy Studios, developer of the popular Warhammer 40,000: Gladius, have announced their next 4x strategy game ZEPHON will release on November 8th. ZEPHON will have Native Linux support. <em>Disclosure: the developer sent me a pre-release key.</em></p>
<p>If you think it looks like Gladius, you would be right, since both are evolutions over Proxy Studios first game Pandora: First Contact from 2013. Here you control the survivors of humanity in a near-future apocalypse of alien origin. Pick a path between the indifferent abominations of the Voice and the uncaring automata of ZEPHON, with city management, turn-based tactical combat, unholy research, diplomatic maneuvering, and branching narrative quests. Gather your allies and pick your actions wisely.</p>
<p>Check out their previous gameplay trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DPD4MiGc2g0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc1ac8fea864939ac2780eeb0ece3d63.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DPD4MiGc2g0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking over email the developer said to me: "Our previous game, Gladius, has been played by over 1.5 million players. Zephon now has in excess of 500 k views on YouTube (including 100 k on the IGN gameplay trailer) and more than 100 k wishlists on Steam a month before release.</p>
<p>In Zephon we did some fun stuff to tackle the "endgame problem" in 4X games, leaned heavily into Souls-like world-building and added narrative design elements to reward players who play multiple sessions (inspired by Hades and co.)."</p>
<p>You can wishlist and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Aspyr announce Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles coming to PC in 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles is another remaster coming from Aspyr Media, bringing over the originally console-exclusive game to PC. <em>The force appears to be strong with Aspyr.</em></p>
<p>Originally released back in the year 2000 for PlayStation, it was then released for Dreamcast and later the Game Boy Advance. Hopefully this latest Star Wars game from Aspyr will have a good release, after the mess that was the STAR WARS: Battlefront Classic Collection but since then they seem to be doing really well with their other releases getting great reviews. I'm just happy to see more classics come to PC, so we can then play on Linux and Steam Deck thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a>.</p>
<p>It releases January 23rd, 2025. Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Internet Archive hit with DDoS attacks and hacked with 31 million accounts hit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A sad day for the internet, as it has been confirmed that the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) that hosts a massive amount of historical data has been hit by DDoS attacks, and unfortunately they've had a breach.</p>
<p>Recently instead of seeing the website as usual, users were greeted with message like this (<a href="https://x.com/jwdomb/status/1844123760720548040" rel="noopener" target="_blank">credit</a>):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5468299481728640690gol1.png"/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>HIBP is in reference to the popular <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HaveIBeenPwned</a> website, that lists various data breaches and now <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/PwnedWebsites#InternetArchive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">includes</a> this latest breach in their database. Troy Hunt, founder of HIBP, <a href="https://x.com/troyhunt/status/1844136762727448644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a thread on Twitter / X that it is legitimate and they had been communicating with the Internet Archive about it,</p>
<p>The breach was also <a href="https://x.com/brewster_kahle/status/1844183111514603812" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> by Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, who said this on Twitter / X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we know: DDOS attack–fended off for now; defacement of our website via JS library; breach of usernames/email/salted-encrypted passwords.</p>
<p>What we’ve done: Disabled the JS library, scrubbing systems, upgrading security.</p>
<p>Will share more as we know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It did briefly come back up, but was hit by another DDoS. As a result, the Internet Archive has been taken offline while their admins deal with the situation.</p>
<p>An account on Twitter / X called "Sn_darkmeta" claimed responsibility for it.</p>
<p><em>Just another reminder that you should never share passwords between websites.</em></p>

<p>The day is here. Canonical have announced the release of Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular Oriole), along with various flavours like Kubuntu 24.10 now being available. <em>This is not an LTS (long term support) release, but an interim release towards the next LTS.</em></p>
<p>Some of the big changes include the latest 6.11 kernel, along with Canonical's shift to "a more aggressive kernel version selection policy going forward", automatic kernel crash dumps, GNOME 47 with its various new additions to the desktop and also Wayland by default for NVIDIA.</p>

<em>Pictured - Ubuntu 24.10 (Oracular Oriole)</em></p>
<p>You'll also find various Raspberry Pi support improvements, various improvements to the Snap packages like the new security center, additional stability and performance patches added to GNOME, Firefox 130, LibreOffice 24.8, Thunderbird 128, Pipewire 1.2.4 and the list of updates goes on and on.</p>

      <title>Gaming on Linux with Apple Silicon now becoming a very real thing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Alyssa Rosenzweig has given an update in a blog post and a presentation at XDC 2024 going over work to improve Linux gaming on the Apple M1/M2 with Asahi Linux.</p>
<p>They announced their "Asahi game playing toolkit" which brings together their Vulkan 1.3 graphics driver, and x86 emulation with Windows game compatibility (using <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> amongst other things). It's all still "Alpha" level quality, but good enough to run some AAA games now. Unlike Apple's own macOS, Asahi Linux has the <em>only</em> conformant OpenGL®, OpenCL™, and Vulkan® drivers for this hardware (as Apple focus on their own API - Metal).</p>
<p>All you have to do is install the Fedora Asahi Remix on your Apple system, get the latest driver updates and then install Steam although they said "most games require 16GB of memory due to emulation overhead".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16335559671728637336gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16335559671728637336gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Fallout 4 on Apple Hardware with Fedora Asahi Remix</em></p>
<p>Incredible work to make more hardware not only able to run Linux nicely, but become actual proper gaming machines too. Sounds like it's been a thoroughly complicated process, with many contributors but the end result looks great for users.</p>
<p>More work is to be done yet on the Honeykrisp driver, like "Sparse texturing" up next which they said will "unlock more DX12 games" but it's already good enough for titles like Fallout 4, Hollow Knight and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>More in their <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and you can see their talk during XDC 2024 - Day 2 in the below video with the talk starting at about 20:46 (they do eventually start speaking English):</p>

      <title>First Steam Deck plugin on Steam will bring GOG and Epic Games compatibility</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em><strong>Update: It looks like Valve have changed their position on this. See this <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/10/that-didnt-last-long-the-junk-store-for-steam-deck-has-its-steam-page-removed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated article</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Original Article:</p>
<p>In a really surprising move the developers behind Decky Loader plugin <em>Junk Store</em>, which provides the ability to install games from GOG and Epic Games, are bringing the plugin to Steam officially.</p>
<p>This is a special new release just for the Steam Deck, and <em>seems</em> to indicate that Valve are open to having Steam Deck plugins available directly like this. Especially nice for all the people claiming free games (or buying) from the Epic Games Store and GOG.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20667548891728635222gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20667548891728635222gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It will <em>not</em> be free and open source like the Decky Loader plugin though, as confirmed in a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JunkStore/comments/1g0qygm/junk_store_is_officially_coming_to_the_steam_store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, due to the work involved in re-writing it for a Steam release. A price has not been decided on it yet as they gauge interest. However, the existing plugin will remain. The developers said they plan to keep expanding it and hopefully add support for more stores too.</p>
<p>That is, <strong>if</strong> Valve <em>do</em> actually give it the true nod of approval once the Junk Store developers are ready to put it live. Valve has at least approved the Steam store page, so it it has at least passed the initial stage but it could still end up catching more attention and end up not being approved - this will be quite a test for Valve too. Just how open is Steam really on what it will allow?</p>
<p>Main features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engineered specifically for Game Mode. Once installed you can download and launch games without needing to go into Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>Junk Store utilises the Steam-native interface for managing games, allowing Steam to handle most of the process.</li>
<li>Junk Store leverages Steam's built-in functionality to manage Proton prefixes.</li>
<li>You can use the QAM to adjust per game Proton settings such as FPS limiting, etc.</li>
<li>It is extensible! You can write whatever you want for Junk Store integrations if you have the skill. You don't need to wait on anyone else to add features or store front integrations.</li>
<li>Currently we have integrated support for Epic and Gog Games that ships with Junk Store.</li>
<li>Epic achievements and EOS overlay are functional for games that support this feature (however, there is no playtime tracking).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Compatibility with other stores is a common complaint with the Steam Deck. You are able to go into Desktop Mode and install whatever you want, but the convenience of having something directly on Steam will be nice.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3250950/Junk_Store/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck officially comes to Australia in November</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Our friends down under will finally be able to buy an officially supported Steam Deck, as it heads to Australia officially in November. It's been a long road to get there, but it's finally happening which opens up Australia to other Valve hardware now too.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck LCD was originally <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released back in February 2022</a> and was later expanded with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/11/steam-deck-hits-japan-hong-kong-south-korea-and-taiwan-on-december-17th/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Komodo partnership</a> to also be sold in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. Much <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/valve-reveals-steam-deck-oled-for-november-16th/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">later in November 2023</a>, Valve then revealed the much better Steam Deck OLED.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press email the prices will be (inclusive of GST):</p>
<ul>
<li>256GB LCD: $649.00 AUD</li>
<li>512GB OLED: $899.00 AUD</li>
<li>1TB OLED: $1049.00 AUD</li>
</ul>
<p>Not bad pricing, and with the OLED truly being a much better device you really should grab that model if you can afford it. It's truly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the definitive Steam Deck</a>.</p>
<p>It's only going to get better too with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamos-36-preview-for-steam-deck-brings-numerous-big-new-features/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming release of SteamOS 3.6</a>.</p>
<p>Once Valve are eventually ready to talk more about a potential Steam Deck 2, this should also hopefully mean Australia won't be left out in the cold on release day. Although, it's also another signal that the current Steam Deck model is here to stay for some time yet.</p>

      <title>Think you&#39;ve seen it all? There&#39;s now a Steam game about squeezing eggs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've cooked a lot of them in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/arctic-eggs-is-thoroughly-weird-physics-based-dystopian-cooking-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arctic Eggs</a> (which is really good) but have you ever just stopped for a moment to squeeze some eggs? No? Maybe you should. Released on Steam on October 1st it's now <img alt="steam deck verified" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/steamdeck/deck_verified.png"/> Steam Deck Verified and works with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-3</a> perfectly on Kubuntu Linux desktop.</p>
<p>So what is it? Egg Squeeze is a "biological intuition test where you squeeze eggs for as long as you can without breaking them". No, I have no idea what's going on here either. I had to test it of course, for science, and to see if I could beat the test. Or maybe the test will beat me, or whisk me, or fry me — or whatever else you do with eggs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18430649521728473464gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18430649521728473464gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>While you're squeezing that egg tightly, trying not to smash it inside your palm, some funky music starts playing. The longer you manage to hold down the button to squeeze before it cracks, the better your score. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell when it's about to break and it's scrambled my brain. I'm not entirely sure what exactly it is that I'm doing. It's all about testing your synergy with the eggs apparently, but how does that work? I need an answer.</p>
<p>Get multiple in a row that you managed to keep intact, and you'll build up streak, crack it open and you'll lose points. The more I played, the more confused I became, and thoroughly frustrated at the amount of eggs I had smashed open. I've touched and smooshed more eggs in this game that I have in my entire real life.</p>
<p>When you manage to hit the needed score, it's time to start a new day and…things get weird — really weird. Seems the days get progressively more difficult too, with the second day adding in an insanity bar and if you crack too many eggs it's game over, and the score you need to hit is much higher too.</p>
<p>Trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Lx7M7H_2iWA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e9b31be0b1adc8c8a06d524b7ba2da44.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Lx7M7H_2iWA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Surprisingly tense for such a simple game too. When you're one crushed egg away from losing and you're counting in your head to a specific number and then (much like the egg) your dreams about passing the test get demolished as you let out a loud expletive <em>F—</em> with a sigh.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have been chosen as a volunteer for the "Egg Squeeze" exam - a test that evaluates one's <em>psychokinetic intuition of biological makeup</em>. In each test, you will be asked to squeeze an egg for a short period of time. The objective is to estimate the egg's unique breaking point and release your grasp <strong>Before it cracks</strong>. You will be graded relative to your synergy with the eggs.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>May the eggs be ever in your favor.</strong></p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Short core game (1-3 hours)</li>
<li>"Infinite Squeeze" mode, for unlimited replayability</li>
<li>50+ track score, composed by indie game veterans</li>
<li>Plenty of secrets waiting to be found...</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229170/Egg_Squeeze/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Explore a top-secret uranium mine in retro-FPS Kvark</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kvark is a new release from developer Latest Past and publisher Perun Creative, set in a fictional version of the 80s Czech Republic where you explore a top-secret uranium mine. <em>Note: my key was provided by PR Outreach.</em></p>
<p>The 1.0 release is out now, which comes with a Native Linux version after a year in Early Access. What is it? A retro-inspired FPS that pays homage to such games as Half-Life and BioShock. You can definitely tell, as it wears the inspiration on its sleeve. If you love retro inspired shooters, you're in for a bit of a treat on this one.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nBmUjnIvO4I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9627d46639b4f5bff8839207fd19ecb2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nBmUjnIvO4I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fast-paced fights with a plethora of weapons, from wrenches to grenades, bazookas, and the iconic EK-48.</li>
<li>Uniquely designed, diverse, and challenging enemies that require swift tactics and weapon swapping, quick thinking, and constant movement.</li>
<li>An intriguing story told through hidden notepads that the player must find to reveal.</li>
<li>Search for suspicious substances that may help you with your efforts.</li>
<li>Simple to intricate puzzles that the player will have to solve to progress.</li>
<li>Detailed, interactive levels that reward players willing to explore with hidden Easter eggs, secrets, and achievements.</li>
<li>Stylized retro graphics that bring old-school gaming nostalgia.</li>
<li>A strong “just-one-more-level” vibe and loads of explosive fun!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the Native Linux version that was tested, two prominent bugs were found in the 1.0 release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Videos don't play and instead you get a white screen (the developer is aware).</li>
<li>In my case when pressing ESC to go to the menu, I was unable to exit the menu again unless I loaded the last save. That's quite game-breaking as you'll lose progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on those issues, I would recommend just playing it with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve's Proton</a> where those issues don't exist after testing with Proton 9.0-3. However, with Proton the Unreal Engine it uses brings up an additional step to install some bits it needs so you'll have to wait a minute or two for it to appear.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2319390/Kvark/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) is a sweet game about writing letters to real people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Expanding greatly from the original, Kind Words 2 (lofi city pop) from Popcannibal is out now with Linux support. <em>Note: the developer sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, all you need are a few kind words to set your day off right or to cheer you up from a bad week. That's pretty much what Kind Words 2 is all about. You write and receive completely anonymous letters, all real people that are also playing it. The sequel is a far bit more than that though with you able to go out and explore a little, giving you more opportunities for letter writing. It includes everything from the original game (the letters are backwards compatible), remastered and available inside this one too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-Qzjz4wVfR0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc8bbb9067d2fa00b14585a919f25148.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-Qzjz4wVfR0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In this one there's also shops you can visit to change your look, write and share poems or listen to others, visit the forest to write chain-letters and more. It's just thoroughly sweet.</p>
<p>Calling it a game is perhaps doing it dirty, it's not a game in the sense that you <em>play</em> it, it acts more like an anonymous social network with a specific laser-focus of just being nice to everyone and getting some advice, or getting some handy tips and suggestions.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2118120/Kind_Words_2_lofi_city_pop/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>FEX-Emu version 2410 out bringing some important fixes for gaming on AArch64</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://fex-emu.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX-Emu</a> is an emulation layer that allows you to run x86 and x86-64 binaries (like games and apps) on an AArch64 Linux host, similar to qemu-user and box86/box64. Instead of using full disk images, FEX-Emu uses rootfs overlay + forwarding GL processing to the host to achieve better performance in emulated software.</p>
<p>Version 2410 was <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEX-2410/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released this week</a> and the changelog is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ARM64EC changes:</strong> Fixed AVX bugs around state saving and restoring when running under Wine, and changes to dynamically determine Windows syscall numbers under WINE instead of hardcoding them. The call checker was also revamped fixing issues when applications hook function early using Wind32 APIs.</li>
<li><strong>JIT Optimizations</strong>: More optimized JIT code which result in 9% less CPU being spent in JIT'ing code. This is important because, the less time cpu is spent in JIT the less "choppy" the software being emulated will be.</li>
<li><strong>JIT fixes: </strong>Fixed bugs on the x87 instruction set that was offering a bugged <code class="inline-code">FPREM</code> instruction (although <code class="inline-code">FPREM1</code> was working and its also part of <code class="inline-code">x87</code>). One of the weird issues this caused was that Steam login was super weird and you had to repeat login multiple times to work. This also fixed bugs on <em>Touhou Luna Nights</em> and <em>Halls of Torment</em> games. <code class="inline-code">SSE MAXSS</code> instruction was also fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The detailed changelog of changes can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX/compare/FEX-2409...FEX-2410" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEX-Emu Github</a>.</p>
<p>If you missed it there's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/valve-appear-to-be-testing-arm64-and-android-support-for-steam-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been some leaks</a> that Valve may be preparing to use tools like FEX to get gaming working on ARM. So it's a project worth following to see the progress.</p>

      <title>Descent 3: Piccu Engine is a new open source build focused on quality-of-life improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thanks to Descent 3 being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/descent-3-has-been-made-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">officially open source</a>, developers can do almost anything with it now and this has given rise to the <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/PiccuEngine" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Descent 3: Piccu Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Forked from the open source Descent 3 game engine the Descent 3: Piccu Engine, it includes "almost every change from <a href="https://github.com/InsanityBringer/InjectD3" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InjectD3</a>, among many more". You might think, well why not submit to the original open source project? But this is the benefit of open source isn't it! People can do whatever changes they want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1397537761728463053gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Descent 3 from Steam</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">This includes enhancements like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Centered window mode.</li>
<li>Scaling in window and fullscreen mode.</li>
<li>Fullscreen which does not change desktop settings (multi adapter support forthcoming).</li>
<li>New mouse code.</li>
<li>Adjustable FOV, with automatic expansion for widescreen.</li>
<li>Missing features in OpenGL restored, including specular highlights and the ability to control mipmapping.</li>
<li>Cockpit actually works in widescreen, unlike InjectD3.</li>
<li>Faster iteration when many missions are present.</li>
<li>Smoother UI (FPS limit raised to 60).</li>
<li>OpenAL sound system with no crackling and environment reverb support.</li>
<li>Many bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently though according to the GitHub page this version of the code is only set up for Windows, but the developer hopes "to change this shortly".</p>
<p>You do need a copy of the game to run it which you can get from <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/descent_3_expansion?as=1636858786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/273590/Descent_3/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>SDL 3.1.3 Stable ABI Preview released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One missed in the inbox of no return from last week. The next-generation SDL 3 is closing in on a proper stable release now with the SDL 3.1.3 Stable ABI Preview now available for game developers.</p>
<p>Despite the version number, it's still pre-release and not officially released just yet. What is SDL used for? It's a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware on many different platforms like Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>In the release <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> developer Sam Lantinga (Valve) said: "We have lots of bugs to fix before the 3.2.0 stable release, but SDL 3.0 has been battle tested by millions of people in DOTA, CS2 and Steam, and is ready for your eyes!". Additionally developer Ryan Gordon <a href="https://x.com/icculus/status/1842311794817442015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a> on Twitter / X: "I can't believe I finally get to say this. SDL3 is officially ABI locked! We will _add_ new things but not _change_ or _remove_ what's there, starting right now. Which means it's safe to start migrating your games to it, starting today!"</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/APIByCategory" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Extremely good documentation</a>: We've spent a ton of effort writing and revising the API reference.</li>

<li>More consistent API naming conventions. Everything is named consistently across the API now, instead of different subsystems taking different approaches. Also, we've tended toward more descriptive names for things in SDL3.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GPU API</a>: access to modern 3D rendering and GPU compute in a cross-platform way.</li>

<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README/main-functions#main-callbacks-in-sdl3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Main Callbacks</a>: optionally run your program from callbacks instead of main().</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryPen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pen API</a>: access to pens (like Wacom tablets and Apple Pencil, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_OpenAudioDevice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Logical audio devices</a>: different parts of an app can get their own unique audio device to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_CreateAudioStream" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Audio streams</a>: handle buffering, converting, resampling, mixing, channel mapping, pitch, and gain. Bind to an audio device and go!</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Default audio devices</a>: SDL3 will automatically manage migrating to new physical hardware as devices are plugged in, ripped out, or changed.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryProperties" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Properties API</a>: fast, flexible dictionaries of name/value pairs.</li>

<li>The Clipboard API <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetClipboardData" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can support any data type</a> (SDL2 only handled text), and apps can provide data in multiple formats upon request in <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_ClipboardDataCallback" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a provided callback</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/BestKeyboardPractices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Better keyboard input</a>, for all your keypress needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_StartTextInputWithProperties" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Customizable virtual keyboards</a> on iOS and Android.</li>
<li>High DPI support is dramatically improved over SDL2.</li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/SDL_SetAppMetadata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">App metadata API</a> for letting SDL report things about your app correctly (like in the About dialog on macOS, etc).</li>

      <title>Block Factory is basically a LEGO factory automation game with diorama building</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You've seen and likely played Factorio, Satisfactory and no doubt seen the chilled-out shapez 2 but there's a newcomer ready to suck your time away in Block Factory. This one is basically a LEGO block factory and automation sim, they just obviously can't use the LEGO name.</p>
<p><em>I've been played the demo on Kubuntu Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/09/proton-90-3-released-and-proton-experimental-upgraded-for-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9</a> and it works beautifully.</em></p>
<p>Coming from OverPowered Team and publisher Shiro Unlimited there's a few things that will set this one apart from the likes of shapez 2, which is what it's most similar to for the much more relaxed atmosphere — just you and the factory and your many conveyor belts.</p>
<p>Here, not only are you extracting blocks but you also need to put them together <em>manually</em> in a little mini-building game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9601891601728402615gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9601891601728402615gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>To make it clearer: you will set down piece dispensers to pull up blocks from resource nodes, and send them across the map on conveyors into various stacking machines. It's inside here, that you manually drag blocks around to arrange them. It can get complicated, since you will end up needing to do this across multiple stackers to end up with the exact shape needed at the end. So you'll stack certain blocks together, to then stack multiple of those together later into another shape.</p>
<p>Quite a brilliantly clever use of game mechanics here.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4947753901728402617gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4947753901728402617gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then you have more like gluing blocks together on their sides, you may also need to cut certain blocks into different shapes to then combine or stick together later on. There's a <em>lot</em> of possibilities here, and based on the demo they're really doing some great stuff with the ideas.</p>
<p>Eventually on each map you build up a diorama too, so it gives you a fun little something to progress towards.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="A6yGmc7HOsU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2e26522d317ff624d4c543203b1d418f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/A6yGmc7HOsU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I think this one, if done right with enough content in the full game, it will end up being a big hit. Really enjoyed trying out the demo.</p>
<p>Worth a go check it out now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2827680/Block_Factory/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Steam page</a>.</p>
