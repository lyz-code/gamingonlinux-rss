      <title>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road is easily going to be my next complete obsession</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road has just planted itself right at the top of my wishlist for the excellent combination of survivor-likes with tower defense. Seriously, this is one you do not want to miss, and there's a demo available to play on Steam right now.</p>
<p>A glorious mixture of survivor-like bullet heaven gameplay popularised by Vampire Survivors, with you protecting a constantly moving town hall so it has a tower defense game mixed into it. As you progress through your run and level up, you get to place down more towers to expand this always moving structure.</p>
<p>You're not just running around taking out monsters helping your tower though, you're also gathering resources as quickly as you can and removing roadblocks in the way of your little town. There's a lot of moving parts to this one to ensure your focus is firmly suckered in by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13001846741756817901gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13001846741756817901gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11528548631756817899gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11528548631756817899gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really challenging with enemies coming from all directions, especially with various types of loot you can go and grab, so you're constantly weighing up which direction to run to take down a few enemies and gather loot and resources, while then making a mad dash back to protect your town.</p>
<p>It's properly unique and clever and it's wrapped up in a neat dark style that really does look fantastic. The rocking tunes are pretty sweet too, although a bit repetitive and that's about the only downside of note to this one.</p>
<p>Do have a look at the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-ybLlFCrduk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee55766be09f2f04a8837515e0d16f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-ybLlFCrduk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Easily one of the best demos I've played this year and I think you're going to love this mixture. The game works to perfection on Linux with Proton 9.0-4.</p>

      <title>Duskers developers reveal Below the Crown a love letter to chess, roguelikes, and dungeon crawlers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Below the Crown has now been officially revealed from Misfits Attic, developers of the award-winning Duskers. It's a thoroughly unique blend of games inspired by chess, roguelikes, and dungeon crawlers.</p>
<p>“We like to think of Below the Crown as either a gateway drug into chess or a fun alternative that scratches the same strategic itch without the heaviness,” said Tim Keenan, Founder, Misfits Attic. “It offers a massively single-player experience with tons of community interaction and a satisfying gameplay loop, all wrapped in a cool ‘80s retro tech aesthetic with Duskers vibes."</p>
<p>In Below the Crown you progress through dungeons, capturing enemy parties with superior strategy and a spell card or two. Answer strange, glitchy psychological questions between battles to uncover what’s really going on here. Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q8gf18lJ_lc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9674cf6b8cfe0288ed8bd92890c8d491.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q8gf18lJ_lc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Chess meets Awesome</strong> - No memorizing openings, long drawn-out endgames, or stalemates. Start with 1 piece instead of 16. Cast new pieces with exciting abilities onto the board. No analysis paralysis – enemy movement stays basic until you encounter the dungeon’s bosses… Collect Undo Tokens if you need ’em, or more gold if you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>You are not Alone</strong> - Post your epic victories as challenges to the community! Watch replays from top players to further improve your skills as you take on Daily Challenges. Dive into the custom board editor to create &amp; download new rooms to spice up your dungeons in this massively single-player experience.</p>
<p><strong>This is a Test</strong> - Answer simple questions based on your psychological state and relationships to your pieces as you progress through the depths of the Dungeon. Please answer openly and honestly. Your answers will not be used against you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it looks awesome, combining lots of mechanics I love in my strategy games. It will arrive in Early Access sometime in Q4 2025 and a demo is arriving in Steam Next Fest in October. It will need Proton to run on Linux.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the top 50 most played games on Steam Deck for August 2025 - with Hollow Knight the champion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the latest data from Valve on what the most played games on Steam Deck were for August 2025, and perhaps unsurprisingly Hollow Knight is top.</p>
<p>With the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-releases-september-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong releasing September 4th</a>, getting <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/hollow-knight-silksong-price-and-release-time-confirmed/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">low price announcement</a> - it's expected the original was going to shoot up the list rather quickly. Players likely refamiliarising themselves with it, along with renewed interest from new players jumping in to see what all the Silksong fuss is about. Looking over Steam charts, Hollow Knight (the original) is currently the 26th top seller globally.</p>

<p>I've been pulled back into Overwatch 2 lately, which does run <em>surprisingly</em> well on Steam Deck due to family being quite into it so that's been taking some hours away from me.

      <title>Blackjack Roulette puts a literal spin on a classic card game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving Blackjack and Roulette a little Balatro treatment? Perhaps just a little, with it putting a literal spin on the classics here. A blend of two casino classics with a rogue-like (rogue-lite?) flavour, which might just be enough to get me to put many hours into this one. <em>Could be a real sleeper hit to watch this one.</em></p>
<p>More info from the developer: "Get as close to 21 without going over and see how you compare against a roulette wheel of hands to beat. If you keep winning, the wheel keeps spinning! After each round, the wheel gets bigger, and so does the Buy-In cost. If you can’t afford the Buy-In at the start of a round, it’s Game Over.</p>
<p>Luckily, this casino will gladly sell you insurance. Insurance Policies offer various upgrades and abilities to help, but they’ll cost you. One policy lets you win on ties (for a small fee, of course). Another lets you overcharge your hand over 21 without busting, but will auto-play your next 5 hands automatically. Press your luck and take out the Pit Bosses in Blackjack Roulette."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tBCsXOeXHcU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bf96e3fb9f6c396c3a11092d9d4c7cac.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tBCsXOeXHcU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Blackjack with a roulette “spin” and unique Insurance Policies that make each run different.</li>
<li>Every hand you defeat gets added to your pocket and are used the next time you lose your hand. And the end of a round, your cash out is based on your Buy-In and your Pocket Size.</li>
<li>60+ unique "Insurance Policies", each with different abilities, all based on real world insurance policies (yes, even Ketchup Insurance).</li>
<li>Unlock Challenge Modes that offer new, and usually harder, ways to play.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Sword Hero is an impressive looking upcoming open-world fantasy RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it has a rather boring name, Sword Hero looks anything but boring in the new trailer and the combat demo you can try out right now. I think the developer is really cooking with this one, everything about it looks and feels really interesting. That is, if you don't mind the retro style to it. </p>
<p>More about it: Sword Hero is an open-world fantasy RPG inspired by classics like Gothic and Kenshi, designed for players who love freedom, danger, and immersion. Instead of guiding you along a safe, linear path, Sword Hero throws you into a world that doesn’t bend to your will—you must adapt, survive, and carve your own story. Be a mercenary, a faction loyalist, an outlaw, or simply prey for the beasts that stalk the land. Every scar, prosthetic, or choice you make leaves its mark on both you and the island itself.</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1wU3T21HapI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bc8e825474415159f24a1067d0a4b871.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1wU3T21HapI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They recently put up a combat arena demo on Steam, which gives you a small glimpse into some of the gameplay systems (it works fine with Proton on Linux) and I'm now really quite excited by this one.</p>
<p>You can try the demo on Steam right now and at some point it will have a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/itspossible/sword-hero" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Seamless Open World: Explore a vast open world, offering freedom from the start with organic obstacles - No invisible walls here.</li>
<li>Dynamic Systems: Day-night cycle, NPC routines, Crime, and Faction skirmishes.</li>
<li>Body Parts Damage: Dismember enemies during combat for visceral battles - Exploit their weak points or even get special items by targeting specific bodyparts.</li>
<li>Housing: Purchase Businesses and Houses - Rent them out or furnish them as your own.</li>
<li>Colossal Creatures: Confront massive foes in epic battles.</li>
<li>Persistent World: Simulated Wounds, infections, decapitation, burning vegetation - Corpses that don't disappear, but rather nature takes its course.</li>
<li>Character Progression: Stats visibly change your character - Get more muscular as your Strength grows, receive permanent scars, replace your limbs with powerful Prostethics, get magical Tatoos and more.</li>
<li>Non-Level Scaling Enemies: Every enemy including Monsters are organic parts of the ecosystem - A Wolf at the beginning of the game won't magically become a bullet-sponge by the end.</li>
<li>Living World: Immerse yourself in a dynamic world where NPCs shape the landscape even when you're not looking.</li>
<li>Join a Faction: Factions provide precious gear and resources you wouldn't otherwise be able to obtain - Become respected and you will rise through their ranks.</li>
<li>An epic Story that spans across 6 Chapters, with some heavily branching choices.</li>
</ul>

      <title>WinBoat is a new Linux app to run Windows apps with &#34;seamless integration&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sometimes, you really do just need to run a Windows app on Linux and perhaps WinBoat might make this easier with its promise of "seamless integration".</p>
<p>We have Wine / Proton of course and they can run a lot, but not everything is possible. WinBoat is different. Instead of running compatibility layers, it runs a real copy of Windows using Docker and KVM under the hood. The developer explains it should run basically everything unless "it requires strong GPU acceleration or kernel-level anticheat". It uses FreeRDP for showing the apps on your Linux desktop, enabling you to interact with them like you would with any other Linux app.</p>
<p>All of this with a good-looking and easy to use interface too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14993009941756809102gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/14993009941756809102gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4950030381756809103gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4950030381756809103gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - WinBoat, from their GitHub</em></p>
<p>The biggest issue it has is requiring you to go through and manually install multiple extras, apart from that I absolutely love the idea of this for a few specific apps that just don't work on Linux directly. It's still a work in progress and quite early with it classed as a "beta" so keep that in mind when testing it.</p>
<p>App Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Elegant Interface: Sleek and intuitive interface that seamlessly integrates Windows into your Linux desktop environment, making it feel like a native experience.</li>
<li>Automated Installs: Simple installation process through our interface - pick your preferences &amp; specs and let us handle the rest.</li>
<li>Run Any App: If it runs on Windows, it can run on WinBoat. Enjoy the full range of Windows applications as native OS-level windows in your Linux environment.</li>
<li>Full Windows Desktop: Access the complete Windows desktop experience when you need it, or run individual apps seamlessly integrated into your Linux workflow.</li>
<li>Filesystem Integration: Your home directory is mounted in Windows, allowing easy file sharing between the two systems without any hassle.</li>
<li>And many more: Smartcard passthrough, resource monitoring, and more features being added regularly.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Crusader Kings III celebrates 5 years with some interesting stats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Crusader Kings III has now been out for 5 years and Paradox have done a mini-celebration, showing off some fresh stats from players. There sure are a lot of divorces going on and even more deaths.</p>
<p>“Five years have gone by so fast,” says Crusader Kings III Game Director Alexander Oltner. “We launched Crusader Kings III at the height of the Covid pandemic, so the last stages of development added an extra layer of pressure on the team. That the game has been such a success is testimony to both the hard work of my colleagues and the passion of the community at large.”</p>
<p>Here's the stats they released:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/371490771756808088gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/371490771756808088gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's interesting to note that this is one of the last few games from Paradox to have Native Linux support, which they're no longer doing. We had Victoria 3 after it and they acquired Across the Obelisk (which already had Linux support) but that's it now, their games following and upcoming are Windows-only so you'll need Proton. Their most recent releases all have mixed to negative reviews too, so I'm hoping that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/paradox-announced-the-updated-expanded-and-remastered-surviving-mars-relaunched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Surviving Mars: Relaunched</a> won't be a disappointment. </p>

      <title>Steam Survey for August 2025 is out and here&#39;s the Linux / SteamOS details</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now released the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey results for August 2025, showing the overall Linux share has dropped. Sadly, that 3% people were hoping for is another month away, but we'll hit it eventually going by the trends overall (especially if we see a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/leaks-again-hint-at-valve-doing-a-proper-steam-machine-console/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proper SteamOS Steam Machine again</a>). Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month's data for comparison</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The overall operating system share:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 95.59% +0.36%</li>
<li>Linux 2.64% -0.25%</li>
<li>macOS 1.77% -0.11%</li>
</ul>
<p>The Linux share from our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a> over time:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13749731881756807196gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13749731881756807196gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>And the Linux distribution share over time (still working on adding older data here):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20761868351756807197gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20761868351756807197gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Be sure to check the interactive charts on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>See below for the breakdown of the popular Linux distributions on Steam for August 2025, with Valve's own SteamOS continuing its slow downwards trend. Which is interesting considering overall the Linux numbers gradually trending upwards showing there's plenty of users flowing into Desktop Linux and systems like Bazzite on other handhelds.</p>
<p>Worth noting that Bazzite this month doesn't have the version number listed, which it did in previous months which is why it says it gained the whole 2.21% for August, but it's actually down from 3.20% <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">last month</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 27.65% -0.66%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 10.98% +0.16%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 8.21% +0.38%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.29% -0.25%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 4.69% +0.48%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 64 bit 2.83% -1.61%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.00% -0.17%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 2.35% -0.11%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.40% +0.07%</li>
<li>Fedora Linux 42 (Workstation Edition) 64 bit 2.18% -0.03%</li>
<li>Bazzite (FROM Fedora Atomic) 64 bit 2.21% +2.21%</li>
<li>Fedora Linux 42 (KDE Plasma Desktop Edition) 64 bit 1.93% +0.14%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 1.97% -0.17%</li>
<li>Other 22.32% +4.74%</li>

      <title>LEGO The Lord of the Rings gets updated and it&#39;s now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The classic LEGO The Lord of the Rings adventure from Traveller's Tales has been upgraded, and it's now Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>Much like we recently saw for <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/lego-batman-2-dc-super-heroes-gets-steam-deck-verified-and-cloud-saves/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes</a>, which was also updated to get Steam Deck Verified, they didn't say exactly what they fixed up for the update that's just been released. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/214510/announcements/detail/498331094794371712" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> simply said: "This update was to get the title Steam Deck verified" - and that's it.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/214510" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> reports from players, the game previously needed a few little manual adjustments, so it seems the developer has worked around it. When Valve went and checked it over again to bump it up to the Verified rating they set it to use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 10 Beta</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9522133381756737849gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Seems like they're going back over multiple LEGO games to get them all Verified, so hopefully more to come, although lots already do work just fine there's a few others like LEGO Worlds that have issues still.</p>

      <title>ScummVM gets support for the survival horror Penumbra Overture from the Amnesia developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Penumbra Overture was the first survival horror game from Frictional Games released all the way back in 2007, and now ScummVM is getting support for it. Long before the release of Soma and the Amnesia series, this is where Frictional Games started off.</p>
<p>ScummVM is an open source project that allows you to play many classic retro games on modern systems, often with a bunch of enhancements. The news is doubly interesting in this case, as Penumbra Overture was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2010/05/lugaruhd-and-penumbra-overture-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open sourced all the way back in 2010</a>. On August 29th, the ScummVM team put up a short <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20250829" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> noting that with the next stable release, Penumbra Overture will have "full support".</p>
<p>You can test it right now with the daily build, or wait for the next big ScummVM release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13254894041756730850gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13254894041756730850gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Penumbra Overture on Linux</em></p>
<p>From the looks of the ScummVM source code on GitHub, they are using a fork of the open source HPL1 game engine from Frictional. Hopefully at some point later we'll also see support for the later games Penumbra: Black Plague and Penumbra: Requiem.</p>
<p>The ScummVM team also recently <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/news/20250822/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> support for World Builder-based games.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS dev announced Kazeta, a new Linux OS aimed at recreating a classic console experience</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer of ChimeraOS has announced Kazeta, a new Linux OS that aims to provide more of a classic gaming console like experience.</p>
<p>We have a Linux distribution for basically everything nowadays right? So why make another one as a passion project? Answering that, developer Alesh Slovak said in an email it's addressing these points they've been thinking on lately:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- I noticed a lot of non-technical people using ChimeraOS/SteamOS getting lost in Steam’s complex menu structure and struggling with basic things like launching and closing games.<br/>
- I became disenchanted with digital storefronts and have come back around to appreciating physical media: game cartridges, CDs, DVDs<br/>
- I have gotten more and more into collecting old physical games and systems and found them to be a much more pleasant experience than what modern gaming offers<br/>
- I have become more and more concerned with preserving my digital game collection for play in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so with that in mind the basic idea is that you grab DRM free games (from stores like <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>), and pop them onto SD Cards to turn them into cartridges that Kazeta will detect.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6440147271756724562gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More from the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To play a game cartridge on Kazeta, you simply insert the cartridge and turn on the system. When you are done playing, you press the power button to turn it off. That’s it. There are no accounts, no online requirements, no cloud, no nothing.</p>
<p>The cherry on top is that the cartridges are treated as read-only and save data is captured separately, keeping your games untouched and preserved forever.</p>
<p>If you boot a Kazeta system with no cartridge inserted, it will boot into a retro-style bios menu where you can manage your game saves, just like the gaming consoles from the latter half of the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Kazeta is definitely not for everyone. It requires a bit of work to get started, but I have been using it quite a bit the last few months and it has brought me a lot of joy. I hope it can bring joy to others as well.</p>

      <title>Classic Marathon trilogy on Steam now has Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally from Destiny and Halo developer Bungie - Classic Marathon 1, Classic Marathon 2 and Classic Marathon Infinity get Native Linux versions on Steam. Nowadays, the retro games are supported by the community as part of the Aleph One open source project.</p>

<p>While the games did work with Proton, or you could have just run Aleph One directly, it's nice to see the Steam releases of the classics directly supported on Linux like this. Open source games are where Native Linux build should (in theory) thrive compared to running Windows games in Proton, since anyone can help make them better.</p>

      <title>Wine 10.14 brings updates for vkd3d and Mono plus more fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Windows compatibility layer Wine, which is what Valve's Proton is built from, has development version 10.14 out now. Nice to see it back to a more regular schedule after the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/wine-10-13-released-with-improvements-for-wow64-bcrypt-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delay on Wine 10.13</a>.</p>
<p>The highlights from Wine 10.14 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bundled vkd3d upgraded to version 1.17.</li>
<li>Mono engine updated to version 10.2.0.</li>
<li>Support for ping on IPv6.</li>
<li>Gitlab CI now running on Debian Trixie.</li>
<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Wine's own vkd3d version 1.17 noted these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Initial HLSL support for thread group shared memory.</li>
<li>Several features have been implemented for the experimental Metal Shading Language target.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And for Wine Mono the 10.2.0 changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mono's handling of arrays with no defined size in native wrappers now treats them as having a size of 1, matching .NET Framework. This fixes a crash in some winforms applications when used with accessibility tools.</li>
<li>Fixed an assertion failure when using the undocumented "VtblGap" runtime feature. Terraria's multiplayer server encounters this.</li>
<li>Modified FNA's <code class="inline-code">Texture2D</code> class to be xml-serializable. This is used (but not really) by Meridian: New World. It attempts to serialize a class containing a null <code class="inline-code">Texture2D</code> field, but just having the field is enough to cause an error.</li>
<li>Implemented some <code class="inline-code">Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput.Device</code> methods used by the Sega Rally launcher.</li>
<li>Technical
	<ul>
<li>Some warning fixes in WpfGfx to support newer llvm-mingw.</li>
<li>mono-basic has been merged into Framework Mono.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Upstream updates
	<ul>
<li>SDL to 3.2.20</li>
<li>FNA to 25.08, plus a few additional commits with fixes for Galactic Arms Race on NVidia GPUs and Ring Runner.</li>
<li>llvm-mingw to 20250709</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's some fixes noted for Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst, GreedFall, Mafia III: Definitive Edition, MDK, Death to Spies, Roblox Studio, Fritz Chess Coach, Le Mans Ultimate and various other fixes for expected Windows app behaviour.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.7.1 brings performance improvements for some Direct3D 9 games on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK is a Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 8/9/10/11 to run Windows games on Linux with Wine / Proton.<em> It can also be directly used by developers for Linux ports too.</em></p>
<p>This is part of what allows Valve's Proton to run Windows games so nicely on SteamOS / Steam Deck. The latest release, version 2.7.1, is out now. You don't need to do anything for Proton as Valve update it themselves. However, you can update it yourself if you wish - <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-update-dxvk-and-vkd3d-proton-in-proton-and-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see how in the GamingOnLinux guide</a>.</p>
<p>From the full <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.7.1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u><strong>Bug fixes and Improvements</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a regression that would cause MSAA resolves to look like MSAA was not working in a number of D3D9 games.</li>
<li>Improved performance in some D3D9 games by avoiding unnecessary render pass barriers, such as <strong>Dead Space 2</strong> (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5112" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5112</a>).</li>
<li>Fixed the way tessellation factors are interpreted for line tessellation. This fixes particle rendering in <strong>DCS World</strong> and potentially other issues. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/4327" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#4327</a>)</li>
<li>Added the <code class="inline-code">d3d9.modeCountCompatibility</code> configuration option to work around buffer overflows in older games that do not expect monitors to support more than ~16 different display modes. This fixes a crash in <strong>AquaNox 2</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Alone in the Dark</strong>: Worked around a crash on start. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5158" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5158</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Comanche 4</strong>: Worked around an issue where the in-game anti-aliasing option would only be exposed on certain GeForce4 Ti GPUs.</li>
<li><strong>Crysis 3</strong>: Removed GPU vendor override to work around an issue where the game wouldn't start after recent EA app updates.<br/>
	Note that this change may cause a noticeable performance regression on AMD systems due to less efficient code paths in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Siege 2</strong>: Fixed a regression that would cause character models to not show in the menu. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/5175" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5175</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</strong>: Worked around poor CPU-bound performance. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5168" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5168</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Fallout New Vegas</strong>: Added vendor override to work around an issue with the FNV Reloaded mod using an unimplemented NVAPI function on Nvidia GPUs. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5136" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5136</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Guilty Gear</strong>: Added 60 FPS cap to work around the game speeding up at higher frame rates. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/5142" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5142</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5143" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5143</a>)</li>
<li><strong>PsiOps</strong>: Added 60 FPS cap to work around broken physics at higher frame rates. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5145" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5145</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Scarface</strong>: Worked around a rendering issue caused by breaking changes in D3D9 API behaviour.</li>
<li><strong>Team Fortress 2</strong>: Fixed an MSAA-related rendering issue. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/5119" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5119</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5132" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5132</a>)</li>
<li><strong>The Witcher 1</strong>: Added 300 FPS cap to work around a game issue where Geralt's hair would not render properly in the inventory menu.</li>
<li><strong>Top Spin 2004</strong>: Fixed a memory leak as well as rendering issues. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/5155" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#5155</a>)</li>

      <title>Parkour meets Vampire Survivors in Midnight Horde</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indie dev Carry Castle recently announced Midnight Horde, a game that blends the popular mechanics of Vampire Survivors with parkour moves.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most unique takes on the genre I've ever seen as you dodge, climb, and weave through swarms of twisted creatures as they soar across the walls of gothic ruins. An interesting upgrade system too with your own castle to build and upgrade as you go. It has some really nice ideas so I can't wait to see more from this one and runs just fine with Proton on Linux.</p>
<p>A demo has been released along with a new trailer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JNByueuE73g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8282e7cb9529a8b151b16734d9d7e44a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JNByueuE73g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Midnight Horde is my personal challenge to make the most objectively fun and flow state focused game I can make as a solo developer. It blends everything I love: gothic vibes, roguelite progression, and fast, skill-based movement, into an experience that’s both intense and expressive.” - Per Fornander, the Developer at Carry Castle</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parkour System</strong>: Dash, climb, and outwit the swarms across haunted rooftops while delivering mayhem to the waves of monstrosities.</li>
<li><strong>Castle Building</strong>: Strengthen your fortress between runs, unlocking upgrades and defences to tip the balance.</li>
<li><strong>Roguelite Progression</strong>: Each night is different: experiment with builds, explore, and adapt to survive.</li>
<li><strong>Gothic Atmosphere</strong>: A dark, hand-crafted world inspired by classic gothic scenes, dripping with atmosphere.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>No exact release date yet other than sometime in 2026.</p>

      <title>The Linux version of the original Splitgate has been removed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Splitgate <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/the-original-splitgate-will-live-on-with-player-hosted-matches/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moving over to player hosted matches</a> with the main servers being shut, the developers have now removed the Native Linux version too.</p>
<p>Going by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/677620/history/?changeid=30854943" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, it appears this happened a few days ago. So now if you wish to continue playing the classic Splitgate, you'll have to use the Windows version with Proton. Since Valve's verification for Steam Deck was done on the Native Linux version that no longer exists, you will need to manually change it over to Proton in the compatibility settings otherwise it won't launch anymore on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2909845051756721349gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p><em>Looks like the anti-cheat was removed as well.</em></p>
<p>It's a shame whenever this happens, but in this case it's a free to play online game that is no longer supported. So, running it with Proton is likely the better option compared with an old Linux version. At least Valve can maintain compatibility with Proton in the case were future Linux updates might just leave the Native version broken.</p>

      <title>Basalt: The Cursed Vein is an upcoming freaking looking roguelite match-3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Enjoy the idea of match 3 games but don't like the grind? The developers of Basalt: The Cursed Vein don't either and so they're doing something different. With a gritty atmosphere and roguelite mechanics, it looks a bit on the spooky side.</p>
<p>Here you mine for ores and rare materials to rebuild a town unlocking new bombs, tools and upgrades as you go that let you push deeper where monsters await you. The roguelite side of it introduces a fresh game each time with different enemy types, bomb effects, and available upgrades. Personally, I think it looks great!</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-OEli70mPdc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/498846979d2b9f049f5e4522bcc95abf.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-OEli70mPdc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“I’ve always loved match-3, but not the free-to-play grind,” says designer Jack Kristoffersen. “Basalt turns it into a strategic roguelite loop where every dig feels rewarding.”</p>
<p>“I wanted the pixel art to feel as rough as the town you’re rebuilding,” says artist Simon Nyhus. “It’s dark and gritty, the kind of place where every shadow hides something, and every character knows more than they’re telling you.”</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Roguelite Match-3 Loop - </strong>Mine ores, rare minerals, and lost artifacts to rebuild a ruined mining town. Each upgrade unlocks new tools, bombs, and perks that let you dig deeper into the shafts for even more valuable resources. Still, every trip uses a limited number of moves that are persistent across the levels, so efficiency is key.</li>
<li><strong>Synergy-Driven Progression - </strong>Collect upgrades, lab-made bombs, and forgeable items that interact in unexpected ways. Build devastating combos that wipe the board, disable enemies, or chain resource extraction, turning every run into a unique strategic puzzle with different optimal builds.</li>
<li><strong>Randomized Runs - </strong>Enemy types, bomb effects, forge recipes, and available upgrades change each run. Even the extraordinary powers of the mine itself vary, forcing you to adapt your tactics and experiment with new playstyles every time.</li>
<li><strong>Gritty Pixel Art Atmosphere - </strong>Explore a dark, cold mining settlement rendered in moody, detailed pixel art. Between runs, meet eccentric and slightly unsettling townsfolk whose shady deals, odd requests, and tragic backstories add mystery to your journey.</li>
<li><strong>Monsters in the Deep</strong> - Battle strange and dangerous creatures as you descend, from horrifying shape-shifting spiders to blind, mineral-hungry tentacles that grow in length.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vampire Survivors latest Beta adds online play and more new content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire Survivors is finally getting the promised online mode, with a Beta now available to try that also includes some new content.</p>
<p>There's quite a few differences to playing it online instead of in local co-op including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch level up</strong> - Depending on the player count you will only see level up after all players have leveled up. So on 4 players the level up screen will only show every 4 levels.</li>
<li><strong>DLC </strong>- You will only be able to use DLC online if every player owns that DLC. We're retro-fitting Online into an originally single player game written in JS by a solo dev, so there are a lot of technical issues we have to move around or worry about later, one of which is the way that DLC expansions are handled.</li>
<li><strong>Free Roam</strong> - In online you are not restricted to the same screen, you can all freely move around the stage independently. (Note: You will be pulled into a boss room if any player walks into it)</li>
<li><strong>Spectator mode</strong> - When you die in multiplayer you can use the mouse to jump to players who are still alive. You also respawn where they are if you are spectating them.</li>
<li><strong>Achievements </strong>- You will have the choice at the end of the run to carry over any achievements earned in that run back into your own save file.</li>
<li><strong>Speed up</strong> - Disabled in online.</li>
<li><strong>Pause menu</strong> - To help flow, when you pause, you do not pause for everyone else, you just get a small window of invincibility</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the PC release, it will be a free update but they're not giving an exact date on when it will leave Beta, other than sometime this "Autumn". Save data will carry over as well, so you should hopefully not have any problems when it does leave Beta. There's no matchmaking for online mode, it's purely based on room codes or invites. Currently no cross-play either.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7689504721756486511gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7689504721756486511gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Plus some new content was also added as a Preview of the new update in the same opt-in Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>15 new achievements to unlock:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 new stages</li>
<li>2 new characters</li>
<li>2 new weapons and their evolutions</li>
<li>1 old passive weapon</li>
<li>3 new darkanas</li>
<li>3 new relics to get:
	<ul>
<li>1 new power-up</li>
<li>1 new character transformation</li>
<li>1 new game mode: PARTY MODE</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's only a small slice of what's to come, as the new content will be added to the Beta in batches. Two more parts are due to be added but they aren't saying what just yet.</p>

      <title>Steam UK users will now need a credit card to access mature content due to the Online Safety Act</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/08/25 - 16:59 UTC</strong>: since there's reports of it still working even with a Debit Card and not just a Credit Card (they're different in the UK), I've asked Valve if they have any comments on this. Since in the UK, even a preteen can get a Debit Card.</p>
<p><strong>Update #2 - 19:33 UTC</strong> - Valve press replied to GamingOnLinux to confirm allowing Debit Cards for verification was a bug, which has now been solved.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Valve recently put up a new support page, detailing the steps they've taken to comply with the UK Online Safety Act.</p>
<p>The UK Online Safety Act has a rather broad scope, and has been the cause of many changes not just for UK citizens but people worldwide as more and more websites realise they're in scope of the act and have to make changes. It covers all sorts of thing from porn to community forums and more. And yes, that even includes video games too (which many developers likely aren't even aware of). If a video game has user to user communication (voice / text chat) and it's available in the UK, the developer will need to comply with it.</p>
<p>The likes of Reddit, Bluesky, Discord, Xbox and more have already rolled out verification systems.</p>
<p>To comply with it, Valve will now be requiring users from the UK to have a valid credit card stored on their account. Valve will do a direct check (that costs £0 to users) using their own internal payment processing system "which is independently certified under the PCI-DSS standard".</p>
<p>If you don't do this you won't be able to access "Steam store pages for mature content games as well as their associated community hubs".</p>
<p>In the UK, you have to be at least 18 to have a credit card, so this way does make a lot of sense - as you'll already be age verified if you have a credit card in your name. Valve additionally say that "Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons".</p>
<p>Valve feel this way "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy" as the data they will process during this is no different to simply making a purchase on Steam. It's also only required if you've specifically opted into seeing mature content on Steam.</p>

      <title>Roguelike third-person mech-action shooter RIG Riot to be Steam Deck optimised</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm a ridiculous sucker for mech-action games and RIG Riot just landed on my radar. A roguelike third-person mech-action shooter with some fun looking combat.</p>
<p>The developer has posted an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3180340/announcements/detail/499456994710651236" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam to note how they plan to ensure it works well on Steam Deck, with current testing showing it will run at 60FPS after only a few tweaks of the settings and they plan to continue optimising it.</p>
<p>More about it: "RIG Riot is a roguelike third-person mech-action shooter. Travel through increasingly difficult stages and collect weapons and mods with powerful effects. Discover unique synergies that suit your playstyle, and travel the megastructure in search of rare permanent parts to perfect your RIG."</p>
<p>Check out the latest trailer which shows off some action along with mech customization:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="FUIGASjxiYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a26f841a289971abe4d2e98c4c55d5aa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/FUIGASjxiYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Highlights from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exciting Combat</strong></p>
<p>Combat can feel quite different depending on the style of RIG you build. Do you prefer a light and mobile mech that bombards their foes from range with a trusty sniper? How about a well-rounded powerhouse who focuses on bringing the pain with missile bombardments and automatic rifles? Or maybe you prefer a tanky build that barrels through all opposition with laser blades and shotguns? Put together your build and then prepare for fast-paced combat against a wide array of enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Customization</strong></p>
<p>In RIG Riot, every loss is an opportunity. Dive into the garage and check out the exciting new parts you've earned. Every part in RIG Riot is made out of a combination of components from the various full sets available in the game. On top of that, rare parts can be found with their own powerful effects. There are an incredible amount of parts to find- which will you use?</p>
<p><strong>Powerful Synergies</strong></p>
<p>Finds the best ways to make your unique RIG shine as you travel through increasingly difficult stages. Search for rare weapons and mods with effects that compliment your build to see just how far you can go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right to the top of my wishlist this one goes.</p>

      <title>Monster-catching, dungeon-crawling RPG Siralim Ultimate gets a big 2.0 update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Despite the developer being done with it, they've expanded it again. Siralim Ultimate 2.0 is out now as the "biggest update ever". Even before this update the game was massive, and easily one of the biggest monster-catching games ever made. Now it's truly huge.</p>
<p>What exactly is it? Tough to pin down properly to a genre, because it blends quite a lot. There's monster catching, dungeon crawling and more with over 1,200 different creatures. The developer says to think of it like "Pokemon meets Diablo, or more accurately, Dragon Warrior Monsters meets Path of Exile". If you can appreciate the very retro style, there's a huge amount of depth to it.</p>
<p>In the new update they've translated it into 14 languages, there's various new game modes to play through from an Ironman Mode to a Calm Mode and more. You'll also find hundreds of new creatures, traits, spell gems, cards, and achievements.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-z_JTU3t0Ws"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5de6948edfe6e379f616d2c56fc8938e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-z_JTU3t0Ws" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

      <title>Popular sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder Cobalt Core added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Rated Overwhelmingly Positive from users on Steam, the sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder Cobalt Core just added official Linux support. It is already rated Steam Deck Verified using Proton but now it has a Linux version.</p>
<p>Not just popular with users on Steam, multiple critic reviews really enjoyed it back when it originally released with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/deckbuilder-fans-owe-themselves-some-time-with-the-brilliant-cobalt-core/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> noting it "might be the year's best deckbuilding game". It plays quite differently to the vast number of other deckbuilders, with its inventive single-axis spin on tactics games. You control a ship, where you need to position yourself along a horizontal axis to manually dodge missiles, line up your cannons and fire.</p>
<p>Check out the original trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OE8_dfMhlfo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/54c4d5dbed87c6791dfa5531f1e2e583.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OE8_dfMhlfo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Give orders to your crew by playing cards: Will you <strong>raise shields</strong> to protect your ship, <strong>dodge</strong> incoming missiles and cannon fire to avoid damage outright, or <strong>strike</strong> preemptively to disable your enemy’s weapons? Outmaneuver your foes to stay just ahead of impending calamity, and reach the Cobalt Core!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fresh new spin on tactics –</strong> dodge attacks and target weak points in this unique single-axis take on tactics combat. Outwit the enemy in a high stakes game of cat and mouse!</li>
<li><strong>Customize your deck –</strong> hundreds of cards and split upgrade paths means no two runs will be the same. Find that perfect combo that brings your deck from powerful to overpowered.</li>

      <title>Check out the demo for Solace Creek a horror game blending suspense, exploration, stealth &amp; puzzle solving</title>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer starlit studio recently put up a Linux demo for Solace Creek, a retro-styled horror game that has a focus on suspense, exploration, stealth &amp; puzzles. If you love dark games with a thick atmosphere, this may be one for you.</p>
<p>No release date is being shared yet, as the developer continues working on expanding it but they said they had many requests for a Linux demo so they've put one up. They've recently been overhauling a number of things in the game including real-time lighting and shadows, along with an upgrade to Unity 6.</p>
<p>Check out the teaser demo trailer below:</p>

<p>More from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You awaken in a strange, abandoned research station. Disoriented and alone, clutching a handful of mysterious crimson coins. But you're not truly alone... Something lurks in the shadows, watching your every move.</p>
<p><strong>The Secrets of TARASET Station</strong></p>
<p>Something terrible has happened here... But what is this place? And how did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>An unsettling Shadow</strong></p>
<p>A sinister entity dwells in the station's dark corridors, drawn to noise and light. Hide when necessary and try to escape this nightmare.</p>
<p>Will you escape this dark place... or become its prey?</p>

      <title>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is out now and Steam Deck Unsupported but SteamOS Compatible</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater from KONAMI is a remake of the 2004 game METAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER. It's out now but it's Steam Deck Unsupported.</p>
<p>Valve checked it out and put up a notice that it just can't perform well enough on Steam Deck, not even by their sometimes strange standards. Not exactly surprising though, this is a full next-gen remake with a big visual bump and a lot of newer AAA games have really struggled on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>It is at least noted to be SteamOS Compatible though, and so it will run with Proton on Linux systems that are a bit more powerful from other handhelds to Desktop Linux. And, early reports on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2417610?device=pc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> paint a reasonably positive picture for Desktop Linux.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SRQM7bf6DOg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/06997e7267aad344434240d118fae845.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SRQM7bf6DOg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm not really up to date enough on Metal Gear Solid to go jumping into this one, so I won't be looking at it directly. </p>
<p>Are you playing it? What do you think so far?</p>

      <title>Gears of War: Reloaded is out now and works well on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been officially released so now we can experience the beginning on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. <em>Note: personal purchase.</em></p>
<p>Surprisingly, it does work rather nicely out of the box on the Steam Deck and seems like it does actually deserve the Steam Deck Verified rating. Naturally, on a more powerful Linux desktop, it's even better. It also uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which is thankfully enabled for Linux platforms as noted <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>With this new edition powered by Unreal Engine you get all post-launch content for the original including a bonus campaign act, multiplayer maps, characters and cosmetics. The controls have also been updated to be a bit more modern feeling. It adds in 4K assets, remastered textures, lighting, shadows and reflections. Along with ultrawide support, HDR, a benchmark mod, VRR, mouse and keyboard support, AMD FSR 3.1 and DLSS3.5 Super Resolution.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VzJDY6V6C4s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b8bd562bb1c443f766ac30de600c2c67.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VzJDY6V6C4s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some nice accessibility settings included in this release too including multiple screen narration options, flash reduction, changing between tapping and holding for button tap challenges and more.</p>
<p>An issue I did encounter on Steam Deck is trying to link my Microsoft account, which is required for cross-platform online play. It just repeatedly failed to contact the servers when entering the code on my PC or phone. You can still play online with other PC players without it though. However, doing a full proper restart of the Steam Deck did <em>eventually</em> allow the linking connection to succeed.</p>
<p>The same issue with account linking I saw on my Linux Desktop too, it just always gave an error about the connection. I tried many times, through many reloads and it just refused. However, adding this Steam launch option for it did enable it to actually work eventually on Desktop Linux:</p>
<p><code class="inline-code">SteamDeck=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Here's the results when running the built-in benchmark mode on a Steam Deck LCD (SteamOS Beta - Proton 9.0-4), with the default graphics settings where it does actually look pretty good:</p>

<p>And for my Desktop Linux (Kubuntu 25.04 - Proton 9.0-4) running Ryzen 5800x and Radeon 6800 XT at 2560x1440 here's what performance you might expect:</p>

<p>One important thing I will touch on here though are the reports about split-screen co-op from negative reviews and forum posts. It was actually originally advertised as having it on PC, but it does <em>not</em>. 15 days ago they removed the tags from Steam (thanks <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2523720/history/?changeid=30573436" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>) without a word, and a previous trailer on Steam noted it that has since been edited to remove it. Not a good look overall and not surprising players aren't happy about that.</p>
<p>Now we just need the sequels to get remasters so we can play through them all properly on PC. For now, we'll have to settle for the prequel in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/gears-of-war-e-day-announced-and-its-coming-to-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gears of War: E-Day</a> that will arrive eventually (no date yet).</p>
<p>Overall, if you're after an action-packed experience this is a great game to pick up. I hadn't played it since the original edition of the game on Xbox 360 so this was a nice upgrade!</p>

      <title>Quartet is a fresh retro-styled RPG out now with Linux and Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Four years after their successful crowdfunding, Quartet from developer Something Classic Games is out now with Linux support and now Steam Deck Verified. Valve checked it over on the Native Linux version to give it the Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible rating.</p>
<p>A game for those of you who love the JRPG styled classics from the team that gave us Shadows of Adam back in 2017. Here's some more about it: "A series of train robberies leads to evidence of a government conspiracy. A mysterious deck of cards gives a young girl a vision of another world. A fleet of deadly airships burns a path across the Imperial frontier. The world’s unlikeliest hero manifests tremendous magical power. These stories intertwine in the world of Quartet. Before it is all over, the eight heroes will uncover how a secret, centuries-old conflict literally reshaped the world. Then they will have their own decision to make about the destiny of magic."</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x1dtKybfyaE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/11eab8d9a90be8c736e1ab75e5a3c790.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x1dtKybfyaE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Combat is fast-paced, turn-based, and full to the brim with TONS of special abilities to use. Each character and enemy turn are shown in the turn queue on the right, allowing the player to plan devastating and timely tactical strikes.</li>
<li>Players can unleash multiple elemental and physical abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses.</li>
<li>AP automatically regenerates after a hero's turn. So don't be stingy—spam those spells!</li>
<li>In Quartet, you control 4 characters on the front line, with the other 4 ready to jump into the action at any time. Ready to bring out your heavy-hitter or an emergency healer? Swap in seamlessly from the reserve party! Swapped-in characters take their turn immediately, with no penalty.</li>
<li>While characters are in the reserves, they also regenerate their ability points (AP) more rapidly, making swapping a crucial element of combat.</li>
<li>From the steampunk-inspired streets of Leornin to the forests on the barbarian frontier; from the cursed marshes of Tyche to the underworld warehouses of Seren, Quartet offers lots to explore.</li>
<li>Exploration is absolutely worth your while. With eight party members to equip, you need lots of gear, and a lot of it comes out of a treasure chest.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: currently at time of writing the GOG store only has the Windows version.</p>

      <title>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is Steam Deck Verified but requires internet even for single-player</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have now rated Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds as Steam Deck Verified ahead of release, but we also now know you need to always be online to play it.</p>
<p>Yep, even for single-player racing you'll need an internet connection which is not just for Steam Deck - all platforms and it's also shipping with Denuvo Anti-tamper. The Steam Deck rating came in early this morning, with Valve testing it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 10 Beta</a>. Since it's Verified for Steam Deck it's also SteamOS Compatible, and will work on other Linux systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21247495941756385576gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Forcing internet connections doesn't exactly make it very portable. A shame to see more games doing this.</p>

      <title>eXtremeRate reveal new Steam Deck back shells with interchangeable back buttons</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>eXtremeRate emailed out an exciting new Steam Deck accessory. It's a new back shell design, with back buttons you can easily swap.</p>
<p>They're up for pre-order priced at either $29.99 or $31.99 depending on the colour you go for. The idea of buttons you can easily swap sounds good, as you might want different sizes on each of them depending on how you're going to use them, and how long your fingers are. And, the colours just look really cool too.</p>
<p>Colours include black, frosted white, clear, clear slate and clear atomic purple.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7156138951756381732gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Must admit, even though nowadays I don't really do any mods on either of my Steam Decks, this actually has me tempted. The colours look awesome, and I do love the button customization to make them just a little bit more comfortable for my tiny hands.</p>
<p>Check out their video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="70DAwLiFkQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/024be1cf1ae4d0482428bfb45c9b07d1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/70DAwLiFkQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The only thing they haven't made clear is the release date. They say it's up for pre-order in the email to GamingOnLinux, their website says pre-order but they also say ready to ship with no dates listed. So — sometime soon.</p>

      <title>Blending classic Disney style animation with horror, Bye Sweet Carole releases in October</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Oh yes, gimme! Bye Sweet Carole looks absolutely incredible with the way it uses a very classic Disney-style animation with horror game vibes. They've just announced that it's going to launch on October 9th!</p>
<p>From developer Little Sewing Machine, it was founded by acclaimed artist and director Chris Darril, creator of the Remothered series. What actually is it? Set in the early 1900s it's a chilling narrative-horror game inspired by classic animation movies. You follow the last known whereabouts of Carole Simmons to uncover the dark truth behind the Bunny Hall orphanage.</p>
<p>Check out the release date trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xakn5BBK77U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/69e4f87da45423d09959f0067720a3fa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xakn5BBK77U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Embark on a horrific journey through a dark tale set in the austere Bunny Hall and the mesmerizing world of Corolla.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a hand-drawn universe brought to life using cinematographic techniques inspired by the greatest animated movies.</li>
<li>Shape-shift into a rabbit and harness your various forms to conquer the deadly challenges that await you.</li>
<li>Encounter a vibrant cast of characters, from your loyal friend Mr. Baesie to the malevolent owl Velenia and the terrifying Mr. Kyn.</li>
<li>A unique journey born from the union of 2 diametrically opposed genres: a traditional animated fairy tale, in the most typical tradition of the princesses from the world of cinematic animation, and a survival horror with old school platform elements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I really hope this one is as good to play as it looks. Anyone else seriously excited by this one?</p>

      <title>Demonschool has been delayed until November due to Hollow Knight: Silksong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Hollow Knight: Silksong released date has pushed the developers and publisher of Demonschool to adjust their plans, with a big delay until November. Demonschool was originally due to launch September 3rd, but they've sent word that it's now going to be November 19th.</p>
<p>What is it? Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG where motion equals action. Defeat big weirdos in between the human and demon worlds as Faye and her misfit companions, while navigating university life on a mysterious island.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14920454391756380278gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Here's the full statement from Brian Kwek of the publisher Ysbryd Games:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Demonschool was set to launch on Sept. 3, but after much anguished consideration on our part, we’ve made the decision to move the game’s release to Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2025.</p>
<p>With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025, on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game. Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool.</p>
<p>We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for Demonschool is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.</p>
<p>We don’t take this decision lightly. Demonschool’s release has been delayed before, and we want to be clear: there are no more delays after this point. We’ve already distributed Steam keys to press as part of a healthy review program, and had every intention to proudly release on Sept 3. We hope fans who anticipated the game will forgive us for one final delay. </p>
<p>Between now and November, Necrosoft Games and ourselves will continue to pour our time into enhancing and polishing up the game experience. For example, there will be more endings and minigames that the developers originally planned to patch in post-release, rather than leave them on the cutting floor; now it’ll all be part of the game’s release in November.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and enthusiasm for Demonschool. We truly hope you continue to support Necrosoft Games’ labor of love by showing up for Faye and her madcap band of collegiate demon hunters on November 19th!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can't argue with any developer choosing to delay due to Silksong, it's going to be a huge release that sucks away time from a lot of gamers. </p>

      <title>The impressive app store Bazaar has arrived on Flathub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's many ways to install apps on Linux and Bazaar might be one of the slickest, with a focus on Flatpak and Flathub. First highlighted here on GamingOnLinux back in July <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/bazzite-gets-a-new-app-store-newly-supported-devices-improved-wifi-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when it was added to Bazzite</a>. Since then, the developers have continued expanding it and now it's looking really good.</p>
<p>Even easier to install now too, as it's directly available on <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.kolunmi.Bazaar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16859298371756379450gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16859298371756379450gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While it's primarily designed for GNOME desktops, I've been running it on KDE Plasma and it all looks rather good. Fits in quite nicely still. Especially if your main source of apps is Flatpak, this is a really sleek alternative to the bigger few like GNOME Software and KDE Discover.</p>
<p>The code is up on <a href="https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>The popular Linux distro CachyOS has a big upgrade and some fun stuff for gamers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CachyOS is a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/steam-survey-for-july-2025-shows-linux-approaching-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">popular choice for Linux gamers</a> based on Arch Linux (like SteamOS is too), and the <a href="https://cachyos.org/blog/2508-august-release/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">August update</a> brings some big new features.</p>
<p>One interesting thing for gamers is their Proton-CachyOS, their own version of Valve's Proton to run Windows games on Linux that has various extras applied to it. With the latest CachyOS update they expanded the options available for it. Taken from the release notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Proton-CachyOS</strong> received several new features: a <strong>DLSS version upgrader</strong> and an option to <strong>force the latest preset</strong>. <strong>XeSS</strong> now has a similar version-upgrade feature. We’ve also made improvements for <strong>PhysX</strong>, and the required <strong>NVIDIA libraries</strong> are now bundled. On <strong>RDNA3</strong> GPUs, you can easily enable <strong>FSR 4</strong> with <code class="inline-code">PROTON_FSR4_RDNA3_UPGRADE</code>; this downloads the FSR4 library and sets the necessary variables automatically. <strong>NTSync</strong> can now be used with Proton-CachyOS by setting <code class="inline-code">PROTON_USE_NTSYNC</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They've also introduced a new packages website, so you can check out what packages they're currently shipping. They've also updated the GRUB boot loader to automatically enable snapshots with the Btrfs file system, NVIDIA support was tweaked to enable S0ix sleep to provide low-power standby and their fork of arch-update with Cachy-Update is now available to give you a system tray indicator for available updates from official repositories and the AUR.</p>

<p>Little Kitty, Big City is a thoroughly wholesome adventure game from Double Dagger Studio with fantastic reviews and now it's even bigger. The game is Steam Deck Verified and has a Platinum rating on ProtonDB, so no matter the Linux system you're on - you're good to go.</p>
<p>They just launched the The Picture Purrfect Update which includes cat customization, there's new neighbourhoods to explore both inside and outside, along with even more extra content like: new quests, new hats, new emotes, human foods (with side effects), an expanded photo mode and new music.</p>
<p>Overall sounds like a really big free update for the game.</p>

      <title>Fantastic co-op game PEAK gets Steam Deck Verified with the latest updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PEAK is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/co-op-climbing-game-peak-is-a-truly-great-time-with-friends/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my current favourite online co-op game</a> to play with a good little crew, and now it fits a lot better on Steam Deck too thanks to updates.</p>
<p>What is it? PEAK is a co-op game about climbing. You and friends live through a plane crash and end up stranded. So now you have to climb your way through various different biomes, each with their own hazards, as you collect items from luggage spread all over the place. It's incredibly funny with the right people.</p>
<p>The problem is - the controller support has been a little on the funky side, at times just not quite working correctly. However, earlier this month a big new update launched for it adding a new biome and new items. This and some following patches improved the controller support and text on Steam Deck too. So now, Valve rated it Steam Deck Verified with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/proton-10-0-2d-beta-released-with-a-few-small-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the latest Proton 10 Beta</a>.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky Voyagers free update released with modular Corvette ships you build yourself</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hello Games launched another huge free update for the open world space survival game No Man's Sky, with a big new Corvette ship class you piece together.</p>
<p>Corvettes are a modular customizable multi-crew ship, so you can finally get up and walk around along with being able to bring you friends with you. These Corvettes can be outfitted with lots of different rooms and cockpits to make it a proper home away from home, along with a special mission radar for multi-crew missions. And, you can even get out and float around in space if that's your thing.</p>
<p>There's also a graphics upgrade for translucent surfaces like glass, NVIDIA DLSS4 support was added, there's new localised character lighting and so much more. With the Corvettes you can even park up somewhere up high in the atmosphere, and skydive out of it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qHZLz1MW0aE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cd79438401f6e1f5cdab17f6b46e36b6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Simply incredible, I can't believe how much they're still adding to No Man's Sky all these years later. The amount of different features it has for players going solo or in groups is now pretty amazing.</p>
<p>There's also a "Deep Dive" video below narrated by Sean Murray, who just casually drops in a little info about their next game Light No Fire and how the tech is being developed for both games.</p>

      <title>Brutal survival game Vintage Story gets another huge update, plus work on an Adventure Mode announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story has some of the most interesting game mechanics I've seen in a survival game, but it's a little brutal - so I'm keen for this new Adventure Mode.</p>
<p>After the news a few months ago about the game Hytale being cancelled, the developers of Vintage Story <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/hytale-fans-you-are-very-welcome-here-r412/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted how</a> they were inviting developers to come work for them. This led to <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/vintage-story-adventure-mode-r413/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">another post</a> in July talking about how they now plan to make an Adventure Mode for Vintage Story, although they haven't settled on a name yet.</p>
<p>For the latest big update to Vintage Story it adds in lots of new ocean content including 33 new fish, coral reefs and large waves. They've also improved clouds, added a bunch of new blocks, you can now tame and ride Elk, healing items now gradually heal instead of being instant, a player revive system for multiplayer was added, various story adjustments, you can now name your sailboat and attach shields and <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/v1210-story-chapter-2-redux-stable-r420/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lots more</a>.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wsyy8pziGLI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0f2f5e19007effe97e40de6ee29b4cd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wsyy8pziGLI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've also disabled purchasing on their <a href="https://tyronx.itch.io/vintage-story" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>, so now you have to get it direct (it's not on Steam or other stores). They claim that itch.io haven't paid them "for over 3 months". In their Discord, the Vintage Story developers expanded on this and said itch are "withholding a six figure sum of our revenue share".</p>

      <title>Helldivers 2 will send you deep underground in the next major update on September 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As if the Halo ODST crossover for Helldivers 2 wasn't enough, now we're actually going underground too on Terminid Hive Worlds. Now I'm really excited and will absolutely have to get some hours back into this, which was a struggle before since Dune: Awakening practically took over my life for a while.</p>
<p>These Hive Worlds have been terraformed by the Terminids, with vast cave networks we'll need to dive into. And, since you're underground, no Super Destroyer to help you. This is all about the Gloom, the thick fog that covers the Hive Worlds which has also mutated the Terminids so there will be some new threats too.</p>
<p>Some new types of missions will come with the update too like escorting a mobile oil rig, which sounds just a little like Deep Rock Galactic. There will also be another new Premium Warbond with a bunch of new gear to unlock.</p>

      <title>iRacing announce they&#39;re developing an official INDYCAR game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>iRacing just announced a partnership with INDYCAR to develop an official game that will release sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>And just like iRacing did for the recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/iracing-arcade-announced-and-its-basically-circuit-superstars-2-with-licensed-cars-and-tracks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement of iRacing Arcade in the trailer</a>, they seem to be keeping the Steam Deck as a firm target with the logo clearly displayed in their main press image.</p>
<p>We don't exactly know a whole lot about this one right now as it has only just been announced. They have said it will include a robust, multilevel career mode, licensed drivers from the NTT INDYCAR SERIES and INDY NXT by Firestone, and online multiplayer. One little fun tidbit though is that it's being made with an enhanced version of the Orontes engine, which iRacing acquired <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/01/orontes-games-creator-of-drag-gets-acquired-by-iracing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">when they bought Orontes Games</a>.</p>

      <title>Bazzite adds support for Ayaneo 3 and the AOKZOE A1X with work towards MSI Claw A8 and Legion Go 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Bazzite, the next generation of Linux gaming, has released a new build with lots of upgrades and support for more PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>Newly supported in this release are the Ayaneo 3 and the AOKZOE A1X. For the Ayaneo 3, all that's missing is support for extra modules as they're waiting to get them so support should improve in future. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6138665991756288009gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Ayaneo 3</em></p>
<p>The fun doesn't stop there though for this Linux system as Bazzite also has preliminary support for the MSI Claw A8 and the Lenovo Legion Go 2. On top of that all MSI Claw handhelds got an update to "improve controller after resume functionality and dual booting with Windows".</p>
<p>Even more with OLED devices like the OneXPlayer F1 Pro/EVA-1, Zotac Zone, and Ayaneo 3 receiving a patch to fix the screen turning off while adjusting the brightness. The Asus Z13 (2025) model is also now fully supported.</p>
<p>So much more on top of improved device support. The Handheld Daemon tool gained the ability to work with external controllers, they've improved Bazzite boot speed, along with some general performance improvements for gaming for all users.</p>
<p>See all in their <a href="https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/back-to-school-update-ayaneo-3-aokzoe-a1x-framework-desktop-performance-boot-time-improvements-bazaar-update/10520" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update post</a> and the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>The new Framework Laptop 16 brings AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series and modular GPU upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework just revealed the new Framework Laptop 16, which brings CPU and GPU upgrades to their popular modular laptop. This is probably one of the most exciting laptop hardware companies around, especially now with modular GPU upgrades possible.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are open now with you being able to configure the new Framework Laptop 16 with the Ryzen AI 7 350 or <br/>
Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 along with the new option for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 or AMD Radeon RX 7700S. Pricing starts at £1,499 for the DIY edition and £1,799 for the pre-built version.</p>
<p>From their <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/introducing-the-new-framework-laptop-16-with-nvidia" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve spent the last two years working with the teams at AMD, NVIDIA, and Compal to not only make a new NVIDIA-powered Graphics Module, but also make it fully backwards compatible with the original Framework Laptop 16. That means any current owner can pick up the new module and get the latest generation of graphics!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're really beginning to show other hardware vendors how it's done. Enabling you to keep updating your existing hardware, instead of forcing you to buy an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>For the refresh they've also revamped the thermal system, along with upgrading the display to support NVIDIA G-SYNC. The AMD GPU was also refreshed with an updated thermal system. There's more too they also announced a new compact 240W USB-C adapter supporting the USB-PD 3.1 spec.</p>
<p>For the original Framework Laptop 16 they're reducing the price and keeping the Ryzen 7 versions in production as a lower cost option.</p>

      <title>Atari acquires the rights to five classic Ubisoft titles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Atari are continuing to acquire more IP and now they've managed to pull a bunch of games away from Ubisoft. They only just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/atari-set-to-acquire-82-of-thunderful-group-ab-as-thunderful-announce-theyre-restructuring/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently acquired most of Thunderful Group AB</a>.</p>
<p>In the press release it's noticed Atari have acquired all intellectual property rights for Cold Fear (2005), I Am Alive (2012), Child of Eden (2011), Grow Home (2015), and Grow Up (2016). Atari plans to re-release the titles under their own publishing label and they're looking at "updated formats, new content, and extended distribution channels".</p>
<p>“Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time,” said Deborah Papiernik, Vice President of New Business. “Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, we’re excited to see how they’ll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.”</p>
<p>“Ubisoft and Atari both have a legacy of crafting worlds that players can fall in love with — games that resonate with generations of players not just for how they played, but for how they made us feel,” said Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari. “We’re excited to reintroduce these titles while also exploring ways to expand and evolve these franchises.”</p>

      <title>Match Shot Chimera blends together a shoot &#39;em up with clever match-3 mechanics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Match-3 and blow everything up in Match Shot Chimera, a unique fusion of two rather different genres of games into something fun. There's a demo now available which has Native Linux support, and the developer recently confirmed that it will be releasing September 9th.</p>
<p>Some more info about it: "Match Shot Chimera is a match-3 shoot 'em up with roguelite elements. Match-3 to deal big damage and collect XP for leveling up your chimera's abilities, all while dodging a wild array of enemies and bullets! Unlock persistent upgrades and unlock new characters to try different play-styles and get further on your next run."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7wZxwnAUW-g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/26e25be27444646e0c145e5e2304088a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7wZxwnAUW-g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vertical shoot 'em up gameplay</strong> - Dodge through a bullet hell while powering up your weapons to bring down massive and bizarre match-block filled bosses.</p>
<p><strong>Match-3 to make enemies go boom </strong>- Enemies drop colored puzzle blocks. Match-3 to blow things up and get XP.</p>
<p><strong>Varied Upgrades</strong> - From exploding shot, new bullet patterns, and healing puzzle matches to shooting fatter, slower bullets, there are plenty of different upgrades to make your chimera's next build unique.</p>
<p><strong>Different weapons for every block color</strong> - Hold different blocks to shoot beam weapons, exploding bomb shot, homing missiles, and more. Switch at will to change weapons, match colors, and use your powers.Varied</p>
<p><strong>Multiple characters - </strong>Choose from multiple chimeras with different powers, stats and weapons. Focus-fire, drop shields, launch drones, and more!</p>
<p><strong>Randomized Levels - </strong>Varied levels are generated from hand-crafted blocks full of hand-tested randomizations. Each level has a different style, and is populated with a different pool of enemies, mini-bosses and bosses.</p>
<p><strong>Play again and again</strong> - Tough shoot 'em up gameplay and bullet dodging will demand skill and quick thinking.  But dying is just the beginning of another run where you can try again with different builds and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent Upgrades </strong>- Collect ichor during runs and save up to upgrade your abilities, unlock new characters and change the structure of the levels themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Controller support</strong> - Fluid controls support just about any joypad you can plug in, or keyboards! Mice, too, if you're into that.</p>
<p><strong>Original Soundtrack</strong> - A sweet suite of squelchy crunching beats, custom-made to blast to.</p>

      <title>Moonlight Pulse is a metroidvania set inside an immense interstellar organism now with a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set inside an immense interstellar organism, Moonlight Pulse looks like a fun metroidvania and recently it gained a Native Linux version. It was originally released back in April 2024, and now has an overall Very Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>More about it: "Team up, learn new abilities and explore a surreal world in this seamless 2D platforming adventure set within the body of a colossal spacefaring turtle. Traverse flowing veins, sparking neurons, and gastric hazards as the world itself breathes around you. Join the heroic Curative Agents, who fight to protect this strange sanctuary from a swarm of ever-hungry interstellar parasites."</p>
<p>Check out the original release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x3wgSRdHqq4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3b6db46b2cc60027eff1c84a233192d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x3wgSRdHqq4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Team of Heroes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategically <strong>switch between characters in an instant</strong> to make use of their <strong>unique combat and movement abilities</strong>.</li>
<li>Unlock new powers as you take a starring role in each character's ongoing story.</li>
<li>Nobody gets left behind! The game ends when any character falls, but <strong>characters can rescue each other when they’re in danger</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Living World</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Journey through the lungs, stomach and heart of Aorasque, an immense interstellar organism.</li>

<p>For this one the developers recommend you play with a controller. Valve actually rated it Steam Deck Verified back in April 2025, although that was using Proton since it was before the Native Linux build existed.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life: Cross Product Multiplayer is a free mod for Half-Life that's basically a big overhaul of HLDM (Half-Life Deathmatch) and now it's now on Steam. They regularly upgrade it with new maps, game modes and more. It even has Native Linux support too.</p>
<p>The Steam release arrived with an updated "Season 9" which brings a lot of upgrades, including controller support with Steam Input and also Steam Workshop support now too.

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Adaptive gamemode system </strong>with CTF support across almost every map.</p>
<ul>

</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Gameplay enhancements </strong>- shield regeneration, soundtrack, and modern viewbobbing - some major, some subtle things, all from the internal developments made to the campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refined classic maps </strong>such as Crossfire &amp; Datacore - with in-universe lore adaptations, quality enhancements, details, smoother lighting, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.5 gains an OEM ready system setup tool and KDE Linux is progressing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next release of KDE Plasma is due in October and the developers have been working non-stop on some great new features for the popular desktop.</p>
<p>In the most recent <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/08/23/this-week-in-plasma-kde-initial-system-setup/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">This Week in Plasma post</a>, developer Nate Graham mentioned the new "KISS" tool which stands for KDE Initial System Setup. Something I'm really surprised they didn't have before. It's a way for users to set up their account properly on a computer with KDE Plasma installed, but the install was not done by them (like buying from system builders).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7495854081756123384gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7495854081756123384gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9878793011756123386gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9878793011756123386gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully with features like this actually in, we're making progress towards more systems shipping with Plasma.</p>
<p>You might also notice in the first shot above, at the bottom it says "KDE Linux". That's because the KDE team are also working on an Arch-based "next-generation operating system showcasing KDE's software". It's nowhere near ready though, but the <a href="https://kde.org/linux/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">placeholder website</a> is live. It's also a bit more like SteamOS and Bazzite, with it having an immutable base where main upgrades replace the system and you install other apps via things like Flatpak.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see what they come up with when it's actually properly ready.</p>

      <title>Retro x86-based machine emulator 86Box v5.0 brings a new integrated machine manager</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>86Box is a low level x86 emulator that runs older operating systems and software, with a big new release out to make managing multiple systems easier.</p>
<p>Version 5.0 brings a new integrated machine manager, which they said is one of the most requested additions of all time for the project. While there are third-party apps to manage it, now for most people this should get the job done. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883128251756122862gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883128251756122862gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's a number of other enhancements in this release like mouse input and display output are now much smoother, they completely reworked the OpenGL Core rendering system with multiple shaders and support for configuring shaders through the user interface, there's support for a few more retro machines, support was added for emulating more proprietary CD-ROM drives plus various UI enhancements throughout.</p>

      <title>Bottles devs give more info on their funding from NLnet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently the Bottles team announced they've been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/bottles-app-for-running-windows-apps-games-on-linux-gets-ngi-zero-commons-funding/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">granted funding by NLnet NGI Zero Commons</a> and now they've given more detail on what it means.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://usebottles.com/posts/2025-08-16-bottles-and-nlnet/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new post</a> they clarify they haven't actually received anything yet as it now goes through a planning stage to define what budget they will be given and how it will be spent. Additionally, this funding is for Bottles Next, their total rework of the app and not for maintenance on the current Bottles app.</p>
<p>With that in mind the developers mention it "doesn't mean Bottles is financially secure", as the current existing Bottles app is still funded purely by donations. And, once Bottles Next is available, it will too "live on donations from the community" as while the funding they will eventually get from NLnet "is a huge support" it's finite.</p>
<p>Since the news of the funding broke they said they've "seen donations decline, especially recurring ones" which is a shame and note that "The funds don’t cover servers, maintenance, or running costs. And without direct support, the risk is that Bottles will be overshadowed before Next is ready".</p>
<p>They also said they're working on a fresh update on the progress of Bottles Next and how development is going.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds planet customization</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open source evolution sim Thrive version 0.8.3 brings in some more customization in how you play, along with new additions to the gameplay. Just like playing the early stages of the classic game Spore, except with a lot more science behind it.</p>
<p>Now when you start a game you can actually tweak even more of it with planet customization, some of which can drastically change your play-through. Control things like world size, temperature, oceanic coverage, geological activity, climate instability and more options are planned to be added.</p>
<p>They've also added a set of achievements, various refinements to balancing and the Multicellular Stage prototype has seen some love too. On top of that they've added a new hydrogenosome organelle, a microbe movement ripple effect and more.</p>

<p>Thrive is free and open source, but you can buy it from stores to support the development. It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable / SteamOS Compatible.</p>

      <title>Tomb Raider I and Tomb Raider II open source re-implementations updated with new graphics options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The TRX project that brings an open-source reimplementation of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 has big new releases out now. It's split into two with TR1X for Tomb Raider I and TR2X for Tomb Raider 2 but they share a lot of the changes.</p>
<p>Amazing project to preserve more classic games and give them a fresh life, even with official modern ports it's nice to see open source still. You will need to official classic games for the data files to play with TRX which you can grab from <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>The update for Tomb Raider 2 is especially big on graphics rendering changes bringing options for round shadows, skyboxes, brightness, anisotropy and vertical sync along with other general visual improvements. There's also upgrades to photo mode, along with additions to gameplay mechanics like an option to allow Lara to jump up or back when hanging from a ledge.</p>
<p>You can see their overview videos on each update below:</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 10-13 released with video fixes for various games and new options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The community compatibility layer GE-Proton for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck version 10-13 brings fixes for videos on various games with some new options.</p>
<p>Be sure to see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my explainer on the different Proton versions</a> and my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to install GE-Proton</a> to get started with it. Usually, you don't need GE-Proton unless it has some specific fix not available in Valve's official Proton.</p>
<p>All that's new in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>intro video playback fixed in Resident Evil 7</li>
<li>intro video playback fixed in Resident Evil 8<font color="#e0e0e0"><strong> (Editor Note: <em>they mean </em></strong></font><em><strong>Resident Evil Village)</strong></em></li>
<li>Upside down cinema video playback fixed in Sky: Children of the Light</li>
<li>Upside down video playback fixed in Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed</li>
<li>Two new environment variable options added:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_MEDIA_USE_GST=1</code> will tell proton to use the winegstreamer backend instead of the default winedmo backend (the winedmo backend was introduced in Proton 10 and is the current preferred video playback method). This can be useful for games with videos that may have worked in Proton 9 but regressed in Proton 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="inline-code">PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION=<orientation></orientation></code> can be any of the following: <code class="inline-code">vertical-flip</code>, <code class="inline-code">horizontal-flip</code>, <code class="inline-code">rotate-180</code>, <code class="inline-code">automatic</code>. This is useful if some games have videos that are upside down or otherwise not oriented correctly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example usage: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION=vertical-flip</code>. If you set PROTON_GST_VIDEO_ORIENTATION it will also automatically force the winegstreamer backend to be used, as manual orientation is not possible with winedmo.</p>
<ul>
<li>protonfix added to restore sound in One Piece Pirate Warriors</li>
<li>protonfix added to fix 40k Dawn of War Definitive Edition multiplayer</li>
<li>protonfix added for GOG version of 40k Dawn of War Definitive Edition</li>
<li>wine-wayland em-10 patches updated and rebased</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git</li>
<li>upstream proton fixes imported</li>
</ul>

      <title>CARGO blends off-roading with an action-focused Mad Max like delivery sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CARGO is not your usual delivery sim. Blending together off-roading co-op madness in a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>They really, badly, need to come up with a better name though. The full name of the game is "CARGO: Co-Op Delivery Simulator in Post Apocalyptic World" and uh — that's a ridiculous mouthful. There's already various games named some form of Cargo, so back to the drawing board with the naming.</p>
<p>Aside from that, love the idea of this. Mixing together elements of SnowRunner, Mad Max / Twisted Metal and more into something that really could be a lot of fun. Their initial announcement trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NC77q9xiJBM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6c15c68882c64d7e406b032dba315efb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NC77q9xiJBM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overview.</strong> CARGO is a post-apocalyptic off-road autosim about moving critical supplies between survivors. Play solo or form <strong>4-player co-op</strong> convoys. Roles can be split (driver/defense/scout/utility); players can share seats (incl. mounted turrets) or bring separate vehicles into the same session.</li>
<li><strong>Driving &amp; Terrain.</strong> Physics-driven handling with meaningful setup impact: vehicle weight, tires, traction, suspension, engine, differentials. Biomes include cracked highways, deep mud, radiation zones, and sand-choked dunes.</li>
<li><strong>Encounters (PvE).</strong> Hostile raiders attempt to disable the rig and steal cargo. Choose when to evade, reroute, or fight; delivery failure is tied to cargo loss.</li>
<li><strong>Vehicles.</strong> Customization and restoration define cars for combat, capacity, speed, or traversal. Swap tires/engines, add armor and defensive/offensive tools, expand trunk capacity. Progression unlocks new options; some upgrades are vehicle-specific. Derelict vehicles can be discovered and rebuilt piece by piece.</li>
<li><strong>Meta Progression.</strong> Start from a small garage and expand base facilities to unlock trading, new delivery types, restoration options, and eventually settlement-scale operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have fond memories of blasting through Star Fox 64 and Wild Blue might end up being the closest thing to it on PC.</p>

      <title>Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) arrives September 19 for co-op PvE spaceship fun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Jump Space (formerly Jump Ship) actually looks incredible if you're in the market for a new co-op game and it arrives September 19th. It already works well on Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck from previous demos, and the developers said they will be working on improving Steam Deck performance with Proton.</p>
<p>Check out their two brand new videos:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="skSL_3-3Hb8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/00a481a51a54c05035f98671a204fc46.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/skSL_3-3Hb8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="l0c2o0UdSgs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7b5701190c3713fa37b3db91d2665975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/l0c2o0UdSgs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jump across the universe</strong> - Select from a variety of hand crafted missions with random elements. No two runs will be exactly the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamlessly go on and off ship</strong> - Once you’ve jumped with your ship, you can switch seamlessly between operating your ship, space walking and on-foot planetary exploration, it just works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Upgrade, maintain, repair</strong> - Manage your ship as you scavenge for parts to upgrade or repair it, and adapt it to fit your needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fly with a crew, or go solo</strong> - Jump Space is best enjoyed with friends, but solo adventurers are welcome too.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Manage Your Jump Ship</strong></p>
<p>Upgrade and customise your ship as you face off against the challenges of space exploration, and scavenge resources to ensure your survival. Reinforce your defences, adjust your energy output for speed or bolster your ship’s attack capabilities - the choice is yours.</p>
<p><strong>Immerse Yourself in Space</strong></p>
<p>Experience fluid gameplay as you switch from steering your ship out of an asteroid field to jetpacking towards an enemy vessel to sabotage its core. Seamlessly transition between exploration, combat and traversal.</p>
<p><strong>Improvise and Adapt; Together</strong></p>
<p>Go on missions with your friends and take on roles, from piloting to engineering and field exploration. Work together to overcome enemy attacks, extinguish fires on the command deck or adjust your ship’s power grid on the fly. There are no set classes in Jump Space, improvise and decide how you want to engage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now onto the bit that annoys me. Scroll down on Steam to see an AI notice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:</p>
<p>Pre-generated voice cloning/Text-To-Speech where it makes sense creatively.<br/>
Placeholders will be replaced by real voice acting as development continues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least in this case, they do plan to put in real voice acting later.</p>

      <title>Let&#39;s Build a Dungeon sounds like such a fun idea as it hits 140,000 Steam wishlists</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm too stupid to make a game, but a game about managing a game studio building an MMORPG? Oh yeah, Let's Build a Dungeon sounds like my jam.</p>
<p>Seriously, Let's Build a Dungeon actually has such a fun sounding idea to it. Because it's not a management game like you would expect. Built by Springloaded, who also made the cute Let's Build a Zoo. You get to build up  a full game in what they say is a "true-to-life and ridiculous simulation of the games industry". Manage staff and development schedules, build up the actual world itself and eventually…you even get to play your own game.</p>
<p>All of that while you sit back sipping a cola without the worry of a publisher suddenly running out on you.</p>
<p>Check out their brand new overview trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w9x1hGEJ-hw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/45fc193bc2bfc1af95a8e11bf1e55ad0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w9x1hGEJ-hw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Design and build your very own MMO world, fit to be filled by hordes of virtual players</li>
<li>Manage the day-to-day running of your game studio, from hiring and firing to keeping your investors happy</li>
<li>Attract new virtual players to your MMO masterpiece by expanding your world, designing new quests and monitoring player journeys</li>
<li>Progress through the campaign to develop new items, environments and mechanics that bring your ideas to life</li>
<li>Playtest your RPG at any time to see the world through the eyes of a player</li>
<li>Mix-and-match quest styles for endless replayability</li>
<li>Customise using thousands of items, or design your own</li>
<li>Negotiate tough conversations with shareholders, staff, players and publishers to make meaningful choices that will impact the direction of your studio.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Deep Dish Dungeon looks like a great co-op dungeon crawler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Dish Dungeon is a recent announcement from publisher Raw Fury, a dungeon crawler with an emphasis on exploration and player ingenuity. Playable solo or in online co-op, the trailer sold me pretty quickly with the overall theme of it.</p>
<p>Developed by Behold Studios who also made Chroma Squad, Knights of Pen and Paper and more games. As the name alludes, cooking a good hearty meal is a big part of the gameplay here. From Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deep Dish Dungeon is a dungeon crawler and exploration game that rewards curiosity and resourcefulness. In an atmospheric environment, explore corridors, rooms and passageways solo or with up to three friends, and gather resources to improve your camping site. Craft tools and cook nourishing meals to bolster strength throughout the journey, and unravel the enigma that lies within the shadows.</p>
<p>Forage and scavenge as you traverse through the dungeon's bountiful depths. Between your journeys, return to camp and plan your next steps by the fire. Use the resources you find to craft new tools and cook a hearty meal. Remember that food is progress: over time, unlock recipes that have different effects on your stats.</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-releases-september-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hollow Knight: Silksong now finally having a release date</a>, Valve have managed to test it early and given it a Steam Deck Verified rating. It's also rated as SteamOS Compatible, since anything that runs on Steam Deck should run on other SteamOS systems unless they have silly <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat</a> (which this of course does not).</p>
<p>Interestingly, Valve's rating is actually using the Native Linux version of the game and not Proton. As you can see in the details on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Nice to see another exciting release actually having full Linux support.</p>

      <title>AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) now available for all developers with FidelityFX SDK 2.0</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have finally released FidelityFX SDK 2.0, which includes support for FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4), so now all developers can use it.</p>
<p>Offering an easy way for developers to upgrade, it provides some pretty big improvements to image quality with their new Machine Learning based algorithm. It improves temporal stability, better preserve detail, and reduce ghosting and in many cases the difference is very noticeable. </p>
<p>As for the upgrade path AMD said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new release of AMD FSR 4 continues to use the FidelityFX API introduced in FSR 3.1, providing an easy update path for developers. New features are exposed using the extensibility of the FidelityFX API. AMD FSR 4 is available as prebuilt, signed DLLs as part of FidelityFX SDK 2.0 official releases to ensure stability and upgradability of DLLs, if allowed by individual game releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AMD FidelityFX SDK is open source available under the MIT license. You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and their <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/amd-fsr4-gpuopen-release/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for info.</p>

      <title>Nexus Mods announce age verification for UK users</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods team have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15346" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> they're adding an age verification requirement for certain mods, and it sounds like eventually for the EU too.</p>
<p>You can thank the UK Online Safety Act they legally have to follow, if they're to continue hosting "adult" themed mods for various games. This follows Discord, Reddit and many other sites being forced to do the same. They'll be using <a href="https://www.k-id.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">k-ID</a> for it, which is also used by Discord.</p>
<p>This won't be required for everyone, it will only appear when you try to access adult content hosted on Nexus Mods. They said EU users will "follow once laws in your region require it" and other countries as their laws come in. The only exemption is accounts over 10 years old will not be asked to age verify.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to verify and choose not to they said the content will simply be hidden.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://help.nexusmods.com/article/157-age-verification-faq" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ post</a> has more info. Nexus said it will begin next week.</p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong releases September 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming and soon too! On September 4th, the wait will finally be over for fans as confirmed today by Team Cherry. Finally, it took a while but hopefully the wait will have been worth it. Sure does look incredible.</p>
<p>Check out the official release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6XGeJwsUP9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb608bc050d35de02b488a43c81c81b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It was originally due to be an expansion for the original but simply grew too big. Their team spoke to Jason Schreier at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), detailing why it took so long to arrive. The answer is pretty simple. There was no burnout or anything big happening behind the scenes, as developer Ari Gibson said "It was never stuck or anything. It was always progressing. It's just the case that we’re a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it." and they were having a bit too much fun designing and expanding it.</p>
<p>"We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing," Gibson said. "Because all we could really say is, 'We’re still working on it.'"</p>
<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Discover a whole new kingdom! Explore coral forests, mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors as you ascend to the shining citadel at the top of the world.</li>
<li>Engage in lethal acrobatic action! Wield a whole new suite of deadly moves as you dance between foes in deadly, beautiful combat.</li>
<li>Craft powerful tools! Master an ever-expanding arsenal of weapons, traps, and mechanisms to confound your enemies and explore new heights.</li>
<li>Solve shocking quests! Hunt down rare beasts, solve ancient mysteries and search for lost treasures to fulfil the wishes of the downtrodden and restore the kingdom’s hope. Prepare for the unexpected!</li>
<li>Face over 150 all-new foes! Beasts and hunters, assassins and kings, monsters and knights, defeat them all with bravery and skill!</li>
<li>Challenge Silk Soul mode! Once you conquer the kingdom, test your skills in an all-new mode that spins the game into a unique, challenging experience.</li>
<li>Experience a stunning orchestral score! Hollow Knight’s award-winning composer, Christopher Larkin, returns to bring melancholy melodies, symphonic strings and heart-thumping, soul strumming boss themes to the adventure.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not entirely clear if it will have Native Linux support like the original. I've emailed the developer to ask. Otherwise there's Valve's excellent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/7-years-later-valves-proton-has-been-an-incredible-game-changer-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton compatibility layer</a>. <strong>Update 22/08/25</strong>: the developers added Linux system requirements after this was published, and it's now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified with the Native version</a>.</p>

      <title>The original Splitgate will live on with player-hosted matches</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At least this is one online game that won't be entirely killed off. Splitgate, the original one, will live on by allowing players to host matches.</p>
<p>If you missed the recent news, the developers announced they're <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/splitgate-2-is-going-back-to-beta-with-the-original-shutting-down-as-1047-games-have-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reworking Splitgate 2</a> and they were going to entirely sunset the original Splitgate and were only exploring the possibility of letting players host matches with the dedicated servers turned off. Now, in a <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-1-lives-on-through-peer-to-peer-support" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official site, they've confirmed an update is coming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6581120651755784135gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>To save you clicking about, here's the important bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What's Happening</strong></p>
<p>Starting August 29, the original Splitgate will be moving to peer-to-peer as we focus our resources on rebuilding Splitgate 2. We know this game means the world to so many of you and we're not about to let that disappear. This means you'll still be able to play matches and experience the magic that made Splitgate special, just in a different way.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, we have also added content to the game that was previously unreleased, stockpiled, or Work In Progress (WIP).</p>
<ul>
<li>13 WIP blockout arena maps -- Including some of the first maps shown in Splitgate 2</li>
<li>Simulation Juliet (an unreleased Takedown map)</li>
<li>Everyone gets access to all cosmetics -- For this reason, the Battle Pass, Rewards Center, Store, and Drops have been sunset</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also made sure that community-favorite features remain playable, including Races and Map Creator!</p>
<p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>
<p>A player will host a match and act as the server. Other players can view the game in the server browser and join from there. If the host has saved Custom Maps, then those maps will be playable for the lobby.</p>

      <title>Mystery delivery game Truckful is getting a demo next month, will be &#34;100%&#34; Steam Deck compatible</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Truckful is a very colourful looking delivery mystery adventure from MythicOwl and Palworld publisher Pocketpair Publishing. A demo is coming next month!</p>
<p>In a Steam announcement the developer said it will be shown off at PAX West between August 28th - September 1st where visitors will be able to try it. At some point after, a public demo will arrive on Steam that will be "100% compatible with Steam Deck". They also confirmed they're "working on a native Linux version that will be available on full game release in 2026".</p>
<p>Every bit of footage I see on this just makes me want more. See some recent gameplay below:</p>

      <title>Dome Keeper set for full online and local multiplayer with a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Multiplayer is finally coming to the excellent Dome Keeper, in a major upcoming update from developer Bippinbits. This is in addition to the developer working on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/i-cant-wait-to-fire-that-massive-cannon-in-pvkk-planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent looking PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>.</p>
<p>Giving more detail in a Steam post it will include Cooperative Play, Competitive Play, Local Splitscreen and Online Multiplayer. It's even getting a Dome versus Dome mode, which sounds like a lot of fun and a very different experience to the base game.</p>
<p>What's not entirely clear is when it will arrive. All modes are now in the code and working, but they're going through and fixing various bugs as they find them. At some point a big playtest is coming to Steam to help hunt for problems.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Soulblaze is a new dice rolling creature-collecting roguelite you can try right now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sword &amp; Quill have announced the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zeinmakesgames/soulblaze-a-hand-drawn-creature-collecting-roguelite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> for Soulblaze, a fresh dice rolling creature-collecting roguelite and there's a demo up right now. Another game made with the free and open source <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>This sounds like a good one for people who don't have endless amounts of time. It's a bite-sized creature collecting experience. As the developer explained: "Enjoy the fun of picking a starter and building your team without having to commit dozens of hours. Runs are fast-paced and always different, each of your teams unique every time. You won't run out of action points, you won't have to walk to the last healing provider over and over, you just keep going... until you win? Yes, win!"</p>
<p>It will be supported on Linux, macOS and Windows. Check out the full Kickstarter video to get some more details on it:</p>

<p>Game Highlights (from Steam):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Capture and train unique hand-drawn creatures that each have their own passive ability.</li>
<li>Combat hybrid between classic creature-collecting RPGs and TTRPG dice-roll mechanics.</li>
<li>Upgrade and customize techniques by combining tags to create your own individual builds.</li>
<li>90s-retro + fantasy: flash drives, sticker albums, and magic, baby!</li>
<li>Twitch integration.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're hoping to get at least €20,000 on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zeinmakesgames/soulblaze-a-hand-drawn-creature-collecting-roguelite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> by September 19th.</p>

      <title>Story-based survival strategy game Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown announced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We're getting a brand new Star Trek: Voyager game and a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes-announced-and-has-me-terribly-excited/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new Battlestar Galactica game</a>? This is what dreams are made of. <em>Someone pinch me, this can't be real. Janeway who? Look at me, I'm the captain now.</em></p>
<p>According to the blurb it blends "exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices" along with "crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe — with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities". Each play-through is different with it being a roguelite and so you get to play out various different fantasies with it.</p>
<p>I will make every attempt to turn the Borg into my friends. And finally give Kim that promotion. Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown is a project driven by passion—both for storytelling and for the legacy of Star Trek,” says Jonas Hüsges, COO at Daedalic Entertainment. “We’re excited to bring the U.S.S. Voyager crew back into the spotlight in a way that feels true to canon while offering new narrative frontiers to explore.”</p>
<p>“As lifelong fans of Star Trek, we’re thrilled to contribute to this iconic universe,” adds Daniel Bernard, Game Director at gameXcite. “This game isn’t just about nostalgia—it’s about giving players the conn and letting them chart their own course through the unknown.”</p>

      <title>Paradox announced the updated, expanded, and remastered Surviving Mars: Relaunched</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sci-fi fans are eating good lately. Surviving Mars: Relaunched was announced by Paradox Interactive with Haemimont Games back for it.</p>
<p>It will include enhanced graphics, a new UI,and new content never before seen in the original. Plus all the previously released DLC from expansions to cosmetic bits all included together in one package. No release date given other than "soon" and it will have a "substantial discount for owners of the original Surviving Mars".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cYdb13fqECo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9c3b50dd9ce2d268f0380d3b04fa3ad6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cYdb13fqECo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We don't know yet if it will continue the Native Linux support like the original, and Paradox haven't yet replied to my question about it. So it's possible you may have to use Valve's Proton for it on Linux systems.</p>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Award-Winning Martian Colonization Game, Remastered: Players must overcome the challenges of building a habitable, life-sustaining colony in a hostile environment, bringing in human colonists, and keeping them alive long enough to become self-sustaining. Relaunched brings a reworked UI to players for easier access to their toolset and upgraded graphics fidelity and lighting for modern systems.</li>
<li>The Full Expansion Catalog: Compete with other colonies with Space Race, introduce Animal Life with Project Laika, and terraform the martian desert with Green Planet - along with all major and minor expansions, cosmetics, and radio stations released for the original game.</li>
<li>New Gameplay Feature: The “Martian Assembly” update adds colony factions to the game, adding players’ greatest challenge yet to the unforgiving environment of Mars: politics. Colonists will adopt agendas and personal demands, allowing players to shape the society of their colonies’ future. Establish laws and policies, and even push for full independence from Earth!</li>
<li>Expansive Mod Support: Craft your own buildings, parks, or even a sci-fi mystery to share through the game’s extensive and convenient modding tools. Modding is integrated into the game across all platforms, making it easy to browse, install, share, and manage mods without ever leaving your colony.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The base price will be $39.99/£34.99/€39.99 but owners of the original get it for $19.99/£17.50/€19.99.</p>

      <title>Mesa 25.2.1 released for open source Linux graphics drivers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mesa 25.2.1 was released on August 20th bringing some essential bug fixes for the current latest feature release of open source Linux graphics drivers. The Mesa developers generally tell people to wait until this first bug fix before upgrading production systems, as new feature releases always have a little something they might miss.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/relnotes/25.2.1.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> the main bug fixes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>d3d10umd: Build regression on 25.2.0-rc1</li>
<li>nvk/nak regression: memory_model.message_passing fails on KeplerA</li>
<li>[ANV] dEQP-VK.api.copy_and_blit.copy_commands2.image_to_buffer_transfer_queue.2d_images.whole_r32g32b32_uint_linear and possibly others asserts on LNL</li>
<li>Build dependency on intel_wa.h missing in Intel vulkan driver</li>
<li>Missing polygons/vertices in CS2 on BMG</li>
<li>`vn_ring`: use-after-release crash after `vn_ring_destroy` on Virtio-Vulkan</li>
<li>venus: vkmark –winsys headless segfault (regression)</li>
<li>Vulkan headless WSI crashes when initializing swapchain on Asahi Linux running Apple M1 Max</li>

      <title>Leaks again hint at Valve doing a proper Steam Machine Console</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We are again seeing leaks of a potential future console from Valve, which is exciting considering how well the Steam Deck has done.</p>
<p>Valve are always working on something though, and seeing leaks doesn't mean what they're currently working on will ever actually release. Valve did also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/the-latest-valve-steam-console-rumour-with-amd-rdna4-can-be-safely-ignored-heres-why/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously completely dismiss another rumour</a> but this one at least has some more substance to it.</p>
<p>The what: as reported by <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1957931577444561350" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SadlyItsBradley</a> on X, noting that a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390426" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Geekbench</a> result had appeared for "Valve Fremont". Going by the details it's currently using a "Hawk Point 2" CPU noted as "AMD Custom CPU 1772" featuring 6 Cores and 12 Threads running at 3.20 GHz.</p>
<p>What makes it a little odd though is the listing being Windows 11 Pro, along with it <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1958024995273068544" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> having a dedicated RX 7600 GPU. It would be thoroughly odd if it was Windows-based, given all their work on Linux and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/7-years-later-valves-proton-has-been-an-incredible-game-changer-for-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">amazing Proton compatibility layer</a>. This is likely just some testing machine that won't match up to what the real specifications will be, if it <em>ever</em> does release.</p>
<p>Question is though — how did this listing appear? It wasn't just the once either, but <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390144" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">twice</a>. Did someone at Valve accidentally allow it to be published? Did Valve do it on purpose to generate more leak hype and speculation? Then again, to cover all sides - this "Valve Fremont" <em>might</em> not even be a real listing actually coming from a Valve test.</p>
<p>How <em>could</em> they actually make it a success? I wrote about what I thought <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/what-valve-would-need-to-do-to-make-a-steam-console-a-success/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve would need for a new Steam Machine previously</a>, and going back — most of what I said still remains true. Mostly, because they do now have the dedicated SteamOS rating system now at least for other devices.</p>
<p>Valve have built up a lot of goodwill and dedicated customers with the Steam Deck, and we've come a truly long way since the failure of the first Steam Machines so they could quite easily make it a success. As long as it's priced right, and performs well enough with people having access to all their existing Steam games thanks again to Proton if it used SteamOS. We definitely <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/new-steam-controller-2-and-vr-controller-designs-got-leaked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">need that Steam Controller 2</a> as well that's for sure.</p>
<p>What are your current thoughts on a future TV Steam Machine from Valve?</p>
<p><em>I've reached out to Valve for comment but we're unlikely to get a response on such a thing.</em></p>

      <title>7 years later, Valve&#39;s Proton has been an incredible game-changer for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It has been 7 years since Valve revealed Proton, their compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux systems. <em>What an incredible time it has been.</em></p>
<p>Hard to imagine Linux gaming without Proton now isn't it? Unless games use some funky video codecs or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">kernel-level anti-cheat</a>, a lot of the time they do just work with the click of a button. We went from getting a handful of indie games and some AAA scraps from porting companies, to multiple tens of thousands of games — we're spoilt for choice on what to actually play. Going by ProtonDB there's at least 15,855 games rated playable by at least two reports, and Valve's Deck Verified system shows 21,694 games rated at least playable for SteamOS / Steam Deck. Incredible numbers and that's only what have actually seen some checks.</p>
<p>I still <em>vividly</em> remember the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/08/valve-officially-confirm-a-new-version-of-steam-play-which-includes-a-modified-version-of-wine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">original announcement</a>, shaking with excitement on what it would mean for the future. It has opened up a world of possibilities, where you (for the most part) don't need to be attached to Windows to play some of the best games around.</p>
<p>Valve's commitment to Linux and open source is very much self-serving of course, they are a company with goals. All of this was progress towards creating their own ecosystem with the likes of the Steam Deck / SteamOS and other potential hardware to come. Linux desktop users are mostly just along for the ride and reap all the benefits.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the work with Proton and the Steam Deck, the Linux user share on Steam is also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on the cusp of breaking through 3%</a> which is impressive considering the massive mountain that is Windows. You don't beat or even get remotely close to such an entrenched system overnight, movement like this just takes time. Slow and steady wins the race right? Valve continue playing the long game here.</p>
<p>What's truly incredible about Proton though is how it gives Valve a set platform to continue building on. So when we hopefully see a Steam Deck 2, or a Steam Machine TV console, it will be plug and play with all the existing games. Linking into why I love the whole idea of Valve using Linux with Proton, SteamOS / Steam Deck over traditional consoles is just having access to all the same games - no need to buy them again.</p>
<p>And with more publishers like Microsoft and Sony pushing their games on Steam too, we all win.</p>
<p>Here's to Valve and Proton, 7 years on. Cheers!</p>

      <title>I can&#39;t wait to fire that massive cannon in PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant really rolls off the tongue doesn't it? Is it basically Dome Keeper in 3D? Well, sort-of but not quite. Either way, it looks fantastic and the latest trailer gives us a fresh glimpse into the world of firing a massive planetary defence cannon.</p>
<p>Working for an autocratic regime and confined to your bunker, it's your mission to manually control that huge weapon with various buttons, levers and more. It's not just you sat in front of a screen though, you can actually get up and walk around this bunker with customizations, and you'll be dealing with various moral dilemmas. There's also some secrets to the bunker to explore and discover.</p>
<p>Check out the fresh trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="HYoehpASQMA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0b207f1379a87aade70c2025b678619a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/HYoehpASQMA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>We still don't entirely know if it will have Native Linux support. It's built with Godot and their FAQ still just mentions that Linux is a "pretty safe bet" since Godot works well. Just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>I'm excited by this one, what a great idea and the new footage looks awesome. Dome Keeper really sucked me in, so I expect more great things from Bippinbits. Their booth at Gamescom is also <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/smitner.studio/post/3lwtdd3oiqs26" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">just awesome</a>.</p>

      <title>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster is the next Nightdive Studios release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios announced they're doing Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster, reviving the 1997 classic from LucasArts. People were speculating this was coming, since the original on Steam got named to "Classic" before the official announcement claim.</p>
<p>More about it: "Saddle up and ride back into the Wild West with the gunslinging ex-Marshal, James Anderson, and face off against the good, the bad, and the even worse this side of the Mississippi as you work to uncover a twisted plot of greed and corruption. With your trusty six-shooting .45 Revolver, Scoped .44 Rifle, 10-Gauge Shotgun, and good ol' Sawed-Off 12-Gauge Shotgun, you'll be packin' plenty of firepower to take out all manner of outlaw varmints."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qx4O0OmaFNg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6742019830ee34ee959da053147bb7a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qx4O0OmaFNg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “Following our release of Star Wars™: Dark Forces Remaster last year, we are overjoyed to continue our relationship and work closely with the amazing team at Lucasfilm Games,” said Stephen Kick, Nightdive’s Studio Head. “The influence of the original Outlaws + Handful of Missions on the FPS genre cannot be overstated, in terms of gameplay and narrative prowess. We’re honored to help bring this iconic Western adventure to modern audiences.”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Engaging first-person ground combat featuring five weapon types</li>
<li>Up to 4K 120FPS visuals on PC, PlayStation 4|5, and Xbox One and Series X|S</li>
<li>Modern gamepad support adds a new weapon wheel, rumble, and motion/gyro controls</li>
<li>Trophies and Achievements on Windows PC via Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles</li>
<li>A Vault filled with golden behind-the-scenes nuggets that fans will enjoy</li>
<li>Four Multiplayer game modes with crossplay across platforms — Deathmatch, Team Play, Capture the Flag, and Kill The Fool With The Chicken!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition fixes desyncs between Windows and Linux / SteamOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition released recently and it works great on Linux, even better now the online works properly too.</p>
<p>Thanks to Valve's Proton, we have access constantly to games new and old. But, sometimes, they come with issues. Much like previous RTS games from Relic Entertainment, it launched with a desync issue between Windows and Linux (Proton). However, unlike previous games, Relic actually released a patch to fix it! Just goes to show how far we've come that developers are truly now paying attention.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8xFKCaztKIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5b3d7ac548714a183dba48a1e5a55e2c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8xFKCaztKIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Noted in Hot Fix 2.0.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players could not see Multiplayer game lobbies hosted by a player using a different audio language (English, German, French, and Russian).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the game from loading the correct language using the GOG Galaxy launcher for those using Korean, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese. </li>
<li><strong>Fixed a desync that led to a crash in Multiplayer games where players on Windows &amp; Linux (SteamDeck / Proton) were playing together.</strong></li>
<li>Fixed two crashes that could occur during singleplayer or multiplayer when numerous enemy units were starting to move while the player is also moving the camera.</li>
<li>Fixed two crashes that could occur when pre-rendered movies started for players using older operating systems. </li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during loading screens or while saving the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a fatal scar error in Winter Assault Disorder Mission 1 when Gorgutz was killed immediately before a cut-scene triggered.</li>
<li>Fixed a scripting error that prevented Listening Posts from being buildable in Dawn of War Mission 1 when two strategic points were captured at the same time.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that could sometimes prevent objective locations from being correctly highlighted by arrow FX in Campaign missions.</li>
<li>Updated Gridkeys controls to fix a keybind conflict on Orks, Space Marines, and Imperial Guard.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Now we can all enjoy one of the best RTS games ever, with lots of enhancements and actually working multiplayer between platforms without having to resort to special external fixes. What a time to be alive.</p>

      <title>iRacing Arcade announced and it&#39;s basically Circuit Superstars 2 with licensed cars and tracks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>iRacing have announced iRacing Arcade made in partnership with Original Fire Games the developers of Circuit Superstars.</p>
<p>Certainly seems like this could have been Circuit Superstars 2, with iRacing mentioning how this "all-new title blends the strengths of both studios to create a unique racing experience that’s fun for all". It will also come with a stylized version of officially licensed vehicles and tracks.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QDQg-MjglNY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25a2710700195311ceb3a55ed32d61ab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QDQg-MjglNY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, their system requirements on Steam note it will run on "LCD Steam Deck equivalent or higher". Nice to see more developers using the Steam Deck directly like this, as a set specification platform for performance.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features of iRacing Arcade include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Approachable racing for all:</strong> Racers of all ages will enjoy iRacing Arcade’s mix of playful art and fun physics, giving players a driving experience that is easy to pick up but rewarding to master.</li>

<li><strong>More ways to race:</strong> Along with your single-player racing dynasty, compete in global time trials and push for the highest possible spot on the leaderboard.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Death By Scrolling is the next game from Ron Gilbert of Terrible Toybox and publisher MicroProse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MicroProse Software are on a bit of a roll lately for their publishing, now they've announced Death By Scrolling from Ron Gilbert of Terrible Toybox.</p>
<p>More about it: set in the bizarre depths of Purgatory — now under new management, Death By Scrolling challenges players to race upward through endless levels, battling quirky underworld monsters, dodging deadly traps, and staying just ahead of the relentless Grim Reaper. The ultimate goal? Amass 10,000 gold to pay the Ferryman’s outrageous river‑crossing fee and finally escape the afterlife. Check out the first proper trailer for it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fXIGtCVH5Wo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3746ef19412f15cac41826fd985aaeeb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fXIGtCVH5Wo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will choose from a varied cast of unique characters, each with distinct perks and abilities, and take on a nonstop vertical sprint where time, gravity, and death itself are constant enemies.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Along the way, they’ll:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Battle <strong>bizarre creatures</strong> and demonic bosses in fast‑paced combat.</li>
<li>Gather <strong>loot</strong>, gems, and power‑ups from eccentric vendors.</li>
<li>Complete <strong>bonus runs and side quests</strong> for extra rewards.</li>
<li>Compete on global Steam <strong>leaderboards </strong>to prove their purgatorial skill.</li>
<li>Enjoy a<strong> tongue‑in‑cheek</strong> take on afterlife bureaucracy, with cheeky dialogues and playful narration—hallmarks of Ron Gilbert’s signature style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>"Working with Ron Gilbert on Death By Scrolling is an honor," said Davide Pessach, CMO at MicroProse. "He’s brought his trademark humor, sharp design, and quirky world‑building to a completely new genre for him. We can’t wait for players to experience it."</p>
<p>Looks like it will have Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes announced and has me terribly excited</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes is a new strategy game from Dotemu and developer Alt Shift releasing in Q1 2026.</p>
<p>I cannot even begin to tell you how happy I am to see this. The modern Battlestar Galactica is easily my all-time favourite sci-fi series. If you haven't watched it – you should fix that.</p>
<p>There is already a Battlestar strategy game with Battlestar Galactica Deadlock, that's really quite good! But this Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes brings more of a roguelite experience that "pays tribute to the fundamental aspects of the franchise". Check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZJsmoFJE-vs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb5914df03b41748eec99353af35d975.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZJsmoFJE-vs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Gosh, that music, what a perfect bit of marketing for anyone who is a Galactica fan. And recreating the intro from the series in the trailer for the game? That was clever. Gimme gimme gimme. My expectations weren't particularly high until watching the trailer, since it's a series I love so much but now I really am interested. A universe that just deserves to be expanded — there's a ridiculous amount of background lore that they can dive into.</p>
<p>From the press email announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em>, you command a fleet of spaceships fleeing humanity’s settled worlds, known as the Twelve Colonies. You must escape annihilation by the Cylons, a sentient robotic species that has turned against its human creators. The only hope of survival lies in reaching the mighty ship known as the Battlestar Galactica, but enduring the Cylons attack while preventing political dissent or in-fleet disputes from dividing your forces will test your ability to manage multiple crises at once – including identifying imposters that may already be among your ranks.</p>
<p>Every difficult choice made in <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> brings consequences, and each run varies in its challenges. Encounter planets and galactic points of interest, decide whether to spend precious resources addressing incidents within your fleet or upgrading your forces, and make the most of your crew’s time while preparing for assault; enemy Cylon ships will close in with each action and turn you take.</p>
<p>Once the deadly Cylons make contact with your forces, a battle begins. True to the franchise’s theme of escaping an overwhelming enemy, <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> features innovative core combat gameplay centered around a simple but key concept of survival: “resist until you can jump.” Deploy fighters from your hangars and direct them in real-time combat scenarios to dispatch the Cylons, minimizing damage to your central ship while wielding its onboard defenses against your gravest threats. Endure until you can flee to another sector of the galaxy, choosing your destination (and potential rewards) based on your most dire needs.</p>
<p>Each run in <em>Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</em> offers new lessons as you adapt to defy your brutal odds of survival, and your tactical options broaden as you unlock additional squadrons, weapons and traits as well as meta upgrades to benefit future runs. Make decisions that meaningfully alter your fleet’s fate, lead your fighters through high-risk battles, and jump to new sectors before the Cylons turn your ships into astral debris. With humanity’s haven in the Twelve Colonies now uninhabitable, your steadfast tactical leadership is your crew’s only hope of surviving the journey to humankind’s last hope, the Battlestar Galactica. So say we all.</p>

      <title>Competitive vehicle shooter World of Tanks: HEAT announced with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A competitive multiplayer game announced with Steam Deck support right away? Not something we see often! World of Tanks: HEAT has me cautiously interested.</p>
<p>It's from Wargaming Group Limited so it's going to be another free to play live service game full of micro-transactions, because of course it is. Hopefully at least it goes better than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/steel-hunters-is-another-live-service-casualty-as-its-shutting-down/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">STEEL HUNTERS which they're shutting down</a>, let's see how long this one lives. To be fair, Wargaming's other games are pretty popular.</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought it was still pretty neat to see Steam Deck mentioned directly along with other platforms at the end of the trailer. The trailer which, while in-engine, is <em>not</em> actual gameplay. So it's about as useful as glass hammer in terms of getting even the slightest idea if it looks fun or not.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7VXeTK3-lMA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/63618980f98abd1eafd69f43520f9c52.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7VXeTK3-lMA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They claim it will have no pay to win, hopefully they actually stick by that. More from their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every vehicle in HEAT is piloted by an elite agent, each with their own backstory, playstyle, and unique active ability. Whether you're the type to hold the line, call the shots, or dive deep behind enemy lines, there's a role for you here.</p>
<h3><strong>Built for Competitive Play</strong></h3>
<p>World of Tanks: HEAT is designed from the ground up to feel tight, responsive, and intuitive. Expect intense matches that get to the action fast and reward strategy, squad-based tactics, and role mastery.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fight across a wide range of dynamic maps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coordinate with your squad to capture objectives and dominate control points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master your favorite vehicles and unlock new looks and loadouts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No endless grinds. No pay-to-win. Just raw, skill-based competition, and all the chaos that comes with it.</p>

      <title>SCS Software have next-gen trucking competition with Road Kings from Saber Interactive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When you think of a trucking sim you probably think American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 but here comes some big competition with Road Kings.</p>
<p>Announced by Saber Interactive and Focus Entertainment, Road Kings invites players to take the driver’s seat of a 40-ton semi in a realistic simulation, and deliver goods across the vast and vibrant landscapes of the American South.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-DgAnfPjijY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dca509b5d97c4835ad56e6009788df87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-DgAnfPjijY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: </p>
<p>“We are thrilled to start on another exciting journey with our longtime partner Saber Interactive,” says John Bert, Managing Director at Focus Entertainment Publishing. “Road Kings is a project that truly combines Saber’s technical expertise with Focus Entertainment’s passion for immersive simulation experiences. Together, we're aiming to deliver a deeper gameplay experience and a more dynamic adventure for players. We can’t wait for fans to get behind the wheel and discover everything this new title has to offer.”</p>
<p>"As a native Floridian, it is awesome to see parts of my home state recreated in Road Kings. ​ I spent hundreds of hours on those roads as a kid and now we are bringing them to life in a game that creates a new category in the simulation space. ​I am so happy to be a part of this journey and personally loved playing the game." said Matthew Karch, Saber CEO.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take the wheel of a 40-ton semi, hauling cargo across the coastal plains of the American South. Manage multiple jobs, trailers, and routes, from busy Jacksonville to the shady streets of historic Savannah.</p>
<p>Starting as a rookie driver, encounter cunning rivals, helpful allies, dangerous weather, and treacherous roads as you take on long-haul deliveries to carve out a reputation as a veteran owner-operator in <em>Road Kings' </em>immersive world.</p>
<p><strong>Grow your reputation, push through dangerous situations, face down rivals, and take on long-haul deliveries in a living, reactive world.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take control of your truck in a next-gen simulation, where every aspect matters, from weight, wear, brakes, torque, tires, and transmissions, to dynamic weather and road surfaces. Drive long distances in faithfully recreated, customizable branded trucks.</li>
<li>Dive into a changing world, where a ruthless corporation is expanding across the South, threatening catastrophe in the name of profit. When disaster strikes, only you can make it through. Rescue communities, deliver critical supplies, and prove that out on the road, a helping hand can make all the difference.</li>
<li>Make your own Road Kings story by earning reputation with drivers, dispatchers, and agencies. Choose a path to success by diversifying clients, or become the star vendor for just a few. Go further with asynchronous multiplayer: join or create a company, and climb the global leaderboards.</li>
<li>Hit the open road, traveling through breathtaking landscapes inspired by the real-life Florida-Georgia border. Navigate interstates with road signs, mind your diesel, watch for troopers, and follow service regulations, as cutting corners can hit your wallet, your clocks, and your reputation.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 launches October 21 but you have to pay extra for all the content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 from Paradox finally has a release date with October 21, but it gets expensive if you want all the content.</p>
<p>Paradox games have become a bit of a meme on the level of DLC included, but with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 they're pushing it further. There's three different editions of the game, the one with all of the actual content at release is a surprising £74.99. That's because, for some reason, they've separated two clans into a DLC which they've put into the "Premium Edition".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="TrAVDT7maJE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b069870430fdaa4b694b9afbb6c8332.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/TrAVDT7maJE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 players will experience the game's narrative through two alternating playable characters: Elder vampire Phyre and Malkavian detective Fabien. After centuries of torpor, a deep state of vampiric slumber, Phyre awakens in modern-day Seattle with a mysterious mark that has locked away their Elder abilities and Fabien’s voice echoing in their head. As Phyre, players meet the city’s ruling Kindred vampires, each with their own motivations, and uncover Seattle’s dark secrets while reclaiming their lost vampiric powers.</p>
<p>Between nights, as Phyre rests, dreams and voices from Fabien's past take hold. Emerging as Fabien, players enter a neo-noir 1920s Seattle and use his Malkavian abilities to unravel the mystery behind his murder. Solving the case proves challenging, as Fabien's fractured perception of reality, a trait of his Malkavian blood, makes it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. </p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 is the successor to the cult-classic Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines (2004). Bloodlines 2 plunges players into Seattle's dark underbelly, where vampires struggle for survival and supremacy. Players meet compelling characters, navigate complex political relationships, stalk the city streets for prey, and engage in intense combat while balancing their thirst for mortal blood. </p>
<p>The base game includes four clans, each with its own distinct playstyles, outfits, and Disciplines: the rebellious Brujah, blood sorcery masters Tremere, justice-driven Banu Haqim, and the persuasive Ventrue. Players must remain mindful of their surroundings or risk breaking the Masquerade – the absolute law of secrecy that keeps vampire society hidden from humanity.</p>

      <title>Europa Universalis V set to release November 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Europa Universalis V from Paradox Interactive now has a confirmed release date for November 4.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/05/europa-universalis-v-from-paradox-will-only-support-windows-no-linux-or-macos-this-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">As confirmed previously</a> though, Paradox have dumped both Native Linux and macOS support as they're now just focusing on Windows. Hopefully their latest engine will work well in Proton so at least Linux gamers won't entirely miss out on the latest grand-strategy game.</p>
<p>From the press release: "Developed by the Barcelona-based Paradox Tinto under the direction of Paradox co-founder Johan Andersson, Europa Universalis V is a continuation of the series’ record of deep, quality strategy gaming, but also a major departure from the previous titles. The new game moves further from the game’s boardgame roots, and embraces population simulator models that have been explored in other Paradox games."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>New “pop” based system: </strong>A region’s population is reflected by pop units, varying in culture, religion, and social position. A prosperous society will see the population grow, while plague and war can prove costly to the core of your game.</li>
<li><strong>Earliest Starting Date in Europa Universalis history,</strong> beginning with the world of 1337. The French and English are about to start the Hundred Years’ War, the Yuan dynasty thrives in China, and the Black Death has yet to happen. Guide a nation through 500 years of history, written by your decisions.</li>
<li><strong>The Biggest Paradox Map</strong> ever uses a more accurate projection of the globe and small province units. This means greater fidelity to the historical world that Europa Universalis V represents and more variety in the strategies available to the player.</li>
<li><strong>Deeper Economic System</strong> including multiple goods and resources in each province. Resources can be fed into a production system, creating key goods for your society or for trade in regional and global markets.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Research Game:</strong> Unlock new technologies and ideas across diplomatic, administrative and military realms. Progress along each research branch will allow new weapons, new industries, and new ways to organize your realm.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Government System:</strong> Give tasks to your cabinet advisors to ease your rule, adopt new laws and national characteristics, and keep the factions of your nation in line by doling out privileges to various Estates.</li>
<li><strong>New Military System</strong> that draws soldiers from your population. Raise the levies and watch commerce grind to a halt, or hire mercenaries to fill your ranks. Slowly develop a professional standing army and organize your battlefield posture as you fight for territory and glory.</li>
<li><strong>And more:</strong> Historical situations to immerse you in real world events, multiple religions and government types, greater importance of characters and dynastic relationships, and dramatic world changing events.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Woolhaven expansion announced for Cult of the Lamb</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gimme! I know a good few people who will be terribly excited for the announced Woolhaven expansion for Cult of the Lamb. Set to arrive in "early 2026" it's a big one too.</p>
<p>The base game works great on Desktop Linux and is Steam Deck Verified. I've put a lot of hours in and can easily recommend it. Absolutely incredible style so I'm quite hyped for this expansion! You'll need to have played a lot of it to access the expansion, as it's only available near the end.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EehS0AGcLkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4f7a95dc21d4941b0dd6f6bde13150d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EehS0AGcLkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Expansion Details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Winter descends, and a long-silenced deity stirs beneath the snow.<br/>
<br/>
Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs, summons you to restore the flock and reclaim what time has erased. But as you breathe life into what long passed, a creeping Rot awakens, spreading corruption through the sacred mountain the lambs once called home…<br/>
<br/>
Not all who tread this peak come seeking redemption. Upon the frozen summit, a wolf prowls — his pack hungers for war with the covetous Gods. Deep within the hidden caverns, a shadowy figure waits, blade honed and patience fraying. Restless spirits drift along the ridges, each bound by former sins. The past was buried for good reason — will you unearth it, or will it consume you?<br/>
<br/>
That which was sacred now rots, and nothing is as it seems. Last of the lambs, Woolhaven’s fate rests in your hooves.</p>
<ul>
<li>Return the lost souls of Woolhaven to their spiritual home and learn the long-forgotten history of lambkind. Rebuild the fallen town to its former glory and reclaim the mountain to restore the depleted power of Yngya, the forgotten God of the lambs. But beware: there is always a price to be paid.</li>
<li>Endure harsh weather, including blizzards and freezing temperatures, that threaten your Cult’s survival. Build new structures to keep your loyal followers warm and protect them from frostbite and famine.</li>
<li>Unlock ranching at your Cult base and breed rare animals that provide wool, warmth, and when times are particularly desperate, precious meat. Tame, ride, and let your followers take care of these majestic creatures.</li>
<li>Venture into a new realm battered by bitter storms, crawling with creatures corrupted with the Rot lurking beneath the snow. Battle through two vast new dungeons, where the echoes of the past refuse to rest.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dune: Awakening is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After Funcom have patched Dune: Awakening quite a few times since release, the experience on Steam Deck is now good enough that it's been Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best MMOs released in a long time, I've been having a seriously good time with it, although it's a huge time sink. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/dune-awakening-is-out-now-and-works-well-on-linux-desktop-but-rough-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial release worked great on Desktop Linux</a> but was just a little rough on Steam Deck. Seems now though Valve felt the issues it had that kept it to a Playable rating have improved enough.</p>
<p>As of August 18th, it's Steam Deck Verified with Proton 9.0-4. The developers also put up an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1172710/announcements/detail/515218419125060464" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> for the change on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greetings Sleepers, </p>
<p>We’re excited to announce that Dune: Awakening is now fully Steam Deck verified! </p>
<p>Until now, it has been in the Playable category, but after some tweaks, it now meets all of Valve’s requirements to be a smooth experience on the Deck: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All functionality is accessible when using the default controller configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This game shows Steam Deck controller icons </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-game interface text is legible on Steam Deck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This game’s default graphics configuration performs well on Steam Deck </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So put some Dune in your Deck and bring a little spice wherever you go. </p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your support as the team continues to work on improvements. Any issues you report using the in-game tool and feedback you leave across all our channels is massively appreciated! We look forward to sharing more details about all the new content we have in store for Dune: Awakening. </p>

      <title>Hollow Knight: Silksong &#39;special announcement&#39; coming August 21</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A special announcement from Team Cherry has been revealed for Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>
<p>They've put up a video on YouTube that will premier at 2:30pm UTC / 3:30pm BST on August 21st. We don't know exactly what it will be for though, so speculation across social media is already going wild about it. This could just be a fresh proper gameplay trailer, a release date announcement or perhaps they might even surprise us all with a direct release along with the video (we can dream right?).</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> or directly below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6XGeJwsUP9c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cb608bc050d35de02b488a43c81c81b3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I continue to be amazed by just how wild the wait is for Hollow Knight: Silksong. There's not many times I've seen this kind of hype for a game in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/happy-birthday-gamingonlinux-16-years-today/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">16 years</a> doing this. The pressure that Team Cherry are feeling must be unimaginable. Will it live up to expectations? </p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 x Halo: ODST crossover arrives on August 26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Okay fine, I'll load HELLDIVERS 2 up again. I definitely don't want to miss the new HELLDIVERS 2 x HALO: ODST Legendary Warbond.</p>
<p>It arrives on August 26th bringing with it armour and weapons from the Halo series. Since it's a Warbond, it does need an extra purchase using in-game currency. But, to the credit of Arrowhead Game Studios, they have one of the best battle pass styled systems in any game I've ever played. You can buy up any Warbond, and then progress through them at your own pace as they don't vanish.</p>
<p>Here's what's in it:</p>

      <title>Valve continue building up their new game Deadlock with a big update with six new heroes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve developers are still working on their upcoming game Deadlock, a third-person MOBA and the latest update is a pretty big one.</p>
<p>There's still no word on a release date, likely as they had to announce it earlier than they wanted to due to all the repeated leaks but work is ongoing on it regularly. You also still need to be invited by someone else with access. Despite all that, it has been seeing over 10,000 concurrent players regularly. </p>
<p>This new update adds in six new heroes, although Valve are doing a staggered release of each with a new one unlocking each day over the week.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3109303521755607306gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>A big new addition is also The Hideout. Giving you a private area to mess about in while you're waiting on a match. You can invite friends to yours or join others, and Valve said it will provide "future opportunities for personalization, achievements, and events".</p>
<p>This Hideout gives you access to various game functions along with a practice range to test movement and abilities without needing to load into the Sandbox.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3622847471755607911gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3622847471755607911gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9396936861755607921gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9396936861755607921gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve also updated the game map with "various visual improvements and lighting changes" and promises "a lot more map improvements planned in upcoming updates". </p>

      <title>Steampunk auto-shooter Airships: Lost Flotilla gets a big free content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Airships: Lost Flotilla is a really good auto-shooter taking elements from survivor-like bullet hells and it just had a big free content expansion. It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Like other games inspired by the mechanics from Vampire Survivors, you pick a character (in this case, a ship) and go through waves of enemies while you keep upgrading.
