      <title>The RAM price and availability situation is going to worsen as Micron pull their Crucial consumer business</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As RAM prices explode and availability becomes an issue thanks to AI companies, Micron announced their Crucial consumer business is no longer a thing.</p>
<p>Sent out in a <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> today Micron said they've decided to "exit the Crucial consumer business, including the sale of Crucial consumer-branded products at key retailers, e-tailers and distributors worldwide". Shipments will continue until the end of February 2026 - but after that, it's over as they will "continue to support the sale of Micron-branded enterprise products to commercial channel customers globally".</p>
<p>As for why? You probably guessed it - AI! From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage. Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments,” said Sumit Sadana, EVP and Chief Business Officer at Micron Technology. “Thanks to a passionate community of consumers, the Crucial brand has become synonymous with technical leadership, quality and reliability of leading-edge memory and storage products. We would like to thank our millions of customers, hundreds of partners and all of the Micron team members who have supported the Crucial journey for the last 29 years.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crucial did RAM and SSDs, so all of it will be going away from us lowly consumers.</p>

      <title>The response to s&amp;box from Facepunch going open source has been &#34;overwhelmingly positive&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Open source rocks so it's pleasing to see it go well for Facepunch with s&amp;box. They've now added native Linux binaries for the dedicated server and game client. If you missed the open source news be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sandbox-from-rust-developer-facepunch-is-now-open-source/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check the previous GamingOnLinux article</a>.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder on what s&amp;box is — "s&amp;box is a game creation platform built on the Source 2 engine and our spiritual successor to Garry's Mod. Play, create, and share games, explore community creations, and experience endless sandbox fun with powerful modern tools."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4012086421764779748gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Speaking in a fresh <a href="https://sbox.game/news/update-25-12-03" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update blog post</a> the developers noted the response has been pretty awesome. From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="open-source-response">Open Source Response</h4>
<p>The response to us going open source has been overwhelmingly positive, in a week we've received <strong>over 3000 stars </strong>and<strong> over 80 pull requests </strong>and 30 already merged.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone for contributing and being interested in the project, the pull requests have been great so far from small bug fixes to proper features. It's giving us a lot more momentum.<br/>
<br/>
We've been refining the repo sync workflows, GitHub actions now run formatting and unit tests on PRs, so any older PRs will need to update their branch to pass these tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In regards to Linux that also got a mention:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Open Source: Linux Binaries</h4>
<p>I've added native Linux binaries to the open source repo for enthusiasts to play around with, these are for the dedicated server and game client only. Source 2 tools don't compile for Linux.</p>
<p>These are not shipped on Steam as they're not usable yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be interesting to see if any proper Linux support expands from this. Fun to see though, and since it's open source anyone can try and do anything with it thanks to the permissive MIT license (<a href="http://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-public" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>). But for now on Steam, you'll still need to run it with Valve's Proton compatibility layer. The game / game editor also isn't technically even released yet, it's still in developer preview while they build it up towards a proper Steam release.</p>
<p>More developers should do open source!</p>

      <title>Survivor-like bullet heavens are going first-person POSTAL with POSTAL: Bullet Paradise</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to go POSTAL once more? This time it's in a survivor-like bullet-heaven styled setting, because obviously every developer needs to be in this genre now. Not that I am complaining, it actually reminds me of the time it felt like everyone was attempting some sort of Battle Royale.</p>
<p>Here you get to suit up and cause some chaos as one of 11 playable POSTAL Dudes from different timelines. Each with their own starting loadout and perks as you blast through hordes of enemies. And, because it's a survivor-like, you will get cards thrown at you to pick upgrades to evolve your POSTAL Dude during a run.</p>
<p>It will be playable entirely solo but you will also be able to team up in online co-op with four players max. Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="GXaJ-MDVPms"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6246b83f9891d4eed5dd51cc82cfcc52.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/GXaJ-MDVPms" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release: “POSTAL: Bullet Paradise is all about releasing the essence of POSTAL and its signature gallows humor into an over-the-top and highly replayable package,” said Artem Korovkin, CEO, Goonswarm Games. “Equal parts irreverent and action-packed, we’re thrilled to partner with Running With Scissors to bring this dystopian slice of Paradise to life.”</p>
<p>“No way in Hell Mike J is going to Heaven,” laughed Running With Scissors founder Vince Desi. “But he’s definitely gunning for POSTAL: Bullet Paradise next year.”</p>
<p>According to the press release it will have Linux, macOS and Windows support at release in Q3 2026 and will be priced at $19.99.</p>

      <title>No Players Online returns after an &#39;unfounded DMCA claim&#39; halted sales for nearly three weeks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Showing yet again that the DMCA system is not fit for purpose, No Players Online launched on Steam on November 6 and then got taken down but it's back.</p>
<p>What is it? <!-- squire -->No Players Online is an expanded now-commercial remake of the free 2019 cult-hit that's still up on <a href="https://papercookies.itch.io/no-players-online-classic" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. The story goes: buried among the files on the computer is a broken multiplayer shooter that seems to have been left running for years. As you progress, you will be pulled further and further into the rotting digital world that will twist your curiosity into an obsession as new secrets about the world behind the screen are revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1805232181764776997gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>What happened? After launching on November 6th, sometime around November 13th the game was abruptly hidden on Steam. Turns out, a "former friend" of the developers sent Valve a DMCA notice. Thankfully, the situation has been sorted and the game has returned but the damage to their launch has been done.</p>
<p>Their <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>recently, No Players Online was removed from steam for nearly 3 weeks right after launch following a DMCA claim made by a former friend. they claimed to be a co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it. NPO was made completely from scratch by our team.</p>
<p>despite trying to clarify to them the past couple months that their allegations were completely unfounded, they recklessly filed the DMCA to steam without any notice, and the game was taken down on november 13th. we immediately filed a counter-notice, and today the game has been reinstated after the time for them to respond has passed.</p>
<p>we spent 2 and a half years of our lives and a ton of money making this game. we also have a lot of people who believed in us and wanted us to succeed. it’s crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form, and it’s been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone i considered a dear friend.</p>
<p>we sincerely apologize to everyone who was unable to purchase or access the game during the past few weeks. this situation has had a significant impact on us, especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us. we lost out on much needed momentum and revenue right after the release of our game and we’re unsure if we will be able to recover financially from this given our already thin margins.</p>
<p>we are committed to doing all that we have planned still for No Players Online, but at this point we are unsure about the future of our studio. any visibility on our game at this point would be crucial, so if you want to support a little indie studio please leave a review on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">steam</a> and share the game to the internet. &lt;3</p>
<p>much love,<br/>
adam pype, the beeswax team and black lantern collective.</p>

      <title>HELLDIVERS 2 file-size on Steam gets massively reduced</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One problem with a lot of modern games is just how big they're getting, but HELLDIVERS 2 is about to massively shrink thanks to work behind the scenes. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam the developers at Arrowhead Game Studios noted they pulled in Nixxes to help get it sorted.</p>
<p>They were making small changes across a few patches, but now the big stuff is here and you can try it out in a Steam Beta via the "prod_slim" branch. Right click the game, go to Properties -&gt; Beta and select "prod_slim" from the drop-down box. The result should be a reduction in installation size from "~154GB to ~23GB". What an insane difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16513124621764772857gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>How did they do this? By "completely de-duplicating our data". They didn't do it before as they were worried about loading times for players who still have a traditional spinning HDD instead of an SSD. Something they spoke about in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">previous news post</a> to explain it a little more. But as it turns out, the difference is only a few seconds.</p>
<p>This will become the default for everyone once they've gone through feedback from the Beta to allow time for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>A big new update also just rolled out with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621274" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Into the Unjust: 5.0.0</a> that brought with it the fun new premium warbond that has a minigun along with lots of improvements to the game overall.</p>

      <title>There&#39;s now an AI warning notice browser plugin for itch.io as well as Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developer behind the useful <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/the-useful-ai-warning-for-steam-script-has-been-turned-into-a-proper-browser-extension/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AI notice browser plugin for Steam</a> has now done the same for <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>, and they've made it easier to use the extensions.</p>
<p>In an email to GamingOnLinux they mentioned the itch.io version is available as a native extension for Firefox and Chrome, or as a userscript if you prefer. On itch.io developers do have to tag their games as using AI <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/itchio-store-now-requires-ai-generated-content-disclosures-for-assets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since November 2024</a>, but it appears there's no actual notice on game pages at all, not even in the "More information" bit you can expand. <em>There is a specific category for AI games with a huge 26,328 tagged.</em></p>
<p>So hopefully this plugin will help any of you that shop across itch.io too. Here's how it looks which is very similar to the Steam version:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5528752571764771859gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Now you can't miss it.</p>
<p>The developer also mentioned "Both extensions can now be installed natively in Firefox for Android. This was already possible with the userscript version, but now it's easier". And, additionally, you can even add it directly into the Steam client using <a href="https://steambrew.app/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Millennium</a> and <a href="https://steambrew.app/plugin?id=788ed8554492" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Extendium</a> although it's not supported and not exactly clear if it's against Steam's rules.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">You can find it via for itch.io:</p>

      <title>Valve have been funding FEX to get x86 games on Arm Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It turns out that not only are Valve using the open source <a href="https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">FEX</a> for the Steam Frame but they have been funding FEX since the beginning of it.</p>
<p>What exactly is FEX? FEX allows you to run x86 applications on ARM64 Linux devices, similar to qemu-user and box64. It offers broad compatibility with both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries, and it can be used alongside Wine/Proton to play Windows games.</p>
<p>Recently, the FEX lead Ryan Houdek wrote a 7 year anniversary <a href="https://fex-emu.com/FEXiversary/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> where in it they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey everyone! In light of the recent product announcements using FEX, I wanted to take a moment to celebrate our anniversary! On this day seven years ago (28th Nov 2018), I landed the first commit in the prototype project that would eventually become FEX-Emu! I want to thank the people from Valve for being here from the start and allowing me to kickstart this project. They trusted me with the responsibility of designing and frameworking the project in a way that it can work long-term; not only for their use cases but also keeping it an open project that anyone can adapt for their own use cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense with the Steam Frame, since it will be using a Snapdragon processor - Valve needed a way to get traditional games and apps to work on it and not just those designed for it. Much like how Proton made sure the Steam Deck was a success and has <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/linux-players-on-steam-hit-an-all-time-high-for-november-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pushed Linux overall to new heights</a>, FEX should hopefully do the same for the Steam Frame and any other future hardware using Arm.</p>
<p>Unlike Proton though, which was based on the existing Wine project with some extras they also fund like DXVK and VKD3D-Proton, Valve was there for the formation of FEX.</p>
<p>In a fresh interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/820656/valve-interview-arm-gaming-steamos-pierre-loup-griffais" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais confirmed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton is also something where you could say we started it, but because it’s a derivative of Wine, it’s less clear-cut. Whereas Fex, we were talking with a few developers that we knew were the right fit for an undertaking like that, a long-term thing that needed a very specific set of experts. We worked hard on trying to convince these guys to start the project, and have been funding them ever since.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't go expecting a Steam Phone any time soon though it sounds like they're happy with living room, handheld, and desktop. But, since FEX is open source people are already using it to get Windows games running on phones.</p>
<p>It's all about giving options and removing barriers, so that you will hopefully eventually get the same experience across x86 and Arm for gaming thanks to the likes of Proton, FEX and other open source projects that Valve fund. We all benefit from it thanks to it all being open source.</p>

      <title>Half-Life Legacy arrives December 12 but you&#39;ll need Proton on Linux due to Native Linux issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life Legacy is an enhanced fan mod of Valve's original shooter and it's releasing December 12th. The developers claim it is the "ultimate restoration for the legendary title". It comes with full controller support, achievements, speedrunning, dynamic weapon lighting, Steam Workshop support, Rich Presence for Steam &amp; Discord and much more.</p>
<p>The developers noted they've been trying to sort out a Native Linux version, but they've been facing some problems with it. As <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/3619040/announcements/detail/538871739033060374" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also have important news to share regarding the <strong>Linux</strong> version of the game. Due to unforeseen circumstances, we have been unable to port <em>Half-Life Legacy </em>to Linux, unlike <em>Cross Product.</em></p>
<p>Linux is a platform we've been targeting since late 2020 and one of the major reasons keeping us on it is Steam Deck playability. Sadly, due to a very strange issue we have spent many hours of our time diagnosing, we cannot release <em>Half-Life Legacy </em>with native Linux support. Despite this, the game has been tested via Proton on Linux Mint and Steam Deck (Steam OS) where it works with no major issues, so for now, Steam Play saves the day.</p>
<p>We will add native Linux support as soon as we can but this issue is not easy to solve. If you're confident with vague debugger errors and complicated issues, feel free to reach out to us via our Discord or a comment on this post, but I do warn you - it's not easy.</p>

      <title>Fedora Linux 44 will get improved NTSYNC enabling for Proton / Wine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NTSYNC has been available in the Linux kernel for a while, but it's taking distributions a while to actually use it - Fedora Linux 44 will make it easier.</p>
<p>What is NTSYNC? Arriving with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/linux-kernel-6-14-out-late-due-to-pure-incompetence-dont-get-too-excited-about-linux-gaming-boosts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux kernel 6.14</a> the aim of it was mainly to help accuracy and performance for NT synchronization primitives when translating between Windows apps / games and Linux with Proton / Wine. As an eventual full and better replacement for the likes of esync and fsync. For plain Wine, it will be quite a nice boost - but Proton won't see too much of a difference in most things.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/NTSYNC-Contained" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new change</a> proposal has now been <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/3510" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">accepted</a> for Fedora Linux 44 that will enable it when it detects specific packages being used - notably Wine and Steam (for Proton). NTSync has been available in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/wine-10-16-released-with-fast-synchronization-support-using-ntsync/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wine since version 10.16</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will give gamers on Fedora a better overall experience with the likes of Wine.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA Beta driver 590.44.01 released for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The first release of the 590 driver branch has arrived in Beta for Linux with 590.44.01 now available for those willing to give it a test. For those of you with an NVIDIA GPU that need the most stable experience, you should probably stick with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/nvidia-driver-580-105-08-out-now-for-linux-as-the-new-recommended-version/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">driver 580.105.08 from early November</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full changelog provided by NVIDIA:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Raised the minimum supported Wayland version to 1.20.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented the PowerMizer preferred mode dropdown menu in the nvidia-settings control panel from functioning correctly on Wayland.</li>
<li>Raised the minimum supported glibc version to 2.27.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of recreating Vulkan swapchains. This helps prevent stuttering when resizing Vulkan application windows.</li>
<li>Raised the minimum supported X.Org xserver version to 1.17 (video driver ABI version 19).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the Dots Per Inch (DPI) to be incorrectly reported for some monitors such as the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9.</li>
<li>Fixed several problems that prevented Vulkan applications from working on Venus VirtIO virtual GPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause system freezes on PREEMPT_RT kernels.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/details/258761/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a></p>
<p>Does this Beta driver have a fix you've been waiting on? If not, what are you waiting on?</p>
<p><strong>Update 03/12/25 10:31 UTC</strong> - NVIDIA have updated their website so that Maxwell, Pascal and Volta are no longer listed in the Supported Products page for this driver. When the Beta initially released they were still listing them but <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/nvidia-confirm-upcoming-driver-will-be-the-last-for-maxwell-pascal-and-volta/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as they previously announced</a> they're no longer supported in the 590+ series.</p>

      <title>Pixel-art RTS game TFC: The Fertile Crescent joins with MicroProse Software and it&#39;s now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Now freshly Steam Deck Verified and with MicroProse Software backing it as publisher, TFC: The Fertile Crescent has a big upgrade out now. A pretty sweet real-time strategy game that's like a pixel-art version of Age of Empires, with an interesting food mechanic that will challenge even veterans of the genre.</p>
<p>Great to see the developer has pulled in some more support for this overlooked gem. Thanks to the new partnership update 1.3 brings translations for the game into German, French, Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Portugese (Brazil), Russian, Simplified Chinese and Spanish. On top of that the last bit needed (on-screen keyboard) was sorted to enable it to get Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>See the new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s version of Android on Linux (based on Waydroid) is now called Lepton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lepton appears to be the new official name for Valve's version of Waydroid (Android in a Linux container).</p>
<p>We still don't have a whole lot of details about how this is all going to work, outside of Lepton enabling Android APKs for developers on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Steam Frame VR kit</a>, but it's now that little bit more official with a proper name and even a logo.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2808312871764672482gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>An interesting looking frog there. No doubt an in-joke from a certain Linux developer Discord server. As for the name, it seems to fit in quite well with the other compatibility layer Proton for Windows games on Linux. Seems Valve are keeping to a similar theme with their naming there.</p>
<p>Courtesy of SteamDB there's a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3029110/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">main page</a> and a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3056000/info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">development version</a> with both actually having (rather blank) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251202053950/https://store.steampowered.com/app/3029110/Lepton/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam pages</a>. I imagine the Steam pages will probably be hidden soon, just like Proton doesn't have an actual Steam page I doubt this will either.</p>
<p>We also saw that recently Valve added <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamworks-sdk-adds-support-for-linux-arm-and-android-and-it-seems-we-know-the-first-android-game-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support for Linux Arm and Android to the Steamworks SDK</a>.</p>
<p>It's definitely going to be fun to see what kinds of developers get on board with the Steam Frame, and perhaps even more exciting if we can get Lepton running directly on Desktop Linux and other SteamOS machines too. I don't really expect Valve to have it locked to the Steam Frame - but we don't know yet.</p>

      <title>Linux players on Steam hit an all-time high for November 2025</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve released the statistics from the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for November 2025, which shows once again that Linux use is trending nicely upwards.</p>
<p>Slow and steady wins the race? Thanks in part due to all of Valve's work with SteamOS and Proton, and thanks to Microsoft forcing AI rubbish in Windows - more people are checking Linux out than ever before.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For November 2025 the overall operating system share is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows - 94.79%</li>
<li>Linux - 3.20%</li>
<li>macOS - 2.02%</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker</a> is up to date for the Linux overall trend, as well as our newer distribution chart as well. Here's a snapshot from it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2143213141764660986gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2143213141764660986gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">For the breakdown of popular Linux distributions on Steam here's November's details:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 26.42% -0.76%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.97% -0.35%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.2 64 bit 7.36% +0.71%</li>
<li>CachyOS 64 bit 6.74% +0.73%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 25.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.96% +1.67%</li>
<li>Bazzite 64 bit 5.53% +1.29%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.29% -0.26%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS 64 bit 3.86% +0.16%</li>
<li>EndeavourOS Linux 64 bit 2.10% -0.22%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 1.96% -0.60%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 1.90% -0.03%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 1.90% -0.14%</li>
<li>Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie) 64 bit 1.58% +1.58%</li>
<li>
<p>Other 20.43% +2.39%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not entirely clear what Valve uses to sort the Linux list, as distributions seem to randomly flick in and out of it each month. Would be nice if we could just get a full list each month. The order has been all messed up for a few months too across various parts of the survey, hopefully Valve will eventually fix that.</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 48: Byzantine Labyrinthine</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-47-before-i-was-born/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Part 47: Before I Was Born</a></strong></p>
<p>In my formative years it was accepted by most that the point and click adventure game was a dead genre. Sure, a handful were still being made, but more often than not these remained nostalgic takes hearkening back to the true heyday of the genre. Most devotees would instead stick to their old favourites, even in the face of mounting incompatibility challenges. These were issues that The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. would attempt to solve, starting with <em>Inherit the Earth</em> and <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em>.</p>
<p>First released for Linux in December 2004, both games were retooled to use the Simple DirectMedia Layer, but were otherwise kept as faithful ports of the originals for good or ill. For the <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> some audio improvements were made, but the only new addition was the "breadcrumbs" navigation feature that I never felt the need to use. Being built around the multimedia capabilities offered by the arrival of CD-ROM, <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> from 1993 is an arthouse first and a game second.</p>
<p>You can even play the game from the CD-ROM itself rather than installing it to your hard drive, although in either case I found I had to preload the libSDL-1.2.so.0 library included in the "common/lib" directory on the disc for it to launch. From here you are thrown straight into the game, with little chance to get your bearings. Vital tools I found for navigating the world included using the tab key to highlight interactable items as well as using the right mouse button to open your inventory screen.</p>
<p>With its age in mind I always figured I would need to consult a walkthrough, but I still gave the game an honest attempt at first; wandering through the hotel, mapping the mirror maze, and even reaching the ghost town of Revolver Springs before giving in. In the end it was the inscrutable user interface that foiled my progress, as while I did discover the drawer in the town jail which contained the brass key I required, the opened drawer then needed to be examined further to reveal the key inside.</p>
<p>The taboo of consulting the Adventurer's Guide now broken, I just went ahead and allowed it to lead me the rest of the way. The puzzles in the game are a means to an end, with the primary focus being to show off the 3D scenes and art assets created by Bradley W. Schenck. Playing <em>Freaks!</em> did show that I have an appreciation for exploring anachronistic worlds, but with only fixed images being used here to represent the four cardinal directions of any given space, I did find this harder to enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12242328631764659696gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12242328631764659696gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3581957381764659695gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3581957381764659695gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>I have had some success coming back to old adventure games many years after using a walkthrough, and relying on my hazy memories to then solve them in a more organic fashion instead. Perhaps that will also be the case here, but <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> does play enough nasty tricks to make this seem a false hope. There are three separate instances where the game can be left unbeatable if you use a puzzle item too early, or if you fail to acquire a certain item before proceeding elsewhere.</p>
<p>One of these items is even hidden behind a door in such a way as to almost ensure you will miss it, with the significance of the item not being signposted in any conspicuous way. This lack of connective tissue is a real hurdle, and is the main Achilles heel of the game. While not exactly suffering from the "moon logic" that plagued so much of the genre, <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> lacks a driving purpose after Daedalus sends you on your way, with puzzle solutions holding little relation to their point of origin.</p>
<p>Keys are distributed at random, pulling levers will cause inexplicable events to happen elsewhere in the world, and your actions appear aimless without context clues to guide you; one event wherein the subway car becomes flattened even failed to happen to me as described. There are exceptions, including a clever conceit where you take advantage of the fact you have been taken outside the flow of time to alter historical events, but these highlights do little to overcome your initial bafflement.</p>
<p>None of this is helped by the smug presumption of the original developers, with them glorifying themselves in the backstory and teasing a sequel at the end. I think the game would have been better served if it was broken into discrete hubs, with more focus on the individual areas, and with the narrative being spread beyond just a handful of infodumps in a few key places. In the same vein is the soundtrack, with the music drilled into your head on an endless loop rather divided to accentuate specific spaces.</p>
<p>Much of <em>The Labyrinth of Time</em> is just straight up mazes, only serving to underline the importance of the map screen; even with this aid I still failed to comprehend the surreal maze I blundered through right before the end. The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. did have plans to craft its own sequels, but have done little beside updating their initial ports for sale on digital storefronts since. The adventure genre would later advance through both ScummVM and the Indie game revival, but the timing was not right.</p>

      <title>Hytale devs confirm they are working to bring it to Linux and macOS</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the revival of Hytale ongoing towards an Early Access release in January, we now have it confirmed that it will be coming officially to Linux and macOS.</p>
<p>Previously it was a case of them being "attempted" but a new <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-hardware-requirements" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> today gives us a much more firm statement with the developers saying "We are actively working to bring Hytale to Linux and Mac as soon as possible". That's great to see - official support! Hopefully it goes well.</p>
<p>As for the Steam Deck they said they don't have the ability to test it right now, and it won't be coming to Steam until "we determine our ability to comply with Steam's policies". Thankfully for the Steam Deck and other SteamOS machines, running third-party stores and software is quite easy as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a bunch of our guides will show you</a>.</p>
<p>The blog post also goes into quite a lot of detail on the suggested system requirements for it. For the requirements it will be harder on your system for single-player, as it will run both the client and server it needs. This is what they're recommending at least for 1080p:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (or equivalent)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16 GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrated:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Intel Iris Xe Graphics</li>
<li>AMD Radeon 660M</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dedicated:</strong>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA GTX 900 Series</li>
<li>AMD Radeon 400 Series</li>
<li>Intel Arc A-Series</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deprecation notice:</strong> Support for Vulkan 1.3 will be required in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong> SSD with 20 GB of free space</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> 8 Mbit/s connection for multiplayer (UDP/QUIC compatible)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a lot more to it, I do suggest reading the full post.</p>
<p>Some previous full gameplay videos can be seen below if you missed them. Keeping in mind they are a heavy work in progress, the game isn't close to being finished after all the delays, cancellation and revival.</p>

      <title>GOG add the huge S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. as a one-click mod install</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. G.A.M.M.A. is a big mod for the already big standalone experience of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly and now easier to install thanks to <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>It's all getting a bit <em>complicated</em> in the Stalker world now so if you're a wee bit confused (I was) here's the basics: Anomaly is a standalone game <em>based on</em> the original series. It blurs the line between mod and fan game. <a href="https://www.stalkergamma.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Gamma</a> (Gigantic Automated Modular Modpack for Anomaly) expands it even further but it can be tricky to install it all together where it works nicely. It's all free and now you can get it together in one neat package.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16390287861764608207gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the Gamma website:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>A Zone That Evolves With You</h4>
<div class="section-content" data-astro-cid-j7pv25f6="" data-node-id="147:101">
<p>GAMMA adapts S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Anomaly into a longer-form, higher-stakes experience. It encourages cautious exploration, smart inventory management, and tactical engagements across a world that's as deadly as it is dynamic.</p>
<p>With multiple difficulty presets, faction options, and curated progression paths, every run feels different yet always true to the heart of the Zone.</p>
<p>Thanks to its modular nature, every aspect that you want to change in G.A.M.M.A. can be easily tweaked in-game through the Mod Config Menu (MCM) or through ticking and unticking individual mods in the Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) instance it is based on. An entire discord community is ready to help you fine-tune the experience to your liking.</p>
<h4>Community-Built. Curated with Care.</h4>
<p>This isn't just a modpack, it's the result of thousands of hours of refinement and specific mods development from passionate fans. Designed to be stable, lore-respectful, and challenging, GAMMA is regularly updated and supported via dedicated Discord channels and install tools.</p>
<p>Anomaly was just the beginning. GAMMA is the test of your true stalker instincts.</p>

      <title>A retro Acorn RISC OS gem returns with Exodus: The Colonization of Space now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A bit of gaming history returns to modern platforms with the release of Exodus: The Colonization of Space now available on Steam. Originally released all the way back in 1997 for Acorn RISC OS computers (an old British company), a name I've not heard in a long time - I'm sure we had an Acorn computer in my original primary school class.</p>
<p>Created by then-developer Artex Software as their first commcerial game, the founders of it would go onto creating Deck13, a name more of you may be familiar with as the developers of The Surge and Lords of the Fallen. Artex have now returned too but as a publisher and Exodus: The Colonization of Space is just a little retro treat<em>.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vZGP1Ld8u4c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e4c52917bd4475c0586cb03129ded6a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vZGP1Ld8u4c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pixely 256-color game focuses on founding a new civilization in space after earth was abandoned. The players colonize planets, deal with (or fight against) up to 14 computer opponents. They build up the surface of their planets, make laws for their people, trade with neighboring planets and fend off mean space pirates. There are turn-based battles, a science tree, and endless possibilities to build a pixel galaxy… or fail trying.</p>
<p>Exodus is a true retro game but has been brought into the 21st century with over 60 gameplay improvements and features like autosave and keyboard shortcuts. As it was originally released on the Acorn Archimedes, few retro gamers have ever played this little gem… Now is your chance!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The re-release arrives with Native Linux support too.</p>

      <title>Arch-based distro EndeavourOS gets a new Ganymede release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of the best ways to try out a form of Arch Linux, the popular <a href="https://endeavouros.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EndeavourOS</a> has a new release with Ganymede out now. Being careful with my wording not to attract the pitchforks from the pure Arch Linux crowd, EndeavourOS is <em>mostly</em> Arch Linux but with a simple to use installer and some packaging tweaks to make getting up and running simple with it.</p>
<p>So all the fresh upgrades you get from Arch Linux, wrapped up in an easy to use package. Now and then they release a big refresh of their ISO downloads, which bring various tweaks and now after some time waiting - their latest release Ganymede has officially arrived.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2906056391764602175gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2906056391764602175gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - EndeavourOS Ganymede</em></p>
<p>The live environment to play around with it and install it comes with:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Calamares 25.11.1.9-1</li>
<li>Firefox 145.0.1-1</li>
<li>Linux 6.17.8.arch1-1</li>
<li>Mesa 1:25.2.7-1</li>
<li>xorg-server 21.1.20-1 (xorg)</li>
<li>Nvidia-utils 580.105.08-4</li>
<li>KDE Plasma 6.5.3</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://endeavouros.com/news/the-long-wait-is-over-ganymede-has-arrived/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they say it has significantly improved support for NVIDIA GPUs.</p>

      <title>Here&#39;s the 50 most popular Steam Deck games for November 2025 - with Dispatch the winner</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's a fresh month and that means we can take a look and see what's been popular for players on Valve's SteamOS powered handheld the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>A good chance to see not just what's popular, but also some ideas perhaps on what to pick up for your next game. Like November 2025's number 1 - Dispatch, which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/i-have-finished-dispatch-and-now-im-at-a-loss-so-im-going-to-play-it-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I also thought was pretty amazing</a>. ARC Raiders is a new one this time, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which can run on Steam Deck</a> but you might find it's a bit unstable (and doesn't look very good). Another new entry is Where Winds Meet which <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/where-winds-meet-devs-plan-improved-steam-deck-support/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">should be getting some Steam Deck optimisations</a> too.</p>

      <title>Raspberry Pi prices are rising due to RAM costs, plus a new 1GB Raspberry Pi 5 now available</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With RAM costs spiralling upwards right now, we're going to see increases to the pricing of lots of hardware - and now it's hit Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/1gb-raspberry-pi-5-now-available-at-45-and-memory-driven-price-rises/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> from the Raspberry Pi team, to help soften the blow a new 1GB Raspberry Pi 5 was revealed at $45 / ~£43.20. For the prices that are increasing here's what they sent along:</p>
<table class="table-stripes-tbody">
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>Product</strong></td>
<td><strong>Density</strong></td>
<td><strong>Old price</strong></td>
<td><strong>New price</strong></td>

<tbody>
<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>They said the 16GB variant of the Compute Module 5 has also gone up by $20. However older lower-density Raspberry Pi models remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Right now the hardware industry just sucks for consumers in terms of pricing. A lot of it thanks to many companies increasing their AI workloads, sucking up all the hardware availability. You've likely seen some reports elsewhere on how 64GB of RAM is often now more expensive than an entire PlayStation 5. I checked that today and - yep, insanity. Lots of RAM completely out of stock, lots of them suggesting delivery would be in <em>multiple</em> months time.</p>

      <title>KDE Connect security advisory released due to possible authentication bypass</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Connect is a popular cross-platform app that allows you to send files across devices and more - with a security advisory being sent out due to a woops. Noted as CVE-2025-66270, that woops could allow an attacker to entirely skip proper authentication.</p>
<p>An overview of the issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Versions of KDE Connect released after March 2025 implement version 8 of the KDE Connect protocol. In this version, the discovery of other devices with KDE Connect on your network involves an additional packet exchange between the two devices. While the first packet is used to determine if a device is paired or not, this additional packet is used to identify the device that is connecting.</p>
<p>The vulnerable implementations of KDE Connect were not checking that the device ID in the first packet and the device ID in the second packet were the same. This could be abused by first sending a device ID of an unpaired device which doesn't require authentication, followed by sending the device ID of a paired device in order to impersonate it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vulnerable versions they list are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>KDE Connect desktop &gt;= 25.04 and &lt; 25.12</li>
<li>KDE Connect iOS &gt;= v0.5.2 and &lt; 0.5.4</li>
<li>KDE Connect Android &gt;= v1.33.0 and &lt; 1.34.4</li>
<li>GSConnect &gt;= 59 and &lt; 68</li>
<li>Valent &gt;= v1.0.0.alpha.47 and &lt; v1.0.0.alpha.49</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The KDE developers are suggesting you stop using KDE Connect until your Linux distribution releases an update for it, or to manually patch it yourself if you're able to.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This looks absolutely wonderful! A puzzle platformer that takes things quite literally with you running, jumping and building your path from puzzle pieces. </p>
<p>Made by developer Neon Polygons with the open source cross-platform <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, it has a Native Linux demo available on Steam for you to try. I'm surprised I didn't spot this one until now, so perhaps you missed it too. There's just too many good games releasing and being teased all the time.</p>
<p>Have a little look at the demo trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ETp1hEq12Ks"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/16ebdabb3ceaf4c478277bedc1520cf9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ETp1hEq12Ks" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>

<p><em>A little confusing though, since there's also the game also called Piece by Piece coming from Gamkat / No More Robots. So one of them might want to change their name…</em></p>

      <title>UZDoom the successor to GZDoom has a first proper release out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What will now be the main modern feature centric port for all Doom engine games, UZDoom has a first proper release out to take over from GZDoom. If you're confused on what happened with GZDoom - be sure to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read the previous GamingOnLinux article</a> covering the drama.</p>
<p>For people making mod packs and standalone games, UZDoom is probably what you want to be using going forwards. This small release is to get the ball rolling, while bigger changes are queued up for UZDoom 5 that will come later.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17807159551764586566gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Doom 2 with UZDoom</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Changes from GZDoom 4.14.2 from the <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=81099" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Multiple security fixes. <strong>This update is being deemed as critical.</strong> It’s highly recommended to upgrade to it.</li>
<li>Anisotropic filtering is now disabled on Intel GPU devices if the texture filtering mode is set to any of the None options. This is to prevent texture filtering from being forced on when anisotropic filtering is enabled.</li>
<li>Added new game-based cursors (courtesy of Nash Muhandes and Xaser). These are much more cursor-y, and very good at pointing and clicking on things.</li>
<li>Changed defaults to be more balanced between vanilla and modern.</li>
<li>Lowered the master volume so it's less likely to blow out the system audio and become muffled (especially with things like the Plasma Rifle firing sound).</li>
<li>Added the Default option for automap colors, allowing the automap to choose based on which game is being played.</li>
<li>Added a Display option to control the render style of rocket explosions (these now default to additive instead of translucent since we felt it visually fit the other projectiles better).</li>
<li>Made the mouse less sensitive in menus when it’s been dormant for a short period. This should help reduce it accidentally shifting the selected option randomly while idle.</li>
<li>Added the <em>powerup_fade_scalar</em> cvar for controlling the strength of the fade on power ups (e.g. the Radiation Suit’s green tint).</li>
<li>Added support for the <strong>BUSY</strong> script flag for ACS.</li>
<li>Fixed audio not muting properly when the game is unfocused, causing it to build up and play back explosively in certain cases (especially for multiplayer games).</li>
<li>Fixed the master volume not properly applying to music when the game starts up.</li>
<li>Fixed weapon bobbing not disabling correctly when manually set to 0 via cvar.</li>
<li>Fixed the wrong music being played during Strife’s bad endings.</li>
<li>Fixed the opening subtitle for Strife not displaying.</li>
<li>Fixed the Iron Lich’s whirlwind blaming the wrong target for its damage dealt.</li>
<li>Fixed the textured automap being broken.</li>
<li>Fixed mid textures clipping incorrectly when skewed.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash with VisualThinkers when loading from a save.</li>
<li>Fixed IQM models with decoupled animations not displaying correctly if spawned without an animation.</li>
<li>Fixed gun flashes from MBF21 weapons not displaying correctly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with <strong>CreateTossable</strong> where items wouldn’t be removed if their amount was 0.</li>
<li>Fixed Quat’s <strong>Conjugate</strong> and <strong>Inverse</strong> functions throwing a JIT error.</li>
<li>Fixed the BrokenLines class being unserializable.</li>
<li>Fixed level data fields e.g. Sector not being cleared properly when transitioning between levels.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Core Keeper set for a massive update in January with a new boss, automation, new weapons and lots more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This might be the most exciting update for Core Keeper yet bringing in loads of new tools and a big boss battle to the mining sandbox adventure. <em>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</em></p>
<p>You'll be able to jump in when update releases on January 28th, when it also arrives on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>What's in it? A ridiculous amount by the sounds of it. They're not giving out exactly what, we'll have to wait for the patch notes at release day. Some of what they explained includes a whole new Beyond the Passage biome with a huge boss battle and brand new automation systems. Since there's new enemies, you also get new tools including: miniguns, mortars, grenades, remote detonators and even a flamethrower.</p>
<p>Loads more too so check out the new trailer:</p>

      <title>Hytale arrives in Early Access in January 2026 after being revived</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being cancelled by Riot Games and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/hytale-has-been-saved-as-hypixel-acquired-it-from-riot-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revived as an indie game again</a>, Hytale is now set for an Early Access launch in January 2026. Pre-purchasing will open December 13th, with it going live January 13th.</p>
<p>No doubt many are excited about this since it had a lot of followers watching it in previous years, thanks to its blend of a sort-of Minecraft style but more of a proper RPG. So a bit like Minecraft and Skyrim combined you might say.</p>
<p>In a fresh <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer makes it clear this will be a very real <em>early</em> access, not like a lot of the early access styled stuff we see on Steam where the game is nearly finished. This will be "very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while" and they expect the "first impression will be rough". Still, it's going to be nice to finally see it out, and with the creators actually in full control.</p>
<p>Just over a week ago they also put up a nice long slice of gameplay too:</p>

      <title>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault has another patch for Steam Deck and to improve performance for all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault from Digital Sun and 11 bit studios should run a whole lot smoother for everyone now, and feel better on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-enters-early-access-and-work-is-ongoing-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the last big patch</a>, another update has been rolled out that should be a pretty dramatic improvement to the feel of it overall. There's a fair bit more to the patch than just performance upgrades and tweak for Steam Deck but the highlights for you are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Big pass on stuttering. We’ve cleaned up a lot of unused or unnecessary data throughout the game. You should now see way less stuttering, and in many cases, virtually none at all.</li>
<li>Controls, performance, and menus are more Deck-friendly now, ie, Settings and Difficulty selection screen being easier to read and navigate.</li>
<li>Default Steam Deck graphics settings now use FSR3 – Quality instead of Balanced, for a sharper, more stable look right from the start.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again - it's great to see such dedicated support for Steam Deck / SteamOS. Always great to see, as a result it should run even better on Desktop Linux with Proton too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DMRITAHclXc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2ed951a1343c544b2277417c9e49c7c2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DMRITAHclXc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the Steam page: "Dive deep into Action-RPG with roguelike elements and a tale about new beginnings. With no coin to your name, you and the other townsfolk find yourselves stranded in the distant village of Tresna. Now, it’s up to you to get back on your feet and turn your humble shop into the beating heart of the village’s wealth. Explore dangerous dungeons, gather relics, sell them, and reinvest in your friends’ establishments. Unlock new weapons, armor, shop decorations, and—more importantly—restore hope that things can one day turn around."</p>

      <title>itch.io is hosting a creator day today where they take no fee from developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>On top of doing their own Black Friday sale, the indie store <a href="http://itch.io" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a> has its Creator Day today as well where they take no cut from developers. A nice chance to support a smaller store that does a fair amount of good for indies, along with supporting indies directly.</p>
<p>There's a whole lot of weird stuff on itch.io though including old demos, old alpha versions of games and more - it can be pretty difficult to find the good. So keeping that in mind I previously <a href="https://itch.io/c/1674813/best-linux-games" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">created a list</a> of some great Linux games you can find on the store. All the games in that special curated list have a Native Linux version too. There's over 160 games in my collection with a whole bunch more that I added in today for you.</p>
<p>Some quick highlights that are actually on a sale of some sort:</p>
<p><a href="https://itch.io/s/167286/black-friday-2025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Double Fine Productions Bundle</a><br/>
<em>Plenty of classics inside like Full Throttle Remastered</em></p>
<p><a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/dicey-dungeons" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dicey Dungeons</a> - 50% off<br/>
<em>Fast-paced dungeon crawling where dice rolls control the flow</em></p>
<p><a href="https://devolverdigital.itch.io/terra-nil" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Terra Nil</a> - 50% off<br/>
<em>Transforming a barren, lifeless landscape into a thriving, vibrant ecosystem</em></p>

      <title>Where Winds Meet devs plan improved Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Where Winds Meet continues to be a big hit on Steam and it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/the-big-new-where-winds-meet-release-works-well-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">works quite well on Desktop Linux</a> but it needs a lot of improvements on Valve's Steam Deck.</p>
<p>On Steam Deck even with various settings dropped down and upscaling, the performance in various parts is just not playable with drops down to 20FPS and at times below. Thankfully, for any fans of this free to play RPG, there's plans from the developer Everstone Studio to get things into better shape.</p>
<p>Writing in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3564740/view/606425106922604161" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> post on Steam dated November 23rd, the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the next two months, we will gradually roll out several updates, <strong>including Steam Deck compatibility</strong>, optimized multi-timezone display, split outfit customization, PS5 Pro support for PSSR, enhanced audio experience, and more. Our goal is to create a Jianghu that everyone can enjoy, and we welcome any further suggestions you may have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Emphasis ours</em></p>
<p>Hopefully we won't be waiting too long on that. And, hopefully they actually get it to perform to a reasonable level. Optimising for the lower-end helps players across all hardware! Oh, and if they could actually make the settings available before forcing you into the game that would be good too. That's a sin some developers still haven't stopped.</p>
<p>Currently, the game is rated Steam Deck Unsupported by Valve. No anti-cheat annoyances though, you can jump in just fine - we're tracking various games on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated Linux / SteamOS anti-cheat page</a>.</p>

      <title>Nightdive Studios present a Blood: Refreshed Supply deep dive in a new video</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to know more about the upcoming Blood: Refreshed Supply? You're in luck as we have a fresh developer video from Nightdive Studios. Arriving on December 4th, Blood: Refreshed Supply will become the actual true definitive edition of the game. The previous edition, Blood: Fresh Supply, is being removed from stores once this has released. You get 66.6% discount if you have the original.</p>
<p>Anyway - the deep dive. That's why you're here. The latest video features creators of the new Marrow and Death Wish episodes of Blood: Refreshed Supply, Dustin Twilley and Nick Palsmeier to talk about their experience creating the expansions and more behind the scenes work on the newer edition of the game.</p>
<p>Grab a coffee and watch below:</p>

      <title>SIDE EFFECTS is a disturbing pill-popping roulette game out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SIDE EFFECTS from developer Free Lives takes the idea of Buckshot Roulette and puts a brutal pill-popping spin on it. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>Playable in solo against the NPC AI, or online for <em>up to</em> 4 players it's all about chugging down pills and often just hoping for the best since you don't exactly know which way the pills will swing for you. Sounds just like real life in some ways when it comes to medical issues. Only here, it's not about hoping the medication cures you - it's each player trying not to die while you're all strapped in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10035363291764253507gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Based on rounds, with each beginning by giving you a set of tools to pick from and then dropping a bunch of pills on the table for you to take turns ingesting them. You have two different types of health bars in this one to keep an eye on and manage. There's your actual health, and a resistance meter that acts like armour with zero resistance meaning potentially certain death as it will drop one of your hearts.</p>
<p>While a lot of it is down to chance on the pills you take, there is a certain amount of strategy to it with the various tools you get. There's a sweet that let's you skip a turn, a hammer to smash a pill so no one can take it, a tool to detect what a pill will do and more. You even get an injection that will swap the effects of a pill, if you're feeling real lucky. You can even mess with other players using pliers now and then to pull out their teeth, dropping their resistance down - especially useful if you wish to focus on taking someone out. Bit gruesome though. </p>
<p>As the rounds go on, new pill types are introduced with different effects and so you have more and more that will potentially end your life.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yYk0ra-5qVg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dae2382c792678908f2d3ead8d62d920.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yYk0ra-5qVg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The online mode is the same just with more players available via matchmaking or joining via lobby codes. So it's nice to see both options available, especially if you don't always have people available to play with. And in my case, only one key was supplied so I had to test it out playing against randoms. Thankfully, the online mode does appear to work quite well to be able to. It's missing a bunch of options though like how it has <em>no</em> chat of any sort - so half the time you're waiting for the lobby to fill as players keep popping in and out.</p>
<p>SIDE EFFECTS can get pretty intense, especially when you're running low on health and other players have items that you know they're going to be saving for you. But I can't help the feeling like it's just missing something, it feels a bit too slow at times while you're waiting for your turn. This is one where I feel it's pretty much <em>essential</em> that you play it with people you know to get the full enjoyment out of it. </p>
<p>It's as disturbing as it is interesting as an experimental game of risk and works just fine with Proton 10 on Linux.</p>
<p>At £4.29 it's an interesting cheap choice to add to your list of games to play with friends.</p>

      <title>According to Epic CEO Tim Sweeney - game stores don&#39;t need an AI label as it will be everywhere</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the increasing amount of games using AI, Epic Game's Tim Sweeney believes the AI messages on stores like Steam make no sense.</p>
<p>Currently, if a game that's released on Steam uses generative AI in some way, it needs to be disclosed. Developers have to go through a content survey on their games to detail things like mature content and AI use. From Valve's own <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/contentsurvey" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">public rules</a> on it as a reminder first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your game used AI services during development or incorporates AI services as a part of the product, this section will require you to describe that implementation in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-Generated:</strong> Any kind of content (art/code/sound/etc) created with the help of AI tools during development. Under the Steam Distribution Agreement, you promise Valve that your game will not include illegal or infringing content, and that your game will be consistent with your marketing materials. In our prerelease review, we will evaluate the output of AI generated content in your game the same way we evaluate all non-AI content - including a check that your game meets those promises.</li>
<li><strong>Live-Generated:</strong> Any kind of content created with the help of AI tools while the game is running. In addition to following the same rules as Pre-Generated AI content, this comes with an additional requirement - in the Content Survey, you'll need to tell us what kind of guardrails you're putting on your AI to ensure it's not generating illegal content.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You've probably seen the notices buried at the bottom of Steam store pages, like this one for Stellaris from Paradox Interactive:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="The developers describe how their game uses AI Generated Content like this:  We employ generative AI technologies during the creation of some assets. Typically this involves the ideation of content and visual reference material. These elements represent a minor component of the overall development. AI has been used to generate voices for an AI antagonist and a player advisor. " src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6433609421764249514gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Which you can make much bigger and clearer so you don't miss them with a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/the-useful-ai-warning-for-steam-script-has-been-turned-into-a-proper-browser-extension/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">browser plugin covered here on GamingOnLinux recently</a>.</p>
<p>Jumping into the discussion now is Epic Game's CEO Tim Sweeney, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posting</a> a reply to someone on X (Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Initial Post: Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the “Made with AI” label.  It doesn’t matter any more., reply from Tim Sweeney: Agreed. The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production." src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14909659391764249647gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's no surprise that Sweeney is in favour of it, with games like Fortnite previously using AI like being able to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chat with Darth Vader</a>.</p>
<p>The situation with generative AI is evolving constantly, but even Sweeney here notes there are rights issues. To be more specific: a lot of the generative AI models used everywhere are trained on material without the permission of the original author of various works. There's been many lawsuits on it to the point that I don't think I need to rehash any of that here - they're all reported on constantly in depth elsewhere.</p>
<p>Even if it does end up everywhere, it's still a good thing to know <em>how</em> it's being used - isn't it? It's a discussion that swings wildly between camps. AI slop makers and people in favour of AI generation will naturally not want these types of notices and will fight against them, while the other side no doubt value seeing the notice to make more informed purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure - generative AI is complicating everything and companies are repeatedly enshittifying their products with generative AI, and it's going to continue on for some time.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the AI disclosures? Leave a comment.</p>

      <title>Cleared Hot is everything you could want in a modern twin-stick helicopter shooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cleared Hot just entered Early Access from developer Not Knowing Corporation and MicroProse Software, and it's simply pure joy to blast through it. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>The game is not yet finished, so any true review will have to wait until later. But clearly they're onto something great here. Especially great for me, since I grew up playing the likes of Desert Strike, Jungle Strike and others in the series. This definitely feels like a much more modernised version, bringing twin-stick helicopter action to everyone who loves a good action game like this. With the addition of the physics system, there's some pretty funny things you can do in it too.</p>
<p>I was already impressed by the demo they previously released, and now thanks to the Early Access release there's just a whole lot more of it to play. Right now there's the desert area, but they have plans to expand the game's campaign into multiple other biomes including a jungle, artic and urban environments will will be interesting to see how the gameplay changes and evolves across each.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8vVEHjc-vBk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a4d7b185992666fb334e4fecb1016372.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8vVEHjc-vBk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The physics system is the true highlight though, and one I hope they keep expanding as the game progresses during development. Being able to hook all sorts of random objects big and small, and throw them around to watch the chaos is just pure joy. Things get pretty messy in Cleared Hot, and it's the absurdity that the physics system brings that really makes it quite special and different to a few other attempts to modernise the classic helicopter combat games.</p>
<p>However, the physics system is a bit of a tease. Only certain types of objects can be picked up, I hope they adjust that to have more available. That, and the destruction system is great too, seeing towers and buildings crumble as you fire is great - but it needs more of that too as some don't at all.</p>
<p>Minor gripes aside, the atmosphere is fantastic. The audio is great, the voice over is fun and it all comes together quite nicely to really get you in the mood for flying.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Physics-Driven Mayhem</strong> - Everything moves, flies, and explodes with glorious realism - or at least plausible deniability.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Upgradeable Helicopters</strong> - Customize and upgrade your chopper to match your playstyle, from stealthy strikes to full-metal overkill.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Rope &amp; Magnet Gameplay</strong> - Pick up (almost) anything - vehicles, enemies, barrels, even your dignity - and weaponize the environment.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Tactical Squad Support</strong> - Deploy your troops, capture objectives, and provide covering fire - just try not to “accidentally” drop them.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Day &amp; Night Missions</strong> - Adapt to shifting light conditions using night vision or thermal optics to keep the advantage.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify"><strong>Creative Destruction</strong> - Physics means freedom - clear obstacles, sling debris, and improvise your way through every mission.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify">A few things are currently missing from it like cloud saves but they're working on it. That, and they have plans soonish to get it bumped up to Steam Deck Verified too as it's currently only listed as Playable, which is mainly due to some small text sizing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Unfortunately, there is one issue on Linux with Valve's official Proton. Some little video clips will <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-some-games-on-linux-steamos-steam-deck-have-broken-videos-and-what-you-can-do/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">give you a test screen instead of the video</a> which is the same issue I saw recently with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/sektori-is-absolutely-one-of-the-best-modern-twin-stick-shooters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sektori</a>. A common codec issue that the developer will need to solve, but until then you can <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">use GE-Proton</a> to get the game working fully. I've given feedback to the developer on this. Apart from that, all fine with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It only arrived on November 20th and already has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam. Awesome.</p>

<p>Following on from a bigger <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-experimental-for-steamos-linux-gets-fixes-for-marvel-rivals-blazblue-centralfiction-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton Experimental update for Linux / SteamOS last week</a>, a smaller bug-fix update has rolled out for the Windows compatibility tool. This is just to clear up a few pesky issues people have encountered.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the changes for the November 26th update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Xalia not interacting correctly with dialogs produced by ARC Raiders.</li>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regression that caused games like Uno and Far Cry 4 to not start.</li>
<li>Fixed voice line playback in Rigid Force Alpha.</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Note: Xalia is what Valve use for adding gamepad support to desktop applications like launchers and dialog boxes that may pop up from games.</p>

<em>Pictured - ARC Raiders</em></p>
<p>How to get it: the update will show up in your Steam Downloads for Proton Experimental if you have it installed already. Otherwise, it will automatically download if you go to play a game that Valve has set for Proton Experimental by default. Or, you can manually search for Proton Experimental in your Steam Library to install it and try it on some games.

<p>ICYMI: Valve also recently release the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-10-0-3-released-bringing-lots-of-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux-steamos-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">huge Proton 10 update</a>.</p>

      <title>The excellent Yet Another Zombie Survivors is finally Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Yet Another Zombie Survivors is one of the best suvivor-likes for its mixture of great action and fun features, and it's finally Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>It worked well for a while, and especially well on Desktop Linux with Proton, but needed various tweaks for the smaller handheld screen so this latest update will be great for other handhelds too. Valve have bumped it up from Playable since the latest update with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-10-0-3-released-bringing-lots-of-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux-steamos-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently released Proton 10</a>.</p>

<p>The most recent update notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>To improve readability on smaller screens, the size of many texts and pop-ups has been increased.</li>
<li>HUD Scale (50%-150%) setting was added to the "Interface" tab in the Options menu.</li>
<li>Added some additional safeguards against potential save corruption (no amount of it is enough).</li>
<li>"Bricklayer" enemy projectiles slowed down by 15% &amp; improved indicator visibility.</li>
<li>Added new VFX particles to the game when "Blood and gore" setting is turned off.</li>
<li>The game now launches with a 60 FPS cap before it fully loads the limit set by the user.</li>
<li>Fix for "Reserve Bench" item not working correctly when equipped with "Gold Medal".</li>
<li>Mechanic: Trusty Spanner: Melee range increased slightly.</li>
<li>"Privacy Mode" setting moved to the user interface tab in the Options.</li>
<li>Fix for gameplay time displaying wrongly on the Save Slot UI.</li>
<li>Display &amp; control improvements for Run History interfaces.</li>

      <title>Death Stranding 2 looks set for a PC release - hopefully sometime soon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>FINALLY. We can see that Death Stranding 2 is coming to PC thanks to a leak from a ratings board. The wait may be almost over, and just in time as I've gotten the partner to give the first game a download to join me in loving it.</p>
<p>The data comes from the ESRB, in a now-deleted post that we can see thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251126052558/https://www.esrb.org/ratings/41057/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a>. Whenever it arrives, it will be a day-1 purchase from me to play on my Fedora KDE install. Perhaps we might even be graced with a release date during The Game Awards, which wouldn't be a surprise since Hideo Kojima has been there a few times in previous years.</p>
<p>Sony games often come to PC a good while (a year or more) after the PlayStation release (apart from Helldivers 2), but we're not even close to a year since Death Stranding 2 originally released so perhaps they are speeding this one up a bit.</p>
<p>Exciting times!</p>
<p>Here's the original PS5 trailer if you want to see it again or for the first time:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EQdOSTt7YpY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc347ca4c3d8ded5ce85cd67c9931ced.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EQdOSTt7YpY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With such a huge game, the biggest issue will be how Proton will run it. However, Valve have made such massive improvements since the original released - so hopefully we won't run into any trouble. GamingOnLinux will let you know either way shortly after release.</p>

      <title>s&amp;box from Rust developer Facepunch is now open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>s&amp;box from Rust developer Facepunch is a modern game engine built on Valve's Source 2 and the latest .NET, and now it is open source! Quite a big surprise and it's using a proper permissive license too (MIT).</p>
<p>Facepunch say s&amp;box is a "spiritual successor to Garry’s Mod and a love letter to Source 2". So it's a mixture of a game engine, and a platform to launch and play games. A bit of an all in one solution, a little like Roblox too in that way.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://sbox.game/news/update-25-11-26" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official site they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously this isn't the Source 2 code, that's up to Valve to open source if they want. For us Source 2 is providing lower level systems, all our high level systems are C# like the entire editor, networking, scene system, UI, and way more..</p>
<p>What this means is you can view, modify, copy any of our code to help improve s&amp;box with pull requests, or maintain your own fork for your standalone games, or even just take the code for your own engine.</p>
<p>It might seem odd from a business perspective to make an engine and give it away for free with no royalties and to give all the code away under open source. But we're a bunch of nerds that love what we're creating, we want everyone to use it in whatever way they want, we want to provide opportunities.</p>
<p>Open source is great for the game dev ecosystem, engines like Godot are awesome, we should have more of it because everyone wins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with basically all of that. Open source is awesome and it's nice to see another major developer get on board.</p>
<p>They also recently <a href="https://sbox.game/metrics/finance" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">opened up</a> their finances to the public to see, which is a really interesting step as well. Allowing anyone to go look at how much s&amp;box pulls in, and how much is being paid out to creators. Love seeing things like that too.</p>
<p>Pretty amazing to see them do all this. It doesn't mean s&amp;box will get Native Linux support though, as even if someone submitted code for it - they don't have to accept it. But what it does mean is anyone can fork it and turn it into something else, learn from it and even improve how it runs in Proton as developers can see exactly what it's doing.</p>
<p>You can find the open source code on <a href="https://github.com/Facepunch/sbox-public" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Sektori is absolutely one of the best modern twin-stick shooters</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sektori blasted onto Steam recently and I've been absolutely loving it, this is easily one of the best modern twin-stick shooters and fantastic to play. <em>Note: a key was provided to GamingOnLinux.</em></p>
<p>If you've ever played and enjoyed anything like Geometry Wars, this is an absolute must-buy. This is what you want in a modern take on the genre that just feels incredible to play and smash through all the enemies. It will fry your brain just as much as your eyes, as the action truly gets intense. </p>
<p>The campaign mode is especially incredible with the way the battlefield changes as you go through. You start off with a small space, that gradually morphs into different shaped arenas as you progress through it. The floor lights up giving you a warning on where it will change, and then it all smashes into play with the new shape. No level loading interruptions, it's all action and no filler here. One you have to experience to get the full feel for it, especially with the thumping techno music that give it a thrilling atmosphere for the challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5512223331764177344gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5512223331764177344gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4761958371764177342gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4761958371764177342gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With an in-battle upgrade system the way it all just keeps the game continuously flowing is incredible. As you destroy enemies you'll see big flashy upgrade tokens to collect which you can spend across boosts like speed, score, shields, your blaster and so on. But here's the interesting bit, the upgrades are in a list where collecting more changes what you will be upgrading - so you can choose to upgrade speed which is at the bottom or collect more tokens to upgrade your blaster which is at the top. All while you're flying around shooting, blasting through enemies and dashing to get away from them. It's true chaos of the best sort. </p>
<p>You also evolve your ship during battle through special evolver tokens, which you pick from a stack that you have unlocked to give you more powerful bonuses like giving you drones to help, repelling enemy bullets, fire bullets behind you and lots more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yGWsLyZ0KPU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/287583a4d8056118c21081d304cda8ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yGWsLyZ0KPU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The style of it too is seriously slick. With bright neon colours surrounding you, and simple but effective 3D geometric shapes for the enemies - it looks spectacular with the way enemies drop down onto the battlefield too. Everything about it is just so wonderfully designed.</p>
<p>From the press release: “Sektori is an evolution of the classic twin-stick shooter, offering a mix of randomization with deliberate strategy as you decide when to cash in your points for power-ups,” said developer Kimmo Lahtinen. “It’s classic arcade action with a smidge of roguelike DNA with the ability to spec your ship differently in each run. It’s easy to have fun right out of the gate, but there’s infinite room for improvement as you aim to tackle higher difficulties, climb the leaderboards, or just beat your own personal best attempts! But most importantly, I wanted to focus on game feel, with kaleidoscopic colors and pulsating techno beats that lock you into a hypnotic flow state.”</p>
<p>On Linux there is <em>one</em> specific issue with Proton. The backing video behind the menu and battlefield is broken on Valve's official Proton. For it to work properly, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-ge-proton-on-steam-deck-steamos-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you'll need GE-Proton</a>. Other than that, no issues at all and it took me a while to even notice that was actually an issue until it suddenly clicked that I was sometimes seeing the <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9489981491764176915gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Proton test image behind</a> the scenes. Goes to show how <em>intense</em> the action is that I didn't even notice it initially. But for the full experience, you <em>definitely</em> want GE-Proton until perhaps they can use a different video codec for it.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of twin-stick shooters this is an <strong>essential</strong> pick. Absolutely brilliant.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma going all-in on Wayland and will drop the X11 session completely</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It was only a matter of time but it's nearly upon us - KDE Plasma with version 6.8 will be entirely dropping the X11 session to go full Wayland.</p>
<p>For a lot of users it won't make much of a difference, according to the <a href="https://blogs.kde.org/2025/11/26/going-all-in-on-a-wayland-future/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcement as the "vast majority of our users are already using the Wayland session". With this change they said it "opens up new opportunities for features, optimizations, and speed of development". Not surprising, since developing for and maintaining the Plasma desktop across two very different protocols can't be easy. At least they'll end up with more focused development. </p>
<p>So with this move support for all X11 applications will be "fully entrusted to Xwayland".</p>
<p>In the FAQ they mentioned the current Plasma X11 session will be supported still into early 2027, no exact timing as of yet though. If you really need X11, they're suggesting sticking to a long term support (LTS) distribution that ships older Plasma. If you are using X11 and sticking with it a while, the good news is that KDE applications will continue to run on X11. They're only dropping support specifically for the Plasma desktop itself.</p>
<p>There's still some <a href="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Wayland_Known_Significant_Issues" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant issues</a> they need to address though, which they're gradually working through to ensure Plasma on Wayland is truly good for everyone.</p>
<p><em>We're finally properly close to the year of Wayland on the desktop.</em></p>

      <title>Slimbook launch the KDE Slimbook VII with AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 / Radeon 880M</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the market for a new powerful laptop ready for the holiday season? Perhaps give a look to the new KDE Slimbook VII.</p>
<p>From the press email sent to GamingOnLinux: "Slimbook and KDE are celebrating their 8th anniversary with the launch of the new KDE Slimbook VII, the seventh generation resulting from a long-standing collaboration between specialized hardware and free software".</p>
<p>Some highlights of the machine include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire --></p>
<ul>
<li>Designed for KDE Plasma users, with optimized power and performance for the Linux ecosystem.</li>
<li>Features an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and integrated AMD Radeon 880M graphics.</li>
<li>16″ WQXGA display (2560x1600) at 165 Hz for a smooth, precise, and comfortable visual experience.</li>
<li>Premium aluminum chassis in a sophisticated slate-blue color combining robustness and elegance.</li>
<li>High expandability: up to 128 GB DDR5 RAM and 8 TB NVMe 4.0 storage.</li>
<li>Cooling system with dual fans and dedicated keys to switch between power modes.</li>
<li>USB‑C with 100 W Power Delivery, Wi‑Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, HDMI, USB-A ports… everything a demanding user needs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5728966481764160129gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The base model has 16GB RAM and a 500GB NVMe storage drive. For ports you get 2x USB-C USB3.2 Gen1 with PD3.0 charging and 4K@60Hz video output, and 3x USB-A 3.2 Gen1.</p>
<p>Priced at €1,098.99 but it's €70 off for Black Friday bringing it down to €1,029. The pricing actually seems <em>reasonable</em> for the specifications, at least to me scanning around a little bit and seeing pricing from other vendors.</p>
<p>You can find it on the <a href="https://kde.slimbook.es/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Slimbook website</a>.</p>

      <title>Fedora proposal put forward to improve &#34;production stability and incident management&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a string of annoying incidents after updates causing stability problems on Fedora, there's a new proposal put forward to help improve things.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/proposal-a-sig-to-improve-production-stability-and-incident-management/174907" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">new proposal</a> suggests forming a Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on developing a "recommended stream of work to improve our stability and robustness, and to improve our communication with users when problems arise that compromise that stability and robustness".</p>
<p>In the proposal several major update issues are noted that have come up lately including a recent Mesa update that broke launching games from Steam. I only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/hello-from-fedora-kde/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">switched to Fedora KDE a few days ago</a>, and was bitten by the Mesa update, and so I was forced into the terminal to downgrade my Mesa version just to get gaming with friends that evening - something that ideally just <em>shouldn't</em> happen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chatter</a> on the Fedora Discourse forum around the Mesa update got a little <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/21" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spicy</a>, with the maintainer who actually pushed out this particular Mesa update noting they "don’t consider closed source steam a reliable indicator of issues, it has no debug symbols" which was pretty <em>unhelpful</em>. And later <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/is-most-recent-mesa-push-to-stable-mesa-25-2-7-2-fc43-reasonable/173585/51" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">saying</a> "Not my problem anymore, I have quit as rpmfusion admin".</p>
<p>Seems like the proposal is a good idea, at least to get the ball rolling on things. Their update process currently doesn't seem to work particularly well at times. This isn't about playing a blame game as issues happen of course, but so many issues <em>could</em> be avoided with better processes in place. A system cannot be (as the Fedora websites advertises) "Trusted, powerful and easy" and "Reliable" if updates repeatedly break major parts of the system.</p>
<p>Hopefully some good improvements can come out of this.</p>

      <title>The action RPG &#39;Soulframe&#39; from the devs of Warframe gets a Steam page and early access for founders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not officially out yet, but you can now jump in early to Soulframe, the in-development action RPG from the developers of the popular Warframe. A Steam page is also now live that you can follow it on, for whenever it actually releases properly. Considering it's from the Warframe developers, I expect it to be another big one.</p>
<p>Not heard of it? An open world fantasy RPG adventure with themes influenced by nature and restoration. With a hand-crafted world you will explore an "ancient, broken land and inherit the courage, spirit, and grace of Ancestors to mend earthly flesh and heal its land from Ode’n reign".</p>
<p>Announced on the <a href="https://forums.soulframe.com/topic/6643-soulframe-preludes-12-wylds/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official forum</a>, founder packs for it are also now live so you can purchase it to get into it early. Until now, you had to sign up for a chance to be invited via email, so you can skip all that if you really want to get in on it during development. It's not cheap though, as getting all three of the characters appears to be £84.99 with them £24.99 individually and you get an assortment of extras with them too. <em>At release much like Warframe, it will be free to play.</em></p>
<p>There's also a new trailer to go along with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3OTXsgACvIA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5643bf5fbf16e08087239c6a65eb0b18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3OTXsgACvIA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the press release:  "Warframe would not still be going strong 12 years later without those who supported us at its early foundations," said Geoff Crookes, Creative Director. "Soulframe Founders is us planting some of our biggest roots yet for the future. We've now reached the phase of development where we can welcome people in to help turn those roots into a solid foundation and build something we've all been waiting and hoping for from the ground up. We promise to continue serving this new community for as long as they allow us to, and to install the themes of redemption and hope throughout every aspect of Soulframe. Thank you for joining us."</p>

      <title>Heck yeah - the next HELLDIVERS 2 Warbond finally brings a minigun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 is still one of the best online co-op action games around, and we're finally going to be able to get a minigun to really tear through enemies.</p>
<p>Not only that, there's going to be a chainsaw too and it looks amazing. Not enough for you? Well there's also a new drone sidekick with a flamethrower, which will probably cause all sorts of friendly-fire chaos I imagine. On top of that there's a new primary weapon that's a combo between an assault rifle and grenade launcher too.</p>
<p>This will come with the premium (paid) Python Commandos Premium Warbond which arrives on December 2nd, which is perfect timing as I've just started getting back into the game after a long time away from it. And, with their new focus on improving the core stability of the game - it's all coming together now.</p>
<p>Probably one of the best sounding warbonds they've added to the game since release. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QQPp9ZCgrP8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f47d903f39e2d4b84d9671672e70ce4f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QQPp9ZCgrP8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>HELLDIVERS 2 continues working quite nicely on Linux with Proton, although annoyingly with my two monitors the mouse does like to wander off onto my second screen at times.</p>
<p>Even with the nProtect GameGuard anti-cheat, it works fine and has done with it since release. That and more noted on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat page</a> for Linux / SteamOS.</p>

      <title>Embracer Group selling off Arc Games and Cryptic Studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group have announced they're once again shrinking, after previously going on a crazy spending spree and then having to make lots of cuts. This time they've announced they're selling off Arc Games and Cryptic Studios which will both go to Project Golden Arc, Inc., with financing from XD Inc.</p>
<p>From the press release: "This transaction supports our key priorities by strengthening our focus on strategic assets and core IPs in Embracer while improving profitability and free cash flow.

      <title>Cold Fear, I Am Alive and more arrive in the GOG Preservation Program along with a Black Friday sale</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those that prefer the DRM-free store <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, they've expanded again with new enhanced releases of Cold Fear and I Am Alive along with a Black Friday sale. You can check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-play-games-from-gog-and-epic-games-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux Guide to get GOG games on Linux / SteamOS</a>.</p>
<p>About restoring <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/cold_fear" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Cold Fear</a>, the GOG team said: "Originally published by Ubisoft and now re-released by Atari with our very own restoration efforts, Cold Fear represents the kind of behind-the-scenes cooperation that helps ensure cult titles don’t quietly fade away when technology moves on. If a game is part of our shared gaming heritage, it deserves more than to be left broken on modern hardware". They also mentioned how it has new support for "robust controller support for popular pads, unified button layouts, and full support for wireless play, hotplugging, D-Pads, triggers, and vibration, all based on an updated scheme inspired by the original PlayStation 2 controls" along with various other enhancements to fix up glitches, crashes and so on.</p>

<p>They also revamped <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/i_am_alive" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">I Am Alive</a> a little for their store that also had a whole bunch of improvements.</p>

      <title>TRX an open-source reimplementation of Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2 version 1.0 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With lots of enhancements for the classics Tomb Raider 1 and Tomb Raider 2, the TRX project version 1.0 is out now with an LUA scripting engine for modders.</p>
<p>So what exactly is TRX? It aims to enhance the classic Tomb Raiders games through decompilation and the implementation of open-source alternatives to proprietary components. TRX is a single engine capable of running TR1, TR2, and custom levels respecting each of the distinct, classic engines' mechanics.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 was released November 23rd bringing the two games together under one roof, and with a new LUA scripting engine that could be really fun for modders to do all sorts with the game. There's absolutely tons more that was added into this release like improved rendering, support for triangular geometry, support for additive blending in textures, a new easter egg command for TR1, support for TR2 weapons in TR1 and so much more.</p>
<p>You can see their release video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="vVU9vbUXTXc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c2976a2866c6d26873ab3bbb1a721d02.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/vVU9vbUXTXc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can see everything in the <a href="https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases/tag/trx-1.0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a> for all that's new in the 1.0 update.</p>
<p>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered is a thing of course, but projects like this being open source can keep the classics running basically forever and on more platforms. You need the original data files from the games to work with TRX which you can grab from <a class="gol298" href="https://gog.com/en/game/tomb_raider_123" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> or <a class="gol644" href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Core%20Design" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior shows off a new prototype trailer of the heavy metal platformer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Chaosmonger Studio continue working on Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior a retro-styled heavy metal platformer in partnership with the band Voivod.</p>
<p>Following on from the successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, they say it has now moved onto "full production" with the new trailer showcasing the game's evolving world: a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape where mechanical ruins meet cosmic horror, brought to life through hand-crafted pixel art and an original soundtrack shaped by Voivod's unmistakable sound.</p>
<p>From the PR: "Our goal is to make a game that feels like stepping inside a Voivod album cover," says Nicola Piovesan, the game’s director and founder of Chaosmonger Studio. "This new trailer captures the atmosphere and energy that define the band’s universe. It’s both a tribute and a continuation of their legacy."</p>
<p>See the new prototype trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="K_Ey26szgM4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b0193d02d23624e9b5876bbf80a44180.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/K_Ey26szgM4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More from the PR: "The result is a unique creative synthesis: a metal-infused interactive experience where music, art, and storytelling merge into a single audiovisual vision. Combining classic run-and-gun gameplay with exploration and atmosphere, Voivod: The Nuclear Warrior invites players to embody the Voivod himself — a mutant warrior guided by his disembodied mind, Nothingface — on a journey through twisted dimensions inspired by the band’s albums and mythos."</p>
<p>It's due out sometime next year.</p>

      <title>God game Reus 2 adds full Steam Deck / SteamOS support in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Reus 2 from Abbey Games recently had a big upgrade, and now it's Steam Deck Verified / SteamOS Compatible with full support from the developer.</p>
<p>What is it? It's all about shaping worlds as one of 6 powerful giants each with their own unique abilities. Your choices will determine the fate of the planet and its inhabitants. And as you progress, you'll unlock more new skills for your giants too. Humanity does its own thing though, and may even turn against you.</p>
<p>In the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1875060/view/815840666002128939" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> that pushed it up to Steam Deck Verified the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote><strong>GAMEPAD &amp; STEAM DECK</strong>
<ul>
<li>This update adds official support for gamepads and the Steam Deck.</li>
<li>The game automatically detects when its played on Deck or a gamepad is connected and switches to the appropriate control scheme.</li>
<li>Many changes to UI composition when UI Scale is at 130%, which is selected by default for Steam Deck.</li>
<li>On UI Scale 130%, the player can increase small font sizes, enabled by default.</li>
<li>Option to disable gamepad detection completely. For when you want to keep playing the PC-control scheme on Steam Deck</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's some nice attention to the little details there, especially nice to see such direct support for our favourite handheld.</p>
<p>See the original trailer below:</p>

      <title>Chaotic climbing game ChimpUP! looks hilarious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChimpUP! is an upcoming chaotic multiplayer climbing game about monkeys trying to collect bananas, where each player has independent grapple hooks for arms. Looks like it could be another funny multiplayer game to add to your list.</p>
<p>It's a fast-paced game with each round only being about 30 seconds. Every map has its own unique weird gimmick you need to master, and it's all about being first to launch immediately into the next map. You each have wobbly arms you can use however you like - whatever gets you there first. That includes sabotaging friends, as you're able to grab them too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UYFegEV4S7o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/93fee5e7c26084693dd45cc2022cabef.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UYFegEV4S7o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4-player competitive co-op racing.</li>
<li>Dual independent grapple hook controls.</li>
<li>30-second average map completion for fast-paced action.</li>
<li>Score-based competition across multiple maps per session.</li>
<li>Player grabbing and sabotage mechanics.</li>
<li>Character customization.</li>
<li>Full Steam Workshop integration.</li>
<li>In-game map creation tools.</li>
<li>In-game cosmetic creation tools.</li>
<li>Detailed race settings for customized play.</li>
<li>Online co-op and offline single player.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a demo available that should work in Proton, but it may also be getting Native Linux support with system requirements for Linux recently added.</p>

      <title>xorg-server 21.1.21 freshly released to fix some annoying regressions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you still rocking xorg rather than Wayland, there's a new release out that should hopefully fix up some <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/1848" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issues</a> you may have been seeing. There was a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/new-security-advisory-released-for-x-org-x-server-and-xwayland-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">security advisory back in October</a> for more issues that were fixed, and a small bug-fix after that - so this release follows on from those.</p>
<p>What's changed in this release? From the release <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2025-November/003643.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The changes being reverted here are part of a series of changes previously backported in the stable branch, yet these are not actual fixes to address bugs found in the stable branch, while those changes introduced regressions with reverse PRIME with the NVIDIA closed-source driver, issues with 10-bit output with the  AMDGPU driver and reduced performance with the AMDGPU driver.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Olivier Fourdan (6):<br/>
       Revert "glamor: reject configs using unsupported rgbBits size"<br/>
       Revert "glamor_egl: add support of GlxVendorLibrary option"<br/>
       Revert "xorg: initialize glamor provider"<br/>
       Revert "glamor: Lift the GLX EGL backend from Xwayland"<br/>
       Revert "glamor: add glvnd_vendor private"<br/>
       xserver 21.1.21</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your distribution (if it still packages xorg) should hopefully pull in the update sometime soon.</p>

      <title>SteamVR 2.14 brings fixes for a Linux memory leak, a Steam Link freeze for AMD GPUs and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest stable release of SteamVR is out now! SteamVR 2.14 is a maintenance release focused on fixing up bugs and nuisance issues. <em>Nice to see the Linux fix make it in here, as no doubt that was quite annoying.</em></p>
<p>Mainly, this is promoting the previous Beta build to stable for all SteamVR users. No doubt plenty more ongoing behind the scenes so that SteamVR is ready for the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming Steam Frame device from Valve</a>. I am very excited to get my hands on it eventually to cut the cord with VR but the Valve Index has served me well until now.</p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote><strong>SteamVR:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improve startup speed when no HMD is present.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that could cause "Port 27062 in use" (can also manifest as error 309) when no HMD is present.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that could result in error 302 or error 101, especially in unusual startup configurations.</li>
<li>Changed Binding UI to allow saving bindings that don't bind all required actions (with confirmation).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where HMD simulation would persist after an app using controller simulation ended.</li>
<li>Fixed some scenarios where the wrong render model would be displayed when multiple devices were simulating.</li>
<li>Fix a crash that could occur if the roomview processing was delayed.</li>
<li>Updated dashboard binding for HP Motion Controller to fix screenshots, smooth scrolling, and take advantage of Quick Recenter.</li>
<li>The prompt to setup SteamVR for app containers and web applications now covers cases where SteamVR is installed outside of its normal location.</li>
<li>Fixed chaperone showing when using Steam Link or wired headsets that draw their own boundaries.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Steam Link:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix Steam Link freeze for users with AMD video cards ("Error 250").</li>
<li>Minor judder improvements.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Linux:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fix a shared memory leak that happened each time an app disconnected from SteamVR.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Schrodinger&#39;s Cat Burglar is an adorable looking puzzle game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Schrodinger's Cat Burglar is a puzzle game with a cat that can be in two places at once, and that will no doubt confuse my brain. Not only does it look wonderful, but the developer added a Native Linux version of the game back in October to help improve it on Steam Deck too. They said that the newer Native build runs a lot smoother.</p>
<p>The game actually sounds great. The central quantum mechanic having you split into two cats at the press of a button, with each being controlled to solve puzzles. Seems like it gets a little confusing though as the developer notes the "quantum superstate obeys Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle - when nobody is looking, Mittens could be in either location. If she’s observed however, things get theoretical…".</p>

      <title>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault enters Early Access and work is ongoing to improve it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's not quite Verified for Steam Deck just yet, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault should be a reasonably good experience. It's rated Playable by Valve, with a note that some text is a bit too small. The developer has confirmed they plan to solve that as soon as possible too.</p>
<p>So what is it? From the Steam page: "Dive deep into Action-RPG with roguelike elements and a tale about new beginnings. With no coin to your name, you and the other townsfolk find yourselves stranded in the distant village of Tresna. Now, it’s up to you to get back on your feet and turn your humble shop into the beating heart of the village’s wealth. Explore dangerous dungeons, gather relics, sell them, and reinvest in your friends’ establishments. Unlock new weapons, armor, shop decorations, and—more importantly—restore hope that things can one day turn around."</p>
<p>It launched into Early Access on November 19th, and they've already put in work to ensure it continues to get better on Steam Deck too. The first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2350790/view/628943104979764390" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hotfix</a> has released that notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Performance</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>First round of performance improvements</strong>. We’ve made changes under the hood as an initial move to reduce hitches, stuttering, and improve overall smoothness.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steam Deck</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized default settings</strong>. Steam Deck now uses a configuration tuned for more stable performance from the moment you launch, so you can focus on looting and selling instead of tweaking options.</li>
<li><strong>Steam Deck → PC graphics note</strong>. If you play on Steam Deck and then jump back to PC, your graphics settings may be set to Low automatically. You can raise them again from the settings menu on your PC. We know this is inconvenient and will work to solve it as soon as we can.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Balance</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier Easy Mode</strong>. Easy mode is now a bit more forgiving: enemies deal less damage and have less health.</li>
<li><strong>Herald adjustments</strong>. The Herald boss fight has been tuned to feel fairer while still offering a solid challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Earlier shop unlocks</strong>. The first Endless Vault challenge requirement has been reduced from 10,000 coins to 7,000, so players can unlock new content and upgrades sooner.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultrawide support</strong>. Fixed compatibility issues with 3440x1440, enabling proper ultrawide support.</li>
<li><strong>Added cursor lock</strong> to improve the experience when playing in full screen, windowed and borderless modes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And, they've put up a Steam Deck video for it too, take a look below:</p>

      <title>Try the demo for Kinsfolk, a casual emotional adventure about fatherhood</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made in the spirit of the likes of Journey, Firewatch, What Remains of Edith Finch - Kinsfolk is a casual adventure about fatherhood. As the main character you embark on a journey to discover the meaning of family. Seems like a nice one if you're into slower-paced experiences.</p>
<p>Writing in a Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2876610/announcements/detail/622187705533466252" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoy using Linux (for my dev work) and Steam Deck for gaming. Since starting Kinsfolk 2 years ago I always wanted to support them properly. I am super happy to announce that the current Kinsfolk demo now runs natively on Linux, and has been optimized for Steam Deck!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the previous trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C1yrqxOPsEk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/701cd7f7c37487933b1d36c1dc969b11.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C1yrqxOPsEk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer explained it on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jndtmc/kinsfolk_vinko_kodzoman_a_wholesome_tale_of_a/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> a bit better a few months ago: "In Kinsfolk there are no failure states, your only goal is to relax, explore the world and feel. I put a lot of emphasis on the voice, scenery and the music in the game so the player can get lost in the story. Throughout the world you will discover story pieces - vignettes - some of which you will be able to relive. This part was in big part inspired by What Remains of Edith Finch. While reliving these short stories in the past the game mechanics might change and you will have to figure out what to do while learning about the past."</p>

      <title>The huge fan-made TimeSplitters Rewind is out now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's splitting time? TimeSplitters Rewind has released for free and it should work just fine on Linux / SteamOS thanks to Proton. They said: "Sorry it's taken us so long. We've only been making the largest free content video game ever", that's a little…cheeky to say given some of the many other free games out there but okay.</p>
<p>Quite a weird one because as a fan game it's part remake and part successor to the classics. They consider it "Early Access" since it's not finished but there's a lot of content there already.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Early Access Features</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>28 Maps.</li>
<li>Online and Offline Story Mode.</li>
<li>51 Arcade Leagues.</li>
<li>32 Challenges.</li>
<li>96 Characters.</li>
<li>41 Weapons.</li>
<li>20 Arcade Game Modes.</li>
<li>New Game Mode - Team Elimination.</li>
<li>Updated Game Mode - Last Stand.</li>
<li>Online and Offline Arcade w/Bots.</li>
<li>10 Players Online.</li>
</ul>

<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZzWSrgQ3eMI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46a3b1f8ed9236c78672052481a2af27.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZzWSrgQ3eMI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've given it a test today and with Proton 10 it appears to work quite well. Just download it from their Indie DB page, extract the zip into your downloads and then add "TimeSplittersRewind.exe" as a Non-Steam game. Once added, simply go into the Properties for it and then to Compatibility, tick the box and select Proton 10 from the drop-down. Practically the same steps as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-install-battle-net-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck-for-world-of-warcraft-and-starcraft/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Option 2 in our Battle.net for Linux / SteamOS guide</a> (seems like we need a more generic guide…<em>soon</em>).</p>
<p>On the website they note "Free? Yes - all for free. No hidden costs, no microtransactions". Not a surprise, since it's entirely based on using someone else's IP. Embracer Group currently hold the rights to it, so it will be interesting to see if they pull out the lawyer card and end up getting it eventually taken down. <em>Using existing IP is always a big risk.</em></p>

      <title>Palworld publisher picks up Vision Quench, a co-op dark fantasy looter shooter set in a consumer goods conglomerate mega dungeon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in the underbelly of a consumer goods conglomerate mega dungeon, Vision Quench is now being published by Palword's Pocketpair Publishing. From WizMUD, this is their first game on Steam and it's going to release sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>More about it: "The last remnant of a vanished bargain lies yet unclaimed atop the Green Tower, where the Sweepstakes Code endures as both a promise and a curse. To redeem it, you and your 3 companions, drawn together by the distant memory of a memory, must fight your way up the tower through a sprawling labyrinth of hidden designs, metaphysical phenomena, and all manner of foul creatures."</p>

<li>One player can carry a backpack allowing everyone to stay mobile while they loot. Items can be easily tossed in and out of the bag. Protect the backpack carrier at all costs, or at least the backpack.</li>
<li>Be mindful of your party’s status, even in this altered state players can become ill and pass it on to others.</li>
<li>Easily throw bandaids and fizzy drinks to your friends in need, but be careful when throwing things like fireworks and cinderblocks</li>
<li>Upon death you’ll become a Freakopop, a plastic toy that can be picked up and thrown around. Assist the living with your newfound Freako Vision.</li>
<li>Your presence may become noted by the Entity: A shadowy creature that takes on different forms. It will try and disconnect you from your vision quest if you don't play by its rules.</li>

<p>It's not clear if it will have a Native Linux version or if you'll need Proton for it. There's Linux system requirements on Steam, but they don't make it clear right now as it's not fully filled.</p>

      <title>Igalia detail their open source work for Valve&#39;s Steam Frame and Steam Machine</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the great things about Valve's hardware is that it's not locked down, and they put a lot of money into open source for SteamOS (Linux). With <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the upcoming new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, the open source never stops.</p>
<p>And here we have Igalia, one of the Free Software consultancies that Valve works with, writing up a post detailing some of the work that goes into it all. In this case, it's especially interesting for the Steam Frame. Igalia have people working on FEX, as just one example, which is a fast usermode x86 and x86-64 emulator for Arm64 Linux. Basically, it allows running x86 applications on ARM64 Linux devices - this is part of how the Steam Frame will actually run games. From the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you love video games, like I do, working on FEX with Valve is a dream come true,” said <a href="https://igalia.com/team/pmatos" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paulo Matos</a>, an engineer with Igalia’s <a href="https://www.igalia.com/technology/compilers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Compilers Team</a>. Even so, the challenges can be daunting, because making sure the translation is working often requires manual QA rather than automated testing. “You have to start a game, sometimes the error shows up in the colors or sound, or how the game behaves when you break down the door in the second level. Just debugging this can take a while,” said Matos. “For optimization work I did early last year, I used a game called <em>Psychonauts</em> to test it. I must have played the first 3 to 4 minutes of the game many, many times for debugging. Looking at my history, Steam tells me I played it for 29 hours, but it was always the first few minutes, nothing else.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine there's a lot of driver development, and Proton / Wine development, that has people repeat sections over and over like this. Can't imagine how boring that actually ends up. But, probably exciting when they finally nail it and get it all working nicely.</p>
<p>The post from Igalia also confirms the Steam Frame will use the open source <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/freedreno.html#turnip" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mesa3D Turnip</a> graphics driver, which needed a fair amount of work to be ready for the device by the sounds of it, with lots missing to get it up to scratch. More from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We implemented many Vulkan extensions and reviewed numerous others,” said <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/dpiliaiev" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Danylo Piliaiev</a>, an engineer on the <a href="https://www.igalia.com/technology/graphics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Graphics Team</a>. “Over the years, we ensured that D3D11, D3D12, and OpenGL games rendered correctly through DXVK, vkd3d-proton, and Zink, investigating many rendering issues along the way. We achieved higher correctness than the proprietary driver and, in many cases, Mesa3D Turnip is faster as well.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's all open source, everyone benefits - not just Valve. And, some of the work sounds quite exciting for the future of gaming on Linux. More from the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking ahead, Igalia’s work for Valve will continue to deliver benefits to the wider Linux Gaming ecosystem. For example, the Steam Frame, as a battery-powered VR headset, needs to deliver high performance within a limited power budget. A way to address this is to create a more efficient task scheduler, which is something <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/changwoo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Changwoo Min</a> of Igalia’s <a href="https://www.igalia.com/technology/kernel" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kernel Team</a> has been working on. As he says, “I have been developing a customized CPU scheduler for gaming, named <a href="https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1713/attachments/1425/3058/scx_lavd-lpc-mc-24.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LAVD: Latency-criticality Aware Virtual Deadline scheduler</a>.”</p>

      <title>Blending classic survival games with automation - ORMOD: Directive sounds interesting</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ORMOD: Directive is a very interesting recent announcement that blends classic action survival gameplay mechanics with automation. A little unusual bit it sounds like it might work quite well and it's set to release on Steam sometime in early 2026.</p>
<p>From the press email: "ORMOD: Directive introduces a post-apocalyptic sandbox where no two worlds are the same. Every playthrough generates a unique and fully customizable world, including the placement of towns, buildings, roads, and key landmarks. Players define their own survival strategy across a landscape built from the ground up for replayability, creativity, and challenge.</p>
<p>Blending classic survival gameplay with automation, base-building, and realistic combat simulation, the game offers a world that continues to evolve even when players are not online. Every decision affects survival, whether through diplomacy, stealth, or brute force, and every item in the world exists physically, stays where it is left, and can be picked up, stolen, or repurposed."</p>
<p>Since it will have anti-cheat as you can run servers for it, I was concerned about the anti-cheat situation for Linux / SteamOS <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since so many games have it disabled</a> and lock Linux away and this one will have their own "In-House Client-Based Anti-Cheat" as listed on Steam. Speaking to their PR team to get word, I asked about it being enabled for Linux / SteamOS and they replied to note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Liam! The developer has confirmed a strong "Yes!" for this.</p>

      <title>WinBoat adds support for Podman, UWP, app filtering and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WinBoat is a popular way to run Windows apps on Linux in a containerized environment that sorts all the configuration for you and a new update sounds great. </p>
<p>An interesting alternative to using the likes of Wine / Proton, to have Windows directly on your device inside Linux with containers. It's all quite clever, especially useful for things that won't run well or at all with Wine. Luckily, I have no need for it but I can see the appeal, far less annoying than dual-booting just for a few select things.</p>
<p>Release v0.9.0 arrived November 23rd with a number of big new features, plus some security improvements and bug fixes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1271730021763991918gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1271730021763991918gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's everything that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>🐳 Podman is now supported</strong>, you can pick it during installation, however USB passthrough on Podman is not supported yet</li>
<li>UWP app support has been added, now you can see and start all your UWP apps</li>
<li>A Custom App can now be created from an existing one if you'd like to modify it</li>
<li>Apps can now be filtered</li>
<li>Apps can now be launched via the context menu</li>
<li>You can now adjust the Application Scaling in Configuration</li>
<li>New WinBoat installations will now reserve the port range <code class="inline-code">47270 - 47370</code> on Docker for all used services, this is to avoid common ports and port conflicts in the future. In the meantime Podman does not support port ranges in compose files, so we're allocating random ports</li>
<li>You can now add new or replace any existing FreeRDP arguments in Configuration</li>
<li>A <code class="inline-code">wm-class</code> prefix has been added for folks who wanna style WinBoat FreeRDP windows in their WM</li>
<li>Windows will now auto-synchronize the clock on new installations</li>
<li>The default install path has been set to <code class="inline-code">~/winboat</code>, of course you can still change it to whatever you prefer</li>
<li>You can now disable animations within WinBoat if you're sensitive to motion or your compositor doesn't play nicely with Electron</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you're using a Custom ISO for installation, that ISO will get auto-unmounted afterwards so the next time you start WinBoat with that ISO deleted, it will work properly</li>
<li>Fixed the CPU usage spiking when RDP monitoring is enabled</li>
<li>Corrected a few typos</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misc:</h3>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">dockur/windows</code> version upgraded to 5.14</li>
<li>All WinBoat ports are now bound by default to <code class="inline-code">127.0.0.1</code></li>
<li>Improved the security of the Guest Server (thanks <a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/mrsheepsheep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@mrsheepsheep</a> and <a class="notranslate user-mention" href="https://github.com/matt0x00" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@matt0x00</a>)</li>

      <title>Palworld update &#39;Home Sweet Home&#39; arrives December 17 with an ULTRAKILL collab</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Home Sweet Home huh? The name of the next Palworld update that's been confirmed to arrive on December 17th.</p>
<p>The update includes a collaboration with the popular FPS ULTRAKILL, as well as new features for customizing bases. Although they haven't said exactly what will be included just yet, we'll have to wait for the actual release notes around December 17th. Looks to be a very combat-focused update though going by the update trailer you can view below, which is not surprising given the picked game for collaboration there. And we get a teaser of something rather big right at the end.</p>
<p>Check it out:</p>

      <title>Grab a free copy of Warhammer: Vermintide 2 for a limited time</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is currently on a time-limited deal where you can grab a copy and keep it, so act fast if you want a free game. Earlier this year it also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/03/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-an-easy-anti-cheat-upgrade-finally-works-properly-on-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had an update</a> to improve the anti-cheat on Linux too, so hopefully now you won't have too much trouble running it on Linux systems with Proton.</p>
<p>More about it: "Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is a 4-player co-op action game set in the Warhammer Fantasy Battles world. Sequel to the critically acclaimed Vermintide, Vermintide 2 is the latest installment in a franchise best known for its intense and bloody first-person melee combat."</p>
<p>It also only just this week added a new free DLC with Warhammer: Vermintide 2 - Return to the Reik, which adds in one of Vermintide 1’s most popular levels.</p>

      <title>The Nightdive Studios enhanced Quake II re-release is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the latest minor update, the newer Quake II re-release that saw Nightdive Studios jump in to improve it is now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/08/quake-ii-remastered-shadow-dropped-playable-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Back in August 2023</a> the re-release update came with lots of enhancements to the classic including the expansions, Quake 64, big multiplayer improvements and various gameplay improvements. It was quite the overhaul for the classic shooter. Valve's original rating was Steam Deck Playable but that was from their test in 2022.</p>
<p>A small update was pushed to the game with no patch notes on what they changed, they simply said "Quake II is now Steam Deck Verified and Handheld Optimized on Xbox ROG Ally devices" and with that - it's now Steam Deck Verified. So now you're truly good to go across Desktop Linux, Steam Deck and other SteamOS machines and it should work without much of a fuss at all.</p>
<p>Nice to see a classic live on.</p>

      <title>The multiverse is a mess so you and friends will get cleaning in S.K.R.U.B. Squad</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I do love how many more casual co-op games we're seeing lately, and it looks like S.K.R.U.B. Squad may be one to add to your list. You've done some power washing in the likes of PowerWash Simulator but what about cleaning up the whole multiverse? A messy job, but someone has to do it.</p>
<p>A recent announcement from developer Devon Wiersma they note: "Whenever there's a mess that needs cleaning, muck that needs wiping, or trash that needs grinding, the SKRUB Squad is there! Made up of a team of interplanetary slime folk who just really REALLY like cleaning, they travel the cosmos looking for the nastiest worlds to make squeaky clean. As their newly-created slimeling recruit, you'll join them to lend a hand to buff the multiverse back to perfection!"</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<li>Clean up solo or with up to four friends!</li>
<li>A variety of levels to explore, from moody space ships to exotic cityscapes!</li>

<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ROLL THE DICE</strong> - Select and reroll unwanted dice to chase ever more valuable hands. Strategically pace your rerolls or go all in chasing the ultimate hand to play!</p>
<p><strong>BUILD A DECK OF SKULLS</strong> - Choose skulls to add to your deck and find new opportunities to increase your score. Experiment, find synergies, and try different playstyles. Construct a deck of skulls to turn even the worst hand of dice around, or pick skulls that reward risky play and pushing your luck.</p>
<p><strong>PLAY HANDS</strong> - Activate as many skulls as possible with every hand and use your rerolls to gain every advantage you can. Upgrade chosen hands to increase their value and complement your deck of skulls to meet increasingly difficult challenges.</p>
<p><strong>FAIL AND TRY AGAIN</strong> - If you run out of hands, it is game over for you. Don’t worry, though. Persistence is rewarded, and the guardian of the Underworld seems to grow fond of you coming back to challenge him for just one more round.</p>

      <title>NodalBastion is a delightful mixture of tower defense and incremental progression</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Taking inspiration from incremental games with a long progress tree to unlock, NodalBastion is a tower defense game that just keeps on going. <em>It's a bit too heavy on the screen effects by default though.</em></p>
<p>A demo is available on Steam which has a Linux version, and if you like tower defense games you might like to try this one too. You may find you end up putting a fair amount of time into the demo to unlock all it has to offer. It does things a bit differently too, which is why I liked it. Starting off with just a single square core, you have to keep expanding with linked nodes to defend that initial core. Placing more nodes is on a timer, and you're given a random assortment of nodes each time you place a new one in a little time-line list. So it's all about making the best of what you're given, based on what you've unlocked from previous runs.</p>
<p>Did you fail? No problem, go back to the menu, unlock a bunch more and have another run.</p>
<p>Clever idea. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RvNbA0LwtOo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/966be9baff0f1b48eae7710c6d777380.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RvNbA0LwtOo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AI wars are over. You are the last intelligence — defending the final core against ever-evolving humanity.</p>
<p>Deploy nodes, expand your network, and neutralize endless hostile intrusions.</p>
<p>Harvest data and install upgrades to adapt with every iteration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build your bastion and collect resources - </strong>Shape your network and fortify the core against humanity’s assault. Collect data to expand faster, energize skills, and unlock upgrades.</li>
<li><strong>Adapt and upgrade - </strong>Optimize your systems, evolve your code — and download more RAM.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash powerful skills </strong>- Execute powerful skills to shift the flow of battle — unleash energy pulses, fire devastating lasers, deploy repair and stasis fields, launch explosive mines, release swarms of autonomous drones, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Survive boss battles </strong>- Face humanity’s elite in relentless showdowns. Neutralize their tactics and prove machine superiority.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Protocols </strong>- Your network, your rules. Switch post-processing effects on or off for optimal clarity — customize scanlines, chromatic aberration, vignette, and more.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The full game is currently set for a March 2026 release date.</p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening gets a limited time free trial and the biggest discount yet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening from Funcom is trying to pull in some fresh players, with a new free trial available and the biggest discount on Steam so far. Thankfully even with the BattlEye anti-cheat, it is enabled and working on Linux / SteamOS systems, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">unlike many other games</a>.</p>
<p>Available now until November 27th, you can jump in completely free. It does work well on Linux desktop with Proton, but is a little rough on the Steam Deck. It's actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/dune-awakening-is-now-steam-deck-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck Verified</a> according to Valve, but in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/06/dune-awakening-is-out-now-and-works-well-on-linux-desktop-but-rough-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my original testing</a> and a recent re-test it still likes to dip below 30FPS. At least if you have a more powerful Linux machine, you'll be good to go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12804349741763727425gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>For the discount, it's also 25% off, which is the historical low for it on Steam. During the trial you only get 10 hours though, which is quite a limit for this type of MMO so you only get a small taster of the game overall.</p>
<p>Sadly, Dune: Awakening has been struggling, with the player numbers dwindling down. As you can see on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/#3m" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, it has been quite a drop and only continues to fall. However, they appear to be making some changes that should hopefully make various parts of the game feel a lot better like the ability to carry vehicles across maps and coming soon:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Base Reconstruction Tool</strong> lets you safely store your entire base and all its contents, so you can take a break from the game without losing any of your progress. </li>
<li><strong>Character Server Transfers</strong> will allow you to move your character to another World entirely. Combined with the Base Reconstruction Tool, you'll be able to bring everything with you when you move. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in August they also added an auto-run keybind, which made exploration a lot nicer too.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues appears to be the end-game, which they're hoping to solve early next year. They said the goal for the next chapter is specifically to "enrich the endgame experience" with a new system that provides "repeatable PVE activities, expanding the character progression with specializations, crafting the next chapter in the main storyline, and much, much more".</p>
<p>So perhaps we might see it have quite the comeback at some point over the next few months.</p>

      <title>ARC Raiders is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve recently published a Steam Deck Verified rating for the smash-hit extraction shooter ARC Raiders. I decided to see if it deserved the rating.</p>
<p>With close to 100 hours on my Linux desktop <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/arc-raiders-has-seriously-exciting-gameplay-that-has-firmly-hooked-me-in/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">where it has been working beautifully</a>, I feel like I have a decent enough grasp on how it should feel by now. It's also one of the few bigger games like this that actually has the anti-cheat enabled for Linux / SteamOS which is going to be <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/anti-cheat-will-still-be-one-of-the-biggest-problems-for-the-new-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a big problem for the Steam Machine</a>, so it's quite an important one. There's many that simply disable Linux support as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted on our anti-cheat page</a>.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it actually does feel <em>okay</em> and with the defaults so far testing on Steam Deck across each map it has remained above 30FPS apart from some rare momentary drops below FPS where it shoots right back above. 30FPS is supposed to be the performance floor for being Steam Deck Verified from what I understand. So it hits it, but it looks a bit on the rough side.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2850592141763725393gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2850592141763725393gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6342345121763725392gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6342345121763725392gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Those are some funny looking trees.</em></p>
<p>You're not going to see much battery life either, with the Steam Deck LCD seeing less than an hour in it. The textures popping in and appearing as you're running through looks a bit terrible too on the default graphics settings.</p>
<p>You'll definitely want to do some graphics tweaks to make it feel better. I would put Textures on Medium and View distance up to High at a minimum, which gives you a better looking game and a better chance at survival. Plus with some upscaling like TSR, you can still keep performance to a reasonable level.</p>
<p>If this is your only way to play, then it's going to be <em>somewhat</em> doable, but you're at quite a heavy disadvantage on Steam Deck with it. Especially in the PvP elements of the game. It's certainly not going to be a recommendation from me on Steam Deck, but it's doable at least. As a way to run with some free loadouts to grab a little loot in bed? Not amazing, but not completely terrible either.</p>
<p>The biggest issue though? It crashes and quits to your library a fair bit. Realistically, at least testing with the Steam Deck LCD, it's not stable enough to be Steam Deck Verified in my opinion.</p>
<p>As long as it keeps working, it will probably be pretty good on the upcoming Steam Machine. But for now, I'll continue playing on my Fedora KDE desktop.</p>

      <title>SteamOS 3.7.18 Beta available with a few nuisance bugs being squashed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamOS 3.7.18 Beta "Old Enough to Vote" was released by Valve today, bringing in a few more fixes for some annoying sounding issues. In case you live under a rock we're also getting some new SteamOS systems with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Frame and Steam Machine</a> you should go and read up on.</p>
<p>As it's a Beta you'll need to change your system updates channel to test it, or just wait for Valve to roll it out for the next stable SteamOS Linux release. You can change it via Settings &gt; System &gt; System Update Channel. The most recent stable update is <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/steamos-3-7-17-released-with-fixes-for-baldurs-gate-3-os-updates-and-discover/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.7.17 from early November</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">What's changed? See below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the performance overlay sometimes showing zero for CPU power draw.</li>
<li>Fixed audio not always switching to/from 3.5mm headphones correctly when inserted or removed.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression where certain in-game overlay UI elements could cause a frame time drop upon appearing.</li>
<li>Fixed the frame limiter interacting badly with VRR after an extended period.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Forza Horizon 4 and Forza Horizon 5 would only display a blank window.</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of that we also only just recently finally saw the release of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/proton-10-0-3-released-bringing-lots-of-improvements-for-gaming-on-linux-steamos-steam-machine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 10</a>, to bring even better game compatibility to SteamOS machines and Linux desktop systems.</p>

      <title>Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 gets more Steam Deck improvements in Hotfix 35 with their native version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Larian have updated Baldur's Gate 3 with Hotfix #35, which includes more improvements to their Native Linux build supported on the Steam Deck with SteamOS.</p>
<p>Did you miss it getting a Native version? See the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/baldurs-gate-3-gets-a-native-linux-version-to-improve-it-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previous GamingOnLinux article</a> for the info. They're still specifically calling it "Steam Deck Native", but it's just a Native Linux version with tweaks for the Steam Deck included. It will be interesting to see how this sort of language evolves, especially <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">with the new upcoming Steam Machine</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19033325001763666180gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/568143233911096621" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> here's all the goodies:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>FIXES</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Crashes and Performance</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a freeze on PS5 that could occur when pressing L2.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Xbox on the host's end when a client leaves a multiplayer session.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Xbox on the client's end when suspending the game while loading into a multiplayer session.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on Steam Deck Native Build and Mac that was sometimes caused when saving the game after crafting.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential crash on Mac on the host's end during cross-play.</li>
<li>Fixed some potential crashes on Steam Deck during cross-play.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Steam Deck</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Bumped the default Upscaling Type from FSR 1 to FSR 2.2 to improve sharpness on Steam Deck Native.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing external controllers to stop working on Steam Deck Native when you use the 'Switch to Desktop' or 'Return to Gaming Mode' functions.</li>
<li>Improved loading times in some instances on the Steam Deck Native build.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on startup when the EN locale is missing on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Improved VRAM consumption on Nvidia GPUs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Bit odd them listing "Improved VRAM consumption on Nvidia GPUs" under the Steam Deck heading but okay. Hopefully that will help those of you choosing to run the Native Linux version on Desktop Linux with an NVIDIA GPU.</p>

      <title>Vampire Survivors gets turned officially into a crazy deck-builder with Vampire Crawlers from poncle</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is the kind of chaos I love to see, and very fitting from Vampire Survivor developer poncle, with the casual deck-builder Vampire Crawlers. With a full name that is a bit of a mouthful. Are you ready? Deep breath…Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors. Wow, what a name huh?</p>
<p>From the Steam page: "From the somehow triple-BAFTA‑winning creators of Vampire Survivors, Vampire Crawlers: the turbo wildcard from Vampire Survivors turns the snowballing thrill of Vampire Survivors into a turbo turn‑based, card‑driven BLOBBER with rogue-lite elements. Build busted decks, explore familiar dungeons from a new perspective, and unleash world‑ending combos. Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!".</p>
<p>You can see their official video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JbDVqLlLarY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0d60280fe4f68620da08c557b2adb4f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JbDVqLlLarY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Snowballing, turn‑based carnage</strong>: Play cards in ascending mana order to land combos; each step multiplies the next card’s effect. Use Wilds to extend the stack and keep going to 10, 20, 30… Can you reach infinite?</li>
<li><strong>Pick your pace</strong>: Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!</li>
<li><strong>Deck-Building</strong>: Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards, headbutt chests for customization gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game.</li>
<li><strong>Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons packed with something seldom seen in Vampire Survivors: functioning walls. And then all sorts of unique treasures and interactions. Find the shovel to dig into the next floor, that will most likely take place in the clouds!</li>
</ul>

<p>And right onto the wishlist it goes! Fun to see Vampire Survivors as a thing expand. Now we have an entirely new game with a similar theme in a different genre, and we also have the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/warhammer-survivors-announced-as-a-licensed-vampire-survivors-game/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">licensed Warhammer Survivors game</a> coming too.</p>

      <title>Zork I, Zork II and Zork III are now officially open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft announced today that they're preserving a bit of history here - with Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III now officially and clearly open source. The source has been around for a while but now it's all proper.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/11/20/preserving-code-that-shaped-generations-zork-i-ii-and-iii-go-open-source" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, we’re preserving a cornerstone of gaming history that is near and dear to our hearts. Together, Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), Team Xbox, and Activision are making <em>Zork I</em>, <em>Zork II</em>, and <em>Zork III</em> available under the MIT License. Our goal is simple: to place historically important code in the hands of students, teachers, and developers so they can study it, learn from it, and, perhaps most importantly, play it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't put up their own repositories though, instead they decided to collaborate with Jason Scott of the Internet Archive, to officially send in pull requests to add the MIT license to each of the existing repositories. That's quite a nice way to do it. Those existing classic source repositories are now considered the canonical home for the Zork source code.</p>
<p>Microsoft said they chose the MIT license for its "simplicity and openness because it makes the code easy to study, teach, and build upon". </p>

      <title>Bioflux - Horde is a survival game where the infected numbers look insane</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coming across it by pure chance recently, Bioflux - Horde is an upcoming survival game with enemy numbers that actually look like true hordes of infected.</p>
<p>I've played tons of action and survival games before, but I don't remember another that throws actual hordes of enemies running at you like this. The <em>closest</em> I can think if is probably World War Z for the sheer numbers but they're a different genre of game overall. Safe to say this is going onto my watch-list to keep a close eye on. Could end up being a good one to blast around in!</p>
<p>Have a look at their early trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="h8HyjM1wipk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5a42b664b12791e072f4e8c1b4c963f7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/h8HyjM1wipk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In true indie dev style, I couldn't find a website or any real info about the developer to share - just the new Steam page that managed to capture my interest to highlight for you today.</p>
<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Open Quarantine Zone</strong> - Explore eight square kilometers of forest, suburbs and the ruins of Eisenstadt. Weather and the day night cycle constantly change visibility and atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Horde System</strong> - Face thousands of infected. Some wander through the landscape while others wait in the ruins. They react to movement, light and sound and they do not forget easily.</p>
<p><strong>Survival Under Pressure</strong> - Hunger, thirst and exhaustion shape every decision. Manage your resources or die trying.</p>
<p><strong>Building and Defense</strong> - Build and reinforce shelters in key locations. Power, lighting and defenses decide whether you survive the night or join the horde.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting and Exploration</strong> - Scavenge, loot and craft tools, weapons and equipment. Search hidden bunkers and old quarantine facilities buried in the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>Open Storyline</strong> - Discover the truth behind the fall of Eisenstadt piece by piece. Follow traces, recordings and forgotten places that reveal what really happened inside the zone.</p>

      <title>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster has launched from Nightdive and it&#39;s Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Nightdive Studios today released Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster, and Valve have rated it Steam Deck Verified now too. Valve's rating came in earlier today, with their testing being done on Proton 10.</p>
<p>More about it: "Get ready for the good, the bad, and the even worse. One black day, ex-Marshall James Anderson’s quiet life with his wife and daughter was shattered by a fancy-dressed land baron intent on plowing down his farm to make way for a railroad. Now Anderson's driven by revenge, which he'll exact in a spray of gunfire. As the ex-Marshall, you'll face a horde of ornery, gun-slinging outlaws and have to shoot your way through a twisted plot fueled by greed. Arm yourself with the iron best suited for the job, as well as your wits, to settle the score."</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer:</p>

      <title>Clive Barker&#39;s Hellraiser: Revival gets a first gameplay trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We have our first brutal glimpse into the world of Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, the upcoming horror-action game from Saber Interactive. It's due out sometime in 2026, we don't know exactly when that will be.</p>
<p>More about it: "Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival introduces a totally new Hellraiser story starring Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the mysterious Genesis Configuration puzzle box to save his girlfriend from the terrifying horrors of Hell. Discover a realm of terrors as you take on dark cultist worshippers, sex-crazed deviants, and infernal monstrosities, harnessing unique abilities and an arsenal of jaw-dropping weapons that can be instruments of both misery and delight. You’ll have many ways to defend yourself – but can you save yourself from an eternity of torment?"</p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="853GzhgIYVs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8c455659ceebef9489bb34760e773713.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/853GzhgIYVs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A Terrifying New Story in the Hellraiser Universe: Discover a chilling new story in the iconic horror franchise as you unwittingly kickstart Pinhead’s (voiced by Doug Bradley) ritual to unleash the ultimate torment on the world.</li>
<li>Unleash the Power of the Box: Harness the unique abilities of the Genesis Configuration in combination with an arsenal of earthly weapons to inflict bone-breaking, flesh-searing pain (or pleasure?) upon your enemies.</li>
<li>Battle for Survival Against Hell’s Armies: Take on Hell's wretches, deviants, cultists, and its most infernal priests in an unholy war for your immortal soul.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like we may be in for quite the treat, if you like horror-action games that is. Might be a little too scary for me, then again - can anything beat the terror of Alien: Isolation - still the scariest game I've ever played. Nothing has topped it so far for me. Anyway, no doubt it will work well in Proton for Linux / SteamOS and the Steam Machine.</p>

      <title>Need a new local co-op game? Puzzle platformer Tentacle Tango looks great and challenging</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starving for more local co-op games to play with a partner? Tentacle Tango could be what you need and it looks really fun. It's out today with Native Linux support.</p>
<p>What's it about? It's a chaotic co-op platformer where two inseparable octopuses — Ten and Tango — swing, jump, flop, and fumble their way through dangerous and hilarious worlds. Whether played solo or in co-op, every terrain demands teamwork, timing, and a healthy tolerance for accidental tentacle mishaps. It may look cute, but the developer assures us it will put friendships to the test, along with your reflexes.</p>
<p>Check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1-uTeYFwVRw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0de9cb9d545dfc9f155f905cc563701d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1-uTeYFwVRw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not into local co-op? Good news there, as they've confirmed online play is also coming in the next few weeks too.</p>
<p>Some highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two Octos. Sixteen Arms. Zero Personal Space</strong> - Bound together, you and your partner must synchronize your movements to overcome every challenge. Use momentum, timing, and teamwork to swing across gaps, avoid traps, and defeat enemies. In Tentacle Tango, even the smallest misstep can send you both tumbling, adding to the game's deceptively tough nature.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse Worlds to Explore</strong> - Each world brings new, progressively challenging obstacles—from crumbling platforms to intricate puzzles that require perfect coordination. The difficulty ramps up with every level, demanding quick reflexes and flawless teamwork.</li>
<li><strong>Solo or Local Co-op</strong> - Play solo, controlling both characters, or team up with a friend in co-op mode. Whether you're flying solo or partnering up, success hinges on perfect synchronization and timing.</li>
<li><strong>Leaderboards and Achievements</strong> - Climb the leaderboards by setting the best times, and compete with friends or globally to prove you’re the ultimate tandem team. Achievements await those who master the tango of teamwork.</li>
<li><strong>Cute, Yet Challenging</strong> - Don’t be deceived by the cute art and charming animals. Tentacle Tango may look like a lighthearted adventure, but underneath is a tough, skill-based challenge that tests your patience and precision. Success requires sharp timing and flawless coordination. Ready to test your teamwork? Tentacle Tango will put your cooperative skills to the test—because it truly takes two to tango!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve put up a new Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 with a move towards 64-bit</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>To ensure games run well on Linux either via Native Linux builds or Windows games with Proton, part of the magic is in the Steam Linux Runtime. A new version of it, the Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 was recently put up with some pretty big changes.</p>
<p>What's the point of it? It ensures Steam and games run through Steam on Linux work properly across all the many different Linux distributions. Another secret Valve sauce for Linux. Well, <em>not</em> secret at all but you get my meaning I'm sure.</p>
<p>Steam Linux Runtime 4.0 brings with it a major bump to the version of Debian as the base of the packages to Debian 13.2. Some of the other highlights from the initial <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steamrt/-/wikis/steamrt4-release-notes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Some libraries like libFLAC and OpenSSL are new major versions with a new SONAME. These libraries are not ABI-compatible with their equivalents in sniper, and making use of them might also require code changes due to API compatibility breaks.</li>
<li>"Classic" SDL 2 has been replaced by sdl2-compat, but porting games to use SDL 3 directly is recommended.</li>
<li>Many larger and/or older libraries have been removed completely. Some might be added back in at a later date if we find that they are necessary. For example:
	<ul>
<li>AT-SPI</li>
<li>FLTK</li>
<li>GLUT</li>
<li>GTK</li>
<li>ICU</li>
<li>libproxy</li>
<li>libsoup</li>
<li>ncurses</li>
<li>Qt</li>
<li>SDL 2 versions of SDL_image, etc. (SDL 3 versions are still available)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most libraries that were previously available for both x86_64 and i386 are now only available for x86_64. In general, we only have i386 libraries if they are expected to be needed for Proton or for the steam-runtime-tools diagnostic tools.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And a follow-up update:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Platform libraries</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update packages from Debian 13.2 point release:
	<ul>

      <title>The cross-platform Nexus Mods app v0.21.1 makes mod collection installation smoother</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Nexus Mods app team have rolled out another early release for their in-progress successor to Vortex, with v0.21.1 bringing more improvements. It's free, open source and most importantly - has a Native Linux version available.</p>
<p>With this release they said the focus has been on "making mod collection installation smoother, improving Health Checks and logs, and squashing several key bugs for a more reliable experience". While in the background work continues on technical features needed to support Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6910706071763574417gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6910706071763574417gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>From the changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collection Conflict Rules:</strong> Mod collection <strong>conflict resolution rules</strong> (which files win when multiple mods include the same file) are now correctly applied the very <strong>first time</strong> you install a collection. This ensures your collection starts up correctly from the beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Better File Checks:</strong> The "Missing Game Files" Health Check now includes a <strong>list of the actual affected files</strong>. This makes it much easier to pinpoint exactly which files need attention.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Bug Fixes and Stability:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Collection Installation:</strong> Fixed a bug that occurred when installing collections that use <strong>Fomod installers with predefined choices</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Resolved 'File In Use' Error:</strong> Fixed a "File in use" exception that could appear when <strong>unmanaging a game</strong> and then trying to <strong>delete the associated mods</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Logging:</strong> Added more <strong>debug information</strong> to the logs, specifically for cases where <strong>backup limit exceptions</strong> are triggered. This will help our team diagnose and fix these issues.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h3>Behind-the-Scenes Improvements:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Refactoring and Optimizations:</strong> we did some general refactoring and optimization related to project structure, hashing and GameIds.</li>
<li><strong>UI State System:</strong> Implemented a system to <strong>save and restore user interface (UI) state</strong>. While not actively used yet, this sets the stage for features where views can remember your preferred layouts and configurations.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering we're about to see more hardware arriving with SteamOS Linux like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/valve-reveal-the-new-steam-frame-steam-controller-and-steam-machine-with-steamos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the new Steam Machine and Steam Frame</a>, getting a properly good cross-platform mod manager like this is going to be essential. So it's pleasing to watch it continue to mature towards being the go-to.</p>

      <title>AMD FSR Redstone arrives December 10 with a teaser</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD have gone and done it. They've put up a teaser for an announcement of AMD FSR Redstone arriving on December 10. Marketing - you gotta love it right? A 26 second video that tells us nothing at all, only that FSR Redstone is "premiering on December 10th".</p>
<p>Officially, only Radeon RX 9000 will be supported, so a lot of GPU owners are going to miss out unless they upgrade. Well, FSR4 can be made to work on earlier models (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/09/steam-deck-plugin-adds-amd-fsr4-support-to-improve-visuals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">even the Steam Deck</a>), but it's not completely clear exactly what Redstone will hook into so it may just be out of reach for older generations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6IWzvKxkKVc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c59bfe641070fdabfd325e71376012d6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6IWzvKxkKVc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>According to AMD's own information, FSR Redstone key highlights include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FSR "Redstone" is a suite of ML-powered gaming technologies, delivering smoother performance and sharper visuals on the latest on AMD RDNA™ 4 GPUs – coming soon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FSR Upscaling:</strong> (Formerly AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution) Reconstructs crisp, high-quality visuals from low-resolution frames. </li>
<li><strong>FSR Frame Generation:</strong> Predicts and inserts new frames between rendered ones, delivering smoother and higher frame rate gaming.</li>
<li><strong>FSR Ray Regeneration:</strong> Infers and restores full-quality ray-traced detail from sparse samples, delivering sharp, noise-free visuals with reduced rendering cost. </li>
<li><strong>FSR Radiance Caching:</strong> Dynamically learns and then predicts how light propagates through a scene, delivering efficient real-time global illumination. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I do wonder how long it will be before Proton supports it. We only just had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/11/vkd3d-proton-3-0-brings-fsr4-support-shader-backend-rewrite-lots-of-bug-fixes-and-performance-upgrades/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VKD3D-Proton 3.0 released which finally has FSR4 support</a> - so it may be a little while. As always, GamingOnLinux will let you know when we know without any clickbait on it.</p>

      <title>A great showcase of open source - Blender 5.0 is out with completely overhauled colour management</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another release is here for the incredible open source project Blender. The 5.0 release brings huge changes like completely overhauled colour management.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bringing with it a refreshed colour management pipeline that natively supports wide-gamut and HDR colour spaces. This also comes with improvements to their Vulkan support, and is supported on both Linux and Windows. With these improvements you get new display and views including support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACES 1.3 and 2.0 views as an alternative to AgX and Filmic and for compatibility with ACES pipelines (both standard and HDR).</li>
<li>Rec.2100-PQ and Rec.2100-HLG displays. May be used for color grading for <a href="https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/5.0/pipeline_io/#images-movies" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">HDR video export</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/pulls/142758" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AgX HDR</a> view.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Tons more new like much faster material compilation, a new fully realistic skeleton asset from the community, lots of big new rendering features like the Compositor in Blender 5.0 gaining a new asset shelf filled with built-in effects. There's also massive improvements to the Video Sequencer with "unprecedented integration" across different areas of the app, the UV Sync feature has been completely overhauled and enabled by default, there's lots of improvements for XR / VR and the list goes on forever.</p>
<p>On Linux there's also now support for the cursor-shape protocol under Wayland.</p>
<p>Check out their official overview video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4wEqD-jK0DU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a9f936c55ffe5841034904337c42eb85.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4wEqD-jK0DU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking as someone who doesn't work with modelling and the like, this is far from my comfort zone. But, as an open source project it really does showcase how amazing the open source community can be - building something as incredible and feature-filled as this.</p>

      <title>Surviving each day is a fierce battle in the upcoming Primal Survival</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Primal Survival is an upcoming prehistoric game about surviving as Homo habilis or Homo erectus, and it really sounds interesting with the dangerous world.</p>
<p>At the dawn of human history, fire has just been discovered and you're taking steps into a wider world. That's the basics of Primal Survival, it's all about sending you back in time some 2.5–3 million years, where hunting for the basics like food and water is as dangerous as anything else.</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="61mqauOptAw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b3e79da9d68158781681a7d1b4cbcfa.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/61mqauOptAw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some things to expect from it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Paleo-Atmosphere: No zombies, no magic. Just a world populated by scientifically grounded megafauna like Mammoths, Smilodons, and Platybelodons.</li>
<li>Archaic Struggle: There is no modern tech. You rely on stone, bone, and wood. It is about surviving nature exactly as early humans did.</li>
<li>Visuals: We are using Unreal Engine 5.5 (Nanite + Lumen) to create a gritty, dark, and dangerous environment.</li>
<li>Co-op: You can form a tribe with friends to build shelter and stand a chance against the ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking over email about Linux support the developer said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->Linux gaming is important to us, and we know your community values proper support.<br/>
We’re actively working to ensure the game runs well on Linux through Proton, and we’re paying attention to Linux-specific issues throughout development. Supporting Linux players is definitely part of our plans as we move toward the next phases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But why another survival game? What's different about it? They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- squire -->We wanted to move away from fantasy tropes and create a grounded, scientifically based prehistoric experience. Unlike many survival games where you quickly become powerful, our core philosophy is simple: <strong>You are not the hunter. You are the prey.</strong></p>

      <title>I have finished Dispatch and now I&#39;m at a loss so I&#39;m going to play it again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Last night I finished my first run in the new episodic superhero adventure Dispatch from AdHoc Studio, and now I don't know what to do with myself.</p>
<p>So I think I'll treat myself to playing through it again, because there's a good amount of choices that really clearly affect big parts of the overall story, and I can think of numerous times where I would like to do something differently. I even managed to hook in the partner to play it through, and it sounds like they're going to be doing the same with an additional play-through.</p>
<p>It's easily one of the absolute best game of the year by far, and I'm pleased to see it has been a huge success for AdHoc Studio! Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GI.Biz</a>, the developer noted how they expected to hit a specific target within three years that they're now on track to do in only three months.</p>

<p>The game is split into two parts — there's anime-styled cut scenes that allow you to pick between watching like a mini-movie or with quick-time events, and then there's the hero management. The management side of it was great fun too, surprisingly challenging as well with you needing to match up the right hero from your team of reformed villains to each call.</p>
<p>Making it an episodic format like a TV show was a clever move too, with excitement building up for each new episode as they came out in blocks of two. That could have just as easily worked against them, but thankfully it has paid off. Seeing everyone talk about it as the episodes rolled in, seeing the hype — it's an experience that's nice not to miss. And thanks to Valve, no one on Linux / SteamOS has to miss out with Proton running Windows games so nicely.</p>
<p>I'll admit the brief bit of nudity was a surprise in one episode, especially where it opens with a rather spicy scene. Caught me out good that did. Good job I wasn't playing it around anyone else - hah. Definitely not a game to play around younger people.</p>
<p>Dispatch made me <em>really</em> feel something too. You'll know the scenes if you've played it. When a certain speedy character says "keep up" and runs off and bad stuff happens. Then the next episode, in a past memory they say "keep up" again and then it jumps back to now and someone is in hospital. The entire mood of the episode is completely different to everything else. The rain on the map in the management section too, the carefully muted audio - gosh, I felt the sadness in me too. The writing and the voice acting is just, <em>fantastic</em>. It all made me really truly care about the characters that I just had to write something more on the game because it's <em>so</em> good.</p>
<p>That's why I feel like I'm at such a loss. It really truly sucked me in, and I feel a sense of nothing without it right now because it's done and finished.</p>
<p>If you've been sitting on the fence about it just jump off already, it's brilliant. I need more. I really hope for a second season, or just more games that mix things together so nicely like this did. Just more <em>please</em>. I'm starving for it. It's safe to say I'll be jumping right into whatever AdHoc Studio make next if it's anything near this quality level.</p>
<p>The game works perfectly on Desktop Linux and Steam Deck with Proton. Not a single issue encountered. It is one of the most perfect for Steam Deck games I've played.</p>
