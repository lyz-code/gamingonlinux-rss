      <title>Reus 2 announced letting you shape humanity again</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Abbey Games are back and they're making a sequel to Reus, their god game from 2013 where you play as giant beings in control of shaping planets in Reus 2. This time they're being published by Firesquid Games.</p>
<p>"As humanity evolves, learns, and reaches for the stars, it will be entirely up to you to help them uncover both the best and worst of their destinies. Choose to foster and shape human aspirations by helping them achieve their goals or pave a more difficult road. Don’t like what you’ve built or being threatened by an angry, nuclear-armed population? You can always start a new humanity." — Abbey Games</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control Giants:</strong> Step into the shoes of powerful giants as they shape planets. Foster or punish the development of human societies. The choice is yours.</li>
<li><strong>Experiment with Natural Resources:</strong> Using different combinations of flora and fauna makes for new discoveries which will change the human societies that inhabit that world.</li>
<li><strong>Observe and Define Your Own Goals: </strong>Shape the development of humanity and watch as their societies evolve from a primitive tribes into advanced civilizations. Whether they are obsessed space explorers or self-destructive warmongers, who are you to judge their choices?</li>
<li><strong>Leave a Lasting Legacy: </strong>Each playthrough leaves a lasting legacy in the stars - and inspires new paths to take.</li>
</ul>
<p>In regards to Linux desktop and Steam Deck support, I spoke with the developer and they said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're actively seeking to support Steamdeck, since the game would be perfect for it! We're also always looking to support general Linux to the best of our abilities, but since we have no native Linux users, it's always hard to make promises there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875060/Reus_2/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu gets a huge performance boost</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Emulation coding is tricky business done by some people that are clearly 100x smarter than I am, and now the Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu devs are just showing off.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-apr-2023/" target="_blank">April 2023 progress report</a>, they talked about a big performance improvement landing thanks to a rewrite of most of their old buffer cache code, plus work in other areas. The result is that you could see up to 87% better performance, although they said for most people it will probably be about 50%.</p>
<p>Just look at these differences (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13408787661683900749gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13408787661683900749gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16967125741683900750gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16967125741683900750gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They said nothing special is needed to get this boost, you just need to be up to date and set GPU accuracy to "Normal".</p>
<p>Plenty more was mentioned like asynchronous presentation with Vulkan, which is behind a tickbox, because in some cases it might make frametimes less consistent but for a lot of people it might actually make things smoother. It needs more testing for them to be sure where to enable it.</p>
<p>The Linux side of yuzu got some nice improvements too like fixing up the initialization of the Vulkan swapchain on Wayland, making it work better for NVIDIA GPU owners and also a crash with Flatpak was solved too.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 42, the Linux distro for handhelds and consoles v42 is out</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want to get Linux onto your handheld PC or your living room PC console? <a href="https://chimeraos.org/" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> is probably what you're going to want and version 42 has just been released. Since Valve haven't yet released SteamOS 3 currently used on the Steam Deck for everyone, this is probably the next best thing.</p>
<p>It comes with Linux kernel version 6.1.27, Mesa 23.0.2 patched for Intel ANV + Gamescope compatibility and NVIDIA 530.41.03.</p>
<p>For device support, there's plenty of improvements to be found like: support for the GPD WIN 4 with controller, it adds support for the AYANEO 2's TDP controls and launching their Chimera App directly for managing lots of different things like GOG and Epic Games, support for managing the LED's on the AYANEO AIR, AIR Pro, 2, and GEEK devices <em>and</em> there's also fan control support for the AYANEO2 and AYANEO Geek.</p>
<p>They also have a new OpenGamepadUI display session option, which gives their own special custom UI (since the default is the new Steam Big Picture). This is "early Alpha" stuff but it sounds quite interesting as a multi-library launcher system with plugin support.</p>
<p>All changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removed Old Big Picture Mode session and steamos-compositor-plus. It served us well. <em>Valeo.</em></li>
<li>Formatting and mounting of all secondary storage devices has been fixed. For real this time.</li>
<li>Improved the usability and aesthetics of the disk management utility in the chimera app</li>
<li>Added controller support for GPD Win4. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>The Chimera App can now be launched locally on the AYANEO 2 using the LC button. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>The Chimera App now has built-in TDP controls for AYANEO 2</li>
<li>The Chimera App can now be launched locally from the desktop</li>
<li>The Chimera App now shows app/game titles on the Flathub, GOG, and Epic Games Store pages for easy searchability</li>
<li>Fixed the ChimeraOS boot splash screen</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the bootloader generator that failed to pickup additional kernel options</li>
<li>Fixed a race condition with suspend that could cause a device to immediately re-suspend after wake. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug on AYANEO 2 and AYANEO Geek devices that could cause duplicate key-presses. (HandyGCCS)</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with button mapping in RetroArch emulators for devices managed by HandyGCCS.</li>
<li>Updated the device-quirks script for the AOKZOE A1 for systemd-boot. See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Device-Specific-Configurations#aokzoe-a1" target="_blank">guide</a> on usage.</li>
<li>Added two experimental sessions for OpenGamepadUI. These sessions should be considered alpha software and are included for testing purposes only. They are not currently recommended for "daily driving".</li>
<li>Added the AYALED service for control of LED's on AYANEO AIR, AIR Pro, 2, and GEEK devices. See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/Device-Specific-Configurations" target="_blank">guide</a> for usage.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Mangohud would display in the center of the screen for left-rotated displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Mangohud would not display the overlay correctly with systems with multiple CPU cores/threads.</li>
<li>Switched from sudo to polkit for brightness control.</li>
<li>Added the pikaur AUR helper for simpler troubleshooting and development usage. The filesystem must be unlocked in order to use pikaur and it is not recommended for general usage in ChimeraOS.</li>
<li>Exposed fan control support for AYANEO2 and AYANEO Geek in sysfs via the oxp-sensors-dkms driver.</li>
<li>Added <code class="inline-code">export-gpu</code> CLI utility to manage Multi-GPU systems (Useful for Nvidia systems paired with a CPU with an iGPU). See the <a href="https://github.com/ChimeraOS/chimeraos/wiki/General-Configuration#multi-gpu-management-utility-egpu-and-igpu--dedicated-gpu-configurations" target="_blank">guide</a> for usage.</li>

      <title>NVIDIA open sources more of RTX Remix with v0.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released version 0.2 of RTX Remix today, which on top of lots of improvements also opens up their NVIDIA RTX Remix Bridge.</p>
<p>What is it? A modding platform that allows people to make "RTX remasters" of various older games enhancing them with Ray Tracing and DLSS. It does this with thanks to the DXVK translation layer, which NVIDIA now have their own fork of just for this. This is the same tech NVIDIA used for Portal with RTX.</p>
<p>As of the 0.2 release they've now also open source the Remix Runtime Bridge, from the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/bridge-remix/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The NVIDIA RTX Remix project allows bringing high quality pathtraced rendering, lighting, shadows etc. into classic games. This repo contains the NVIDIA RTX Remix Bridge client and server components required for enabling a 32-bit game to interact with the 64-bit Remix Runtime dll.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So eventually we might see a whole bunch of mods for older DirectX 8 and 9 games, to give them fancy new rendering features. Although, NVIDIA do say on their roadmap they eventually plan to support OpenGL games as well. They should all be easy enough to get running on Linux, since Remix ends up with Vulkan thanks to their use of DXVK.</p>
<p>All the changes from the 0.2 release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Remix Runtime Bridge is now open source on GitHub! You can find the repo <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/bridge-remix" target="_blank">here</a>!</li>
<li>Many Bridge improvements have gone into this release to address various game compatibility issues:
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with shader parser logic that helps with Shader Model 2+ games.</li>
<li>Fixed surface data pitch issue that was leading to crashes in some games.</li>
<li>Added support for games that change the main window handle on <code class="inline-code">Reset()</code>.</li>
<li>Allow <code class="inline-code">null</code> vertex declaration on server to fix unnecessary failures in some situations.</li>
<li>Properly initialize render state according to the official DirectX9 documentation to fix geometry corruption in some games.</li>
<li>Handle <code class="inline-code">CreateTextureXXX()</code> calls with <code class="inline-code">levels = 0</code> to fix geometry corruption in some games.</li>
<li>Fixed mouse input processing for games where the mouse pointer would not move in the game or with the Remix menu opened, and added other DirectInput fixes for games using different exclusive modes. Also added optional input message pump hook that is needed for some games.</li>
<li>Better matching of the native D3D9 behavior when dealing with shaders and swapchain initialization.</li>
<li>Added more input validation on client and server side – the server is now properly returning failure codes to the client where failure is allowable.</li>
<li>Added DPI awareness to the bridge client so that the game window gets scaled and mouse input is handled properly on displays with higher than 100% DPI.</li>
<li>Optimized how the <code class="inline-code">SharedHeap</code> works to reduce crashes at launch and require less finetuning of its settings. Since the <code class="inline-code">SharedHeap</code> can still lead to issues in certain games we switched it to be turned off by default, but it can be enabled in <code class="inline-code">bridge.conf</code> with the <code class="inline-code">useSharedHeap</code> setting.</li>
<li>Added forced window client option <code class="inline-code">client.forceWindowed</code> to <code class="inline-code">bridge.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DXVK-Remix improvements and game compatibility fixes:
<ul>
<li>Improvements to culling issues–Remix now includes an initial set of heuristics to work around engine-side culling.</li>
<li>Improved handling of alpha-tested geometry that uses fractional ("feathered") alpha.</li>
<li>Improved detection of shadow volumes.</li>
<li>Support for capturing normals in vertex capture path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvements to RTX Remix menus and documentation: expanded and clarified the existing documentation, and added tooltips in the UI to make it more accessible.</li>
<li>Debug symbols for the release are now available in a separate <code class="inline-code">remix-0.2.0-symbols.zip</code> package to make debugging the source code from the compiled binaries easier.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mechabellum is an auto-battling Supreme Commander - I&#39;m completely hooked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mechabellum is a new Early Access release from Game River and Paradox Arc (the publishing arm of Paradox Interactive). It's an auto-battler like say Dota Underlords and Auto Chess, but with big mech units with battles like Supreme Commander.</p>
<p>Safe to say, it is absolutely my sort of thing. Quick games, lots of explosions and plenty of strategy. So TriplePoint PR sent over a key and I've been playing it to see if this may be the next big thing. Working out of the box on desktop Linux with Proton 8.0-2, this is absolutely going to be my next multiple-hundred hour game. I can already feel it's teeth sinking into my brain as I just want to play one more game constantly.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4Rj3sgSQLdU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a852bb365d0e49a5397cb237e89e309.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4Rj3sgSQLdU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>After blasting through a few of the solo tutorials to get me started, I quickly jumped into online games doing 1v1 battles and honestly, I was impressed with it very quickly. It takes the basic idea of an auto-battler, but just makes it so much more entertaining than any that came before. Who doesn't love lots of explosions, lasers and missiles firing everywhere while you sit back and watch the fireworks hoping your idea will work for this round?</p>
<p><em>I don't want to put it down. I might even have to cancel my dinner plans tonight, I need to play more.</em></p>
<p>I'm not very good at it yet mind you, I've been repeatedly stomped into the ground by everyone having much better ideas on what units to unlock and deploy each round but I'm having fun and that's the main thing. It really does look quite a bit like the classic RTS Supreme Commander, but on a much smaller scale with games that aren't hours long. Exactly what I want right now.</p>
<p>You have a really great mixture of units to deploy to from tiny nuisances, which are great to pull the attention from bigger enemies, to massive mechs and everything in between. Everything has a strength and weakness, although there are some balancing issues the developer needs to sort. Starting off by picking your commander to get your first units and bonuses, it's then a tug of war each round as you pick a new unit to unlock, deploy up to 2 additional units and then position them. Plus, you get to sprinkle in some especial abilities like a bombing run, sneaky units you can place behind enemy lines and even big storms to really screw with your opponent.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7429491881683893492gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7429491881683893492gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The idea is just to destroy all the enemy units, or as many as you can until the 60 second round timer ends. How many units you have left will be how much health you take away from your opponent, so you want as many as possible left. Once your opponent or you reach zero health, it's then game over. Taking down one or both of the enemy towers is a safe bet, if you can get there, as it then gives a momentary slowdown to enemy units and that can be quite devastating but they get put back each round.</p>
<p>At the start of each round you get to upgrade units to give them an overall buff, plus give them additional upgrade which affects other similar units. You also have your two towers, which also have upgrades available on each, to buff up all your units. Everything you do has a cost though, with the game having a single resource for everything so it means you really have to think between new units and what to upgrade.</p>
<p>Since it's an auto-battler, one you've finished deploying and upgrading, it's down to the AI to hopefully crush the other side and it's quite <em>epic </em>to watch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4543147071683893914gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4543147071683893914gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Rarely does a brand new release get such intense excitement from me, I only hope the community sticks around for it to give it a longer life than other auto-battlers. It has all the makings of a great game. I'm off to go play some more now.</p>
<p><em>Early Access is planned to last around 12 months.</em></p>
<p>You can buy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/" target="_blank">Mechabellum on Steam</a> but it will be eventually free to play.</p>

      <title>DXVK 2.2 released supporting D3D11On12, plus improvements for game launchers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>DXVK translates Direct3D 9 / 10 and 11 into Vulkan for Proton and Wine, used on Linux desktop and Steam Deck for gaming. The new DXVK 2.2 release sounds like quite a big one, and just shows how awesome open source is. Once it's ready and in a new Proton release, we should see another nice little bump in game compatibility.</p>
<p>The first big one is support for D3D11On12, Microsoft's own layer "which maps graphics commands from D3D11 to D3D12". DXVK does this with the help of VKD3D-Proton (the Direct3D 12 to Vulkan translation layer) and is required for D3D12 support in recent Unity Engine titles such as Lego Builder's Journey according to the DXVK team. To test that right now you need a recent build of VKD3D-Proton.</p>
<p>Another nice addition is support for D3D9 Partial Presentation, which should improve compatibility with various game launchers, "particularly those based on Microsoft's WPF toolkit, and some visual novels". The downside is that it has a noticeable "performance hit".</p>
<p>There's also some specific game fixes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jade Empire.</li>
<li>Sid Meier's Pirates.</li>
<li>Total War: Shogun 2.</li>
<li>Battle Fantasia Revised Edition.</li>
<li>Cold Fear.</li>
<li>Dawn of Magic 2.</li>
<li>DC Universe Online.</li>
<li>Far Cry 2.</li>
<li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</li>
<li>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus these other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent RE Engine games performance fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue wherein threads were not properly destroyed.</li>
<li>Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by incorrect layout tracking when enabling feedback loops for a texture.</li>
<li>Fixed Vulkan validation errors caused by 0x0 sized clears in D3D9.</li>
<li>Improved usage of some VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state3 features to avoid hitting slow paths on some drivers.</li>
<li>Significantly reduced memory usage in situations where games create unused D3D11 devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.2" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt an upcoming Proton Experimental release will include it, as always I'll let you know when that happens.</p>

      <title>World Turtles is a city-builder on the back of a space turtle out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>City-builders come in all shapes and sizes and now you can build on the back of a massive turtle flying through space in World Turtles.</p>
<p>Now in Early Access released on May 1st, it's certainly an interesting idea, and reminds me on the basic idea found in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/the-wandering-village-gets-gamepad-and-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">The Wandering Village</a> which I very much loved. While you're dealing with building up your city, you're also dealing with the fact that you're in space and your turtle friend might go into some dangerous areas. Check out the launch trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="y8DBSWXQkYA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b646cf2ce75267163d192b539decb9c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/y8DBSWXQkYA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer said they expect Early Access to last at least 1 year, possibly longer depending on feedback and just how much they decide to add into the game.</p>
<p>Right now it has the basic core mechanics of resources gathering, climate issues, research, health, terrain interaction and so on. Plus different characteristics of space but it all needs to be fleshed-out with more of everything and just making your decisions have more impact to the overall journey. Some of what they plan to add includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Populating more of the existing game systems and mechanics, especially the interaction of the Turtle and the Meeps with Space. A part of this lies in the already kicked-off Space Resources that are obtained through various interactions with Space.</li>
<li>Adding a Culture / Art mechanic similar to the current Research mechanic, where different building types can contribute to industry-specific progress.</li>
<li>Expanding the random map generator and map builder to include more variety and randomness that actually change the way a map plays out.</li>
<li>Expanding into higher tier buildings, moving into the services industry rather than raw resource gathering.</li>
<li>Adding more focused challenges with a variety of clearly defined goals. Also, mini-challenges with certain risks and rewards will liven up normal free-play games.</li>
<li>Eventually, making a map editor with ever-increasing functionality available to players. I already use a crude editor for development.</li>
<li>Possibly adding a Campaign - this requires game mechanics, systems and behind the scenes data structures to be largely settled.</li>
<li>I would love to eventually add some multiplayer / Co-op functionality so players could interact with each other's worlds, but that's a while away...</li>
</ul>

      <title>Mesa graphics drivers 23.1.0 out now with RADV GPL enabled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh release of Mesa is now available, the set of open source graphics drivers for Linux and Steam Deck with v23.1.0 out now.</p>
<p>This is actually quite an important one for AMD GPUs (like the Steam Deck), since it comes with enabled support for Vulkan Graphics Pipeline Libraries (GPL). With this feature, the shader stutter you would usually see before it's built up in a game should be vastly reduced and so overall we should see smoother gaming performance on Linux with AMD GPUs thanks to this.</p>
<p>From the release <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-announce/2023-May/000720.html" target="_blank">announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some highlights:<br/>
- Our OpenCL implementation Rusticl added support for AMD GPUs.<br/>
- Both ANV (Intel) and RADV (AMD) got initial support for Vulkan Video<br/>
  decoding.<br/>
- Vulkan Graphics Pipeline Libraries (GPL) are now supported in RADV.</p>
<p>New extensions &amp; features (in no particular order):<br/>
- VK_EXT_pipeline_library_group_handles on RADV<br/>
- VK_EXT_image_sliced_view_of_3d on RADV/GFX10+<br/>
- VK_KHR_map_memory2 on ANV and RADV<br/>
- fullyCoveredFragmentShaderInputVariable on RADV/GFX9+<br/>
- VK_EXT_discard_rectangles version 2 on RADV<br/>
- VK_EXT_graphics_pipeline_library on RADV<br/>
- extendedDynamicState3ColorBlendEquation on RADV<br/>
- primitiveUnderestimation on RADV/GFX9+<br/>
- VK_KHR_fragment_shading_rate on RADV/GFX11<br/>
- VK_EXT_mesh_shader on RADV/GFX11<br/>
- RGP support on RADV/GFX11<br/>
- GL_NV_alpha_to_coverage_dither_control on r600/evergreen+</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you'll be able to get it depends on what Linux distribution you're on. They all have different update schedules so refer back to their roadmaps. As for Steam Deck directly, this should hopefully be in the next major SteamOS update with 3.5 coming out sometime soonish on <em>Valve Time</em>.</p>

      <title>ASUS ROG Ally releases in June priced competitively to the Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ASUS has today formally revealed all about their handheld gaming PC, the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-2023/" target="_blank">ROG Ally</a> and it's releasing in June with a pretty competitive price. It runs Windows 11, so for the GamingOnLinux followers, it may not exactly be what you're after. However, with handheld PC gaming rising, especially with the Linux powered Steam Deck, it's good to keep an eye on the competition right?</p>
<p>Today they revealed the pricing after many leaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD Ryzen Z1 model: $599 - launching in Q3.</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme model: $699 - launching June 13th.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6690977911683815731gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6690977911683815731gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Picture source - ASUS YouTube</em></p>
<p>Goes without saying really but I will anyway: I will be sticking to the Steam Deck and desktop Linux. Just because something new comes along, doesn't mean I'm going to instantly jump towards it. Not everyone has money to burn every time something a bit more powerful comes along.</p>
<p>IGN already have a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-review" target="_blank">review</a> of it up and it sounds overall like a good device, with battery life also not long when playing bigger games like the Steam Deck. They do make a point that the initial experience with Windows 11 and ASUS Armoury Crate being a nuisance.</p>
<p>It will definitely be interesting to watch how this will affect the Steam Deck though. Competition is absolutely good! It benefits everyone and it pushes all sides to do better. Plus, the more companies that show there's a demand for handheld gaming like this, the better the future will be for it, including a potential Steam Deck 2.</p>

      <title>Explosive exploration-mining game BLASTRONAUT gets a watery upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BLASTRONAUT is a bit of an indie gem, a mining exploration game about blowing up the world beneath you to collect resources. The latest update is a bit <em>wet</em>.</p>
<p>In the update named Aqueous, the developer has added in a full liquid simulation system, which they said they put a lot of effort into optimizing and ensuring it runs well on the Steam Deck too. Looks pretty great in action too, giving you a world that seems quite a lot more alive with it. Starting to feel a little more like <a href="http://Noita" target="_blank">Noita</a> now in a way, although with a very different overall theme.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/903303161683804892gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/903303161683804892gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>This update also introduces new large-scale machinery to build, allowing you to get a bit more industrial with your underground mining operations. There's a whole bunch more automation with drones included in this update too, giving you a helping hand moving resources around. Plenty more, here's the highlights of what's been added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1. Liquid simulation.</li>
<li>2. Submerged biome.</li>
<li>2. Drill machine - converts fuel to resources.</li>
<li>3. Pump machine - converts water to fuel.</li>
<li>4. Automation with 3 transport drones (storage, crafting, selling).</li>
<li>5. Mobile construction mode with 3 construction tools.</li>
<li>6. Displaying stats under storage and crafting machines.</li>
<li>7. Modules can be added to crafting machines.</li>
<li>8. More info about module benefits in the construction view.</li>
<li>9. Ability to destroy modules.</li>
<li>10. New showcase scenario for the added construction features.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It was already quite fun but a bit lacking in content, however with this update there's quite a lot more to do - great to see it expand. The developer said this update is simply laying the foundation for another big upgrade to come which sounds exciting.</p>
<p><em>Full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1392650/view/3686802895182488007" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1392650/BLASTRONAUT/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and works great on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>We have to wait a bit longer for Hollow Knight: Silksong</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hollow Knight is probably one of the most popular 2D metroidvania action-adventures available on PC and the follow-up, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is looking like it's going to take a while longer to release.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Matthew Griffin from Team Cherry mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey gang, just a quick update about Silksong.</p>
<p>We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We're excited by how the game is shaping up, and it's gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can. </p>
<p>Expect more details from us once we get closer to release.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A shame, but given how people dote on Hollow Knight, perhaps it's best they just take all the time they need and not end up as another rushed-out release like we've seen recently.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pFAknD_9U7c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e974b252dc76c3b010aef5a6a3b94bd8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pFAknD_9U7c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Play as Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, and adventure through a whole new kingdom ruled by silk and song! Captured and brought to this unfamiliar world, Hornet must battle foes and solve mysteries as she ascends on a deadly pilgrimage to the kingdom’s peak.<br/>
<br/>
Hollow Knight: Silksong is the epic sequel to Hollow Knight, the award winning action-adventure. As the lethal hunter Hornet, journey to all-new lands, discover new powers, battle vast hordes of bugs and beasts and uncover ancient secrets tied to your nature and your past."</p>
<p>If you've still somehow not played Hollow Knight you can buy it from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hollow-knight?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> (50% off until May 23rd).

      <title>Dead by Daylight gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, I've been waiting to see what the public official word would be on Dead by Daylight and now it's official. Dead by Daylight is now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/dead-by-daylight-now-works-on-linux-desktop-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank">Recently I wrote</a> about how it had been working for a week, with no public word from the developer. But now it's Steam Deck Verified by Valve with the official DBD Twitter account has <a href="https://twitter.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1656345021598121984" target="_blank">announcing</a> it too, plus they highlighted it on their Steam announcements as well. So you don't get much more official than that. For Deck Verified, Valve set it to use Proton 8.0-2 by default.</p>
<p>You can see my previous video on it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sEqpy3yVhsQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/32932b6ab9d9c126c92529844b98585e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sEqpy3yVhsQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Plus I did a recent <a href="https://youtube.com/live/AlEP9LwmLrA?feature=share" target="_blank">YouTube Livestream</a> showing it off as well.</p>
<p>This is excellent news, as one of the most popular multiplayer games on Steam, having it all official is fantastic. And yes, it works just fine on desktop Linux as well. Even on the Steam Deck, it runs at 60FPS on Medium settings, you don't exactly need a lot of power to get good performance out of it.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us closer to playable on Steam Deck, but the Deck still has RAM problems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last of Us Part I from Naughty Dog has another big performance patch out, and the result on Steam Deck is quite surprising. But the Steam Deck still suffers from a major problem.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, on low details with FSR2 set to Quality, you're far more likely now to be able to hit 30FPS in lots of sections of the game on Steam Deck. Plenty of dips here and there though, but it's certainly a drastic improvement over how it was at launch. The <a href="https://feedback.naughtydog.com/hc/en-us/articles/15404598599444-The-Last-of-Us-Part-I-v1-0-5-0-Patch-Notes-for-PC" target="_blank">v1.0.5.0</a> patch includes many assorted optimizations, and the game even looks better now on the Low and Medium graphics presets as they've fixed up a bunch of texture and lighting problems.</p>
<p>The biggest annoyance though, is one I and others have seen a few times now, where the Steam Deck shows in the performance overlay hitting about 14GB RAM and then the game suddenly stutters and crawls down in FPS and eventually just stops. After a while, it then reboots the Steam Deck (<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6653#issuecomment-1542434631" target="_blank">bug reported</a>). A problem also seen in <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/5511#issuecomment-1399504207" target="_blank">God of War</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6559" target="_blank">Sons of the Forest</a>, Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Horizon Zero Dawn and no doubt plenty of other bigger games I've yet to play. An issue Valve has yet to solve or formally comment on but the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/cryoutilities-2-boosts-steam-deck-performance/" target="_blank">CryoUtilities scripts</a> can help with in some cases.</p>
<p>Check out my video for more:</p>

<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Direct3D 8 to Vulkan translator D8VK &#39;production-ready&#39; 1.0 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>D8VK translates Direct3D 8 to Vulkan, just like DXVK for Direct3D 9 / 10 / 11 and VKD3D-Proton for Direct3D 12 used with Wine and Proton on Linux and Steam Deck. Fantastic to see the progress on this. I reported <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/d8vk-is-an-in-progress-implementation-of-direct3d-8-for-dxvk/" target="_blank">on an earlier release</a>, but now the "production-ready" 1.0 is available for you to play with.</p>
<p>In the release notes the developer mentioned "This is the first production-ready release of d8vk that has been tested against many hundreds of games with better performance and compatibility than is possible with WineD3D or d3d8to9".</p>
<p>The developer also included a bunch of benchmarks in 3DMark 2001 SE to show the differences in performance between different translations:</p>

      <title>Stellaris: Galactic Paragons released, along with free 3.8 update adding co-op modes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A big one for Stellaris is here with the Stellaris: Galactic Paragons expansion launched along with the 3.8 "Gemini" patch for all players. Stellaris: Galactic Paragons expands the political system quite a bit with some new features, allowing for a fair bit more role-play with specialized abilities.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/177172581683719608gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/177172581683719608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's what Stellaris: Galactic Paragons offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Council Roles: Specialized roles and benefits are included in Galactic Paragons to expand upon the new Council Mechanics in Stellaris! Find dozens of unique council roles based on your civics and government types, and unlock additional positions as your empire evolves.</li>
<li>New Dynamic Leaders: Recruit, improve, and follow the leaders of your empire through the ages! You may shape them by picking their traits, selecting their veteran class, and guide them towards their destiny, up until they retire - or perish!</li>
<li>Meet Galactic Heroes: Attract paragons of renown to your council: unique leaders with their own art, events, and stories may join your empire and bring their own benefits to your government. Or, discover four Legendary Paragons with intricate event chains and unique mechanics!</li>
<li>New Traditions, Civics, And More:
<ul>
<li>A new “Under One Rule” Origin that tells the tale of the leader who founded your empire</li>
<li>Eight new Civics focused on leadership, from immortalizing the personalities of leaders past in digital archives to heavily optimized council selection via corporate charter</li>
<li>12 new Veteran Classes</li>
<li>Hundreds of new Leader Traits</li>
<li>Two new Tradition Trees, giving players new edicts and improved leaders</li>
<li>New ships, art, and story content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="n1bU_6Qy6Mo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/eb2b82a36b4100c3809e65222f6d3df2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/n1bU_6Qy6Mo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The free 3.8 patch also brings with it the new co-op modes which sound very useful. The modes are classed as being in Beta, meaning there might still be some issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooperative PvE allows players to join together to take on enemies as a single empire. This more relaxed gaming environment is conducive to teaching others how to play the game or dividing responsibilities of empire management.</li>
<li>Cooperative PvP allows groups of players to join opposing empires and fight against each other. This division of duties may be less overwhelming and reduce barriers to entry for non-competitive players. For those who are more competitive, empires can also be locked and require a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>The entire patch notes can be seen on the <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/dev-team-3-8-gemini-galactic-paragons-is-available-now-full-patch-notes-inside.1580562/" target="_blank">Paradox Forum</a>. As usual they're quite extensive, with lots of overall improvements to many of the game's systems.</p>

      <title>Open source evolution sim Thrive adds prototypes for going on land</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thrive is a free and open source in-development evolution sim, a bit like a more scientific version of EA's Spore and Thrive 0.6.2 expands the gameplay even more with some new prototypes.</p>
<p>It already has quite an expansive underwater cell-stage, where you build up your life-form from nothing. Now though, they're beginning the expansion into later stages of life - although it's very early. They've added in "raw prototypes" of basic land evolution, just to show more of what they plan for the game.</p>
<p>On top of that there's new 3D backgrounds for the menu, their membrane generation algorithm is now massively faster, compound cloud visuals have been improved, a new late multicellular stage underwater panoramic background, 2 new multicellular prototype organelles, separation between divided cells and colonies is now much better, various UI improvements and lots of bug fixes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jRjg7QndzxE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/21a8912bd117fa96415963bb29fe1e71.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jRjg7QndzxE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From their development <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/devblog-37-background-technology-unlocked/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, it sounds like they have even grander scale plans for the game to eventually let you go into space too. So this is going to be a full life evolution sim. Given their impressive work with the early cell stage, there's a lot to look forward to.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development or download it <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/" target="_blank">direct</a> or via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.revolutionarygamesstudio.ThriveLauncher" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>The 2D massive space epic Starsector gets a big upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Starsector is something quite special, originally called Starfarer it's been in development for quite a few years now and a big new release is now available.</p>
<p>This latest update has been in the works for years as well, with the last major release upgrade being in 2021. The developers aren't in a rush though, with the game already being crammed full of features and content and it still has some of the absolute best 2D real-time space combat around. Not just the action though, the ship artwork is something else too, with tons of awesome detail to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20454342801683638996gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20454342801683638996gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's hard to properly describe the game because it blends together elements from so many different genres. The developers say it's an "open-world single-player space-combat, roleplaying, exploration, and economic game". So it's basically a big open-world space epic.</p>
<p>Their trailer may be years old, but it still sells it well and shows off many parts of it:</p>

<p>Here's what's new in Starsector 0.96a:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Take on new missions exploring the story of the Luddic Church and the Sindrian Diktat.</li>
<li>Cut deals Warlord Kanta’s pirates or Luddic Path fanatics to stop their attacks… though peace may come at a high price.</li>
<li>Fly new ships, including 5 new capital-class hulls and numerous smaller vessels.</li>
<li>Acquire new weapons, including a lineup of missiles that shoot lasers (“Directed Energy Munitions”).</li>
<li>Face faction fleets with distinct identities driven by the new ships and weapons.</li>
<li>Deal with hostile activity at your colonies and master hyperspace navigation using the new “Event” system.</li>
<li>Build hullmods into ships to gain unique bonuses.</li>
<li>Additional illustrations, portraits, descriptions and encounters help bring the Sector to life.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you love single-player space RPGs, this is one you should take a look at. A total joy every time it gets a big update, because I just know it's going to once again suck away hours of my time.</p>
<p>You can buy it <a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/" target="_blank">direct from the developer</a>, it's not available on other stores.</p>

      <title>Need a new controller? The 8BitDo Ultimate C 2.4G looks great</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in need of a new controller, the 8BitDo Ultimate C might just be what you need as 8BitDo revealed their slimmed-down version of their pricier Ultimate.</p>
<p>Very similar to the original Ultimate which is my current favourite controller, although the Ultimate C does away with the customization via their app and removes the back buttons (which you couldn't use on Linux / SteamOS anyway). You also only get the controller and the dongle, whereas the plain Ultimate gives you a charging dock too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3132264131683628623gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Honestly though, for £24.99 / $29.99, with the same build quality as the standard Ultimate — this C variant is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>Pretty wide compatibility too across Raspberry Pi OS, SteamOS (Steam Deck), Android and Windows. Fun to see their official site list things like the Steam Deck and Raspberry Pi OS directly too. Should work just like the plain Ultimate on desktop Linux too, once you set up the needed udev rules (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/zmvkdj/8bitdo_ultimate_bluetooth_controller_working_in/" target="_blank">Fedora example</a>) which worked for me.</p>
<p>Available in Green or Purple on Amazon, releasing at the end of May:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B0C2V3QPN7" target="_blank">UK Green</a> / <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Windows-PC-Raspberry/dp/B0C2V3QPN7/" target="_blank">USA Green</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B0C2V6JLNJ" target="_blank">UK Purple</a> / <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2V6JLNJ" target="_blank">USA Purple</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If wireless isn't your thing though, they're also doing a cheaper <em>wired</em> version of the same controller in the same colours:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultimate-Controller-Compatible-Windows-Raspberry/dp/B0C2TW2X65" target="_blank">UK Green</a> / (no USA green listing up yet)</li>

      <title>Swarm Grinder is a very unique horde-game now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love anything remotely similar to Vampire Survivors and other horde-style auto-shooters, you might want to take a look at Swarm Grinder. Note: key provided by the developer.</p>
<p>Available now with Native Linux support in Early Access, Swarm Grinder is an action rogue-lite game where you control a single character with auto-firing weapons. Here, you're presented with a randomised map each time, which is full of strange looking cells you need to erase that regrow to surround you. As you erase them to make a path, various types of enemies will spawn from inside the darker coloured cells for you to battle. And occasionally, you also get a big wave where a whole bunch of cells explode around you with lots of enemies coming at you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3059520341683566518gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3059520341683566518gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The problem is the clock on your fuel is always ticking. You have to keep moving, to destroy enemies who will occasionally drop fuel. If you run out of fuel, it will start quickly reducing your health. This mechanic makes quick-thinking essential and it's really challenging.</p>
<p>In the one mode currently available, your mission is to race through the cells across the map, to find 25 mining zones to clear. Once you clear a zone, a pod drops down that releases three power-ups that you get to choose one from. These are a mix of extra weapons, ability buffs or upgrades to weapons. The problem at the start, is you don't know what they are until you pick them up. On top of that, extra weapons reduce your fuel at an increased rate so it's a toss-up between more weapons and less fuel or ability buffs every time you clear a mining area. I'm not overly keen on the fuel system being tied to the weapons, as it feels just a bit <em>too</em> punishing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7001182381683567230gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7001182381683567230gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The fuel system serves <em>another</em> purpose though, other than to just keep you constantly moving and battling to get more. If you overfill your tank, it gives you a nice ability buff and that can really help you out in a pinch. Especially as if you manage to get surrounded by one false move, it's pretty much game over which is another problem. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1326720861683568756gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1326720861683568756gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>During you run you might also find golden nuggets to destroy (pictured below), which will give you currency towards the permanent upgrades system. They take longer to destroy though than most creatures, and you don't get a lot of them, making it take quite long time before you really start getting some of those upgrades which end up essential for getting further into a run. However, if you collect a few and last a while, you'll also get a time bonus that gives you a few extra of these upgrade shards.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11655466801683567755gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11655466801683567755gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently I <em>cannot</em> recommend playing Swarm Grinder on <strong>Steam Deck</strong>, as the performance is pretty problematic. The effect of removing the mass of cells drags down the performance constantly (often below 30FPS), making it a hassle to play. The developer is aware of this, as it affects some lower-end PCs as well. On desktop Linux though, performance has been <em>great</em> on my main Fedora KDE 38 system.</p>
<p>I'm very keen to see how this game evolves, because they have an absolutely <strong>fantastic</strong> idea with a solid foundation, that really needs some balancing on the weapons, fuel and pickups. That said, even with the issues, it's already a lot of fun to play through.</p>

      <title>Goodbye to Roblox on Linux with their new anti-cheat and Wine blocking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You might have seen <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/roblox-intentionally-blocking-linux-with-wine-in-their-new-update/" target="_blank">recently that I covered</a> the upcoming updates for Roblox, and now it's here blocking Wine with their new anti-cheat. This means you won't be able to play it on Linux any more, at all, unless you find some sort of special workaround.</p>
<p>Previously the roll-out of this update was being tested only with some users. Now though it's here for everyone giving a 64 bit client and introducing their Hyperion anti-cheat software which they are intentionally blocking Wine with. Naturally plenty of Roblox fans on Linux are upset by this, asking their team for updates on what their plans are.</p>
<p>In a fresh statement on their official developer forum one of their staff <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/proper-support-for-the-linux-platform/56544/88" target="_blank">said this</a>, in reply to users asking about updates in regards to Linux support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi - thanks for the question. I definitely get where you’re coming from, and as you point out, you deserve a clear, good-faith answer. Unfortunately that answer is essentially “no.”</p>
<p>From a personal perspective, a lot of people at Roblox would love to support Linux (including me). Practically speaking, there’s just no way for us to justify it. If we release a client, we have to support it, which means QA, CS, documentation, etc., all of which is much more difficult on a fragmented platform. We release weekly on a half-dozen platforms. Adding in the time to test, debug, and release a Linux client would be expensive, which means time taken away from improving Roblox on our current platforms.</p>
<p>Even Wine support is difficult because of anti-cheat. As wonderful as it would be to allow Roblox under Wine, the number of users who would take advantage of that is minuscule compared with our other platforms, and it’s not worthwhile if it makes it easy for exploiters to cheat.</p>
<p>I’m sorry to be such a downer about this, but it’s the reality. We have to spend our time porting to and supporting the platforms that will grow our community.</p>
<p>Again, I’m personally sorry to have to say this. Way back in 2000 I had a few patches accepted into the kernel, and I led the port of Roblox game servers from Windows to Linux several years ago. From a technical and philosophical perspective, it would be a wonderful thing to do. But our first responsibility is to our overall community, and the opportunity cost of supporting a Linux client is far, far too high to justify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're clearly not going to be releasing a Native Linux build, which I think most people probably <em>already</em> knew, but at least previously they repeatedly said that Wine was a "priority" to support but now it doesn't sound as likely going by the above.</p>

      <title>Re:Touring is a clever, accessible and polished first-person puzzler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you enjoy first-person puzzlers like Portal and The Talos Principle then you'll likely feel right at home with Re:Touring. <em>Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>The premise here is pretty simple - you're visiting an old facility and inside are various rooms to progress through where you'll be tapping buttons and making machines work by matching up colours. So you'll be opening doors, controlling moving platforms and there's even some lasers to deal with too.</p>
<p>It doesn't do a whole lot when it comes to story-telling, mainly focusing on your progress through the 26 puzzle rooms but there is a little environmental story-telling you can pick up on. I quite liked the very relaxed casual nature to it, with you being able to just dive right into the puzzle-solving. With plenty of hints available for each puzzle if you need them too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DggKbFguLQg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27e04efe64b62a2d10d76c5a96623582.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DggKbFguLQg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Re:Touring starts off nice and simple, with you just tapping a single button on a machine to change the colour it outputs. These simplistic patterns get more complicated though, with multiple rows of buttons to define what colour will be output based on what colour the machine currently sees and more. Then you get rooms with multiple puzzles, and a few basic timers but nothing about it makes you feel rushed.</p>
<p>Don't let the early simplicity of it fool you, once you get to the double-digit levels, it will take a little bit more thought and some head-scratching but not enough to stress you out. The whole thing feels very nicely put together and well thought-out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15767075951683561886gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15767075951683561886gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Enjoyed my time with this one, there were a few times I needed to get hints but not many. The hint system was a nice touch, letting you sit down in the corner of a room and get a first basic clue and then multiple more clues after if needed to really explain things. </p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solve varied puzzles by creating matching colour patterns.</li>
<li>Uncover the history of the facility by searching for clues in the game.</li>
<li>Most levels will introduce a new game mechanic.</li>
<li>Hint system will help you if you get stuck.</li>
<li>Accessibility features like closed captions, colour presets for colour blindness and simple controls.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve gave Steam store search a very useful upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a fresh upgrade to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> store search, making it a lot more useful so here's a run over what's new and improved.</p>
<p>Previously, searching for something on Steam would only take into account the name of the game. Good if you knew what you're looking for exactly but now it searches across more of Steam. The auto-suggest drop-down will now show suggested tags and categories, developers, publishers and franchises too.</p>
<p>First example is searching for SEGA, where it will give a few games and then the publisher page too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412004731683557097gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412004731683557097gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then you could also search for a particular tag like "strategy" and have games show up along with tag suggestions:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5925044001683557098gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5925044001683557098gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They're also now handling typos a bit better too, matching up names a bit closer so you don't always have to have the exact name to search for something.</p>
<p>All part of Valve's continued work to help visibility on Steam, a problem that has grown over time with more and more games releasing on Steam. It's a crowded market but now Steam has so many different ways to discover games, hopefully you will be able to find what you want.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3686801719533364952" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>Nreal Air and Steam Deck together - quite mind-blowing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently I was sent over a package with the <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/air/" target="_blank">Nreal Air</a>, so I've spent a fair bit of time testing out these AR glasses with the Steam Deck to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>To say they've blown my mind would be quite the understatement. It's really a case of seeing is believing, and no amount of photos or videos can really do such a thing enough justice. But before all that, what exactly are they? Well, they're glasses that have screens built into them, to give you a truly personal full cinema experience. You can hook them up to many things like the Steam Deck, and various consoles (with an adapter).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11953315021683545207gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>When it comes to using them with the Steam Deck, it's quite literally plug and play. You plug a cable into the end of one of the temples that goes behind your ear, then the other end into the Steam Deck and away you go. There's simply no fussing involved. After that, put them on and you'll get a huge screen right in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>Originally I didn't think I would ever get to test these. I saw a few others across Twitter had them, so I posted about it and eventually some PR / marketing team emailed me about it. Problem is this first team wanted a <em>paid</em> review, asking for my "rates". After clearly telling them I don't do that, they never replied again. A short moan on Twitter later, and a completely different team that works with Nreal reached out and straight-up offered a pair with <em>no</em> strings attached. Exactly the way I like to cover anything, and the only way I like doing it, so there’s nothing holding me back or really influencing my thoughts. </p>
<p>Basic Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>148mm x 52mm x 159mm (opened).</li>
<li>148mm x 52mm x 60mm (folded).</li>
<li>3-Position adjustment for optimal gaze angle.</li>
<li>Head width from 120-186mm.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm no stranger to having something strapped to my face. I have a Valve Index, and I love it. Playing Half-Life: Alyx is an experience I'll never forget and absolutely one of my favourite gaming experiences — ever. However, this is quite a different beast. You're not <em>inside</em> the games like with VR, as with AR glasses it's more about giving you a massive flat screen that follows you around as you move your head so it's always in focus and following you.</p>
<p>Nreal have managed something quite extraordinary here. Not only are they reasonably stylish with quite a low profile, as they're actually quite small, they're surprisingly light too. Someone looking at you across a table probably can't even tell there's anything special about them. Which is good, I was worried they might look a bit ridiculous on, but to my surprise they look pretty nice actually.</p>
<p>A bit heavier than any normal glasses or sunglasses though. After a few minutes of wearing them, the feeling of them sort-of fades away as you get engrossed into your game. It certainly helps that the speaker quality is actually very good and impressively clear too.</p>
<p>Fitting different face and nose shapes is simple enough. The glasses come with three sets of nose rests, each of them being able to squish down onto your nose nicely. The ear rests also have a certain amount of outwards flexibility too, so if you've got a bit of a bigger face, they should still place nicely. The ear rests can also be vertically angled across three points too, to hopefully sit properly depending on where you ears are positioned. Lots of little touches that add up.</p>
<p>Since they're AR glasses, you can see <em>through</em> them and see your surroundings. At times it can be a little disorientating perhaps, but they also give you a cover to stick on the front for when you want a truly <em>fully</em> immersive experience with no pass-through to get 100% from it. As long as you're not constantly moving your head around it's fine, and you do get used to the feeling of it quite quickly. I can't tell you the immense joy I got from laying in bed, staring up at the ceiling with the Nreal Air on playing Brotato and various other games on the Steam Deck. I probably looked pretty ridiculous, smiling and laughing away at just how completely nerdy it was but it really sold me on it.</p>
<p>Below you can see a shot (click it to enlarge) of the lense, which is very tricky to get a good capture of. On the left is with the cover on, on the right has no cover for pass-through to see your surroundings.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2096939461683548745gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2096939461683548745gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For a clearer idea of the level of pass through to expect, the shot below is <em>without</em> the cover on with the device on max brightness with plenty of stuff in the background. This is in a very brightly lit office room too, with multiple light sources, and even there without the cover the picture quality is indeed very impressive. <em>Click below to enlarge it, warning: big file.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10338186461683549361gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10338186461683549361gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For me, being able to rest my wrists a little more while playing with the Steam Deck has been great, as using the Nreal Air meant I could sit in pretty much any position I wanted, as long as I had a good grip on the controls on the Deck nothing else mattered. It enabled <em>maximum</em> comfort.</p>
<p>Much like my time with the Valve Index, the Nreal Air has made me rethink what gaming can be, where and how you can do it. There's just something a little bit more special about having your games so up close and intense like this, it really brings a different level of immersion. I found myself getting lost with it, spending far too much time with it when I absolutely should have been productive doing other things. It's bad for your free time.</p>
<p><em>There are some issues with it though. It's not perfection but close.</em></p>
<p>Firstly, if you wear glasses, you'll need to arrange for special lenses. Nreal do provide a tiny (and flimsy) example frame, that you can take somewhere to get your actual required lenses fitted on. Then you can just insert them into the frame as they attach to the nose rest. So they have at least though of people without great vision, but it's an <em>extra</em> expense and a fair bit of hassle to arrange. There's no hardware adjustments for vision at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17408683101683545283gol1.jpg"/>Pictured left to right - carrying case, lens cover, optional glasses frame insert, Nreal Air device.</em></p>
<p>Although there's no hardware adjustments you can make to the screen, at least with the Steam Deck you can tweak the scaling of the actual display thanks to the Steam Deck's own built-in options. So, if for example you have trouble reading the edges of the screen, you could scale it just a bit smaller and it can make all the difference to comfort:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20354121621683546595gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20354121621683546595gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Part of why the Nreal Air is so light is that it draws power from what it's connected with, it has no batteries itself. So you'll need to keep an eye on battery level of the Deck directly. Charging the Steam Deck while using the Nreal Air something of an issue and it seems they don't support it directly, and there's no official extra dongle of sorts to attach to enable it. This means you have to go third-party to do it. I've asked their team to direct me towards what you can get to help with this, but they haven't actually replied to clear this up for me. I'll update this note if I do hear back on that. However, quite a few people on their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nreal/?f=flair_name%3A%22charging%20while%20using%20%22" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have come up with their own solutions. <em>But if you can't arrange anything yourself, sounds like it's time to take a break and charge your Deck.</em></p>
<p>Updating firmware also seems like it's not possible on Linux yet, which is again another question their team has yet to reply on to properly clarify. I had to resort to Windows to do this, and even there it took a few attempts before it actually succeeded.</p>
<p>How about using them with a desktop or a laptop? That's simple enough to do! Nreal have a dedicated <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/adapter/" target="_blank">adapter</a> for that. The same one you would use from them to connect up to other consoles. You plug the glasses to the adapter via the included USB-C wire, then adapter HDMI out to your PC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13101154241683554857gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13101154241683554857gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the above, you can then use it as a traditional PC screen too and with my testing on KDE Plasma on Fedora 38, even that worked out of the box without an issue. You can just tell your display settings how to use it, here's an example as an extended display with GamingOnLinux in Chrome moved over to it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14729549091683555242gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14729549091683555242gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For how they actually look worn, you can check out <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/hce9oEppop0" target="_blank">my YouTube Short</a>.</p>
<p>As my first try for anything like this, I'm sold on the idea. Overall, the Nreal Air is a thoroughly impressive device that I have genuinely had a lot of fun with. It's a very unique experience that I'm glad to have had the chance to test out. Priced at $379 / £399.99, it's not cheap though, but as long as you don't mind dealing with the issue with glasses (or you don't wear glasses), I would say it's well worth it. If you can get it that is, availability is quite limited on where to buy it and what countries you can get it in right now.</p>
<p>My current favourite accessory to pair up with the Steam Deck? Absolutely.</p>
<p>You can check it out on their <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/air/" target="_blank">website</a>, and on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF5LKP5Q" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

      <title>Arcane Wilds kicks off with some refreshing RTS ideas</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you been someone who loved playing games like Starcraft and Age of Empires primarily in multiplayer mode with your friends, or do you still play them? Then I might have something for you that could make your competitive RTS heart beat faster and bring some fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Arcane Wilds is a fantasy RTS game with a western-style that actually does many things differently than many other RTS games that have been on the market so far. Currently, the game is still in its Beta stage but already playable. However, keep in mind that there may still be changes to the game. If you're interested in trying out Arcane Wilds yourself, you can still participate in the closed beta and get a free key for the game, just like me. Simply <a href="https://arcanewilds.com/join" target="_blank">follow this link</a>. But now let's take a look at what Arcane Wilds is and what it's all about.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="44CQZj19PQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d53b0db6114ce4b4577d9122fdcceb9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/44CQZj19PQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3>What is Arcane Wilds, and what is it about?</h3>
<p>Arcane Wilds is a fantasy RTS game in a western-style setting, where three factions compete for dominance on small islands. The game can be played alone or online with up to eight players in multiplayer mode, using either Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>Although the game takes place in a fantasy world, all three factions are clearly inspired by the American 19th century.</p>
<p>There is an Army that strongly resembles an American Civil War army. This army has a powerful arsenal of weapons and well-trained units. Its low mobility is compensated for by its long range and the excellent firepower of its cannons.</p>
<p>Then there is a group of settlers, known as Colony, who most closely resemble settlers in the Wild West. These colonists are a ragtag group of gunslingers who prefer to use their explosive barrels, dynamite, and the concentrated firepower of Gatling guns to lead a well-balanced army into battle.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a Tribe faction, which most closely resembles the Indigenous peoples of North America. They have fast, agile units and mobile structures, and their medicine men and shamans can also cause devastating chaos among enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11658711681683455482gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11658711681683455482gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In addition, the game features some fantasy elements, such as one of the two main resources, which I will discuss later, and several creatures that you may recognize from myths and legends.</p>
<h3>Resource management and logistics system</h3>
<p>While the three factions in Arcane Wilds differ from each other in gameplay, they are not the game's unique selling point. The innovative approach to resource management is the game's standout feature.</p>
<p>Resources can not only be collected but also stolen. This is possible because resources in Arcane Wilds are not abstract numbers on the screen, but physical goods that must be transported from point A to point B.</p>
<p>When starting on a map, players have a central port and a group of workers. The port is surrounded by a group of trees that up to 12 workers can work on to gather wood, which is actually called Supplies in Arcane Wilds.</p>
<p>We also extract Essence, which is required for certain upgrades, higher level units and technologies, and can be used in other ways.</p>
<p>Just like Supplies, Essence is a physical good in Arcane Wilds. This means that it must be extracted and transported by us, and can also be stolen from us. At the same time, we can lose these resources through clever theft by our opponent.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a resource called Corruption, which is generated passively through the extraction of Essence. Corruption is required for unit upgrades and is not a physical good.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9552221321683455482gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9552221321683455482gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<h3>The skirmishes</h3>
<p>As in most other RTS games, we must use both main resources to build new buildings or train units, and then send our army to attack our opponent.</p>
<p>The gameplay of Arcane Wilds is particularly focused on fast and intense battles, in which players fight for dominance on the map or try to outsmart their opponents with clever strategies.</p>
<p>The maps are symmetrical, like in many other RTS games, offering equal chances for all players. Distributed across the maps are various locations where we can gain certain advantages or resources.</p>
<p>For example, there are small groups of natives who are initially neutral towards us and only become hostile if we attack them. Attacking these enemies is a smart move, though, as we must expand our “Fame Level” – represented by the small crown and number in the middle of the upper screen – to increase our unit limit.</p>
<p>Aside from battles, we can also increase our Fame Level by exporting Essence or building certain large buildings on the map for the first time. This feature is a fresh idea because, unlike many other strategy games, we build houses in Arcane Wilds not to increase our unit limit but as a morale boost. This boost makes our units near the houses significantly stronger, which can turn a direct attack on a base into a suicide mission.</p>
<p>Another detail of Arcane Wilds, that is very different from many other RTS games, is the unit production. Although we build certain buildings in Arcane Wilds to produce units, they are automatically “pre-produced” over time and must then be “ordered” at the port.</p>
<p>Our “order” then arrives at the port by ship after a short time. We can even give commands to the prepared units before they come ashore. If we need to speed things up, there is also a button at the port to immediately send a ship. Alternatively, we can also order this immediately via a shortcut. However, the option's use is limited, as the timer extends by up to eight minutes with each use.</p>
<p>By the way, whether with the regular ship or the express option, we can order our units from anywhere on the map and do not have to go back to the port first, which makes unit production and deployment pretty quick and hassle-free.</p>
<p>The shortcuts in Arcane Wilds are otherwise well-thought-out. For example, like in other RTS games, we can divide our units into specific groups and select them from a distance. We can then command the units to pick up a specific resource package with a right-click and then bring it directly to our port via a shortcut (here Shift-X). With a little practice, we can even do this quite comfortably in the heat of battle.</p>
<h3>The victory conditions</h3>
<p>Some of you may have already noticed: the port is the central element of our armies. Without our port, we immediately lose the game, and the same can also be true for the opponent's port as our primary target.</p>
<p>However, in addition to destroying the port, there are also a few other victory conditions that are based on the different game modes. For example, we can capture certain relics from the center of the map guarded by a powerful monster, fend off a horde of attacking enemies, or liberate specific villages from enemies to win.</p>
<h3>Other modes and features</h3>
<p>There is also a campaign mode in Arcane Wilds, which, however, is currently only playable with the Army faction. In the campaign, we have a central island from which we can start various missions, which play out as small individual battles. The special feature of the campaign is our central main island, on which we can build buildings and prepare various units and upgrades for our next mission.</p>
<p>Arcane Wilds also offers a comprehensive and well-designed tutorial in the form of an academy, which, by the way, is also one of the main points in the main menu. And in fact, this academy is needed because there are a lot of game mechanics to learn.</p>
<p>This starts with the three factions. While the Army and the Colonists play relatively traditionally, the Tribe faction can construct buildings with their Travois. So, a building practically costs as much as a Travois.</p>
<p>In addition, there are different building areas, normal and corrupt ones, which are represented by green and violet underlays beneath the blueprints when placing a building. While normal buildings can be placed anywhere, we can only build certain higher-ranking buildings on corrupt areas.</p>
<p>If the goal of a battle is to capture the relics from the center of the map, their protectors become stronger with each neutral unit camp destroyed. This means that if we destroy too many of these neutral camps, we or our opponent may have difficulty obtaining the relic in the end. However, it also means that if we destroy too few of these camps, we may lag in our Fame Level, which in turn means a smaller army.</p>
<p>This creates a very interesting balancing act, in which we always have to consider how many of the neutral inhabitants we want to destroy before we start conquering the relic.</p>
<h3>Criticism and comments</h3>
<p>In terms of gameplay, I would like a bit more variety in the strategic placement of resources in the game. So far, our port has always been surrounded by a few trees, which makes resource gathering almost too easy and overshadows the excellent logistics element of the game. This could be solved, for example, by placing the trees further away from the port, thus creating a vulnerable supply line.</p>
<p>Also, Essence could be placed only once in the middle of the map, making it much more difficult for factions to even get higher-level units.</p>
<p>By the way, I really like the cute polygon graphics of the game – at least for a strategy game. However, I would like to see proper walls for the palisades. Currently, the palisades look more like a row of posts. But that is my only criticism of the model selection, and it can be easily fixed.</p>

<p>Overall, I think Arcane Wilds is already a really rounded gaming experience, especially for a Beta. With its fast gameplay and the relatively tricky peculiarities in resource management and unit production, I think Arcane Wilds can be a fascinating game for players who like fast and competitive RTS games.</p>
<p>That was my first impression of the game so far.</p>
<p>If you find Arcane Wilds interesting, you can still participate in the closed beta by following the link above and follow it on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1492050/Arcane_Wilds/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam will now scale better with KDE and GNOME</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Beta release for Steam from May 5th, Valve finally did some more work on scaling the UI of the Steam Client. Quite overdue isn't it?</p>
<p>From the release notes they mentioned Steam will now use the global scale factor as configured via KDE or GNOME settings, specifically from <code class="inline-code">org.gnome.desktop.interface/text-scaling-factor</code>. Valve has also re-introduced GDK_SCALE as a fallback, and there's also a command line switch to let you override it with <code class="inline-code">-forcedesktopscaling float</code> now available.</p>
<p>Other fixes in the Beta from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3705943193607193985" target="_blank">May 5th</a> include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed big black rectangle sometimes showing up in small mode at start time.</li>
<li>Fixed context menus sometimes getting squashed in small mode.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fix Right Trackpad Click in the controller binding listening page being bound to Left Stick Click.</li>
<li>Improved digital navigation in GamePad Action Binding Tab when selecting LED Color Action.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All these changes also apply to the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>There was also an update on May 4th that I missed as well, as Valve are working to fix up all the issues that came along with the newer UI and the new Steam Overlay. For desktop here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3705943193600581522" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with navigating forward and back when the client's start page is the Library</li>
<li>Tweaked the order and presentation of some items in the account menu</li>
<li>Fixed library artwork not automatically updating in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed developer, publisher, and franchise links not working in game info panel</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting issues on downloads page</li>
<li>Made download throttle setting field honor the bits-per-second/bytes-per-second toggle setting</li>
<li>Changed default display of download rate to bits per second.</li>
<li>LED Personalization now has has dedicated sub-page in Controller Calibration page</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the cursor position would be reset in Game Notes after auto-saving</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Friends List</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Send Trade Offer opening in the system browser</li>
<li>Fixed Add to Favorites / Remove from Favorites not dismissing the context menu in some instances</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Screenshot Manager</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed screenshots failing to upload when certain privacy settings were selected</li>
<li>Fixed UI glitch when deleting a local screenshot's caption</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>In-Game Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added cloud sync status icon to Game Notes dialog. If there's a Steam Cloud conflict, clicking on that icon will display a cloud conflict resolution dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with Friends List context menu items not opening links in the overlay web browser (e.g. "View Profile" or "Send Trade Offer")</li>
<li>Fixed issue where some dialogs were not appearing correctly (e.g. Invite Friend to Game, Add Friend, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the file picker dialog not showing any files when browsing for an app icon</li>
<li>Fixed the Steam Runtime info dialog not showing any information</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The majority of that was also on Steam Deck too, although most of it is for desktop mode.</p>
<p>The new design is starting to feel quite a lot more stable now, as it was a bit rough with the recent major Beta upgrade.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental improves EA app, Battle.net and nvapi enabled for many games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A rather great sounding update to Proton Experimental landed on May 5th, so here's a run over what's new and improved. Since there's many different Proton versions it can get a bit confusing, so head on over to my <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">beginner's guide on Steam Play and Proton</a> for more info.</p>
<p>Newly listed as playable for this update is Gunfire: Reborn. </p>
<p>They've also now enabled nvapi for these games, meaning you shouldn't need any special workarounds to enable special NVIDIA features in-game: </p>
<ul>
<li>Chernobylite Enhanced Edition</li>
<li>Dead Space (Remake)</li>
<li>Forspoken</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5</li>
<li>Hi-Fi Rush</li>

<li>Monster Hunter Rise</li>
<li>Need For Speed Unbound</li>
<li>Nioh 2, Propnight</li>

<li>Sackboy: A Big Adventure</li>
<li>SCP: 5K</li>
<li>Scum</li>
<li>The Last Of Us Part I</li>
<li>Watch Dogs Legion</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more bug fixes and improvements came in too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Tales of Berseria suffering from screen tearing with vsync turned on while in fullscreen / borderless.</li>
<li>Improved Final Fantasy XIII loading times.</li>
<li>Fixed EA launcher crashing and removed the previous workaround.</li>
<li>Fixed Red Dead Redemption 2 taking long time to exit with Alt+F4.</li>
<li>Fixed Battle.net not starting.</li>
<li>Fixed cutscenes freezing in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.</li>
<li>Fixed multiple Unity titles flickering on the Steam Deck when switching display window options.</li>
<li>Fixed The Elder Scrolls Online wrongly claiming not enough space.</li>
<li>Fixed The Elder Scrolls Online launcher showing blank window.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally they updated the SteamWorks SDK support to v1.57. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>

      <title>Cartridges is another Linux game launcher and it&#39;s super-clean</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing we're not short on, it's launchers. There's some kind of launcher for everything including Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and more. Now there's also Cartridges.</p>
<p>First impression is surprisingly good with this one. The interface is impeccably clean and clear, with options to import games from other sources like Steam, Heroic and others. It works damn well too without any fussing around. Although you will need to add extra sources for it to scan, if you're not using the defaults (like extra Steam game install folders). Importing is blazingly fast too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17890729111683298453gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17890729111683298453gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Manually adding and editing games.</li>
<li>Importing games from Steam, Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and itch.</li>
<li>Support for multiple Steam install locations.</li>
<li>Hiding games.</li>
<li>Searching and sorting by title, date added and last played.</li>
<li>Automatically downloading cover art from <a href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/" target="_blank">SteamGridDB</a>.</li>
<li>Searching for games on various databases.</li>
<li>Animated covers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Might be worth a look if you're after something <em>simple</em>, that will bundle all your games from different sources.</p>

      <title>Typing Tempo challenges you in a 41-key typing rhythm game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you enjoy rhythm games and think you're a master typist, you may want to take a little look over at the new release of Typing Tempo. Giving you 41 keys worth of button-mashing, you likely don't need an introduction to rhythm games. You hit the correct key at the right time to progress through each track. Looks like it can get pretty challenging in the harder modes too.</p>
<p>"The Typing Tempo music library contains more than 30 upbeat and energetic tracks, including genres such as Future Bass, Hardcore, House, and more! With 100+ handcrafted levels, Typing Tempo has plenty of content to play from the get-go. You can also add your own music and levels to play, which can be created with Typechart Studio, a simple but powerful chart editor for the game, which is included as a Steam Tool."</p>
<p>You can see what to expect from it below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cSaPDFVi2NA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6e37ec5280670cd621a81acde7535f8b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cSaPDFVi2NA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some other features it has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Custom keyboard layouts</li>
<li>Customizable fonts</li>
<li>Scroll speed</li>
<li>Visual offset</li>
<li>Modifiers such as 'Mirror,' 'Vanish,' and 'Spin'</li>
<li>Customizable displays</li>
<li>Profiles, high scores, and statistics tracking</li>
<li>'Practice Mode', where you can select certain keys and words to practice at a specific tempo</li>
<li>and much more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available with Native Linux support <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2332930/Typing_Tempo/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GOG reveal some stats on how they&#39;re doing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Game store <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> has a new <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/gog_2023_update_2_facts_and_numbers_of_2022_copy3" target="_blank">blog post</a> up detailing how they're doing, and it seems like things are starting to go a bit better for them. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">Back in 2021</a>, I reported on how in the CD PROJEKT financials, it showed that GOG was losing money, so it seems they may be starting to turn things around a little bit.</p>
<p>In their new post, they showed that for 2022 they have seen an 11% increase in active users across all of GOG services with an 18% increase in their overall user base. However, GOG Galaxy only "remained consistent", so it seems they aren't seeing much growth for their launcher. They're also reporting a net profit of $1.2M USD, noting they're losing around 4% due to suspending operations in Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>Nothing close to how they were doing in 2020 though, which they attribute the spike that year to Cyberpunk 2077 and COVID-19 increasing sales due to people being at home more.</p>
<p>As for their market split they're seeing 53% from Europe, 37% from North America, 4% Asia, 4% Australia and New Zealand and 2% elsewhere.</p>
<p>The amount of games releasing on GOG has been increasing every year too, although it's nothing close to what Steam has, since GOG do a little more curation on what they accept (which is at times a little weird on what they deny). From 296 releases in 2018 up to 684 in 2022.</p>

      <title>Dead by Daylight now works on Linux desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some potentially great news for Dead by Daylight fans, as it <em>seems</em> Behaviour Interactive have finally made the switch with their anti-cheat to allow Steam Deck and Linux desktop players in.</p>
<p>It was noticed by users around a week ago, with reports across <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/381210" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/132m9lq/dead_by_daylight_steam_version/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> mentioning that it now works. We've been in this situation before though, with this game specifically and multiple others, that suddenly work after an update. Usually, a day or a few days later the anti-cheat begins to kick Linux desktop and Steam Deck players. In this case though, that didn't seem to happen.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/steam-dead-by-daylight-is-now-working-on-deck/" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> are reporting they've had the PR team from Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive email them, stating it is intentionally working. However, the developer has made <em>no</em> public announcement on this anywhere, and they <em>haven't</em> replied to my email on it as of yet. Until they do give some public word on it, I would still take it with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>The question is: if the report is true - <em>why</em> aren't the developers talking about it? Seems odd. A lack of confidence right now perhaps? Silent testing to see how it goes? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>Giving it a test run myself and it does indeed now work just fine with Proton 8.0-2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17266768461683282289gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17266768461683282289gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above running on Fedora KDE 38 on Ultra details, it's very smooth at 2560x1440 on my Ryzen 5800X + NVIDIA 2080 Ti system. Absolutely no issues observed there, so it's looking really nice. Not sure how much my heart can take with a game like this though — phew, what a rush when you're discovered and you have to run away.</p>
<p>Testing it out on Steam Deck too pictured below, the result of it working with Proton 8.0-2 is the same. On Medium details, with resolution bumped up to 100% it runs very smoothly there too. Not a big surprise though, since the environments are pretty small.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14388498421683283767gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14388498421683283767gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Hopefully we'll see an announcement on it officially soon. </em></p>
<p>You can buy Dead by Daylight from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-by-daylight?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, here's a video of it running on Steam Deck with my thoughts on this:</p>

      <title>Discord username system changing to make it easier to find people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After years of technical debt, Discord has <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames" target="_blank">announced</a> a big change is coming to their username system to make it easier to find the people you want to connect with.</p>
<p>Currently, you have your username followed by a bunch of numbers. It's not an ideal system, as they said themselves, "our current usernames can often be too complicated or obscure for people to remember and share easily". So they're changing it to be a bit more like Twitter and other platforms where you have @username instead. You'll still be able to change your display name to whatever you want though.</p>
<p><em>This is a good time to tell you to <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">join the GamingOnLinux Discord</a> right?</em></p>
<p>When the change comes in, your username will need to be unique and they said it will roll-out over the coming weeks. You'll get an in-app notification when your time comes to do the change-over. It will take several months for them to get through everyone, so you might be in for a bit of a wait on it.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how this system is received. It can easily end up with the same problems other places have, with people impersonating others by nabbing their tag used on another platform. Discord will need to be careful on this, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see them eventually roll out their own verification system too due to this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Open source physics-based tabletop sim &#39;Tabletop Club&#39; gets an official release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bunch of early testing builds, the developer of the free and open source tabletop sim Tabletop Club has announced the first stable release. While this is the first "official" release, it's only the beginning for the project. It's already quite playable, and easy for you and friends to jump into thanks to it not requiring an account, just a hosted room code you can send to friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2598023611683210305gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of what's already planned for future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved behaviour for in-game objects like boards and containers.</li>
<li>More intuitive asset pack creation and management within the game itself.</li>
<li>An online asset pack database for creators to upload content, and for players to automatically download from.</li>
<li>A Lua scripting API for custom behaviour.</li>
<li>Migration to Godot 4.0, which should bring better performance and improved graphical fidelity.</li>
<li>Expansion to more platforms, including the web and mobile devices. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the release <a href="https://drwhut.itch.io/tabletop-club/devlog/523502/release-v010-humble-beginnings" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the developer explained why it was created:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I want to thank everyone, from my friends who helped shape and test the game, to those who have contributed code, assets and translations, and to whose who have played it even for a little bit - this genuinely would not have been possible without your support. For context, I started this project knee-deep in the middle of the COVID pandemic since I was not able to play board games face-to-face at the time. At the same time, the various lockdowns were taking a huge toll on my mental health, which I did not realise until it was too late; the effects of which I am still feeling to this day. For me personally, not only is this a project that allows me to play board games with my friends, but it is also proof. Proof that no matter how bad it gets, no matter how low your self-esteem gets, you're still worth it. You can still make a difference in the world. Even if by modern standards most would call me a "failure" or a "wreck", it's all relative. This is something I've made, and I'm damn proud of it.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Soul Survivors is a refreshing skill-based time-survival Vampire Survivor-like</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing my quest to have no free time ever, I have been checking out Soul Survivors that's now available in Early Access. It may be yet another (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">there's lots now</a>) Vampire Survivor-like but that's not a bad thing at all. In fact, I'm actually rather enjoying Soul Survivors. Stride PR sent over an key and my early impression here is that it's really fun.</p>
<p><em>On desktop Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with Proton 8 and Proton 7.</em></p>
<p>It has all the basics of these popular horde games but there are some key differences. It's definitely a whole <em>lot</em> more skill-based than just the movement-dodging basics found in Vampire Survivors, especially with the different classes actually being very different to play. The current version has a mid-range fighter which is pretty standard, plus a Necromancer that spawns creatures you keep alive by picking up flesh piles. The Necromancer also has a physics-based spiked flail that moves based on your own position, so you can spin it each side or all around you based on your movement. The Necromancer has been a lot of fun to play as, with you swinging the spiked flail around as a skeleton runs around doing your bidding, while also firing off various spells.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13468808141683201195gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13468808141683201195gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - Soul Survivors on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Enemies actually have various different behaviours too. There's the usual hordes that chase you, enemies that will dart at you, enemies that teleport around you, vines that will hold you in place requiring you to quickly mash the direction buttons to break free.</p>
<p>Lots of clever little changes, make it worthwhile to play. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ubXculnoFNk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ff6c0d3958fa91978d3c33097a4d6d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ubXculnoFNk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Then you come to the boss system, each map has a specific set of bosses to fight and when you beat them, the game sudden warps into what they call Cursed Mode, where every minute a new curse on you or the world will increase the difficulty making it thoroughly interesting and frantic to keep going longer once you finish a map. So while there is gated progression for maps based on the bosses, each map is also endless and repeatable with it being quite dynamic at the end.</p>
<p>Another fun little addition is the money snail you chase around, which drops lots of gold for your character persistent upgrades. There's plenty of other ways to get gold from crates and other creatures, but the money snail was a funny addition.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17186964061683199879gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17186964061683199879gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Soul Survivors on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>As you progress through a level, there's temporary items you can pick up too. Some might have you throw bombs constantly for a few seconds, some might make your Necromancer flail massive and plenty more. Lots of little things that add up to a really fun experience. Vampire Survivor fans won't want to miss this.</p>
<p>“Since beginning development on Soul Survivors, we have worked tirelessly to create a unique and entertaining time-survival roguelite,” said Sterling Selover of Stingbot Games, “Whether you’re familiar with the genre or are a fledgling adventurer, our blend of distinctive combat, persistent progression, and dark fantasy world-building has something for everyone.”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2002220/Soul_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Framework gives more detail on their AMD Ryzen laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently Framework excited everyone over <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/framework-reveal-new-laptop-with-modular-graphics-plus-an-amd-ryzen-model/" target="_blank">their big DIY laptop upgrades</a>, and now they're giving more detail on the Framework 13 Laptop with AMD Ryzen. They weren't able to originally reveal what AMD chips they would be using, but now they are.</p>
<p>They've now officially revealed they will be shipping with either the Ryzen 5 7640U or Ryzen 7 7840U depending on what you pick and you can pre-order them now with shipping expected sometime around Q3 this year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/585990111683197045gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center">From their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ryzen 5 7640U processor has 6 CPU cores clocked at a base frequency of 3.5GHz and up to a max boost of 4.9GHz, while the Ryzen 7 7840U has an amazing 8 cores and 16 processing threads clocked at a base of 3.3GHz and up to 5.1GHz max boost. These are all Zen 4 cores, which feature AMD's fastest processor technology ever. These chips are fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process node, meaning that even with such high performance, they are also extremely efficient. We've designed the thermal system to be able to handle the processors at up to 28W continuous load if you need to do some heavy crunching too.</p>
<p>Ryzen-powered Framework Laptop users are also in for a treat when it comes to graphics performance. The Ryzen 7040 Series processors feature the latest generation AMD Radeon 700M Series graphics, the first AMD RDNA 3-based integrated graphics. The Ryzen 5 7640U has Radeon 760M graphics with 8 Compute Units while the Ryzen 7 7840U has Radeon 780M graphics with 12 Compute Units.  This means the Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series) can handle a range of modern game titles directly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For existing owners of a Framework Laptop, they will also be suppling the Mainboard so you can upgrade to it if you wish, or you can use it as a standalone computer too. The first two batches are already sold-out, and you can order either pre-built with Windows or the DIY edition to build it all yourself.</p>
<p>I don't need it…but I want it.</p>

      <title>AMD Render Pipeline Shaders SDK adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for game developers here and anyone tinkering around with graphics APIs, as AMD has announced the next upgrade to their Render Pipeline Shaders SDK and now it has Linux support.</p>
<p>This SDK was announced back in <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/rps_1_0/" target="_blank">December</a> in Open Beta, as a comprehensive and extensible Render Graph framework for graphics applications and engines using explicit APIs (like Vulkan and DirectX 12). The v1.1 update from <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/rps_1_1_linux_support/" target="_blank">May 3rd</a> adds in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux support for the base library and the RPSL compiler.</li>
<li>Support for dynamically loading Vulkan functions.</li>
<li>Support for latest stable Agility SDK 1.608.3.</li>
<li>Automatic marking of the discard flags to accesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some background on it from <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RenderPipelineShaders" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<p>"The AMD Render Pipeline Shaders (RPS) SDK is a comprehensive and extensible Render Graph framework.</p>
<p>Since the debut of explicit graphics APIs (Direct3D 12 and Vulkan®), Render Graphs (or Frame Graphs) have been proposed as an elegant and efficient solution to various problems such as generating resource barriers, managing transient memory and scheduling GPU workload. In practice, it is non-trivial to implement a render graph system from scratch, and it requires effort to keep it optimal according to hardware, API and content changes. Porting effects and techniques between different render graph systems may also consume extra engineering time.</p>
<p>The RPS SDK intends to make Render Graphs more easily accessible and to provide a generally optimal barrier generator and (aliasing) memory scheduler. RPS also tries to simplify Render Graph construction by extending HLSL with attributes and intrinsics to create a domain specific language for render graph programming. This enables opt-in applications to program Render Graphs implicitly via a high-level, declarative programming model, allowing users to focus on the render pipeline logic rather than node configuration details. We call the extended language "Render Pipeline Shader Language", or RPSL."</p>
<p>Always good to see more and more developer-focused tooling available for Linux, bringing down more barriers for developers working on games, game engines, drivers and more.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 9,000 games rated Verified and Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another juicy milestone for Valve with the Steam Deck, as it now has over 9,000 games rated as either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Going by the list on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which also takes into account those titles that have been removed for sale, which players can still download if they own the games the current status is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 3,276</li>
<li>Playable - 5,750</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2,879</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping in mind, these are only those that have been through Valve's Deck Verified certification, there's plenty more that do work out of the box with no changes needed. Over time the numbers will naturally just keep rising, especially with upgrades to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton compatibility layer</a> along with some more Native Linux releases.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Deck Verified isn't perfect, there will be some games that are Verified that shouldn't be, and same again for Unsupported - some of them work and some don't. We really don't know how Valve actually test, as they've been a bit tight-lipped on it.</p>
<p>According to Valve this is the criteria for being Verified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input - The title should have full controller support, use appropriate controller input icons, and automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display - The game should support the default resolution of Steam Deck (1280x800 or 1280x720), have good default settings, and text should be legible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seamlessness - The title shouldn’t display any compatibility warnings, and if there’s a launcher it should be navigable with a controller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System Support - If running through Proton, the game and all its middleware should be supported by Proton. This includes anti-cheat support.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A pixel-art version of The Sims? Sign me up. Tiny Life from Ellpeck Games and Top Hat Studios is now available in Early Access. It comes with full Native Linux support and it should work just fine on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>For anyone who has played anything like The Sims it shouldn't need a big intro. In this open-ended game you control a set of people that live together and you take care of all their needs, build them up, make relationships or whatever you want really. From what I played of earlier versions before this Early Access release, it showed a lot of promise and was already fun.</p>
<p>There's also now a brand new trailer:</p>

      <title>Valve limits Steam store pages to 2 trailers before screenshots</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't know about you, but I used to get a little annoyed by endless amounts of trailers on Steam pages that didn't really show much. Valve have been paying attention again to what players want to see.</p>
<p>Some developers went completely overboard, listing multiple years of update trailers before you even get a single screenshot, making it annoying to just quickly at a glance see if the basic style is your cup. Lots of "trailers" show little normal gameplay too and it was a growing problem.</p>
<p>Valve has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/5358762517221792488" target="_blank">announced</a> a change, so that only two trailers will be shown before screenshots now. All other trailers will be shown after the screenshots. This is a nice win for Steam customers, making it far less frustrating overall. It may seem like a <em>small</em> thing, but it really does make people bounce away from store pages if they're littered with trailers that don't show what people want.</p>
<p>Think about it - you go to a new store page for a random game and you want to see right away what it's like. Lots of trailers plastering various logo screens and intros before you really see anything — such a nuisance.</p>
<p>Another change Valve made is that trailers can now have a category and name tag, so developers and publishers can tell people what type of trailer it is so you can scroll to another if you really don't care about their cinematics for just one example. A small addition but could be useful if used correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4441127511683125669gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4441127511683125669gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17200584061683125670gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17200584061683125670gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Screenshot examples from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/" target="_blank">Portal 2</a></em></p>
<p>As Valve said on why it matters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The display of trailers on Steam store pages have been updated today to address some frustrations we've heard from players when trying to find gameplay videos or navigate to screenshots. These changes include new logic that determines the order of trailers and screenshots, plus the ability to specify a category for each trailer to show to players.<br/>
<small>[…]</small><br/>
We have found that it wasn't clear to developers how best to manage trailers in order to provide the best experience for players. Many games have collected a great number of trailers over their lifetime of development and have made it harder for prospective customers to find the screenshots. At the same time, we know that players are interested in understanding a little more about the trailers they are watching. This update is intended to address both of these issues and help players more quickly learn about games they are interested in.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-1 released, mainly pulling in Proton 8 upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton has a new release out <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-1" target="_blank">with 8-1</a>, which is mainly pulling in a whole bunch of improvements from Proton 8 and Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>This is the version of Proton made and supported by the community, for the times where it may work better than the official Valve Proton, but it comes with less testing and may have its own issues. See more in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Steam Play and Proton guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All build components rebased to Proton 8 experimental/upstream.</li>
<li>proton-wine updated to latest experimental.</li>
<li>wine-staging rebased on top of proton-wine 8.</li>
<li>proton-ge game patches and pending wine upstream patches rebased on top of proton-wine 8.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git.</li>
<li>protonfix: No cutscene audio in Daedalic Games (Memoria, The Night of the Rabbit, A New Beginning - Final Cut) - (thanks marianoag).</li>
<li>protonfix: Megadimension Neptunia VII - (thanks snaggly).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some other notes that were included to be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>FSR is currently disabled again. It needs a massive rebase and same as before I don't know if it's currently possible to rebase/port it over to the new proton 8 build.</li>
<li>Having the nvapi hack configuration enabled in dxvk.conf seems to crash battlenet. Recommend removing it from the config for existing Lutris battle.net installations and related games.</li>
<li>Overwatch losing focus after death seems to be fixed.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

      <title>OBS Studio 29.1 is out now with AV1 / HEVC for YouTube</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for content creators here, as the excellent OBS Studio just released <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/29.1.0" target="_blank">version 29.1.0</a>. This brings initial support for AV1 / HEVC on YouTube.</p>
<p>There's various improvements elsewhere too of course but this is quite a big one, as it's potentially the future of streaming video and it's currently limited to YouTube for now as a Beta feature. This release also now supports Enhanced RTMP V1, which extends the RTMP protocol to support newer video codecs and HDR. Lots of future-proofing work going on in OBS Studio right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377001261683112301gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377001261683112301gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Here's everything that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for streaming AV1/HEVC over Enhanced RTMP [YouTube/yuriy-chunak/derrod]
<ul>
<li>Enhanced RTMP V1 extends the RTMP protocol to support newer video codecs and HDR. More info at: <a href="https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp" target="_blank">https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp</a></li>
<li>Currently only supported by/enabled for YouTube as a beta feature</li>
<li>HDR is not yet implemented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for multiple audio tracks in Simple output recording [pkv]</li>
<li>Added a DLL blocking feature for Windows. This allows OBS to block problematic DLLs from attaching to OBS and causing freezing or crashes, for example 3rd party overlay hooks and outdated video capture devices. [notr1ch]
<ul>
<li>This blocks old versions of popular VTubing software virtual cameras that are known to cause freezes when accessing video capture device properties. If you are affected, please update to the latest version of your VTubing software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added settings to select the audio encoder for streaming and recording [tytan652]</li>
<li>Added an option to preload media sources used in Stingers to memory, to avoid frame skips during transitions [Jim]</li>
<li>Added Update Channels on macOS and updated Sparkle for smaller and faster updates going forward [derrod]</li>
<li>Added compatibility notices in the Window and Game Capture sources for Windows [derrod]</li>
<li>Added the ability to zoom browser docks with Ctrl - and + and the right click menu [WizardCM]</li>
<li>Added a setting to record in fragmented MP4 and MOV formats [derrod]
<ul>
<li>These offer greater compatibility than MKV while providing similar resilience against data loss due to crashes, running out of space, etc.</li>
<li>Fragmented MP4 and MOV files can be remuxed to regular MP4/MOV in cases where the former may not be read correctly (e.g. in older editing software)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for surround sound for AJA capture cards [paulh-aja]</li>
<li>Added ProRes 4444 (XQ) support for VideoToolbox encoder on macOS [jpark37]</li>
<li>Added lossless audio recording options (FLAC/ALAC/PCM including 32-bit float) [derrod]</li>
<li>Added indicator if an audio source is unmuted, but not assigned to any audio tracks [derrod]</li>
<li>Added AMD AV1 encoder to simple output mode [notr1ch]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Just for Linux, there were a couple of improvements like these:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improve screen capture performance on Intel dedicated GPUs on Linux [kkartaltepe]</li>
<li>JACK inputs on Linux will now display "OBS Studio" in their name to clarify their origin. This may cause existing configured devices to stop working until updated by the user [univrsal]</li>
<li>Fixed a crash on shutdown with virtual camera on Linux [kkartaltepe/norihiro]</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the V4L2 source on Linux where a capture device's frame rate could be invalid, resulting in incredibly large log files [9p4]</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Push to Talk on Linux wouldn't work when assigned to secondary mouse buttons [KasinSparks]</li>
</ul>

      <title>OpenRazer v3.6 brings support for 11 more Razer devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fantastic update to OpenRazer with <a href="https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/releases/tag/v3.6.0" target="_blank">version 3.6.0</a> bringing support for more Razer devices on Linux along with various improvements.</p>
<p>Like many other hardware vendors, Razer do <em>not</em> officially support Linux with their software to tweak things, thankfully the community keeps on giving with OpenRazer. Pairing up OpenRazer with an app like <a href="https://polychromatic.app/" target="_blank">Polychromatic</a> can give you a pretty great experience. Polychromatic actually had a small update recently too with v0.8.1.</p>
<p>With this new OpenRazer release these devices are now supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Razer Laptop Stand Chroma.</li>
<li>Razer Blade 14 (2022).</li>
<li>Razer Core X Chroma.</li>
<li>Razer Basilisk V3 Pro.</li>
<li>Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro.</li>
<li>Razer Blade 15 Base (2022).</li>
<li>Razer HyperPolling Wireless Dongle.</li>
<li>Razer Pro Click Mini (Receiver).</li>
<li>Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro TKL (Wired and Wireless).</li>
<li>Razer Ornata V3 X.</li>
<li>Razer DeathAdder V2 Lite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's these improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plenty of cleanup in the daemon around the screensaver suspend/resume functions.</li>
<li>Prepare for better error handling in the kernel driver.</li>
<li>daemon: sanity check set_dpi_xy call for AVAILABLE_DPI devices.</li>
<li>daemon: clean up custom mouse get methods.</li>
<li>daemon: add effect_methods also for backlight zone.</li>
<li>pylib: don't init _matrix_dimensions when there's no matrix.</li>
<li>daemon: throw exception in get_matrix_dims when not available.</li>
<li>daemon: initialize self.POLL_RATES for all devices with poll rate.</li>
<li>pylib: deprecate poll rate constants.</li>
<li>Makefile: remove uninstall targets.</li>
<li>Makefile: Remove ubuntu_udev_install rule.</li>
<li>debian: replace python packaging hacks.</li>
<li>fake driver: ensure daemon cannot create new files.</li>
</ul>
<p>And these bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix volume wheel on Razer DeathStalker V2.</li>
<li>Fix macro LED not turning off on some devices.</li>
<li>Fix persistence for lighting on/off state.</li>
<li>daemon: Add missing methods to some devices.</li>
<li>daemon: fix Basilisk V2 matrix dimensions.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Proton 8.0-2 out for Linux / Steam Deck fixing the EA app (yes, again)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has upgraded the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">newer Proton 8</a> that only launched for Linux and Steam Deck recently, with a bunch of bug fixes. This is all pretty standard stuff, a point release for the newest version of Proton for running Windows games. If you're confused about Steam Play and Proton see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>Seems on top of a few games needing fixes, that the EA app has once again broken requiring Valve to jump in to prevent a whole bunch of games suddenly not working.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in Proton 8.0-2, a bunch of which is pulled over from the recent Proton Experimental update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Baldur's Gate 3 getting stuck on a black screen in Vulkan mode.</li>
<li>Fixed Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition and Divinity Original Sin II: Definitive Edition crashing on launch.</li>
<li>Fixed Path of Exile crashing.</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in Trackmania and Ubisoft Connect overlay.</li>
<li>Improved Elden Ring compatibility compared to Proton 8.0-1. It can still be finicky.</li>
<li>Fixed Red Dead Redemption 2 and other games not starting after switching from Proton Experimental to stable.</li>
<li>Added a temporary workaround for EA Launcher crashing. Steam Deck's on-screen keyboard may not pop up automatically while using it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How to update?</strong></p>
<p>It will show up as an update to Proton 8 in your Steam Downloads. Just update it as you would any other app / game on Steam.</p>
<p><strong>How to use it?</strong></p>
<p>You can select Proton 8 in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu of any game when you tick the box.</p>
<p>Changelog can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder for Desktop Linux users - Proton 8.0 requires your GPU to support Vulkan 1.3. Steam Deck doesn't need to worry about that.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Additionally, as a heads up, it seems Proton 8 might potentially <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6740" target="_blank">break</a> with some Easy Anti-Cheat games. Something to keep an eye on if you've switched any games with EAC over to it.</p>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 2 has one final content update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cellar Door Games are saying farewell to Rogue Legacy 2, with one final major content upgrade out now with The Swan Song. They had originally planned to move on earlier but they just couldn't help but do a little bit more. Even though they're moving on, it may still get some small patches to fix up issues as they appear.</p>
<p>Some highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3 New Ways to Play</strong> – Fans of the original Rogue Legacy may be familiar with the game’s hardest achievement, Thanatophobia, which required the game be completed in 15 lives. Well, we’re bringing it back as an official Special Game Mode, alongside two other modes that truly spice up the experience. Thana-two-phobia takes the original challenge and dials it to 11, with Prime bosses and harder biomes, while True Rogue pits you against the gods of RNG. This mode randomizes your character, drops you in random biomes, and tests how far you can get on a single life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dream A Little Dream</strong> – Deep within the shadows of an oppressive Kingdom lies the faint light of hopes and dreams. This latest update will be introducing Dreams, unique experiences similar to Scar Challenges that allow you to play out the fantasies of some of the most iconic characters in the game. What those fantasies are you will have to discover on your own. *Unlike Challenges, Dreams do not count towards earning certain achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fables For All</strong> – We’re completing the cycle and adding three new Fabled Weapons in this final update. Bring both shock and awe to your foes with Mjolnir, strike fear into their hearts with a hand puppet, or just take on the righteous tides with your surfboard. With the addition of these remaining Fabled Weapons, all Classes in the game now have one tied to them in the Soul Shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customization is the Spice of Life</strong> – To wrap things up, we are adding some minor customizations for both new and long-time fans of the PC/Mac/Linux version of the game. The first is the ability to add your own custom localizations. Please note that due to the nature of font generation, the feature is only available for languages in Latin or Cyrillic. We’re also adding custom seeds for speed runners, along with ways to validate them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the update trailer: </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-dV_OLQkcwk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a80a2996ee97a79cce782188060fe394.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-dV_OLQkcwk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Playing it for a while after release, I can see why people love the game. The design is fantastic and it looks super crisp. Tough as heck for lots of it though, really needs a lot of time to learn all the little enemy encounters and to get good at the tight platforming skills required. With nearly 12,000 user reviews on Steam and a Very Positive rating, this seems like a good send off.</p>

      <title>Animated series in the works for Vampire Survivors, plus big upgrade upcoming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not only will Vampire Survivors get another content upgrade and a small patch later this month but an animated TV show is currently in the works.</p>
<p>Clearly the developers are doing well, and not really a huge surprise, since Vampire Survivors is one of the biggest indie hits in the last year. With an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over 185,000. Anyone who enjoys it I'm sure can attest to have utterly captivating it can be to play.</p>
<p>Sharing the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3717201559848963709" target="_blank">Steam</a> about the animated show, the developers said they've pulled in a company called Story Kitchen, whose team includes Derek Kolstad (John Wick) and Dmitri M. Johnson (Sonic films). So they have help in the industry but studio founder Luca Galante mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we all know, the most important thing in Vampire Survivors has always been the story, so we are very excited for this and we hope you are too! It’s still early days for the show, but I can already say that we will be involved so that we can ensure it doesn’t have any vampires (probably) and they will only cast the finest garlic. While we will be involved, this won't affect game development in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't actually mean it will happen though, as <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/vampire-survivors-video-game-animated-television-series-story-kitchen-luca-galante-poncle-trailer-1235340337/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> reported they're searching for a writer and they still need some network to actually pick it up and buy into it. So it may never happen but given the popularity of the game, it may prove popular.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126313641683037307gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126313641683037307gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the game, a small patch is coming this month and then a <em>bigger</em> v1.5 content patch is planned to come later with new stages and relics but no dates set. They did say the 1.5 patch will have something different, as they keep experimenting with things like previous updates.</p>
<p>While all of this is going on, they're still working through their game engine upgrade too, which you can <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1794680/discussions/3/5769714637082190371/" target="_blank">try in Beta</a>.</p>

      <title>Combat Master is a cheesy indie free to play Call of Duty</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heard of Combat Master? It's a free to play first-person shooter released on Steam in late April and now it has Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Designed to be like a much cheesy faster Call of Duty, one that it's optimized for lower-end systems, it doesn't have anywhere near the level of graphics of the current-gen shooters. It's also a game that was <em>primarily</em> made for mobile it seems, that they've ported over to PC and just recently they added Native Linux and Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10797079801683034929gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10797079801683034929gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Notes from the latest update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Max players increased: 5v5 and 10 players lobbies are here!</li>
<li>Lightning speed loading time!</li>
<li>Steamdeck release, Linux + SteamOS.</li>
<li>New settting "Toggle Sprint" for Keyboard players.</li>
<li>Set "Huh" jump sounds volume.</li>
<li>Sniper Rifles now deal more damage over distance.</li>
<li>Customize color of Armor Icon in UI.</li>
<li>Far away shooting sounds are now louder.</li>
<li>Invert Y-axis setting.</li>
<li>Warehouse map clipping fix.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also said the "CombatZone" is coming soon, so probably their own low-end take on a BR like Call of Duty Warzone.</p>
<p>It certainly won't win any awards for originality, and it really is pretty much a bargain-bin poor man's Call of Duty attempt by a small team. That said, it's popular on mobile and even on Steam it seems to regularly have multiple thousands playing it at any time so it seems to have already found an audience. Alfa Bravo Inc (the developers) even say they're just "enthusiasts" who have a "special love for firearms" and the gaming industry with "No corporates" involved.</p>

      <title>Seems the big Chinese surge on Steam is over - Steam Survey for April 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/" target="_blank">latest</a> Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for April 2023, and it shows that things have calmed down again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/the-latest-steam-survey-had-a-huge-surge-of-simplified-chinese/" target="_blank">I reported earlier last month</a>, that the details they had for March 2023 looked really off. It showed a massive surge in Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam with it becoming top, along with Windows 10 surging up over Windows 11 as well. It was all a bit odd. Valve never issued any corrections though, or announced any issues with it at all.  </p>
<p>For April 2023, things have settled down again with Linux back to 1.32% (+0.48%), macOS back to 2.30% (+0.89%) and Windows at 96.38% (-1.37%). Languages changed dramatically again too with Simplified Chinese dropping back down to 25.03% (26.60%) so English being once again the top language used on Steam.</p>
<p>When filtering the April 2023 survey over to Linux here's the current most popular ways to game:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 22.77% +1.57%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 10.84% +1.23%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.79% -0.57%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.61% +0.51%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.25% -0.70%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 4.97% +4.97%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.86% +3.86%</li>
<li>Other 33.90% -10.89%</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's clear the Steam Deck is currently beating all other ways on Steam for playing games on Linux.</p>

      <title>FNA gets Direct3D 11 support on Linux using DXVK and vkd3d</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun for game developers and game porters looking at Linux and Steam Deck here, as <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> has released a major upgrade that has early support for Direct3D 11 on Linux. <em>FNA powers quite a <a href="https://www.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Tools#01_FNA.txt" target="_blank">lot</a> of games, and is used to help port games over to Linux as well.</em></p>
<p>In the latest FNA release <a href="https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/releases/tag/23.05" target="_blank">23.05</a> it brings Linux support for Direct3D 11 rendering in Alpha. How? Making use of DXVK-Native (which is now just part of <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> itself) and vkd3d. You might be wondering, and I certainly was - why? Well, developer Ethan Lee wrote on their <a href="https://icculus.org/finger/flibitijibibo" target="_blank">blog-thingy</a>:</p>

<p>I was really excited to help with this for a few reasons:</p>

<li>It was an excuse to work with CodeWeavers' programmers again</li>
<li>Having a Linux-native HLSL-&gt;DXBC compiler has been on every porter's wishlist forever (as <a href="https://github.com/icculus/mojoshader/commits/main/mojoshader_compiler.c" target="_blank">Ryan can attest to</a>)</li>
<li>It was also an excuse to start helping Joshua Ashton with making D3D9/10/11 a runtime provided by operating systems, as well as the Steam Runtime</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>While Valve still isn't prioritizing native, that hasn't stopped others from working on it independently - it's this cooperation that allowed the FNA team to release what I'm badly naming <strong><em>"The FNA3D D3D11 Linux Alpha"</em></strong>! Available on <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">the FNA website</a>, this is a supplementary archive for fnalibs.tar.bz2; by updating fnalibs and bundling linux_d3d11, you can now pass <code class="inline-code">/gldevice:D3D11</code> as a launch arg, and it will use dxvk with the native Linux binaries. Is it any better than our native OpenGL/Vulkan renderers? Maybe! Is it still cool even if it isn't better? Sure! The main goal of this feature is that it showcases what's possible for studios using D3D that want to make native versions, since <em>somebody</em> needs to tell everyone that this is an option, and I don't see anyone else doing that, so... here we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19902407871683030873gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19902407871683030873gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above is Streets of Rage 4, a shot taken from Lee's post about it showing it running with this change to FNA. Below a bunch of screenshots Lee further explained once their TODOs on it are done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That will effectively fulfill my vision for what all of the recent DirectX work could be doing for native: Provide a built-in Direct3D runtime and HLSL compiler in distributions, just as we already do for other graphics libraries and shader languages, so that developers can target native Linux binaries without having to statically bundle what amounts to an entire graphics driver inside their game. The samples above may not look super cutting edge, but even small developers can make use of these features to improve energy efficiency for the new handheld PC craze, as well as improving on the usual performance and stability concerns.</p>
<p>And of course, I'm still supporting OpenGL as always, and the FNA team is still heavily invested in <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_shader_tools/blob/main/docs/README-SDL_gpu.md" target="_blank">SDL_gpu</a>, but this has been a fun thing to work on in between SDL_ActionSet work and some other console projects that I've been working on in the background. I hope the work will help continue to build a platform that developers feel confident shipping native games on, and maybe Valve will get excited about it too!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will certainly be interesting to see what becomes of this, and perhaps if more developers look towards something like DXVK and vkd3d it could help bring down costs when it comes to porting. Although for bigger developers that largely depends on what happens with the Steam Deck and Linux desktop user share over time, it has to be worth it for them.</p>

      <title>Another Steam and Steam Deck Beta brings fixes and Steam Input improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the huge update recently that overhauled the Steam Overlay, Valve has put up another Steam and Steam Deck Beta to fix up lingering issues and upgrade Steam Input.</p>
<p>For the May 1st update on Desktop here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3705942560795699113" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed -silent command-line option not working.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to http transfers.</li>
<li>Fixed opening systray menu for certain monitor configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Menus now work in the desktop overlay.</li>
<li>Added binding listener dialog that lets you bind inputs by hitting a mouse button, keyboard key, or gamepad button.</li>
<li>LED Color/Brightness Action reinstated as a bindable action. Find the Action settings inside the Game Pad tab when selecting an action binding (available on controllers with LEDs only).</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator not fully closing when backing out via gamepad in the Desktop overlay.</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator opening layout previews in a new window instead of directly in the configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed cases where alt-tabbing between the stand alone instance of the desktop configurator and a game would not update the in-game layout.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed windows not grouping together in the taskbar.</li>
<li>Fixed pinning a steam window to the taskbar resulting in a shortcut that could not launch steam.</li>
<li>Fixed association of steam windows with the steam.desktop application entry.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The taskbar issue was quite a little nuisance, nothing truly breaking but annoyingly all the same so glad to see that fixed quickly (and yes it is actually fixed, I checked).</p>
<p>Over on Steam Deck the changes are basically the same, since Valve now share a lot of the code between them, something they were keen to highlight in the recent major update so it makes implementing features a lot easier for them and they can bring the features to PC and Steam Deck faster. These are the Steam Deck <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3717201559861560266" target="_blank">changes</a> (Beta and Preview channels):</p>

<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>

<li>Fixed a crash related to http transfers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Desktop Mode</strong></p>

<p>What have you been playing? I only recently finished Fallen Order, hoping the sequel would be worth playing through but as we saw it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/star-wars-jedi-survivor-had-a-very-rough-launch/" target="_blank">another poor launch</a>. Major publishers just keep pushing things out that aren't ready. It didn't take long for the next major game to have a crap launch with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294810/Redfall/" target="_blank">Redfall</a> already on Mostly Negative.</p>
<p>This and more was covered in my recent news overview video:</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Starve Together huge sale, content update and hitting records</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Klei Entertainment have just released that latest update for their co-op survival game Don't Starve Together, it's a good one and it's on a massive sale too.</p>
<p>This is the biggest discount on Steam the game has ever had with 90% off until May 4th, putting it at only £1.09 / $1.49 / €1.49. Thanks to this, the player count for it has skyrocketed. The previous peak of 68,418 back in 2019 was smashed with it hitting a new top of 107,998.</p>
<p>It's not just the discount pulling people in though - it is a great game and the latest update sounds fun adding in rifts that appear, these will spawn creatures that are "very interested in gardening". Plus there's new powerful equipment to craft and this is only the first part of a trilogy of updates coming to the game as part of the "From Beyond" update arc.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a5-sHjpO7-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5cceb6d0eeaa2f9b74596c96d83052a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a5-sHjpO7-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>They haven't forgotten about the original single-player <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/219740/Dont_Starve/" target="_blank">Don't Starve</a> though, it also has a 75% discount until May 4th and they released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/219740/view/3725082859194767733" target="_blank">a huge</a> quality of life update for the game too.</p>

      <title>Is X4: Kingdom End worth your money?</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It has been over four years since X4: Foundations was released. With the new fourth DLC Kingdom End, Egosoft has now brought the last of the original races back into the game, namely the peaceful and scientifically highly motivated Borons.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IdLuSIB76UA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/502dc921dad8836758e9f522284fb26f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IdLuSIB76UA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3>So, what does the new DLC Kingdom End offer?</h3>
<p>Firstly, there is, of course, the new storyline about the Borons, who were separated from the other sectors at the beginning of the game. As players, our task is to not only restore the connection with the Borons but also help them reintegrate into the community of other factions.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with the Borons: they are peaceful aquatic creatures primarily interested in science and harmony, and they prioritize violence and economy less.</p>
<p>In addition to the long-awaited reunion with the Borons, the new DLC also expands the existing sector network. The Borons add 11 new sectors, divided into two regions, to the game. Furthermore, there are, of course, the Borons themselves and all their ships and stations.</p>
<p>Economically, there is also a requirement for a specific resource that is different from many other races – the Borons require water to build their ships and stations, a resource that has not been used for building ships and stations in X4 so far.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Boron ship design is a little different from that of the other races. The Boron ships are overall more streamlined, have a deep blue color, pulsating lights, and all appear somewhat delicate. Additionally, all ships have names of aquatic creatures, which, I believe, are almost all fish names.</p>
<p>As for ship selection, many of the ships are designed primarily for good defense and speed. For example, there is the Hydra, which has an enormously strong shield performance, or the cannon ship Tresher, which is also heavily armored.</p>
<p>However, there are no battleships or frigates for the Borons. Nevertheless, the Borons have two carrier ships, one in size L and one in XL. These carriers can then be equipped with a light fighter, the Mako, or its heavy counterpart, the Barracuda. Additionally, there are various civilian ships of the Borons, such as scouts, miners, transporters, and so on.</p>
<p>Similar to previous DLCs, Kingdom End also has two new game starts that begin at different points in the game, but ultimately lead to the same sandbox-like universe that many X4 players know and love. This means that we can still enjoy all the gameplay freedoms while also immersing ourselves in the Boron storyline.</p>
<p>Of course, I would rather not spoil the story, but I can say that it is well done. One sector that will immediately catch your attention during the early missions of the new game start is the Sanctuary of Darkness.</p>
<p>This sector is not only dangerous because some aliens fly around there, but also because there is a kind of space storm raging through it which one has to fight their way. This gave me quite a headache, as I think I died about seven or eight times trying to get through this sector. Nevertheless, I think this sector is overall a nice addition because it adds exciting elements to the story as well as to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Sanctuary of Darkness can be quite frustrating, especially for beginners, and I have to confess that after the seventh or eighth try, I simply consulted Reddit to find my way through the sector.</p>
<p>A nice element of at least one of these launches is that we get the research station/player HQ shortly after the beginning of that launch – and without any work at all. We only have to dock there once and then we can chat a little with the first Boron we meet in the storyline and he then simply gives us the station.</p>
<p>The expansion also comes with its own set of achievements that can only be unlocked with this DLC.</p>
<h3>6.00 Update</h3>
<p>Alongside the paid DLC, Egosoft also released the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/6659175566905047112" target="_blank">free 6.0 update</a>. This update offers a new physics engine, improved lighting effects, and parallax occlusion mapping, which has made significant changes to the game's underlying systems.</p>
<p>However, personally, I don't think I saw much of a difference. Although I had already set my graphics settings to high and still found the game relatively attractive, there were some performance drops in certain areas. While I mostly had around 60 FPS, there were moments – especially in stations – where the FPS dropped to around 18 or 20.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, X4 is still an incredibly demanding game even with the new DLC and update, not just in terms of graphics but also in terms of CPU and RAM usage on your PC. It's hardly surprising, given that the game simulates a vast universe with around 100 sectors.</p>
<p>In addition to some new models for the construction ships of all races and the option for fleets led by a single carrier to defend multiple positions, the 6.0 update naturally offers a whole host of smaller bug fixes and changes, which I cannot mention all here. But please follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/6659175566905047112" target="_blank">this link</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p>However, one feature I particularly liked in the 6.0 update was the live-stream feature. By pressing F6, we can now select a new camera perspective that presents a ship or station from the outside – optionally with some basic information and cinematic black bars. This is great for a long journey in space, and I was delighted that Egosoft added it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Did I like X4 Kingdom End and the update?</p>
<p>To put it briefly, overall yes.</p>
<p>However, I must admit that X4 is not a game that you can just play on the side. Even though I had already spent around 150 hours in X4 before the DLC, I actually had to relearn the ship controls and figure out where all the hotkeys were in the first hour of the new DLC.</p>
<p>The other reason why X4 is not a game for "just playing for a moment" is that, after four years and with the new DLC and update, it is a real monster. The game is not only incredibly large, with around 100 sectors, but also incredibly complex. And it just takes time to make progress in certain areas.</p>
<p>You have to build your reputation, earn money, and buy or steal your fleet together – and that takes a little time. However, that's also the beauty of X4. So if you have the time and patience to get into X4, you'll definitely have a lot of fun, especially now with the new DLC and the newly added Borons.</p>
<p>However, while playing, I also noticed some things that I didn't find quite polished. For example, when I received my Mako fighter as a gift from the Borons, I didn't know how to get into the damn thing. Here, a very simple tutorial hint would have been nice to show newcomers an easy way into their ship.</p>
<p>Since X4 is still a very complex and large game, some minor bugs are to be expected. The autopilot, for example, still tends to crash into things if you rely on it too much. Other than that, there are a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing really dramatic.</p>
<p>In terms of game design, I found the mission where you have to set the navigation beacons in Sanctuary of Darkness – don't worry, it's not a particularly late mission, so I won't spoil too much – not easy at all. This is mainly because there are hardly any visual clues as to where it is safest to pass through this sector.</p>
<p>While you're told to stick to the asteroids and look for areas where nothing is destroyed, there aren't many asteroids in this sector, and the path isn't very clear. After about seven or eight attempts, I ended up consulting Reddit because it was getting too frustrating – and I found that a bit disappointing. When I had to pass through the sector again later, I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would say that X4 Kingdom End is definitely worth the purchase, especially for fans of the series. However, I think most of you have already bought the DLC by now.</p>
<p>Not only does it add the last remaining race in the X4 universe to the game, but there are also 11 new sectors and two new regions. By the way, these two regions are very different economically. While the sectors of the Provinces Adrift are initially quite starved economically, the sectors of the royal Borons are economically well-positioned. Both parties are thirsty for expanding their economic influence across the entire X-universe – and that offers some gameplay options.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the music. I can only emphazise that Alexei Zakharov did an excellent job. The music of the game was the element that captivated me already in the trailer and provided me with some beautiful moments in the game. Sitting in front of the screen and watching the new sectors and ships in live-view while enjoying the atmospheric music created some special moments.</p>
<p>So if you've played X4 in the past and have €14.99 / $14.99 / £12.49 to spare, I highly recommend giving the DLC a chance. I think the new DLC is a real improvement, as is the new update.</p>
<p>However, I hope that X4 will continue to work on the story and especially the performance in future updates, as it is still an issue. Nevertheless, X4 is and remains a unique game in its own right, and I am very pleased that it is still being developed and hope that it will continue to receive new updates.</p>
<p>If you've never played X4 before, I can definitely recommend the game, but with the small warning that the game not only requires at least a decent PC, but also a lot of time. But the game is certainly beautiful. There are few single-player space simulations that are as comprehensive and offer as much freedom as X4.</p>
<p>You can buy X4 on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/x4_foundations?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/x4-foundations?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor had a very rough launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Just like The Last of Us Part I (and so many other games recently), another major game released too early. STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor is a hot mess.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for players to make their thoughts clear, with the Steam user review rating hitting Mostly Negative shortly after release from over three thousand people, although now it's changed to Mixed. This could easily be the worst launch so far this year. It's so full of general technical issues but the biggest problem is the performance, as even on top-end systems it seems to be struggling everywhere.</p>
<p>Here's an example of just how bad it is on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="poYcwyybW8I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4253bc83e5aab08c43e51979a932c87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/poYcwyybW8I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's probably going to be quite a while before it's fixed up to a satisfactory level. They've now released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1774580/view/3719453359664023556" target="_blank">statement</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are aware that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor isn’t performing to our standards for a percentage of our PC players, in particular those with high-end machines or certain specific configurations.</p>
<p>For example, players using cutting-edge, multi-threaded chipsets designed for Windows 11 were encountering problems on Windows 10, or high-end GPUs coupled with lower-performing CPUs also saw unexpected frame loss. Rest assured, we are working to address these cases quickly.</p>
<p>While there is no single, comprehensive solution for PC performance, the team has been working on fixes we believe will improve performance across a spectrum of configurations. We are committed to fixing these issues as soon as possible, but each patch requires significant testing to ensure we don’t introduce new problems. Thanks for understanding and apologies to any of our players experiencing these issues. We will continue to monitor performance across all platforms and share update timing as soon as it is available.</p>
<p>The Star Wars Jedi Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor out on desktop Linux with my Fedora KDE 38 system running an AMD Ryzen 5800X, an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and Proton Experimental it can't hold anywhere near 60FPS even at only 1080p. Testing across Low, Medium and High details preset, the performance across all of them is very similar and even Low is well below 60FPS, often 40FPS and below. Keep in mind these shots are on Low details:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16144453171682717033gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16144453171682717033gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16342425531682717035gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16342425531682717035gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Right now, it's a definite skip until they actually sort out all the performance problems.</p>

      <title>Huge Steam Beta upgrade with new overlay, screenshot manager &amp; more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow. Valve sure love to just drop awesome stuff out of nowhere don't they? A brand new Beta update is now live for Steam with some massive improvements. There's also a fresh Steam Deck Beta too!</p>
<p>First, let's talk Steam Desktop. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3686801719529689367" target="_blank">Beta</a> brings in a whole new Steam Overlay with a new interface and a fancy toolbar, that gives you easy access to various things like friends chat, achievements progress, guides, discussions, a browser, and more. There's a new notes app that lets you type in whatever you like, saved in the cloud and synced across other systems. Even more awesome, is that you can now pin things on top of the game window, to have them show on top — which sounds incredibly useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/899241641682676661gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/899241641682676661gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Above you can see the new overlay in action on Fedora KDE 38, with a bunch of windows open. And a note telling myself that I need to "Git gud". If you notice, the guide has a blue pin, because that has been pinned to the game, so when looking at the game it would show up like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8027767671682676763gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8027767671682676763gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Wherever you place a pinned window in the overlay, is where it will show on the game.</p>
<p>Notifications have been overhauled too and they even upgraded the screenshot manager.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19112819641682676287gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19112819641682676287gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For Linux and macOS, Valve even said their work has now enabled hardware acceleration bringing it up to the same level as the Windows client. So now Steam should be a lot smoother. One thing they noted is how a lot of work went under the hood for all this, as they changed how they share the code between desktop, big picture and Steam Deck to help bring features out faster.</p>
<p>There's subtle design changes across the whole client too, so a lot more of it matches with their newer modern design elements and it looks pretty great now overall, much more consistent.</p>
<p>It also wasn't mentioned directly but the old Steam file picker when adding a Non-Steam game is gone, instead it now seems to use the desktop file picker. Finally! That was one of the worst parts of the Steam client because that old Steam file picker was pretty terrible but now you get your full desktop picker. Excellent.</p>
<p>This overall is really quite a fantastic upgrade for Steam on desktop. According to Valve designer Lawrence Yang on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1651742201272209408" target="_blank">Twitter</a> the overlay improvements will eventually come to Gaming Mode on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Steam Deck also had a Beta and Preview update with these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3717201559846022608" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new warning icon to the header that will display when Steam Deck can't reach the Steam servers. Clicking the icon will navigate a page with more details.</li>
<li>The wifi icon will no longer show a yellow exclamation mark when Steam Deck can't reach the Steam servers. It will still show this icon if Steam Deck can't reach the internet (e.g. the connection has a login portal).</li>
<li>Added support for Mouse4 (Back) as B button in the interface.</li>
<li>Fixed opening the "Reorder controllers" dialog in the main Big Picture Window when a game is running.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new config export path that works while offline. In personal configuration dropdown the options are now "New Personal Save", which is this new option and "New Sharable Personal Save", which uses the existing Steam Workshop backend.</li>
<li>Filter the configuration export options based on whether the device is connected to Steam/Offline.</li>
<li>Fixed some flashes when adjusting sliders in the Quick Settings section of the configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed moving right in the mode settings page not jumping to the appropriate settings sub-page.</li>
<li>Fixed turning off the Dual Sense Edge controller.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Steam Deck has all the new overlay stuff too but just in Desktop Mode for now. </em></p>
<p><strong>Update 28/04/23 20:08 UTC</strong>: an additional Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3705942560783794887" target="_blank">update</a> went out, fixing up some issues and adding back the missing Steam Play settings.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us gets more optimizations and another Steam Deck fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slowly but it's happening, The Last of Us is getting fixed up after the poor launch and it's getting a little closer to being playable on Steam Deck now too. On desktop Linux at least, it ran pretty well at release (aside from all the confirmed game bugs and issues) but on Steam Deck it was especially rough.</p>
<p>Here's everything changed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1888930/view/5815877879410560069" target="_blank">v1.0.4</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized CPU and GPU use throughout the game</li>
<li>Improved texture fidelity and resolution on in-game Low and Medium settings</li>
<li>Improved graphical fidelity on the in-game Low graphics preset, particularly water surfaces no longer appear black</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur during shader building</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur when quitting to the Main Menu</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur when dying after combat</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, on first boot, players may experience longer wait times to load into the game</li>
<li>Added an option for players to lock and unlock performance stats simultaneously in the HUD menu (Options &gt; HUD)</li>
<li>Added descriptions in the Graphics menus to better explain when certain settings may affect another (Options &gt; Display)</li>
<li>Added a Texture Streaming Rate setting (Graphics &gt; Texture Settings)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where skipping cutscenes during a critical load may cause the game to hang</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the shader load warning did not appear while relaunching the game</li>
<li>Updated the VRAM bar to more accurately display the OS+Apps usage</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Screen Reader read values for locked settings which may imply those same locked setting were active</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where aiming downward while using keyboard and mouse (KBM) may increase camera sensitivity</li>
<li>Refined the handling of certain commands that are assigned the same KBM keybinding</li>
<li>Corrected Brazilian Portuguese, Croatian, Dutch, Finnish, French, Greek, Hungarian, LATAM Spanish, Spanish, Thai, and Traditional Chinese translations for multiple menu options</li>
<li>[Ultrawide Displays] Corrected the Rangefinder reticle position for the bow</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>AMD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur on AMD CPUs with affinity limited to X3D cores</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where textures may render incorrectly on AMD GPUs</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the “It Can't Be For Nothing” achievement did not trigger, despite acquiring all other achievements</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue on Steam Deck where resetting Display settings to Default no longer enabled AMD FSR 2 (Options &gt; Display)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going back to it myself today on Steam Deck to test and the first bit of good news - is that the initial shader building on the menu now only takes just about 16 and a half minutes, down from the 1 hour it took at release. That is a huge improvement but still quite a while to twiddle your thumbs when you've already waited a good while just to download the game.</p>
<p>After that though, my first attempt to just load an early saved game resulted in my Steam Deck doing a full reboot. An annoying issue that has been present since release, that a few other bigger titles also cause as well like God of War. Second load though worked fine. One of the heaviest parts of the game is actually in the intro section, and here on the default settings (Low + FSR 2 Quality) it stayed a lot closer to 30FPS compared to before where it would be sticking well below it the entire time. So there's definitely some performance uplifts with this patch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10715926001682616755gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10715926001682616755gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17163347691682616756gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17163347691682616756gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Still far from ideal though, with multiple dips below 30FPS but the improvement is <em>clear</em> in my testing. In another couple patches, and perhaps with the upcoming major SteamOS 3.5 update, it might actually be closer to a properly playable status.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you've given it another run since this latest patch, how's your experience now?</p>

      <title>Charming monster collector Cassette Beasts is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is the second full release from Bytten Studio following Lenna's Inception. It's a rather sweet evolution on the Pokémon-like monster catching games.</p>
<p>Giving off an 80s vibe, this is an open-world RPG with turn-based battles where you record monsters on retro cassette tapes, and you can use some of their abilities in the open world too. Together with the clever fusion system, that allows you to create lots of unique creatures, there's a lot to love about it.</p>
<p>Developed with Godot Engine, it has full Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified with the Steam Deck using the Native Linux build by default. The Godot Engine team just <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-showcase-cassette-beasts/" target="_blank">did an interview</a> with the developers that's worth a read too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_OLST_Fw5Ms"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d9c826a8b5b43e68a56a646276bbf49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_OLST_Fw5Ms" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?! Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li>Fuse monster forms! Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li>Explore a rich open world - Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions - Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li>Master a deep battle system - Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
<li>Play couch-co op with Friends - Team up in local multiplayer with a friend to explore an open world, transform and battle together! Facing the unknown as a duo will surely develop your relationship!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely worth picking up. The developers have supported Linux very nicely with it and it's just a great looking game. I had a huge amount of fun with the demo which you can still try right now to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

"Thank you to our dedicated community of players for their support and feedback throughout the years. As we watch the sun set on Cities: Skylines together and move to the next chapter of the franchise, we look forward to seeing and learning from the amazing creations players design, this last time and beyond."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BFc50HzpQYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19c4f39e789384fb186ac96f4704516f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BFc50HzpQYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is all the final content, the game will still get general support until the end of the year. So if any big bugs need squashing then we might see some smaller updates come in.

      <title>Street Fighter 6 on Steam Deck and Linux tested, Valve sets it to Proton Experimental</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Street Fighter 6 is coming up for release in June and there's a demo now available to try out on Steam, which Valve has now set to use Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1651345821332557824" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve designer Lawrence Yang noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For folks checking out the Street Fighter 6 demo on Steam Deck, the launch issue has been addressed (we’ve temporarily pinned the title to Proton Experimental.)</p>
<p>You may need to restart Steam to pick up this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you have been trying it out and couldn't get it working right, either uncheck any Proton version in the compatibility settings to pick up what Valve set or manually swap it over to Proton Experimental yourself. For now Valve think that will give you the best experience in the demo. I did notice though one video in the intro logo screen section didn't work, and was instead their video-test screen but apart from that everything else seemed to work.</p>
<p>Performance can be an issue though. It's easy enough to get a near-solid 60FPS in the versus mode on Steam Deck but the World Tour mode is a different beast. Settings will need to be turned down for it.</p>
<p>Here's a short look at the demo running on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xuKA41Z-2sM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb6e3fa37ff50c42fd7ac251770ec927.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xuKA41Z-2sM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On desktop Linux, I've done my testing here with Fedora KDE 38 and one thing it did on desktop, that it didn't do on Steam Deck, is offer up pre-warming of the shaders. So, letting it do that option, gave a wait of only around 2 minutes on my Ryzen 7 5800X / NVIDIA 2080 Ti setup, so nice and speedy compared to some other games.</p>
<p>After that, the versus mode on desktop Linux with Proton gave an almost perfect 60FPS at 2560x1400 (Ultra settings) and it looks amazing in action. It could go a lot higher but the fights are locked to 60FPS as a max:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14365365581682606110gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14365365581682606110gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The full game is set to launch on June 2nd, so it's nice to see that Valve are keeping a close eye on yet another popular titles about to release.</p>
<p>You can pre-order on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/street-fighter-6?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364780/Street_Fighter_6/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental upgraded for April 26th brings fixes and new game support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go, now that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Proton 8</a> is out <em>and</em> Proton Experimental has been rebased on top of Proton 8, there's more fixes and improvements coming in for Steam Deck and Linux desktop gamers.</p>
<p>Valve released an update to Proton Experimental on April 26th that includes these newly supported games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint.</li>
<li>Minecraft Legends.</li>
<li>Company of Heroes: Battle of Crete.</li>
<li>STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are fixes from regressions in Proton 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3 no longer launches to a black screen in Vulkan mode.</li>
<li>Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition and Divinity Original Sin II: Definitive Edition no longer crash on resolution change.</li>
<li>Path of Exile no longer crashes.</li>
<li>GTA V no longer freezes after each key press.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's these other improvements too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regression causing Payday 2 to crash on start.</li>
<li>Improved Elden Ring compatibility compared to Proton 8.0-1. It can still be a bit finicky.</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in Trackmania and Ubisoft Connect overlay.</li>
<li>Added a temporary workaround for EA Launcher crashing. Steam Deck's on-screen keyboard may not pop up automatically while using it.</li>
<li>Fixed Madballs in Babo: Invasion claiming the game wasn't purchased.</li>
<li>Fixed PlanetSide 2 launcher.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>Since there's many different Proton versions it can get a bit confusing, so head on over to my <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">beginner's guide on Steam Play and Proton</a> for more info.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming "Paws &amp; Claws" update for Core Keeper sounds wonderful, adding in two major features with pets and a creative mode.</p>
<p>Releasing on May 10th it will have an entirely new Meadow biome featuring cattle, animal companions you can hatch and lots of new game mechanics. There's also going to be new decorative items too like glass that could be useful. Adding a creative mode sounds good too, for those that prefer things a bit more peaceful. This creative mode also has a god mode, allowing you to move much more freely including through objects.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J3AHHSdTaHk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55ae7bbc66043f835e7786142a6055fb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J3AHHSdTaHk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Pricing of the game is also going to change on May 29th with prices going up, however it's also on a 20% discount from the currently lower price now until May 22nd. As for the rising price they shared these as an example of what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Price in GBP = £12.99</li>
<li>Updated Price in USD = $15.99</li>

      <title>UK CMA blocks the Microsoft takeover of Activision</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's some industry news for you: the UK's Competition and Markets Authority has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-activision-deal-prevented-to-protect-innovation-and-choice-in-cloud-gaming" target="_blank">announced</a> today they've blocked Microsoft's takeover of Activision.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the main concern of the UK CMA here seems to be around Cloud Gaming specifically. As they said in their statement "Microsoft has a strong position in cloud gaming services and the evidence available to the CMA showed that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s games exclusive to its own cloud gaming service." and that "The deal would reinforce Microsoft’s advantage in the market by giving it control over important gaming content such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft. The evidence available to the CMA indicates that, absent the merger, Activision would start providing games via cloud platforms in the foreseeable future.".</p>
<p><em>Quite a big blow to the $68.7 billion deal!</em></p>
<p>We saw Microsoft attempt to get around these concerns, with various Cloud Gaming deals being announced over the last year but it seems that just hasn't been enough. An interesting part of the CMA announcement was on a proposal submitted by Microsoft, to address some of their concerns, this proposal was to set out "requirements governing what games must be offered by Microsoft to what platforms and on what conditions over a ten-year period" but one of the shortcomings noted was "It was not sufficiently open to providers who might wish to offer versions of games on PC operating systems other than Windows.". Nice to see.</p>
<p>The UK certainly isn't the only country to be concerned by the power this deal would hand to Microsoft with the US FTC also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-hits-a-bump-as-ftc-seeks-to-block-it/" target="_blank">trying to block it</a> and according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/no-substantive-settlement-talks-between-us-ftc-microsoft-over-activision-lawyer-2023-01-03/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> earlier this year there were no substantive settlement talks on it. So now with the UK blocking it, that will likely boost the FTC's argument to block it too. On top of that, there's also the EU regulators decision coming up next month.</p>
<p>Microsoft, naturally, will be attempting to appeal the decision.</p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts?</em></p>

      <title>Valheim is getting siege weapons, fortresses and fearsome foes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming major update to Valheim with The Ashlands is sounding increasingly exciting, as the developers have another spoiler-filled development <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com/news/development-blog-fearsome-foes/" target="_blank">blog post</a> up. Naturally, you'll want to avert your eyes if you don't want anything spoiled.</p>
<p>While there's no expected release date yet for The Ashlands because they're still working out all the mechanics, this is an exciting glimpse into what to expect from it. However, we might see some public testing within the next couple of months.</p>
<p>It seems the land will be filled with fortresses and siege weapons, something that was teased on <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinEyreArt/status/1646798139930681344" target="_blank">Twitter</a> recently but now we have a clear shot of one:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20765479481682506191gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20765479481682506191gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>These fortresses will come with some scary looking creatures too like the Fallen Valkyrie and the Charred:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14217335941682506322gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14217335941682506322gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19348428301682506321gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19348428301682506321gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sure they look scary, but I would argue the scariest foes in Valheim are still those damn Deathsquitos, sneaky little things. Lost count of the amount of times I've been bested by them.</p>
<p>Oh and if that wasn't enough, there's going to be a Bonemaw Serpent ready to chomp sections of your ships away, or your arms and legs if you happen to fall into the water:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8095496471682506414gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8095496471682506414gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>All this plus the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valheim-is-getting-extensive-difficulty-options-including-a-creative-mode/" target="_blank">upcoming customisation</a> of the difficulty options (and a creative mode) really has me excited, the future of Valheim is sounding simply awesome.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: Galactic Paragons announced for May 9th and a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellaris: Galactic Paragons is the next expansion for my favourite space strategy game from Paradox Interactive and it's coming May 9th. This DLC will give deeper character and story progression allowing for more customisation of your leaders.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“There are endless stories to tell in the Stellaris universe. Breathing life into the stories of the leaders in the Galactic Council and your empires is a perfect showcase of the team’s commitment to expanding the ways our players can explore a vast and wondrous galaxy,” said Stephen Muray, Game Director for Stellaris. “Our players push us to bring Stellaris to new heights, and we'll be exploring the galaxy alongside them for years to come.”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NrWoHmBntTw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7793c3863bcba899f8e683d776969bc6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NrWoHmBntTw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique Council Roles</strong>: Specialized roles and benefits are included in Galactic Paragons to expand upon the new Council Mechanics in Stellaris! Find dozens of unique council roles based on your civics and government types, and unlock additional positions as your empire evolves.</li>
<li><strong>New Dynamic Leaders</strong>: Recruit, improve, and follow the leaders of your empire through the ages! You may shape them by picking their traits, selecting their veteran class, and guide them towards their destiny, up until they retire - or perish!</li>
<li><strong>Meet Galactic Heroes</strong>: Attract paragons of renown to your council: unique leaders with their own art, events, and stories may join your empire and bring their own benefits to your government. Or, discover four Legendary Paragons with intricate event chains and unique mechanics!</li>
<li><strong>New Traditions, Civics, And More</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A new “Under One Rule” Origin that tells the tale of the leader who founded your empire</li>
<li>Eight new Civics focused on leadership, from immortalizing the personalities of leaders past in digital archives to heavily optimized council selection via corporate charter</li>
<li>12 new Veteran Classes</li>
<li>Hundreds of new Leader Traits</li>
<li>Two new Tradition Trees, giving players new edicts and improved leaders</li>
<li>New ships, art, and story content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will of course drop alongside the 3.8 update which I mentioned recently, that will include two co-op modes. You can get a lot more info on the co-op mode in their <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-293-introducing-coop.1577064/" target="_blank">explainer forum post</a> but essentially it comes down to these key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cooperative PvE</strong> allows players to join together as a single empire to take on enemy empires. This presents a great opportunity for players to teach their friends how to play the game or divide the responsibilities of empire management for a more relaxed gaming experience.</li>
<li><strong>Cooperative PvP</strong> allows groups of players to join opposing empires to fight against each other. Splitting up duties may reduce barriers to entry of competitive multiplayer by being less overwhelming. For more competitive players, empires can also be locked and require a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a Preview update with STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor is releasing on April 28th, so Valve has released an updated graphics driver in the Preview update branch for Steam Deck. This is the work covered previously where Valve wouldn't name the game, so we got <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-improving-mesa-graphics-drivers-on-linux-for-a-secret-game/" target="_blank">a bit too excited</a> about it.</p>
<p>Released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3729585915988347091" target="_blank">April 25th</a>, the Steam Deck OS 3.4.7 Beta available in the Preview branch simply notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the graphics driver with performance improvements for STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you're wanting to get the best out of Jedi: Survivor on Friday, be sure you've opted into the Preview branch on Steam Deck which you can do in the Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>The next major SteamOS update for Steam Deck should be quite an exciting one, as SteamOS 3.5 is planned to come with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/hdr-and-colour-management-patches-for-steam-deck-amd-gpus-under-review/" target="_blank">support for HDR</a> for external screens when docked along with an upgraded Linux kernel and various improvements elsewhere.</p>

      <title>Grounded 1.2 out now and Steam Deck Verified but desktop Linux needs a small fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The survival game Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Xbox Game Studios has now released version 1.2 and it got bumped up to Verified on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/grounded-from-obsidian-adds-steam-deck-support-in-v120/" target="_blank">I reported previously</a> during the Beta, the developers managed to fix up the issues that were causing the game to not run and even with workarounds the Xbox login was still a mess. All those issues were solved and it really is looking pretty great on Steam Deck now.</p>
<p>See their update video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-OH6IZ3Yf_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d78b7bbde26f5810f2a4d93bc05a9dc5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-OH6IZ3Yf_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam Deck fixes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The game now boots past the initial loading screen.</li>
<li>The Xbox log-in window properly displays.</li>
<li>Tuned the default graphics settings for Steam Deck to provide an enjoyable experience. Also includes some Steam Deck-specific optimizations.</li>
<li>Steam Deck virtual keyboard pops up when selecting any input text field in the game (entering a multiplayer game password, naming your trail marker / storage, pet, etc.)</li>
<li>Control prompts no longer flip flop between displaying gamepad and mouse/keyboard controls when using the touch pad or gyro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see my previous video of the 1.2 Beta below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xJUI-l-damM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f3a33a1e5aee687b7d48e93c0251ce52.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xJUI-l-damM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Grounded will be having a Free Weekend on Steam as well from April 27th until May 1st, so you'll be able to check it out on Steam Deck and see all the fancy new stuff too.</p>
<p>For Linux gamers on <em>desktop</em>, sadly it still won't run out of the box. However, to get it to work all you have to do is remove or rename the <code class="inline-code">SpeechSynthWrapper.dll</code> file found in the <code class="inline-code">Grounded/Maine/Binaries/Win64/</code> install folder. You can find the installed folder in Properties -&gt; Local Files / Installed Files and hit Browse. Here's a shot from it running just fine after that on Fedora KDE 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5735381221682446500gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5735381221682446500gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can buy Grounded on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Using a Steam Deck to control a Ukrainian automatic turret, now I&#39;ve seen it all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>People have used their Steam Deck to do all sorts of crazy things but this latest is nuts. It seems people in Ukraine are using it to help work an automatic turret. From ТРО Медіа on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tro.media.news/posts/pfbid02WH8wn384mZtJtagg9QnK9MnEFNpmjX6NLTyd3xzFsEtMmWM9cV55hVkvT8GvjJeEl" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, they shared a post giving a few details into it with it translating roughly as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sablya" is a Ukrainian automated remote-controlled fire complex designed for stationary installation on real estate objects or special transport.</p>
<p>The Shable Coordination is done via a remote control, camera and monitor, which allows combat from up to 500 from the rig, while preserving the operator's life.</p>
<p>A combat platform can be installed both stationary at checkpoints, border and other zones, including to defeat low-flying enemy "drones". On the platform you can install any light anti-infantry or anti-tank weapon weapon, for example, machine gun kalashnikov.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what did people spot in the pictures? A Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17221077421682436293gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17221077421682436293gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9027042651682436292gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9027042651682436292gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Well, it is an entire computer in your hands with a screen, with a full Linux desktop mode available. So sure, why not. Thinking plainly, it's not too different to them sitting with a laptop of any other brand, just that little bit more portable. <em>The other side is that they could just be using it to play some games in between testing and who could blame them eh?</em></p>
<p>There's spotting a Steam Deck "in the wild" and then there's this. Quite a surprise.</p>

<p>AMD also said in their press release that more info on the ROG Ally will be announced on May 11th.</p>
<p>“Having a great gaming experience doesn’t mean you have to be tied to a chair or a charger,” said Shawn Yen, product management director of Gaming Business Unit, Asus. “With the new Ryzen Z1 Series processors, we’re working with AMD to deliver the power, visuals and efficiency needed to enable a superior portable gaming experience — whether you’re traveling, commuting for work or simply want to game untethered.”</p>
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-z1" target="_blank">AMD page</a> for the new processors, AMD give more details and yet they're showing a Nintendo Switch and a Steam Deck in pictures before the Ally:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21165147581682435295gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21165147581682435295gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The question is why are they showing two devices not using these chips? An error left in, or are we just supposed to assume it's to showcase power from low to high without naming them directly? Curious. Or even upcoming new versions of both with these new chips (not likely).</p>
<p><strong>Update 20:12 UTC</strong>: AMD removed the Switch and Steam Deck so it's now just the Ally:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1553915221682449836gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1553915221682449836gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>So at least now we know what processor the ROG Ally will use but can it really compete with the Steam Deck? Until we know pricing, nothing is clear on that. With more power comes more battery drain too, there's so many unknowns about it.</p>

      <title>KDE apps like Kdenlive get big upgrades for KDE Gear 23.04</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Gear is the name of the big bundle of software the KDE team create, and with the KDE Gear 23.04 release there's new apps and plenty of improvements to making the desktop experience better.</p>
<p>One of the newer apps is Tokodon, a desktop client for Mastodon that supports multiple accounts, which is super useful if you have multiple accounts on the same host. <em>FYI you can follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux on Mastodon</a>.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10807629541682421056gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10807629541682421056gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the improvements include the ability to see previous messages when replying and the ability to send polls to your followers, plus you can also configure a proxy for it before logging in now as well.</p>
<p>The Kdenlive video editor, my go-to app for editing all GamingOnLinux videos got support for nested timelines, this new feature allows you to group several clips together to treat them as a single sequence, allowing you then do all sorts of things to the clips together like effects and transitions. Sounds incredibly useful. Honestly this is probably the feature I am most excited about, it sounds like it might end up saving a lot of time when editing videos with lots of different clips together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/716827921682422320gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/716827921682422320gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of other improvements elsewhere to the likes of their YouTube Music app called AudioTube getting a redesign, NeoChat for Matrix also has an upgraded design, the screenshot tool Spectacle now allows you to annotate screenshots and record your screen on Wayland (and it also had a redesign), the Filelight app for monitoring disk space gained a useful list view and lots more.</p>
<p>More can be seen on the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/gear/23.04.0/" target="_blank">announcement page</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Victoria 3 from Paradox Interactive is getting it's first "Immersion Pack" on May 22nd and here's what to expect from it.</p>
<p>It's called Voice of the People, Paradox say it challenges you to handle some of history's greatest political agitators. Coming with a new Agitator system that's highlighted with the addition of dozens of historical figures who break convention and build political power behind the force of their personality. Meet intellectuals like Mikhail Bakunin, conservative militarists like Georges Boulanger, and voices for freedom like Frederick Douglas.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jAEsJek9fW4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7abea2eaab323e568a78e3d96171bb18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jAEsJek9fW4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 60 New Historical Characters: Explore new alternate histories with real historical characters, including John Brown, Emmeline Pankhurst, and Enver Pasha.</li>
<li>Special Agitator Actions: Aid the agitators by promoting them to lead Interest Groups, or send them into exile to blunt their impact. You can also, in some cases, invite other nations’ exiles into your society to take advantage of their ideas.</li>
<li>Unique French Content: New events, journal missions, and decisions inspired by French history. Press your advantage in Northern Africa, back one of many royal claimants, or establish a strong French Empire in Europe and worldwide.</li>
<li>New French Buildings: Historic structures from France added to the map.</li>
<li>New Art: A paper map unique to Voice of the People, wrapped in a new art nouveau appearance. New animations for revolutions highlight the interest groups in revolt, and new clothing and uniforms are added for many societies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

The DLC will be priced around $14.99 / £12.99 / €14.99.</p>
<p>At release as usual for Paradox titles there will also be a big free upgrade for all players too.

After trying out the demo it's shot up high on my personal wishlist.

      <title>Valve moves ELDEN RING back to Proton 7 as it has issues with newer Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Certain games on Steam that you play across either Linux desktop or Steam Deck get a specific version of Proton set by Valve, and at times they don't quite work right like ELDEN RING.</p>
<p>In this case Valve had set Proton Experimental to be the default to run ELDEN RING, where it did work previously, however they just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-upgraded-with-proton-8/" target="_blank">upgraded Proton Experimental</a> basing it upon the newly released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Proton 8</a>. With any new Proton version can come breakage as the translation layer isn't quite perfected just yet and in this case the popular game is having issues with the Proton upgrades.</p>
<p>As mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1650299941699596288" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The launch issue with ELDEN RING has been addressed by temporarily reverting the game to using Proton 7 while the Proton 8 update issue is being investigated. Restarting Steam will pick up the fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you're forcing a compatibility option on ELDEN RING, you might want to uncheck it to pick up what Valve set or change it yourself back to Proton 7 to have it work again.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to keep on top of compatibility like this.</p>

      <title>Linux and Steam Deck compatibility tool Luxtorpeda gets upgraded in v63</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a very interesting project. It's a compatibility layer (like Proton) but designed to help you run Native Linux game engines for various Steam games.</p>
<p>Why? Well, quite a number of games on Steam actually have much more modern community-made game engines, that can give all sorts of quality enhancements. Luxtorpeda allows you to easily download these and run them directly through Steam.</p>
<p>Version 63 was recently released and here's the main technical changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to using Steam Linux Runtime - Sniper for the built engines. This provides newer tooling for builds, which should make future development easier, for example being able to build qt 5.15 and have gcc 10 available. The 100+ engines have been re-built. Note that previous clients should still work on the older soldier, but any new updates will only happen to sniper (this client and above). If you run into any issues with the engines, please open a new issue in the <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">packages</a> repo.</li>
<li>Rust panics, if they occur, should now be caught and displayed in the Godot UI.</li>
<li>[dreamer] Use steamlocate v2 alpha</li>
<li>Bump h2 from 0.3.15 to 0.3.17</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from that, there's been numerous <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#630-2023-04-13" target="_blank">upgrades</a> to the various game engines it offers up to help you get the most out of your gaming. You can see a full list of <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">supported titles here</a>, along with any notes on the supported status of each one and there's quite a lot now.</p>
<p>I previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">did a guide</a> on how to use it, and while focused on the Steam Deck the same applies to using it on a Linux desktop:</p>

      <title>Pixel-art Sims styled game Tiny Life hits Early Access on May 3rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ellpeck Games have announced their pixel-art game inspired by The Sims, Tiny Life will be releasing with Linux support on May 3rd. From what I've played of some of the earlier builds, it showed a huge amount of promise.</p>
<p>"Tiny Life is a fun simulation game that aims to capture the essence of games like The Sims series, but in an isometric pixelart style. In the game, you control a set of people that live together in a household. You take care of their daily needs, build their skills, forge new relationships... or just mess up their entire life in whatever way you can think of!"</p>
<p>Their current trailer is a little old but gives you a good idea on what to expect:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iw-D7queVUI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/897b57f5d30bca7e02888d7f82dfd714.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iw-D7queVUI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At the Early Access date the developer said it will contain this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything that is currently in the Tiny Life Demo.</li>
<li>Three free, always-installed Sets of content: The Familiar Attire Set, the Woodworking Set and the Fitness Set, two of which come with lots of additional stuff to do!</li>
<li>The large Maple Plains City map which was featured in the Tiny Life Beta.</li>
<li>The ability for adult Tinies to get pregnant, and give birth to babies.</li>
<li>The baby life stage, which features unique interactions, personalities, and skills.</li>
<li>The ability to export, share and import lots, households and custom maps, both manually and on the Steam Workshop.</li>
<li>The ability to create and share custom mods for Tiny Life using the official C# Modding API, both manually and on the Steam Workshop.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1651490/view/5306971121514693921" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned they've seen around 15,000 people wishlist it, so clearly there's been a good amount of interest in this one.</p>

      <title>HDR and Colour Management patches for Steam Deck + AMD GPUs under review</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Melissa Wen recently sent in <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/amd-gfx/2023-April/092215.html" target="_blank">patches</a> to improve HDR and Colour Management on Linux for Steam Deck and potentially other AMD GPUs. The work is being done by Melissa Wen, Joshua Ashton and collaboration with Harry Wentland.</p>
<p>Exciting stuff, as eventually with this we should see some HDR fun on Linux with the likes of Gamescope. In the RFC (Request For Comments) patches, it was also specifically mentioned that SteamOS 3.5 is aiming to have "gamut mapping, HDR, SDR on HDR, HDR on SDR, and much more".</p>
<p>Excerpts from the RFC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joshua Ashton and I (with the great collaboration of Harry Wentland - thanks) have been working on KMS color pipeline enhancement for Steam Deck/SteamOS by exposing the large set of color caps available in AMD display HW.<br/>
[…]<br/>
So far, we keep these properties' usage under an AMD display config option (STEAM_DECK). However, we are fine with having them fully available to other DCN HW generations. In the current proposal, we are already checking ASICs before exposing a color feature. We can work on 3D LUT resource acquisition details to fit them to DCN 3+ families that support them. Indeed, before moving to these config boundaries, we started working on an open solution for any AMD HW.</p>
<p>The userspace case here is Gamescope which is the compositor for SteamOS. It's already using all of this functionality (although with a VALVE1_ prefix instead of AMD) to implement its color management pipeline right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like developers on KDE are interested in the work too, with Wen noting that Xaver Hugl from KDE was interested in experimenting with it for their HDR / colour bring-up too.</p>

      <title>Roblox intentionally blocking Linux with Wine in their new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the days of using workarounds to play Roblox on Linux may be coming to an abrupt end, with the upcoming launch of their new client blocking Linux intentionally.</p>
<p>This new client appears to be undergoing testing, and users quickly <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528" target="_blank">noticed</a> it wasn't working under the Wine compatibility layer on Linux. It seems the issue comes from Byfron, software for anti-cheat and anti-tamper that joined up officially with Roblox back in October 2022.</p>
<p>In reply to the forum post, a staff member for Roblox <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/2" target="_blank">mentioned</a> it is intentionally blocking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Jrelvas, Unfortunately this block was intentional. With the Windows 64-bit client launch we made the conscious decision to block the use of Wine. We came to this decision due to a combination of security and compatibility concerns. As a Linux user I am sure you understand the challenges of the Windows ecosystem. Wine is not officially supported but we are committed to working towards compatibility where possible. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a specific timeline for this support. However, I assure you that it remains a priority for our team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems it may not be forever, going by what they said above and below as this new 64bit client is undergoing intense testing right now as they gather feedback, bug reports and crash logs. In a follow-up post, another staff member <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/28" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your well thought out post. First and most importantly, we are not trying to punish the use of Wine.<br/>
Our Windows 64-bit client is in some regards quite different from the 32-bit client. We are currently gathering telemetry to analyze and hopefully fix existing issues and prevent future ones from popping up. For this process to work, it is of utmost importance to collect data from the [intended] target operating system. You will also find that we blocked the usage of VMs for the very same reason.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies some of the thought process behind the blocking of Wine. As MrEaker mentioned before, Wine remains a priority for our team, and we are certainly not deaf to the voices of our community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they seem to have <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/34" target="_blank">no plans</a> to block Wine use at all with Roblox Studio.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why they can't simply filter out the unwanted Wine results, since they obviously detect it just fine. Another few posts from the Roblox staff attempted to clear it up, as they <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/38" target="_blank">mentioned</a> their client will crash "compromised processes intentionally" and since they're going through so many thousands of crash logs, it would be quite a nuisance to add more to it. Sounds like it's complicated in many parts.</p>
<p>If / when they issue an update that does allow Wine players on Linux back in, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Flathub app store for Linux and Steam Deck gets overhauled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The redesign of the <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> app store for Linux is now live, bringing with it a refreshed look along with showing verified developers and their apps. A much needed change that really does look a whole lot better.</p>
<p>With the new launch everything just looks a lot cleaner, and having a proper verification system in place means you will know if you're downloading something maintained by the creators and not a third-party. There's even a category just for <a href="https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/collection/verified/1" target="_blank">verified apps</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20489047961682155341gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20489047961682155341gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above is an example of the Games category which features not just games but launchers, emulators and more, everything related to gaming. You can see the blue ticks to clearly show verified apps.</p>
<p>While the front-page isn't massively different, the biggest visual change is to individual app pages. There's quite a bit more detail included on them like install size, download size, how many people have installed it, direct links to the website and documentation for help, a graph of installs over time, a collapsible changelog of the most recent update and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17764174091682155923gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17764174091682155923gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>On <a href="https://mastodon.social/@barthalion@treehouse.systems/110241570500375384" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, the Flathub maintainer Bartłomiej Piotrowski mentioned "A redesign of #Flathub is live! Drop by <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">https://flathub.org</a> to see all the shiny new things, such as developer verification and download graphs. There's more under the hood, including the long awaited subsets to enable only verified or FLOSS apps. Stay tuned for more updates!".</p>
<p>Flathub has quickly become my go-to place first to find downloads for any apps on Linux now. Especially with it being the main way to install extra apps on the Steam Deck too (through Discover), it's nice to have things the same across different systems.</p>

      <title>Valve improving Mesa graphics drivers on Linux for a &#34;secret&#34; game (update: Jedi Survivor)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/plagman2/status/1649562547908120576" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it’s for the upcoming Star Wars Jedi Survivor.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here's something interesting for you. Valve developers seem to be improving the Mesa graphics drivers right now towards a secret game. First noticed by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, developer Samuel Pitoiset has been working on improvements in Mesa for the RADV driver (AMD Vulkan). This is the driver used by most for gaming on AMD + desktop Linux and also the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22556" target="_blank">merge request</a> from April 18th, one of the commits noted there was an improvement to "a depth-only pass by +35% in one upcoming game". <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22579" target="_blank">Another one</a> from April 19th notes it gives another performance improvement of around 10% in "that game" (continuing to be rather cryptic). Then from April 20th there's <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22589" target="_blank">another</a> and when you read into the comments, Pitoiset <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22589#note_1879550" target="_blank">notes</a> it's "again this upcoming (secret) game" that was pointed out by SadlyItsBradley on <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1649512643273674753" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought perhaps it was just going to be preparations for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and they just didn't want to name the game of a partner they were testing for because it's coming soon. However, the continued secrecy around it and even saying directly it's a "secret" definitely now has my curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>Do we think this is a new Valve game? It would make sense that Valve have their people working on performance improvements, and not naming it because then the internet would go wild. Perhaps Left 4 Dead 3 that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/left-4-dead-3-appears-in-counter-strike-2-files/" target="_blank">was spotted</a> being named in Counter Strike 2 files? Perhaps finally Half-Life 3 (yeah likely not but I can dream).</p>
<p>Pure speculation of course and it may not be a Valve game at all. It really could actually just be a game they're testing for a third-party, as we know Valve do get to do driver fixes and Proton fixes at times before a game releases on Steam so it's ready for Steam Deck. Either way, it seems we'll <em>eventually</em> find out on this one…</p>

      <title>Dota 2: The New Frontiers Update is out and it&#39;s huge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dota 2: The New Frontiers Update might be one of the biggest updates to Valve's free to play MOBA ever and it's here now.</p>
<p>Starting with a new map that has been massively expanded with 40% more terrain. The interesting thing here is that the lanes aren't further away and everything is still focused on going through the centre but the expanded space opens the game up some more for new strategies.</p>
<p>Roshan has new homes, there's teleport towers to get from one corner of the map to another, there's Lotus Pools on the left and right sides of the map that spawn fruit to give Mana and HP which you can stockpile into a larger fruit too. On top of that there's powerful new neutral creeps to fight, special towers to capture to give extra vision, a new way to get out the back of your base when the enemy is attacking front and loads more. See the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eH6UJ4xDn4Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99bc9518e15f711fcce78f831864e788.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eH6UJ4xDn4Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another big change is to heroes with a new attribute type with Universal Heroes, Valve say it's a "new main stat group composed of existing heroes that now gain 0.6 damage from each stat, of any attribute". Neutral creeps will get stronger over time now too, killing other players should have more of an impact now too, abilities that disable you have been nerfed so there's less sitting around, there's major changes to how matchmaking works and the list of changes just seems nearly endless.</p>
<p>I think it may be time for me to get back into Dota 2…at least I would, if it wasn't completely <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/2294" target="_blank">broken</a> for me right now. Seems the new release has come with some issues, mine won't even launch on Fedora 38. <u><strong>Update</strong></u>: turns out my issue was a known bug with Vulkan loaders you can <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/2285#issuecomment-1518051805" target="_blank">work around</a>.</p>
<p>See all on the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newfrontiers?v=2" target="_blank">big update page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hitting retail stores in Japan from April 29th, South Korea to follow</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Komodo announced today that they're expanding the retail presence of the Steam Deck into Japan now, with South Korea to follow after.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-hitting-retail-in-hong-kong-taiwan-and-later-japan-and-south-korea/" target="_blank">Back in March</a>, they put the Steam Deck in the first retails stores in Hong Kong and Taiwan. That will expand starting April 29th, with the first store in Japan receiving the Steam Deck and the official Docking Station at EDION Namba Main Store (Namba, Chuo-ku, Osaka).</p>
<p>Komodo mentioned additionally there will be an in-store trial event which will run from April 29th until May 7th. More retail partners in Japan will be announced "Soon" and they stated South Korea is next up in the list.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are excited about opportunities that provide Steam Decks to more people,” said Ricky Uy, CEO of KOMODO, “and we hope anyone interested in trying Steam Deck in Osaka has the opportunity to visit the EDION Namba Main Store during the trial week.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>All good news, and with the Steam Deck reportedly on track to hit well <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/report-steam-deck-to-pass-3-million-sales-during-2023/" target="_blank">over 3 million sales total</a> this year, an expanded retail presence is only going to keep pushing that number higher. The Steam Deck from Valve is just going from strength to strength, especially with big Proton upgrades further improving compatibility like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">recently launched Proton 8</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-upgraded-with-proton-8/" target="_blank">Proton Experimental update</a> following it.</p>
