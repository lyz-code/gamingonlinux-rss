      <title>Re:Touring is a clever, accessible and polished first-person puzzler</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you enjoy first-person puzzlers like Portal and The Talos Principle then you'll likely feel right at home with Re:Touring. <em>Note: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>The premise here is pretty simple - you're visiting an old facility and inside are various rooms to progress through where you'll be tapping buttons and making machines work by matching up colours. So you'll be opening doors, controlling moving platforms and there's even some lasers to deal with too.</p>
<p>It doesn't do a whole lot when it comes to story-telling, mainly focusing on your progress through the 26 puzzle rooms but there is a little environmental story-telling you can pick up on. I quite liked the very relaxed casual nature to it, with you being able to just dive right into the puzzle-solving. With plenty of hints available for each puzzle if you need them too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="DggKbFguLQg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27e04efe64b62a2d10d76c5a96623582.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/DggKbFguLQg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Re:Touring starts off nice and simple, with you just tapping a single button on a machine to change the colour it outputs. These simplistic patterns get more complicated though, with multiple rows of buttons to define what colour will be output based on what colour the machine currently sees and more. Then you get rooms with multiple puzzles, and a few basic timers but nothing about it makes you feel rushed.</p>
<p>Don't let the early simplicity of it fool you, once you get to the double-digit levels, it will take a little bit more thought and some head-scratching but not enough to stress you out. The whole thing feels very nicely put together and well thought-out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15767075951683561886gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15767075951683561886gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Enjoyed my time with this one, there were a few times I needed to get hints but not many. The hint system was a nice touch, letting you sit down in the corner of a room and get a first basic clue and then multiple more clues after if needed to really explain things. </p>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Solve varied puzzles by creating matching colour patterns.</li>
<li>Uncover the history of the facility by searching for clues in the game.</li>
<li>Most levels will introduce a new game mechanic.</li>
<li>Hint system will help you if you get stuck.</li>
<li>Accessibility features like closed captions, colour presets for colour blindness and simple controls.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Valve gave Steam store search a very useful upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve announced a fresh upgrade to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> store search, making it a lot more useful so here's a run over what's new and improved.</p>
<p>Previously, searching for something on Steam would only take into account the name of the game. Good if you knew what you're looking for exactly but now it searches across more of Steam. The auto-suggest drop-down will now show suggested tags and categories, developers, publishers and franchises too.</p>
<p>First example is searching for SEGA, where it will give a few games and then the publisher page too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412004731683557097gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1412004731683557097gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Then you could also search for a particular tag like "strategy" and have games show up along with tag suggestions:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5925044001683557098gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5925044001683557098gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They're also now handling typos a bit better too, matching up names a bit closer so you don't always have to have the exact name to search for something.</p>
<p>All part of Valve's continued work to help visibility on Steam, a problem that has grown over time with more and more games releasing on Steam. It's a crowded market but now Steam has so many different ways to discover games, hopefully you will be able to find what you want.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3686801719533364952" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>

      <title>Nreal Air and Steam Deck together - quite mind-blowing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently I was sent over a package with the <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/air/" target="_blank">Nreal Air</a>, so I've spent a fair bit of time testing out these AR glasses with the Steam Deck to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>To say they've blown my mind would be quite the understatement. It's really a case of seeing is believing, and no amount of photos or videos can really do such a thing enough justice. But before all that, what exactly are they? Well, they're glasses that have screens built into them, to give you a truly personal full cinema experience. You can hook them up to many things like the Steam Deck, and various consoles (with an adapter).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11953315021683545207gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>When it comes to using them with the Steam Deck, it's quite literally plug and play. You plug a cable into the end of one of the temples that goes behind your ear, then the other end into the Steam Deck and away you go. There's simply no fussing involved. After that, put them on and you'll get a huge screen right in front of your eyes.</p>
<p>Originally I didn't think I would ever get to test these. I saw a few others across Twitter had them, so I posted about it and eventually some PR / marketing team emailed me about it. Problem is this first team wanted a <em>paid</em> review, asking for my "rates". After clearly telling them I don't do that, they never replied again. A short moan on Twitter later, and a completely different team that works with Nreal reached out and straight-up offered a pair with <em>no</em> strings attached. Exactly the way I like to cover anything, and the only way I like doing it, so there’s nothing holding me back or really influencing my thoughts. </p>
<p>Basic Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>148mm x 52mm x 159mm (opened).</li>
<li>148mm x 52mm x 60mm (folded).</li>
<li>3-Position adjustment for optimal gaze angle.</li>
<li>Head width from 120-186mm.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm no stranger to having something strapped to my face. I have a Valve Index, and I love it. Playing Half-Life: Alyx is an experience I'll never forget and absolutely one of my favourite gaming experiences — ever. However, this is quite a different beast. You're not <em>inside</em> the games like with VR, as with AR glasses it's more about giving you a massive flat screen that follows you around as you move your head so it's always in focus and following you.</p>
<p>Nreal have managed something quite extraordinary here. Not only are they reasonably stylish with quite a low profile, as they're actually quite small, they're surprisingly light too. Someone looking at you across a table probably can't even tell there's anything special about them. Which is good, I was worried they might look a bit ridiculous on, but to my surprise they look pretty nice actually.</p>
<p>A bit heavier than any normal glasses or sunglasses though. After a few minutes of wearing them, the feeling of them sort-of fades away as you get engrossed into your game. It certainly helps that the speaker quality is actually very good and impressively clear too.</p>
<p>Fitting different face and nose shapes is simple enough. The glasses come with three sets of nose rests, each of them being able to squish down onto your nose nicely. The ear rests also have a certain amount of outwards flexibility too, so if you've got a bit of a bigger face, they should still place nicely. The ear rests can also be vertically angled across three points too, to hopefully sit properly depending on where you ears are positioned. Lots of little touches that add up.</p>
<p>Since they're AR glasses, you can see <em>through</em> them and see your surroundings. At times it can be a little disorientating perhaps, but they also give you a cover to stick on the front for when you want a truly <em>fully</em> immersive experience with no pass-through to get 100% from it. As long as you're not constantly moving your head around it's fine, and you do get used to the feeling of it quite quickly. I can't tell you the immense joy I got from laying in bed, staring up at the ceiling with the Nreal Air on playing Brotato and various other games on the Steam Deck. I probably looked pretty ridiculous, smiling and laughing away at just how completely nerdy it was but it really sold me on it.</p>
<p>Below you can see a shot (click it to enlarge) of the lense, which is very tricky to get a good capture of. On the left is with the cover on, on the right has no cover for pass-through to see your surroundings.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2096939461683548745gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2096939461683548745gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For a clearer idea of the level of pass through to expect, the shot below is <em>without</em> the cover on with the device on max brightness with plenty of stuff in the background. This is in a very brightly lit office room too, with multiple light sources, and even there without the cover the picture quality is indeed very impressive. <em>Click below to enlarge it, warning: big file.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10338186461683549361gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10338186461683549361gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For me, being able to rest my wrists a little more while playing with the Steam Deck has been great, as using the Nreal Air meant I could sit in pretty much any position I wanted, as long as I had a good grip on the controls on the Deck nothing else mattered. It enabled <em>maximum</em> comfort.</p>
<p>Much like my time with the Valve Index, the Nreal Air has made me rethink what gaming can be, where and how you can do it. There's just something a little bit more special about having your games so up close and intense like this, it really brings a different level of immersion. I found myself getting lost with it, spending far too much time with it when I absolutely should have been productive doing other things. It's bad for your free time.</p>
<p><em>There are some issues with it though. It's not perfection but close.</em></p>
<p>Firstly, if you wear glasses, you'll need to arrange for special lenses. Nreal do provide a tiny (and flimsy) example frame, that you can take somewhere to get your actual required lenses fitted on. Then you can just insert them into the frame as they attach to the nose rest. So they have at least though of people without great vision, but it's an <em>extra</em> expense and a fair bit of hassle to arrange. There's no hardware adjustments for vision at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17408683101683545283gol1.jpg"/>Pictured left to right - carrying case, lens cover, optional glasses frame insert, Nreal Air device.</em></p>
<p>Although there's no hardware adjustments you can make to the screen, at least with the Steam Deck you can tweak the scaling of the actual display thanks to the Steam Deck's own built-in options. So, if for example you have trouble reading the edges of the screen, you could scale it just a bit smaller and it can make all the difference to comfort:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20354121621683546595gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20354121621683546595gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Part of why the Nreal Air is so light is that it draws power from what it's connected with, it has no batteries itself. So you'll need to keep an eye on battery level of the Deck directly. Charging the Steam Deck while using the Nreal Air something of an issue and it seems they don't support it directly, and there's no official extra dongle of sorts to attach to enable it. This means you have to go third-party to do it. I've asked their team to direct me towards what you can get to help with this, but they haven't actually replied to clear this up for me. I'll update this note if I do hear back on that. However, quite a few people on their <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nreal/?f=flair_name%3A%22charging%20while%20using%20%22" target="_blank">Reddit</a> have come up with their own solutions. <em>But if you can't arrange anything yourself, sounds like it's time to take a break and charge your Deck.</em></p>
<p>Updating firmware also seems like it's not possible on Linux yet, which is again another question their team has yet to reply on to properly clarify. I had to resort to Windows to do this, and even there it took a few attempts before it actually succeeded.</p>
<p>How about using them with a desktop or a laptop? That's simple enough to do! Nreal have a dedicated <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/adapter/" target="_blank">adapter</a> for that. The same one you would use from them to connect up to other consoles. You plug the glasses to the adapter via the included USB-C wire, then adapter HDMI out to your PC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13101154241683554857gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13101154241683554857gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With the above, you can then use it as a traditional PC screen too and with my testing on KDE Plasma on Fedora 38, even that worked out of the box without an issue. You can just tell your display settings how to use it, here's an example as an extended display with GamingOnLinux in Chrome moved over to it:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14729549091683555242gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14729549091683555242gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For how they actually look worn, you can check out <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/hce9oEppop0" target="_blank">my YouTube Short</a>.</p>
<p>As my first try for anything like this, I'm sold on the idea. Overall, the Nreal Air is a thoroughly impressive device that I have genuinely had a lot of fun with. It's a very unique experience that I'm glad to have had the chance to test out. Priced at $379 / £399.99, it's not cheap though, but as long as you don't mind dealing with the issue with glasses (or you don't wear glasses), I would say it's well worth it. If you can get it that is, availability is quite limited on where to buy it and what countries you can get it in right now.</p>
<p>My current favourite accessory to pair up with the Steam Deck? Absolutely.</p>
<p>You can check it out on their <a href="https://www.nreal.ai/air/" target="_blank">website</a>, and on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF5LKP5Q" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.</p>

      <title>Arcane Wilds kicks off with some refreshing RTS ideas</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have you been someone who loved playing games like Starcraft and Age of Empires primarily in multiplayer mode with your friends, or do you still play them? Then I might have something for you that could make your competitive RTS heart beat faster and bring some fresh ideas.</p>
<p>Arcane Wilds is a fantasy RTS game with a western-style that actually does many things differently than many other RTS games that have been on the market so far. Currently, the game is still in its Beta stage but already playable. However, keep in mind that there may still be changes to the game. If you're interested in trying out Arcane Wilds yourself, you can still participate in the closed beta and get a free key for the game, just like me. Simply <a href="https://arcanewilds.com/join" target="_blank">follow this link</a>. But now let's take a look at what Arcane Wilds is and what it's all about.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="44CQZj19PQo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d53b0db6114ce4b4577d9122fdcceb9e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/44CQZj19PQo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3>What is Arcane Wilds, and what is it about?</h3>
<p>Arcane Wilds is a fantasy RTS game in a western-style setting, where three factions compete for dominance on small islands. The game can be played alone or online with up to eight players in multiplayer mode, using either Windows or Linux operating systems.</p>
<p>Although the game takes place in a fantasy world, all three factions are clearly inspired by the American 19th century.</p>
<p>There is an Army that strongly resembles an American Civil War army. This army has a powerful arsenal of weapons and well-trained units. Its low mobility is compensated for by its long range and the excellent firepower of its cannons.</p>
<p>Then there is a group of settlers, known as Colony, who most closely resemble settlers in the Wild West. These colonists are a ragtag group of gunslingers who prefer to use their explosive barrels, dynamite, and the concentrated firepower of Gatling guns to lead a well-balanced army into battle.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a Tribe faction, which most closely resembles the Indigenous peoples of North America. They have fast, agile units and mobile structures, and their medicine men and shamans can also cause devastating chaos among enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11658711681683455482gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11658711681683455482gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In addition, the game features some fantasy elements, such as one of the two main resources, which I will discuss later, and several creatures that you may recognize from myths and legends.</p>
<h3>Resource management and logistics system</h3>
<p>While the three factions in Arcane Wilds differ from each other in gameplay, they are not the game's unique selling point. The innovative approach to resource management is the game's standout feature.</p>
<p>Resources can not only be collected but also stolen. This is possible because resources in Arcane Wilds are not abstract numbers on the screen, but physical goods that must be transported from point A to point B.</p>
<p>When starting on a map, players have a central port and a group of workers. The port is surrounded by a group of trees that up to 12 workers can work on to gather wood, which is actually called Supplies in Arcane Wilds.</p>
<p>We also extract Essence, which is required for certain upgrades, higher level units and technologies, and can be used in other ways.</p>
<p>Just like Supplier, Essence is a physical good in Arcane Wilds. This means that it must be extracted and transported by us, and can also be stolen from us. At the same time, we can lose these resources through clever theft by our opponent.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a resource called Corruption, which is generated passively through the extraction of Essence. Corruption is required for unit upgrades and is not a physical good.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9552221321683455482gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9552221321683455482gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<h3>The skirmishes</h3>
<p>As in most other RTS games, we must use both main resources to build new buildings or train units, and then send our army to attack our opponent.</p>
<p>The gameplay of Arcane Wilds is particularly focused on fast and intense battles, in which players fight for dominance on the map or try to outsmart their opponents with clever strategies.</p>
<p>The maps are symmetrical, like in many other RTS games, offering equal chances for all players. Distributed across the maps are various locations where we can gain certain advantages or resources.</p>
<p>For example, there are small groups of natives who are initially neutral towards us and only become hostile if we attack them. Attacking these enemies is a smart move, though, as we must expand our “Fame Level” – represented by the small crown and number in the middle of the upper screen – to increase our unit limit.</p>
<p>Aside from battles, we can also increase our Fame Level by exporting Essence or building certain large buildings on the map for the first time. This feature is a fresh idea because, unlike many other strategy games, we build houses in Arcane Wilds not to increase our unit limit but as a morale boost. This boost makes our units near the houses significantly stronger, which can turn a direct attack on a base into a suicide mission.</p>
<p>Another detail of Arcane Wilds, that is very different from many other RTS games, is the unit production. Although we build certain buildings in Arcane Wilds to produce units, they are automatically “pre-produced” over time and must then be “ordered” at the port.</p>
<p>Our “order” then arrives at the port by ship after a short time. We can even give commands to the prepared units before they come ashore. If we need to speed things up, there is also a button at the port to immediately send a ship. Alternatively, we can also order this immediately via a shortcut. However, we can only use this option for a limited time, as the timer extends by up to eight minutes with each use.</p>
<p>By the way, whether with the regular ship or the express option, we can order our units from anywhere on the map and do not have to go back to the port first, which makes unit production and deployment pretty quick and hassle-free.</p>
<p>The shortcuts in Arcane Wilds are otherwise well-thought-out. For example, like in other RTS games, we can divide our units into specific groups and select them from a distance. We can then command the units to pick up a specific resource package with a right-click and then bring it directly to our port via a shortcut (here Shift-X). With a little practice, we can even do this quite comfortably in the heat of battle.</p>
<h3>The victory conditions</h3>
<p>Some of you may have already noticed: the port is the central element of our armies. Without our port, we immediately lose the game, and the same can also be true for the opponent's port as our primary target.</p>
<p>However, in addition to destroying the port, there are also a few other victory conditions that are based on the different game modes. For example, we can capture certain relics from the center of the map guarded by a powerful monster, fend off a horde of attacking enemies, or liberate specific villages from enemies to win.</p>
<h3>Other modes and features</h3>
<p>There is also a campaign mode in Arcane Wilds, which, however, is currently only playable with the Army faction. In the campaign, we have a central island from which we can start various missions, which play out as small individual battles. The special feature of the campaign is our central main island, on which we can build buildings and prepare various units and upgrades for our next mission.</p>
<p>Arcane Wilds also offers a comprehensive and well-designed tutorial in the form of an academy, which, by the way, is also one of the main points in the main menu. And in fact, this academy is needed because there are a lot of game mechanics to learn.</p>
<p>This starts with the three factions. While the Army and the Colonists play relatively traditionally, the Tribe faction can construct buildings with their Travois. So, a building practically costs as much as a Travois.</p>
<p>In addition, there are different building areas, normal and corrupt ones, which are represented by green and violet underlays beneath the blueprints when placing a building. While normal buildings can be placed anywhere, we can only build certain higher-ranking buildings on corrupt areas.</p>
<p>If the goal of a battle is to capture the relics from the center of the map, their protectors become stronger with each neutral unit camp destroyed. This means that if we destroy too many of these neutral camps, we or our opponent may have difficulty obtaining the relic in the end. However, it also means that if we destroy too few of these camps, we may lag in our Fame Level, which in turn means a smaller army.</p>
<p>This creates a very interesting balancing act, in which we always have to consider how many of the neutral inhabitants we want to destroy before we start conquering the relic.</p>
<h3>Criticism and comments</h3>
<p>In terms of gameplay, I would like a bit more variety in the strategic placement of resources in the game. So far, our port has always been surrounded by a few trees, which makes resource gathering almost too easy and overshadows the excellent logistics element of the game. This could be solved, for example, by placing the trees further away from the port, thus creating a vulnerable supply line.</p>
<p>Also, Essence could be placed only once in the middle of the map, making it much more difficult for factions to even get higher-level units.</p>
<p>By the way, I really like the cute polygon graphics of the game – at least for a strategy game. However, I would like to see proper walls for the palisades. Currently, the palisades look more like a row of posts. But that is my only criticism of the model selection, and it can be easily fixed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11681801881683455481gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11681801881683455481gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Overall, I think Arcane Wilds is already a really rounded gaming experience, especially for a Beta. With its fast gameplay and the relatively tricky peculiarities in resource management and unit production, I think Arcane Wilds can be a fascinating game for players who like fast and competitive RTS games.</p>
<p>That was my first impression of the game so far.</p>
<p>If you find Arcane Wilds interesting, you can still participate in the closed beta by following the link above and follow it on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1492050/Arcane_Wilds/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam will now scale better with KDE and GNOME</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Beta release for Steam from May 5th, Valve finally did some more work on scaling the UI of the Steam Client. Quite overdue isn't it?</p>
<p>From the release notes they mentioned Steam will now use the global scale factor as configured via KDE or GNOME settings, specifically from <code class="inline-code">org.gnome.desktop.interface/text-scaling-factor</code>. Valve has also re-introduced GDK_SCALE as a fallback, and there's also a command line switch to let you override it with <code class="inline-code">-forcedesktopscaling float</code> now available.</p>
<p>Other fixes in the Beta from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3705943193607193985" target="_blank">May 5th</a> include:</p>

<li>Improved digital navigation in GamePad Action Binding Tab when selecting LED Color Action.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All these changes also apply to the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>There was also an update on May 4th that I missed as well, as Valve are working to fix up all the issues that came along with the newer UI and the new Steam Overlay. For desktop here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/3705943193600581522" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issues with navigating forward and back when the client's start page is the Library</li>
<li>Tweaked the order and presentation of some items in the account menu</li>
<li>Fixed library artwork not automatically updating in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed developer, publisher, and franchise links not working in game info panel</li>
<li>Fixed some formatting issues on downloads page</li>
<li>Made download throttle setting field honor the bits-per-second/bytes-per-second toggle setting</li>
<li>Changed default display of download rate to bits per second.</li>
<li>LED Personalization now has has dedicated sub-page in Controller Calibration page</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the cursor position would be reset in Game Notes after auto-saving</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Friends List</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Send Trade Offer opening in the system browser</li>
<li>Fixed Add to Favorites / Remove from Favorites not dismissing the context menu in some instances</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Screenshot Manager</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed screenshots failing to upload when certain privacy settings were selected</li>
<li>Fixed UI glitch when deleting a local screenshot's caption</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>In-Game Overlay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added cloud sync status icon to Game Notes dialog. If there's a Steam Cloud conflict, clicking on that icon will display a cloud conflict resolution dialog.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with Friends List context menu items not opening links in the overlay web browser (e.g. "View Profile" or "Send Trade Offer")</li>
<li>Fixed issue where some dialogs were not appearing correctly (e.g. Invite Friend to Game, Add Friend, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the file picker dialog not showing any files when browsing for an app icon</li>
<li>Fixed the Steam Runtime info dialog not showing any information</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The majority of that was also on Steam Deck too, although most of it is for desktop mode.</p>
<p>The new design is starting to feel quite a lot more stable now, as it was a bit rough with the recent major Beta upgrade.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing we're not short on, it's launchers. There's some kind of launcher for everything including Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher, Bottles and more. Now there's also Cartridges.</p>
<p>First impression is surprisingly good with this one. The interface is impeccably clean and clear, with options to import games from other sources like Steam, Heroic and others. It works damn well too without any fussing around. Although you will need to add extra sources for it to scan, if you're not using the defaults (like extra Steam game install folders). Importing is blazingly fast too.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Manually adding and editing games.</li>
<li>Importing games from Steam, Lutris, Heroic, Bottles and itch.</li>
<li>Support for multiple Steam install locations.</li>
<li>Hiding games.</li>
<li>Searching and sorting by title, date added and last played.</li>

<li>Searching for games on various databases.</li>

<p>Might be worth a look if you're after something <em>simple</em>, that will bundle all your games from different sources.</p>

      <title>Typing Tempo challenges you in a 41-key typing rhythm game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you enjoy rhythm games and think you're a master typist, you may want to take a little look over at the new release of Typing Tempo. Giving you 41 keys worth of button-mashing, you likely don't need an introduction to rhythm games. You hit the correct key at the right time to progress through each track. Looks like it can get pretty challenging in the harder modes too.</p>
<p>"The Typing Tempo music library contains more than 30 upbeat and energetic tracks, including genres such as Future Bass, Hardcore, House, and more! With 100+ handcrafted levels, Typing Tempo has plenty of content to play from the get-go. You can also add your own music and levels to play, which can be created with Typechart Studio, a simple but powerful chart editor for the game, which is included as a Steam Tool."</p>

<p>Game store <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> has a new <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/gog_2023_update_2_facts_and_numbers_of_2022_copy3" target="_blank">blog post</a> up detailing how they're doing, and it seems like things are starting to go a bit better for them. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/gog-to-go-through-some-reorganization-after-suffering-losses/" target="_blank">Back in 2021</a>, I reported on how in the CD PROJEKT financials, it showed that GOG was losing money, so it seems they may be starting to turn things around a little bit.</p>
<p>In their new post, they showed that for 2022 they have seen an 11% increase in active users across all of GOG services with an 18% increase in their overall user base. However, GOG Galaxy only "remained consistent", so it seems they aren't seeing much growth for their launcher. They're also reporting a net profit of $1.2M USD, noting they're losing around 4% due to suspending operations in Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>Nothing close to how they were doing in 2020 though, which they attribute the spike that year to Cyberpunk 2077 and COVID-19 increasing sales due to people being at home more.</p>
<p>As for their market split they're seeing 53% from Europe, 37% from North America, 4% Asia, 4% Australia and New Zealand and 2% elsewhere.</p>
<p>The amount of games releasing on GOG has been increasing every year too, although it's nothing close to what Steam has, since GOG do a little more curation on what they accept (which is at times a little weird on what they deny). From 296 releases in 2018 up to 684 in 2022.</p>

      <title>Dead by Daylight now works on Linux desktop and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some potentially great news for Dead by Daylight fans, as it <em>seems</em> Behaviour Interactive have finally made the switch with their anti-cheat to allow Steam Deck and Linux desktop players in.</p>
<p>It was noticed by users around a week ago, with reports across <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/381210" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/132m9lq/dead_by_daylight_steam_version/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> mentioning that it now works. We've been in this situation before though, with this game specifically and multiple others, that suddenly work after an update. Usually, a day or a few days later the anti-cheat begins to kick Linux desktop and Steam Deck players. In this case though, that didn't seem to happen.</p>
<p>Now <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/steam-dead-by-daylight-is-now-working-on-deck/" target="_blank">SteamDeckHQ</a> are reporting they've had the PR team from Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive email them, stating it is intentionally working. However, the developer has made <em>no</em> public announcement on this anywhere, and they <em>haven't</em> replied to my email on it as of yet. Until they do give some public word on it, I would still take it with a pinch of salt.</p>
<p>The question is: if the report is true - <em>why</em> aren't the developers talking about it? Seems odd. A lack of confidence right now perhaps? Silent testing to see how it goes? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>Giving it a test run myself and it does indeed now work just fine with Proton 8.0-2.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17266768461683282289gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17266768461683282289gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above running on Fedora KDE 38 on Ultra details, it's very smooth at 2560x1440 on my Ryzen 5800X + NVIDIA 2080 Ti system. Absolutely no issues observed there, so it's looking really nice. Not sure how much my heart can take with a game like this though — phew, what a rush when you're discovered and you have to run away.</p>
<p>Testing it out on Steam Deck too pictured below, the result of it working with Proton 8.0-2 is the same. On Medium details, with resolution bumped up to 100% it runs very smoothly there too. Not a big surprise though, since the environments are pretty small.</p>

<p><em>Hopefully we'll see an announcement on it officially soon. </em></p>
<p>You can buy Dead by Daylight from <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-by-daylight?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, here's a video of it running on Steam Deck with my thoughts on this:</p>

      <title>Discord username system changing to make it easier to find people</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After years of technical debt, Discord has <a href="https://discord.com/blog/usernames" target="_blank">announced</a> a big change is coming to their username system to make it easier to find the people you want to connect with.</p>
<p>Currently, you have your username followed by a bunch of numbers. It's not an ideal system, as they said themselves, "our current usernames can often be too complicated or obscure for people to remember and share easily". So they're changing it to be a bit more like Twitter and other platforms where you have @username instead. You'll still be able to change your display name to whatever you want though.</p>
<p><em>This is a good time to tell you to <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">join the GamingOnLinux Discord</a> right?</em></p>
<p>When the change comes in, your username will need to be unique and they said it will roll-out over the coming weeks. You'll get an in-app notification when your time comes to do the change-over. It will take several months for them to get through everyone, so you might be in for a bit of a wait on it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this system is received. It can easily end up with the same problems other places have, with people impersonating others by nabbing their tag used on another platform. Discord will need to be careful on this, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see them eventually roll out their own verification system too due to this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Open source physics-based tabletop sim &#39;Tabletop Club&#39; gets an official release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a bunch of early testing builds, the developer of the free and open source tabletop sim Tabletop Club has announced the first stable release. While this is the first "official" release, it's only the beginning for the project. It's already quite playable, and easy for you and friends to jump into thanks to it not requiring an account, just a hosted room code you can send to friends.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2598023611683210305gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of what's already planned for future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved behaviour for in-game objects like boards and containers.</li>
<li>More intuitive asset pack creation and management within the game itself.</li>
<li>An online asset pack database for creators to upload content, and for players to automatically download from.</li>
<li>A Lua scripting API for custom behaviour.</li>
<li>Migration to Godot 4.0, which should bring better performance and improved graphical fidelity.</li>
<li>Expansion to more platforms, including the web and mobile devices. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the release <a href="https://drwhut.itch.io/tabletop-club/devlog/523502/release-v010-humble-beginnings" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the developer explained why it was created:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First of all, I want to thank everyone, from my friends who helped shape and test the game, to those who have contributed code, assets and translations, and to whose who have played it even for a little bit - this genuinely would not have been possible without your support. For context, I started this project knee-deep in the middle of the COVID pandemic since I was not able to play board games face-to-face at the time. At the same time, the various lockdowns were taking a huge toll on my mental health, which I did not realise until it was too late; the effects of which I am still feeling to this day. For me personally, not only is this a project that allows me to play board games with my friends, but it is also proof. Proof that no matter how bad it gets, no matter how low your self-esteem gets, you're still worth it. You can still make a difference in the world. Even if by modern standards most would call me a "failure" or a "wreck", it's all relative. This is something I've made, and I'm damn proud of it.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Soul Survivors is a refreshing skill-based time-survival Vampire Survivor-like</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Continuing my quest to have no free time ever, I have been checking out Soul Survivors that's now available in Early Access. It may be yet another (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">there's lots now</a>) Vampire Survivor-like but that's not a bad thing at all. In fact, I'm actually rather enjoying Soul Survivors. Stride PR sent over an key and my early impression here is that it's really fun.</p>
<p><em>On desktop Linux and Steam Deck, it works out of the box with Proton 8 and Proton 7.</em></p>
<p>It has all the basics of these popular horde games but there are some key differences. It's definitely a whole <em>lot</em> more skill-based than just the movement-dodging basics found in Vampire Survivors, especially with the different classes actually being very different to play. The current version has a mid-range fighter which is pretty standard, plus a Necromancer that spawns creatures you keep alive by picking up flesh piles. The Necromancer also has a physics-based spiked flail that moves based on your own position, so you can spin it each side or all around you based on your movement. The Necromancer has been a lot of fun to play as, with you swinging the spiked flail around as a skeleton runs around doing your bidding, while also firing off various spells.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13468808141683201195gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13468808141683201195gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - Soul Survivors on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Enemies actually have various different behaviours too. There's the usual hordes that chase you, enemies that will dart at you, enemies that teleport around you, vines that will hold you in place requiring you to quickly mash the direction buttons to break free.</p>
<p>Lots of clever little changes, make it worthwhile to play. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ubXculnoFNk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9ff6c0d3958fa91978d3c33097a4d6d4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ubXculnoFNk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p></p>
<p>Then you come to the boss system, each map has a specific set of bosses to fight and when you beat them, the game sudden warps into what they call Cursed Mode, where every minute a new curse on you or the world will increase the difficulty making it thoroughly interesting and frantic to keep going longer once you finish a map. So while there is gated progression for maps based on the bosses, each map is also endless and repeatable with it being quite dynamic at the end.</p>
<p>Another fun little addition is the money snail you chase around, which drops lots of gold for your character persistent upgrades. There's plenty of other ways to get gold from crates and other creatures, but the money snail was a funny addition.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17186964061683199879gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17186964061683199879gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Soul Survivors on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>As you progress through a level, there's temporary items you can pick up too. Some might have you throw bombs constantly for a few seconds, some might make your Necromancer flail massive and plenty more. Lots of little things that add up to a really fun experience. Vampire Survivor fans won't want to miss this.</p>
<p>“Since beginning development on Soul Survivors, we have worked tirelessly to create a unique and entertaining time-survival roguelite,” said Sterling Selover of Stingbot Games, “Whether you’re familiar with the genre or are a fledgling adventurer, our blend of distinctive combat, persistent progression, and dark fantasy world-building has something for everyone.”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2002220/Soul_Survivors/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Framework gives more detail on their AMD Ryzen laptop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently Framework excited everyone over <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/framework-reveal-new-laptop-with-modular-graphics-plus-an-amd-ryzen-model/" target="_blank">their big DIY laptop upgrades</a>, and now they're giving more detail on the Framework 13 Laptop with AMD Ryzen. They weren't able to originally reveal what AMD chips they would be using, but now they are.</p>
<p>They've now officially revealed they will be shipping with either the Ryzen 5 7640U or Ryzen 7 7840U depending on what you pick and you can pre-order them now with shipping expected sometime around Q3 this year.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/585990111683197045gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p style="text-align:center">From their announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ryzen 5 7640U processor has 6 CPU cores clocked at a base frequency of 3.5GHz and up to a max boost of 4.9GHz, while the Ryzen 7 7840U has an amazing 8 cores and 16 processing threads clocked at a base of 3.3GHz and up to 5.1GHz max boost. These are all Zen 4 cores, which feature AMD's fastest processor technology ever. These chips are fabricated on TSMC's 4nm process node, meaning that even with such high performance, they are also extremely efficient. We've designed the thermal system to be able to handle the processors at up to 28W continuous load if you need to do some heavy crunching too.</p>
<p>Ryzen-powered Framework Laptop users are also in for a treat when it comes to graphics performance. The Ryzen 7040 Series processors feature the latest generation AMD Radeon 700M Series graphics, the first AMD RDNA 3-based integrated graphics. The Ryzen 5 7640U has Radeon 760M graphics with 8 Compute Units while the Ryzen 7 7840U has Radeon 780M graphics with 12 Compute Units.  This means the Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series) can handle a range of modern game titles directly. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For existing owners of a Framework Laptop, they will also be suppling the Mainboard so you can upgrade to it if you wish, or you can use it as a standalone computer too. The first two batches are already sold-out, and you can order either pre-built with Windows or the DIY edition to build it all yourself.</p>
<p>I don't need it…but I want it.</p>

      <title>AMD Render Pipeline Shaders SDK adds Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for game developers here and anyone tinkering around with graphics APIs, as AMD has announced the next upgrade to their Render Pipeline Shaders SDK and now it has Linux support.</p>
<p>This SDK was announced back in <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/rps_1_0/" target="_blank">December</a> in Open Beta, as a comprehensive and extensible Render Graph framework for graphics applications and engines using explicit APIs (like Vulkan and DirectX 12). The v1.1 update from <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/rps_1_1_linux_support/" target="_blank">May 3rd</a> adds in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux support for the base library and the RPSL compiler.</li>
<li>Support for dynamically loading Vulkan functions.</li>
<li>Support for latest stable Agility SDK 1.608.3.</li>
<li>Automatic marking of the discard flags to accesses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some background on it from <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/RenderPipelineShaders" target="_blank">GitHub</a>:</p>
<p>"The AMD Render Pipeline Shaders (RPS) SDK is a comprehensive and extensible Render Graph framework.</p>
<p>Since the debut of explicit graphics APIs (Direct3D 12 and Vulkan®), Render Graphs (or Frame Graphs) have been proposed as an elegant and efficient solution to various problems such as generating resource barriers, managing transient memory and scheduling GPU workload. In practice, it is non-trivial to implement a render graph system from scratch, and it requires effort to keep it optimal according to hardware, API and content changes. Porting effects and techniques between different render graph systems may also consume extra engineering time.</p>
<p>The RPS SDK intends to make Render Graphs more easily accessible and to provide a generally optimal barrier generator and (aliasing) memory scheduler. RPS also tries to simplify Render Graph construction by extending HLSL with attributes and intrinsics to create a domain specific language for render graph programming. This enables opt-in applications to program Render Graphs implicitly via a high-level, declarative programming model, allowing users to focus on the render pipeline logic rather than node configuration details. We call the extended language "Render Pipeline Shader Language", or RPSL."</p>
<p>Always good to see more and more developer-focused tooling available for Linux, bringing down more barriers for developers working on games, game engines, drivers and more.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits over 9,000 games rated Verified and Playable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another juicy milestone for Valve with the Steam Deck, as it now has over 9,000 games rated as either Verified or Playable.</p>
<p>Going by the list on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, which also takes into account those titles that have been removed for sale, which players can still download if they own the games the current status is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified - 3,276</li>
<li>Playable - 5,750</li>
<li>Unsupported - 2,879</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping in mind, these are only those that have been through Valve's Deck Verified certification, there's plenty more that do work out of the box with no changes needed. Over time the numbers will naturally just keep rising, especially with upgrades to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton compatibility layer</a> along with some more Native Linux releases.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Deck Verified isn't perfect, there will be some games that are Verified that shouldn't be, and same again for Unsupported - some of them work and some don't. We really don't know how Valve actually test, as they've been a bit tight-lipped on it.</p>
<p>According to Valve this is the criteria for being Verified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Input - The title should have full controller support, use appropriate controller input icons, and automatically bring up the on-screen keyboard when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display - The game should support the default resolution of Steam Deck (1280x800 or 1280x720), have good default settings, and text should be legible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seamlessness - The title shouldn’t display any compatibility warnings, and if there’s a launcher it should be navigable with a controller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System Support - If running through Proton, the game and all its middleware should be supported by Proton. This includes anti-cheat support.</p>
</li>
</ul>

From what I played of earlier versions before this Early Access release, it showed a lot of promise and was already fun.</p>
<p>There's also now a brand new trailer:</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if it finds an audience. People absolutely love these types of sims.</p>

      <title>Valve limits Steam store pages to 2 trailers before screenshots</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I don't know about you, but I used to get a little annoyed by endless amounts of trailers on Steam pages that didn't really show much. Valve have been paying attention again to what players want to see.</p>
<p>Some developers went completely overboard, listing multiple years of update trailers before you even get a single screenshot, making it annoying to just quickly at a glance see if the basic style is your cup. Lots of "trailers" show little normal gameplay too and it was a growing problem.</p>
<p>Valve has now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/5358762517221792488" target="_blank">announced</a> a change, so that only two trailers will be shown before screenshots now. All other trailers will be shown after the screenshots. This is a nice win for Steam customers, making it far less frustrating overall. It may seem like a <em>small</em> thing, but it really does make people bounce away from store pages if they're littered with trailers that don't show what people want.</p>
<p>Think about it - you go to a new store page for a random game and you want to see right away what it's like. Lots of trailers plastering various logo screens and intros before you really see anything — such a nuisance.</p>
<p>Another change Valve made is that trailers can now have a category and name tag, so developers and publishers can tell people what type of trailer it is so you can scroll to another if you really don't care about their cinematics for just one example. A small addition but could be useful if used correctly.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4441127511683125669gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4441127511683125669gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17200584061683125670gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17200584061683125670gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Screenshot examples from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/" target="_blank">Portal 2</a></em></p>
<p>As Valve said on why it matters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The display of trailers on Steam store pages have been updated today to address some frustrations we've heard from players when trying to find gameplay videos or navigate to screenshots. These changes include new logic that determines the order of trailers and screenshots, plus the ability to specify a category for each trailer to show to players.<br/>
<small>[…]</small><br/>
We have found that it wasn't clear to developers how best to manage trailers in order to provide the best experience for players. Many games have collected a great number of trailers over their lifetime of development and have made it harder for prospective customers to find the screenshots. At the same time, we know that players are interested in understanding a little more about the trailers they are watching. This update is intended to address both of these issues and help players more quickly learn about games they are interested in.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-1 released, mainly pulling in Proton 8 upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GE-Proton has a new release out <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton8-1" target="_blank">with 8-1</a>, which is mainly pulling in a whole bunch of improvements from Proton 8 and Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>This is the version of Proton made and supported by the community, for the times where it may work better than the official Valve Proton, but it comes with less testing and may have its own issues. See more in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Steam Play and Proton guide</a>.</p>
<p>Here's all that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>All build components rebased to Proton 8 experimental/upstream.</li>
<li>proton-wine updated to latest experimental.</li>
<li>wine-staging rebased on top of proton-wine 8.</li>
<li>proton-ge game patches and pending wine upstream patches rebased on top of proton-wine 8.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git.</li>
<li>protonfix: No cutscene audio in Daedalic Games (Memoria, The Night of the Rabbit, A New Beginning - Final Cut) - (thanks marianoag).</li>
<li>protonfix: Megadimension Neptunia VII - (thanks snaggly).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some other notes that were included to be aware of:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>FSR is currently disabled again. It needs a massive rebase and same as before I don't know if it's currently possible to rebase/port it over to the new proton 8 build.</li>
<li>Having the nvapi hack configuration enabled in dxvk.conf seems to crash battlenet. Recommend removing it from the config for existing Lutris battle.net installations and related games.</li>
<li>Overwatch losing focus after death seems to be fixed.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

      <title>OBS Studio 29.1 is out now with AV1 / HEVC for YouTube</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One for content creators here, as the excellent OBS Studio just released <a href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/releases/tag/29.1.0" target="_blank">version 29.1.0</a>. This brings initial support for AV1 / HEVC on YouTube.</p>
<p>There's various improvements elsewhere too of course but this is quite a big one, as it's potentially the future of streaming video and it's currently limited to YouTube for now as a Beta feature. This release also now supports Enhanced RTMP V1, which extends the RTMP protocol to support newer video codecs and HDR. Lots of future-proofing work going on in OBS Studio right now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377001261683112301gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7377001261683112301gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>Here's everything that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for streaming AV1/HEVC over Enhanced RTMP [YouTube/yuriy-chunak/derrod]
<ul>
<li>Enhanced RTMP V1 extends the RTMP protocol to support newer video codecs and HDR. More info at: <a href="https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp" target="_blank">https://github.com/veovera/enhanced-rtmp</a></li>
<li>Currently only supported by/enabled for YouTube as a beta feature</li>
<li>HDR is not yet implemented</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for multiple audio tracks in Simple output recording [pkv]</li>
<li>Added a DLL blocking feature for Windows. This allows OBS to block problematic DLLs from attaching to OBS and causing freezing or crashes, for example 3rd party overlay hooks and outdated video capture devices. [notr1ch]
<ul>
<li>This blocks old versions of popular VTubing software virtual cameras that are known to cause freezes when accessing video capture device properties. If you are affected, please update to the latest version of your VTubing software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added settings to select the audio encoder for streaming and recording [tytan652]</li>
<li>Added an option to preload media sources used in Stingers to memory, to avoid frame skips during transitions [Jim]</li>
<li>Added Update Channels on macOS and updated Sparkle for smaller and faster updates going forward [derrod]</li>
<li>Added compatibility notices in the Window and Game Capture sources for Windows [derrod]</li>
<li>Added the ability to zoom browser docks with Ctrl - and + and the right click menu [WizardCM]</li>
<li>Added a setting to record in fragmented MP4 and MOV formats [derrod]
<ul>
<li>These offer greater compatibility than MKV while providing similar resilience against data loss due to crashes, running out of space, etc.</li>
<li>Fragmented MP4 and MOV files can be remuxed to regular MP4/MOV in cases where the former may not be read correctly (e.g. in older editing software)</li>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.7.1 hotfix 1 fixes up Epic Games login</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having some troubles with Epic Games on the Heroic Games Launcher? You weren't alone and a new hotfix is out to get it sorted.</p>
<p>For Epic Games, the issue was the captcha not being able to be completed, so 2.7.1 Hotfix #1 should solve that properly now. Some people noticed they were getting a blank screen on loading too, that should also be solved. Plus a problem with the Add Game blocking the Finish button was also fixed.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9305794471683111489gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9305794471683111489gol1.png"/></a><em>Giving it a run today and the Epic Login with captcha worked just fine!</em></p>
<p>They've also added some keyboard shortcuts now too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command Or Control+R: Reloads the app.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+Q: Quits the app.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+Shift+I: Opens the dev tools.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+K: Opens the Heroic settings screen on the frontend.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+L: Opens the library screen.</li>
<li>Command Or Control+J: Opens the downloads screen.</li>

      <title>OpenRazer v3.6 brings support for 11 more Razer devices</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fantastic update to OpenRazer with <a href="https://github.com/openrazer/openrazer/releases/tag/v3.6.0" target="_blank">version 3.6.0</a> bringing support for more Razer devices on Linux along with various improvements.</p>
<p>Like many other hardware vendors, Razer do <em>not</em> officially support Linux with their software to tweak things, thankfully the community keeps on giving with OpenRazer. Pairing up OpenRazer with an app like <a href="https://polychromatic.app/" target="_blank">Polychromatic</a> can give you a pretty great experience. Polychromatic actually had a small update recently too with v0.8.1.</p>
<p>With this new OpenRazer release these devices are now supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Razer Laptop Stand Chroma.</li>
<li>Razer Blade 14 (2022).</li>
<li>Razer Core X Chroma.</li>
<li>Razer Basilisk V3 Pro.</li>
<li>Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro.</li>
<li>Razer Blade 15 Base (2022).</li>
<li>Razer HyperPolling Wireless Dongle.</li>
<li>Razer Pro Click Mini (Receiver).</li>
<li>Razer DeathStalker V2 Pro TKL (Wired and Wireless).</li>
<li>Razer Ornata V3 X.</li>
<li>Razer DeathAdder V2 Lite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's these improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plenty of cleanup in the daemon around the screensaver suspend/resume functions.</li>
<li>Prepare for better error handling in the kernel driver.</li>
<li>daemon: sanity check set_dpi_xy call for AVAILABLE_DPI devices.</li>
<li>daemon: clean up custom mouse get methods.</li>
<li>daemon: add effect_methods also for backlight zone.</li>
<li>pylib: don't init _matrix_dimensions when there's no matrix.</li>
<li>daemon: throw exception in get_matrix_dims when not available.</li>
<li>daemon: initialize self.POLL_RATES for all devices with poll rate.</li>
<li>pylib: deprecate poll rate constants.</li>
<li>Makefile: remove uninstall targets.</li>
<li>Makefile: Remove ubuntu_udev_install rule.</li>
<li>debian: replace python packaging hacks.</li>
<li>fake driver: ensure daemon cannot create new files.</li>
</ul>
<p>And these bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix volume wheel on Razer DeathStalker V2.</li>
<li>Fix macro LED not turning off on some devices.</li>
<li>Fix persistence for lighting on/off state.</li>
<li>daemon: Add missing methods to some devices.</li>
<li>daemon: fix Basilisk V2 matrix dimensions.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Proton 8.0-2 out for Linux / Steam Deck fixing the EA app (yes, again)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has upgraded the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">newer Proton 8</a> that only launched for Linux and Steam Deck recently, with a bunch of bug fixes. This is all pretty standard stuff, a point release for the newest version of Proton for running Windows games. If you're confused about Steam Play and Proton see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my beginner's guide</a>.</p>
<p>Seems on top of a few games needing fixes, that the EA app has once again broken requiring Valve to jump in to prevent a whole bunch of games suddenly not working.</p>
<p>Here's what's changed in Proton 8.0-2, a bunch of which is pulled over from the recent Proton Experimental update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Baldur's Gate 3 getting stuck on a black screen in Vulkan mode.</li>
<li>Fixed Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition and Divinity Original Sin II: Definitive Edition crashing on launch.</li>
<li>Fixed Path of Exile crashing.</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in Trackmania and Ubisoft Connect overlay.</li>
<li>Improved Elden Ring compatibility compared to Proton 8.0-1. It can still be finicky.</li>
<li>Fixed Red Dead Redemption 2 and other games not starting after switching from Proton Experimental to stable.</li>
<li>Added a temporary workaround for EA Launcher crashing. Steam Deck's on-screen keyboard may not pop up automatically while using it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How to update?</strong></p>
<p>It will show up as an update to Proton 8 in your Steam Downloads. Just update it as you would any other app / game on Steam.</p>
<p><strong>How to use it?</strong></p>
<p>You can select Proton 8 in the Properties -&gt; Compatibility menu of any game when you tick the box.</p>
<p>Changelog can be seen <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>. As a reminder for Desktop Linux users - Proton 8.0 requires your GPU to support Vulkan 1.3. Steam Deck doesn't need to worry about that.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Additionally, as a heads up, it seems Proton 8 might potentially <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6740" target="_blank">break</a> with some Easy Anti-Cheat games. Something to keep an eye on if you've switched any games with EAC over to it.</p>

      <title>Rogue Legacy 2 has one final content update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cellar Door Games are saying farewell to Rogue Legacy 2, with one final major content upgrade out now with The Swan Song. They had originally planned to move on earlier but they just couldn't help but do a little bit more. Even though they're moving on, it may still get some small patches to fix up issues as they appear.</p>
<p>Some highlights of what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>3 New Ways to Play</strong> – Fans of the original Rogue Legacy may be familiar with the game’s hardest achievement, Thanatophobia, which required the game be completed in 15 lives. Well, we’re bringing it back as an official Special Game Mode, alongside two other modes that truly spice up the experience. Thana-two-phobia takes the original challenge and dials it to 11, with Prime bosses and harder biomes, while True Rogue pits you against the gods of RNG. This mode randomizes your character, drops you in random biomes, and tests how far you can get on a single life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dream A Little Dream</strong> – Deep within the shadows of an oppressive Kingdom lies the faint light of hopes and dreams. This latest update will be introducing Dreams, unique experiences similar to Scar Challenges that allow you to play out the fantasies of some of the most iconic characters in the game. What those fantasies are you will have to discover on your own. *Unlike Challenges, Dreams do not count towards earning certain achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fables For All</strong> – We’re completing the cycle and adding three new Fabled Weapons in this final update. Bring both shock and awe to your foes with Mjolnir, strike fear into their hearts with a hand puppet, or just take on the righteous tides with your surfboard. With the addition of these remaining Fabled Weapons, all Classes in the game now have one tied to them in the Soul Shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customization is the Spice of Life</strong> – To wrap things up, we are adding some minor customizations for both new and long-time fans of the PC/Mac/Linux version of the game. The first is the ability to add your own custom localizations. Please note that due to the nature of font generation, the feature is only available for languages in Latin or Cyrillic. We’re also adding custom seeds for speed runners, along with ways to validate them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the update trailer: </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-dV_OLQkcwk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a80a2996ee97a79cce782188060fe394.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-dV_OLQkcwk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Playing it for a while after release, I can see why people love the game. The design is fantastic and it looks super crisp. Tough as heck for lots of it though, really needs a lot of time to learn all the little enemy encounters and to get good at the tight platforming skills required. With nearly 12,000 user reviews on Steam and a Very Positive rating, this seems like a good send off.</p>

      <title>Animated series in the works for Vampire Survivors, plus big upgrade upcoming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not only will Vampire Survivors get another content upgrade and a small patch later this month but an animated TV show is currently in the works.</p>
<p>Clearly the developers are doing well, and not really a huge surprise, since Vampire Survivors is one of the biggest indie hits in the last year. With an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam from over 185,000. Anyone who enjoys it I'm sure can attest to have utterly captivating it can be to play.</p>
<p>Sharing the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/3717201559848963709" target="_blank">Steam</a> about the animated show, the developers said they've pulled in a company called Story Kitchen, whose team includes Derek Kolstad (John Wick) and Dmitri M. Johnson (Sonic films). So they have help in the industry but studio founder Luca Galante mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we all know, the most important thing in Vampire Survivors has always been the story, so we are very excited for this and we hope you are too! It’s still early days for the show, but I can already say that we will be involved so that we can ensure it doesn’t have any vampires (probably) and they will only cast the finest garlic. While we will be involved, this won't affect game development in any way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't actually mean it will happen though, as <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/vampire-survivors-video-game-animated-television-series-story-kitchen-luca-galante-poncle-trailer-1235340337/" target="_blank">Deadline</a> reported they're searching for a writer and they still need some network to actually pick it up and buy into it. So it may never happen but given the popularity of the game, it may prove popular.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126313641683037307gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16126313641683037307gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As for the game, a small patch is coming this month and then a <em>bigger</em> v1.5 content patch is planned to come later with new stages and relics but no dates set. They did say the 1.5 patch will have something different, as they keep experimenting with things like previous updates.</p>
<p>While all of this is going on, they're still working through their game engine upgrade too, which you can <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1794680/discussions/3/5769714637082190371/" target="_blank">try in Beta</a>.</p>

      <title>Combat Master is a cheesy indie free to play Call of Duty</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heard of Combat Master? It's a free to play first-person shooter released on Steam in late April and now it has Linux and Steam Deck support.</p>
<p>Designed to be like a much cheesy faster Call of Duty, one that it's optimized for lower-end systems, it doesn't have anywhere near the level of graphics of the current-gen shooters. It's also a game that was <em>primarily</em> made for mobile it seems, that they've ported over to PC and just recently they added Native Linux and Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10797079801683034929gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10797079801683034929gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Notes from the latest update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Max players increased: 5v5 and 10 players lobbies are here!</li>
<li>Lightning speed loading time!</li>
<li>Steamdeck release, Linux + SteamOS.</li>
<li>New settting "Toggle Sprint" for Keyboard players.</li>
<li>Set "Huh" jump sounds volume.</li>
<li>Sniper Rifles now deal more damage over distance.</li>
<li>Customize color of Armor Icon in UI.</li>
<li>Far away shooting sounds are now louder.</li>
<li>Invert Y-axis setting.</li>
<li>Warehouse map clipping fix.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They also said the "CombatZone" is coming soon, so probably their own low-end take on a BR like Call of Duty Warzone.</p>
<p>It certainly won't win any awards for originality, and it really is pretty much a bargain-bin poor man's Call of Duty attempt by a small team. That said, it's popular on mobile and even on Steam it seems to regularly have multiple thousands playing it at any time so it seems to have already found an audience. Alfa Bravo Inc (the developers) even say they're just "enthusiasts" who have a "special love for firearms" and the gaming industry with "No corporates" involved.</p>

      <title>Seems the big Chinese surge on Steam is over - Steam Survey for April 2023</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/" target="_blank">latest</a> Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for April 2023, and it shows that things have calmed down again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/the-latest-steam-survey-had-a-huge-surge-of-simplified-chinese/" target="_blank">I reported earlier last month</a>, that the details they had for March 2023 looked really off. It showed a massive surge in Simplified Chinese as a language on Steam with it becoming top, along with Windows 10 surging up over Windows 11 as well. It was all a bit odd. Valve never issued any corrections though, or announced any issues with it at all.  </p>
<p>For April 2023, things have settled down again with Linux back to 1.32% (+0.48%), macOS back to 2.30% (+0.89%) and Windows at 96.38% (-1.37%). Languages changed dramatically again too with Simplified Chinese dropping back down to 25.03% (26.60%) so English being once again the top language used on Steam.</p>
<p>When filtering the April 2023 survey over to Linux here's the current most popular ways to game:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 22.77% +1.57%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 10.84% +1.23%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.79% -0.57%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.61% +0.51%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 6.25% -0.70%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 4.97% +4.97%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.86% +3.86%</li>
<li>Other 33.90% -10.89%</li>
</ul>
<p>So it's clear the Steam Deck is currently beating all other ways on Steam for playing games on Linux.</p>

      <title>FNA gets Direct3D 11 support on Linux using DXVK and vkd3d</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun for game developers and game porters looking at Linux and Steam Deck here, as <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">FNA</a> has released a major upgrade that has early support for Direct3D 11 on Linux. <em>FNA powers quite a <a href="https://www.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=Portfolio/Tools#01_FNA.txt" target="_blank">lot</a> of games, and is used to help port games over to Linux as well.</em></p>
<p>In the latest FNA release <a href="https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA/releases/tag/23.05" target="_blank">23.05</a> it brings Linux support for Direct3D 11 rendering in Alpha. How? Making use of DXVK-Native (which is now just part of <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk" target="_blank">DXVK</a> itself) and vkd3d. You might be wondering, and I certainly was - why? Well, developer Ethan Lee wrote on their <a href="https://icculus.org/finger/flibitijibibo" target="_blank">blog-thingy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was really excited to help with this for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It was an excuse to work with CodeWeavers' programmers again</li>
<li>Having a Linux-native HLSL-&gt;DXBC compiler has been on every porter's wishlist forever (as <a href="https://github.com/icculus/mojoshader/commits/main/mojoshader_compiler.c" target="_blank">Ryan can attest to</a>)</li>
<li>It was also an excuse to start helping Joshua Ashton with making D3D9/10/11 a runtime provided by operating systems, as well as the Steam Runtime</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>While Valve still isn't prioritizing native, that hasn't stopped others from working on it independently - it's this cooperation that allowed the FNA team to release what I'm badly naming <strong><em>"The FNA3D D3D11 Linux Alpha"</em></strong>! Available on <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/" target="_blank">the FNA website</a>, this is a supplementary archive for fnalibs.tar.bz2; by updating fnalibs and bundling linux_d3d11, you can now pass <code class="inline-code">/gldevice:D3D11</code> as a launch arg, and it will use dxvk with the native Linux binaries. Is it any better than our native OpenGL/Vulkan renderers? Maybe! Is it still cool even if it isn't better? Sure! The main goal of this feature is that it showcases what's possible for studios using D3D that want to make native versions, since <em>somebody</em> needs to tell everyone that this is an option, and I don't see anyone else doing that, so... here we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19902407871683030873gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19902407871683030873gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Pictured above is Streets of Rage 4, a shot taken from Lee's post about it showing it running with this change to FNA. Below a bunch of screenshots Lee further explained once their TODOs on it are done:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That will effectively fulfill my vision for what all of the recent DirectX work could be doing for native: Provide a built-in Direct3D runtime and HLSL compiler in distributions, just as we already do for other graphics libraries and shader languages, so that developers can target native Linux binaries without having to statically bundle what amounts to an entire graphics driver inside their game. The samples above may not look super cutting edge, but even small developers can make use of these features to improve energy efficiency for the new handheld PC craze, as well as improving on the usual performance and stability concerns.</p>
<p>And of course, I'm still supporting OpenGL as always, and the FNA team is still heavily invested in <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_shader_tools/blob/main/docs/README-SDL_gpu.md" target="_blank">SDL_gpu</a>, but this has been a fun thing to work on in between SDL_ActionSet work and some other console projects that I've been working on in the background. I hope the work will help continue to build a platform that developers feel confident shipping native games on, and maybe Valve will get excited about it too!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will certainly be interesting to see what becomes of this, and perhaps if more developers look towards something like DXVK and vkd3d it could help bring down costs when it comes to porting. Although for bigger developers that largely depends on what happens with the Steam Deck and Linux desktop user share over time, it has to be worth it for them.</p>

      <title>Another Steam and Steam Deck Beta brings fixes and Steam Input improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the huge update recently that overhauled the Steam Overlay, Valve has put up another Steam and Steam Deck Beta to fix up lingering issues and upgrade Steam Input.</p>
<p>For the May 1st update on Desktop here's what's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3705942560795699113" target="_blank">changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed -silent command-line option not working.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash related to http transfers.</li>
<li>Fixed opening systray menu for certain monitor configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Menus now work in the desktop overlay.</li>
<li>Added binding listener dialog that lets you bind inputs by hitting a mouse button, keyboard key, or gamepad button.</li>
<li>LED Color/Brightness Action reinstated as a bindable action. Find the Action settings inside the Game Pad tab when selecting an action binding (available on controllers with LEDs only).</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator not fully closing when backing out via gamepad in the Desktop overlay.</li>
<li>Fixed the controller configurator opening layout previews in a new window instead of directly in the configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed cases where alt-tabbing between the stand alone instance of the desktop configurator and a game would not update the in-game layout.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed windows not grouping together in the taskbar.</li>
<li>Fixed pinning a steam window to the taskbar resulting in a shortcut that could not launch steam.</li>
<li>Fixed association of steam windows with the steam.desktop application entry.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The taskbar issue was quite a little nuisance, nothing truly breaking but annoyingly all the same so glad to see that fixed quickly (and yes it is actually fixed, I checked).</p>
<p>Over on Steam Deck the changes are basically the same, since Valve now share a lot of the code between them, something they were keen to highlight in the recent major update so it makes implementing features a lot easier for them and they can bring the features to PC and Steam Deck faster. These are the Steam Deck <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/3717201559861560266" target="_blank">changes</a> (Beta and Preview channels):</p>

</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Desktop Mode</strong></p>

<p>What have you been playing? I only recently finished Fallen Order, hoping the sequel would be worth playing through but as we saw it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/star-wars-jedi-survivor-had-a-very-rough-launch/" target="_blank">another poor launch</a>. Major publishers just keep pushing things out that aren't ready. It didn't take long for the next major game to have a crap launch with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294810/Redfall/" target="_blank">Redfall</a> already on Mostly Negative.</p>
<p>This and more was covered in my recent news overview video:</p>

      <title>Don&#39;t Starve Together huge sale, content update and hitting records</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Klei Entertainment have just released that latest update for their co-op survival game Don't Starve Together, it's a good one and it's on a massive sale too.</p>
<p>This is the biggest discount on Steam the game has ever had with 90% off until May 4th, putting it at only £1.09 / $1.49 / €1.49. Thanks to this, the player count for it has skyrocketed. The previous peak of 68,418 back in 2019 was smashed with it hitting a new top of 107,998.</p>
<p>It's not just the discount pulling people in though - it is a great game and the latest update sounds fun adding in rifts that appear, these will spawn creatures that are "very interested in gardening". Plus there's new powerful equipment to craft and this is only the first part of a trilogy of updates coming to the game as part of the "From Beyond" update arc.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="a5-sHjpO7-c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d5cceb6d0eeaa2f9b74596c96d83052a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/a5-sHjpO7-c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>You can buy it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322330/Dont_Starve_Together/" target="_blank">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>They haven't forgotten about the original single-player <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/219740/Dont_Starve/" target="_blank">Don't Starve</a> though, it also has a 75% discount until May 4th and they released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/219740/view/3725082859194767733" target="_blank">a huge</a> quality of life update for the game too.</p>

      <title>Is X4: Kingdom End worth your money?</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It has been over four years since X4: Foundations was released. With the new fourth DLC Kingdom End, Egosoft has now brought the last of the original races back into the game, namely the peaceful and scientifically highly motivated Borons.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IdLuSIB76UA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/502dc921dad8836758e9f522284fb26f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IdLuSIB76UA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<h3>So, what does the new DLC Kingdom End offer?</h3>
<p>Firstly, there is, of course, the new storyline about the Borons, who were separated from the other sectors at the beginning of the game. As players, our task is to not only restore the connection with the Borons but also help them reintegrate into the community of other factions.</p>
<p>For those who are not familiar with the Borons: they are peaceful aquatic creatures primarily interested in science and harmony, and they prioritize violence and economy less.</p>
<p>In addition to the long-awaited reunion with the Borons, the new DLC also expands the existing sector network. The Borons add 11 new sectors, divided into two regions, to the game. Furthermore, there are, of course, the Borons themselves and all their ships and stations.</p>
<p>Economically, there is also a requirement for a specific resource that is different from many other races – the Borons require water to build their ships and stations, a resource that has not been used for building ships and stations in X4 so far.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Boron ship design is a little different from that of the other races. The Boron ships are overall more streamlined, have a deep blue color, pulsating lights, and all appear somewhat delicate. Additionally, all ships have names of aquatic creatures, which, I believe, are almost all fish names.</p>
<p>As for ship selection, many of the ships are designed primarily for good defense and speed. For example, there is the Hydra, which has an enormously strong shield performance, or the cannon ship Tresher, which is also heavily armored.</p>
<p>However, there are no battleships or frigates for the Borons. Nevertheless, the Borons have two carrier ships, one in size L and one in XL. These carriers can then be equipped with a light fighter, the Mako, or its heavy counterpart, the Barracuda. Additionally, there are various civilian ships of the Borons, such as scouts, miners, transporters, and so on.</p>
<p>Similar to previous DLCs, Kingdom End also has two new game starts that begin at different points in the game, but ultimately lead to the same sandbox-like universe that many X4 players know and love. This means that we can still enjoy all the gameplay freedoms while also immersing ourselves in the Boron storyline.</p>
<p>Of course, I would rather not spoil the story, but I can say that it is well done. One sector that will immediately catch your attention during the early missions of the new game start is the Sanctuary of Darkness.</p>
<p>This sector is not only dangerous because some aliens fly around there, but also because there is a kind of space storm raging through it which one has to fight their way. This gave me quite a headache, as I think I died about seven or eight times trying to get through this sector. Nevertheless, I think this sector is overall a nice addition because it adds exciting elements to the story as well as to the gameplay.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Sanctuary of Darkness can be quite frustrating, especially for beginners, and I have to confess that after the seventh or eighth try, I simply consulted Reddit to find my way through the sector.</p>
<p>A nice element of at least one of these launches is that we get the research station/player HQ shortly after the beginning of that launch – and without any work at all. We only have to dock there once and then we can chat a little with the first Boron we meet in the storyline and he then simply gives us the station.</p>
<p>The expansion also comes with its own set of achievements that can only be unlocked with this DLC.</p>
<h3>6.00 Update</h3>
<p>Alongside the paid DLC, Egosoft also released the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/6659175566905047112" target="_blank">free 6.0 update</a>. This update offers a new physics engine, improved lighting effects, and parallax occlusion mapping, which has made significant changes to the game's underlying systems.</p>
<p>However, personally, I don't think I saw much of a difference. Although I had already set my graphics settings to high and still found the game relatively attractive, there were some performance drops in certain areas. While I mostly had around 60 FPS, there were moments – especially in stations – where the FPS dropped to around 18 or 20.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, X4 is still an incredibly demanding game even with the new DLC and update, not just in terms of graphics but also in terms of CPU and RAM usage on your PC. It's hardly surprising, given that the game simulates a vast universe with around 100 sectors.</p>
<p>In addition to some new models for the construction ships of all races and the option for fleets led by a single carrier to defend multiple positions, the 6.0 update naturally offers a whole host of smaller bug fixes and changes, which I cannot mention all here. But please follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/392160/view/6659175566905047112" target="_blank">this link</a> if you want to know more.</p>
<p>However, one feature I particularly liked in the 6.0 update was the live-stream feature. By pressing F6, we can now select a new camera perspective that presents a ship or station from the outside – optionally with some basic information and cinematic black bars. This is great for a long journey in space, and I was delighted that Egosoft added it.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Did I like X4 Kingdom End and the update?</p>
<p>To put it briefly, overall yes.</p>
<p>However, I must admit that X4 is not a game that you can just play on the side. Even though I had already spent around 150 hours in X4 before the DLC, I actually had to relearn the ship controls and figure out where all the hotkeys were in the first hour of the new DLC.</p>
<p>The other reason why X4 is not a game for "just playing for a moment" is that, after four years and with the new DLC and update, it is a real monster. The game is not only incredibly large, with around 100 sectors, but also incredibly complex. And it just takes time to make progress in certain areas.</p>
<p>You have to build your reputation, earn money, and buy or steal your fleet together – and that takes a little time. However, that's also the beauty of X4. So if you have the time and patience to get into X4, you'll definitely have a lot of fun, especially now with the new DLC and the newly added Borons.</p>
<p>However, while playing, I also noticed some things that I didn't find quite polished. For example, when I received my Mako fighter as a gift from the Borons, I didn't know how to get into the damn thing. Here, a very simple tutorial hint would have been nice to show newcomers an easy way into their ship.</p>
<p>Since X4 is still a very complex and large game, some minor bugs are to be expected. The autopilot, for example, still tends to crash into things if you rely on it too much. Other than that, there are a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing really dramatic.</p>
<p>In terms of game design, I found the mission where you have to set the navigation beacons in Sanctuary of Darkness – don't worry, it's not a particularly late mission, so I won't spoil too much – not easy at all. This is mainly because there are hardly any visual clues as to where it is safest to pass through this sector.</p>
<p>While you're told to stick to the asteroids and look for areas where nothing is destroyed, there aren't many asteroids in this sector, and the path isn't very clear. After about seven or eight attempts, I ended up consulting Reddit because it was getting too frustrating – and I found that a bit disappointing. When I had to pass through the sector again later, I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would say that X4 Kingdom End is definitely worth the purchase, especially for fans of the series. However, I think most of you have already bought the DLC by now.</p>
<p>Not only does it add the last remaining race in the X4 universe to the game, but there are also 11 new sectors and two new regions. By the way, these two regions are very different economically. While the sectors of the Provinces Adrift are initially quite starved economically, the sectors of the royal Borons are economically well-positioned. Both parties are thirsty for expanding their economic influence across the entire X-universe – and that offers some gameplay options.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the music. I can only emphazise that Alexei Zakharov did an excellent job. The music of the game was the element that captivated me already in the trailer and provided me with some beautiful moments in the game. Sitting in front of the screen and watching the new sectors and ships in live-view while enjoying the atmospheric music created some special moments.</p>
<p>So if you've played X4 in the past and have €14.99 / $14.99 / £12.49 to spare, I highly recommend giving the DLC a chance. I think the new DLC is a real improvement, as is the new update.</p>
<p>However, I hope that X4 will continue to work on the story and especially the performance in future updates, as it is still an issue. Nevertheless, X4 is and remains a unique game in its own right, and I am very pleased that it is still being developed and hope that it will continue to receive new updates.</p>
<p>If you've never played X4 before, I can definitely recommend the game, but with the small warning that the game not only requires at least a decent PC, but also a lot of time. But the game is certainly beautiful. There are few single-player space simulations that are as comprehensive and offer as much freedom as X4.</p>
<p>You can buy X4 on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/x4_foundations?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/x4-foundations?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/392160/X4_Foundations/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor had a very rough launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again! Just like The Last of Us Part I (and so many other games recently), another major game released too early. STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor is a hot mess.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for players to make their thoughts clear, with the Steam user review rating hitting Mostly Negative shortly after release from over three thousand people, although now it's changed to Mixed. This could easily be the worst launch so far this year. It's so full of general technical issues but the biggest problem is the performance, as even on top-end systems it seems to be struggling everywhere.</p>
<p>Here's an example of just how bad it is on Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="poYcwyybW8I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b4253bc83e5aab08c43e51979a932c87.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/poYcwyybW8I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's probably going to be quite a while before it's fixed up to a satisfactory level. They've now released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1774580/view/3719453359664023556" target="_blank">statement</a> that reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are aware that Star Wars Jedi: Survivor isn’t performing to our standards for a percentage of our PC players, in particular those with high-end machines or certain specific configurations.</p>
<p>For example, players using cutting-edge, multi-threaded chipsets designed for Windows 11 were encountering problems on Windows 10, or high-end GPUs coupled with lower-performing CPUs also saw unexpected frame loss. Rest assured, we are working to address these cases quickly.</p>
<p>While there is no single, comprehensive solution for PC performance, the team has been working on fixes we believe will improve performance across a spectrum of configurations. We are committed to fixing these issues as soon as possible, but each patch requires significant testing to ensure we don’t introduce new problems. Thanks for understanding and apologies to any of our players experiencing these issues. We will continue to monitor performance across all platforms and share update timing as soon as it is available.</p>
<p>The Star Wars Jedi Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Testing STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor out on desktop Linux with my Fedora KDE 38 system running an AMD Ryzen 5800X, an NVIDIA 2080 Ti and Proton Experimental it can't hold anywhere near 60FPS even at only 1080p. Testing across Low, Medium and High details preset, the performance across all of them is very similar and even Low is well below 60FPS, often 40FPS and below. Keep in mind these shots are on Low details:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16144453171682717033gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16144453171682717033gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16342425531682717035gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16342425531682717035gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Right now, it's a definite skip until they actually sort out all the performance problems.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1774580/STAR_WARS_Jedi_Survivor/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Huge Steam Beta upgrade with new overlay, screenshot manager &amp; more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wow. Valve sure love to just drop awesome stuff out of nowhere don't they? A brand new Beta update is now live for Steam with some massive improvements. There's also a fresh Steam Deck Beta too!</p>
<p>First, let's talk Steam Desktop. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3686801719529689367" target="_blank">Beta</a> brings in a whole new Steam Overlay with a new interface and a fancy toolbar, that gives you easy access to various things like friends chat, achievements progress, guides, discussions, a browser, and more. There's a new notes app that lets you type in whatever you like, saved in the cloud and synced across other systems. Even more awesome, is that you can now pin things on top of the game window, to have them show on top — which sounds incredibly useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/899241641682676661gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/899241641682676661gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Above you can see the new overlay in action on Fedora KDE 38, with a bunch of windows open. And a note telling myself that I need to "Git gud". If you notice, the guide has a blue pin, because that has been pinned to the game, so when looking at the game it would show up like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8027767671682676763gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8027767671682676763gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Wherever you place a pinned window in the overlay, is where it will show on the game.</p>
<p>Notifications have been overhauled too and they even upgraded the screenshot manager.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19112819641682676287gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19112819641682676287gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For Linux and macOS, Valve even said their work has now enabled hardware acceleration bringing it up to the same level as the Windows client. So now Steam should be a lot smoother. One thing they noted is how a lot of work went under the hood for all this, as they changed how they share the code between desktop, big picture and Steam Deck to help bring features out faster.</p>
<p>There's subtle design changes across the whole client too, so a lot more of it matches with their newer modern design elements and it looks pretty great now overall, much more consistent.</p>
<p>It also wasn't mentioned directly but the old Steam file picker when adding a Non-Steam game is gone, instead it now seems to use the desktop file picker. Finally! That was one of the worst parts of the Steam client because that old Steam file picker was pretty terrible but now you get your full desktop picker. Excellent.</p>
<p>This overall is really quite a fantastic upgrade for Steam on desktop. According to Valve designer Lawrence Yang on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1651742201272209408" target="_blank">Twitter</a> the overlay improvements will eventually come to Gaming Mode on Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Steam Deck also had a Beta and Preview update with these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3717201559846022608" target="_blank">changes</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new warning icon to the header that will display when Steam Deck can't reach the Steam servers. Clicking the icon will navigate a page with more details.</li>
<li>The wifi icon will no longer show a yellow exclamation mark when Steam Deck can't reach the Steam servers. It will still show this icon if Steam Deck can't reach the internet (e.g. the connection has a login portal).</li>
<li>Added support for Mouse4 (Back) as B button in the interface.</li>
<li>Fixed opening the "Reorder controllers" dialog in the main Big Picture Window when a game is running.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Input</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new config export path that works while offline. In personal configuration dropdown the options are now "New Personal Save", which is this new option and "New Sharable Personal Save", which uses the existing Steam Workshop backend.</li>
<li>Filter the configuration export options based on whether the device is connected to Steam/Offline.</li>
<li>Fixed some flashes when adjusting sliders in the Quick Settings section of the configurator.</li>
<li>Fixed moving right in the mode settings page not jumping to the appropriate settings sub-page.</li>
<li>Fixed turning off the Dual Sense Edge controller.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The Steam Deck has all the new overlay stuff too but just in Desktop Mode for now. </em></p>
<p><strong>Update 28/04/23 20:08 UTC</strong>: an additional Beta <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/3705942560783794887" target="_blank">update</a> went out, fixing up some issues and adding back the missing Steam Play settings.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us gets more optimizations and another Steam Deck fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slowly but it's happening, The Last of Us is getting fixed up after the poor launch and it's getting a little closer to being playable on Steam Deck now too. On desktop Linux at least, it ran pretty well at release (aside from all the confirmed game bugs and issues) but on Steam Deck it was especially rough.</p>
<p>Here's everything changed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1888930/view/5815877879410560069" target="_blank">v1.0.4</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Optimized CPU and GPU use throughout the game</li>
<li>Improved texture fidelity and resolution on in-game Low and Medium settings</li>
<li>Improved graphical fidelity on the in-game Low graphics preset, particularly water surfaces no longer appear black</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur during shader building</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur when quitting to the Main Menu</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur when dying after combat</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, on first boot, players may experience longer wait times to load into the game</li>
<li>Added an option for players to lock and unlock performance stats simultaneously in the HUD menu (Options &gt; HUD)</li>
<li>Added descriptions in the Graphics menus to better explain when certain settings may affect another (Options &gt; Display)</li>
<li>Added a Texture Streaming Rate setting (Graphics &gt; Texture Settings)</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where skipping cutscenes during a critical load may cause the game to hang</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the shader load warning did not appear while relaunching the game</li>
<li>Updated the VRAM bar to more accurately display the OS+Apps usage</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Screen Reader read values for locked settings which may imply those same locked setting were active</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where aiming downward while using keyboard and mouse (KBM) may increase camera sensitivity</li>
<li>Refined the handling of certain commands that are assigned the same KBM keybinding</li>
<li>Corrected Brazilian Portuguese, Croatian, Dutch, Finnish, French, Greek, Hungarian, LATAM Spanish, Spanish, Thai, and Traditional Chinese translations for multiple menu options</li>
<li>[Ultrawide Displays] Corrected the Rangefinder reticle position for the bow</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>AMD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash that may occur on AMD CPUs with affinity limited to X3D cores</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where textures may render incorrectly on AMD GPUs</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the “It Can't Be For Nothing” achievement did not trigger, despite acquiring all other achievements</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Steam Deck</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue on Steam Deck where resetting Display settings to Default no longer enabled AMD FSR 2 (Options &gt; Display)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Going back to it myself today on Steam Deck to test and the first bit of good news - is that the initial shader building on the menu now only takes just about 16 and a half minutes, down from the 1 hour it took at release. That is a huge improvement but still quite a while to twiddle your thumbs when you've already waited a good while just to download the game.</p>
<p>After that though, my first attempt to just load an early saved game resulted in my Steam Deck doing a full reboot. An annoying issue that has been present since release, that a few other bigger titles also cause as well like God of War. Second load though worked fine. One of the heaviest parts of the game is actually in the intro section, and here on the default settings (Low + FSR 2 Quality) it stayed a lot closer to 30FPS compared to before where it would be sticking well below it the entire time. So there's definitely some performance uplifts with this patch.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10715926001682616755gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10715926001682616755gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17163347691682616756gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17163347691682616756gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Still far from ideal though, with multiple dips below 30FPS but the improvement is <em>clear</em> in my testing. In another couple patches, and perhaps with the upcoming major SteamOS 3.5 update, it might actually be closer to a properly playable status.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>If you've given it another run since this latest patch, how's your experience now?</p>

      <title>Charming monster collector Cassette Beasts is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is the second full release from Bytten Studio following Lenna's Inception. It's a rather sweet evolution on the Pokémon-like monster catching games.</p>
<p>Giving off an 80s vibe, this is an open-world RPG with turn-based battles where you record monsters on retro cassette tapes, and you can use some of their abilities in the open world too. Together with the clever fusion system, that allows you to create lots of unique creatures, there's a lot to love about it.</p>
<p>Developed with Godot Engine, it has full Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified with the Steam Deck using the Native Linux build by default. The Godot Engine team just <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-showcase-cassette-beasts/" target="_blank">did an interview</a> with the developers that's worth a read too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_OLST_Fw5Ms"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9d9c826a8b5b43e68a56a646276bbf49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_OLST_Fw5Ms" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Transform into monsters...using retro cassette tapes?! Faced with the constant threat of monster attacks, the residents of Harbourtown, New Wirral choose to fight fire with fire. Record a monster to tape, then play it back to take on its form for battle!</li>
<li>Fuse monster forms! Getting close to your companion has benefits–while transformed you can combine your strengths to gain the upper hand in battle! Any two monster forms can be fused to produce unique, fully-animated new fusion forms.</li>
<li>Explore a rich open world - Certain monster abilities can be used in human form. You’ll need these to help you get around, solve puzzles, and locate dungeons. Glide, fly, swim, climb, dash, or turn magnetic!</li>
<li>Travel alongside a diverse cast of human companions - Never fight alone! Form bonds, spend time together, and help your selected partner complete personal goals to become a better team. The strength of your relationship determines how well you’re able to fuse!</li>
<li>Master a deep battle system - Take advantage of elemental chemistry to apply extra buffs or debuffs alongside your attack, or even alter your opponent’s elemental type!</li>
<li>Play couch-co op with Friends - Team up in local multiplayer with a friend to explore an open world, transform and battle together! Facing the unknown as a duo will surely develop your relationship!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely worth picking up. The developers have supported Linux very nicely with it and it's just a great looking game. I had a huge amount of fun with the demo which you can still try right now to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>You can pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1321440/Cassette_Beasts/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Paradox Interactive announced today that the mini-expansion Cities: Skylines - Hotels &amp; Retreats is due for release on May 23rd. On top of the mini-expansion they've also revealed three content creator packs.</p>
<p>"Revealing the last Cities: Skylines expansion and content packs is a bittersweet moment.

"Thank you to our dedicated community of players for their support and feedback throughout the years. As we watch the sun set on Cities: Skylines together and move to the next chapter of the franchise, we look forward to seeing and learning from the amazing creations players design, this last time and beyond."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BFc50HzpQYk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19c4f39e789384fb186ac96f4704516f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BFc50HzpQYk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Cities: Skylines - Hotels &amp; Retreats Key Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hotel Buildings: Hostels, cabins, hotels, luxurious resorts… you name it! Add a series of hotel buildings to your city on a range of budgets.</li>
<li>Hotel Management: Start with one-star hotels and unlock new options as your business revenue and popularity booms.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Players can also look forward to the following Content Creator Packs:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is all the final content, the game will still get general support until the end of the year. So if any big bugs need squashing then we might see some smaller updates come in. Mainly because their team are now working on the sequel with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/paradox-cities-skylines-2-plus-the-sims-like-game/" target="_blank">Cities: Skylines 2</a>.</p>

      <title>Street Fighter 6 on Steam Deck and Linux tested, Valve sets it to Proton Experimental</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Street Fighter 6 is coming up for release in June and there's a demo now available to try out on Steam, which Valve has now set to use Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/lawrenceyang/status/1651345821332557824" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, Valve designer Lawrence Yang noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For folks checking out the Street Fighter 6 demo on Steam Deck, the launch issue has been addressed (we’ve temporarily pinned the title to Proton Experimental.)</p>
<p>You may need to restart Steam to pick up this change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you have been trying it out and couldn't get it working right, either uncheck any Proton version in the compatibility settings to pick up what Valve set or manually swap it over to Proton Experimental yourself. For now Valve think that will give you the best experience in the demo. I did notice though one video in the intro logo screen section didn't work, and was instead their video-test screen but apart from that everything else seemed to work.</p>
<p>Performance can be an issue though. It's easy enough to get a near-solid 60FPS in the versus mode on Steam Deck but the World Tour mode is a different beast. Settings will need to be turned down for it.</p>
<p>Here's a short look at the demo running on Steam Deck with Proton Experimental:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xuKA41Z-2sM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/bb6e3fa37ff50c42fd7ac251770ec927.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xuKA41Z-2sM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On desktop Linux, I've done my testing here with Fedora KDE 38 and one thing it did on desktop, that it didn't do on Steam Deck, is offer up pre-warming of the shaders. So, letting it do that option, gave a wait of only around 2 minutes on my Ryzen 7 5800X / NVIDIA 2080 Ti setup, so nice and speedy compared to some other games.</p>
<p>After that, the versus mode on desktop Linux with Proton gave an almost perfect 60FPS at 2560x1400 (Ultra settings) and it looks amazing in action. It could go a lot higher but the fights are locked to 60FPS as a max:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14365365581682606110gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14365365581682606110gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The full game is set to launch on June 2nd, so it's nice to see that Valve are keeping a close eye on yet another popular titles about to release.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental upgraded for April 26th brings fixes and new game support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go, now that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Proton 8</a> is out <em>and</em> Proton Experimental has been rebased on top of Proton 8, there's more fixes and improvements coming in for Steam Deck and Linux desktop gamers.</p>
<p>Valve released an update to Proton Experimental on April 26th that includes these newly supported games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint.</li>
<li>Minecraft Legends.</li>
<li>Company of Heroes: Battle of Crete.</li>
<li>STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are fixes from regressions in Proton 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3 no longer launches to a black screen in Vulkan mode.</li>
<li>Divinity: Original Sin: Enhanced Edition and Divinity Original Sin II: Definitive Edition no longer crash on resolution change.</li>
<li>Path of Exile no longer crashes.</li>
<li>GTA V no longer freezes after each key press.</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus there's these other improvements too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regression causing Payday 2 to crash on start.</li>
<li>Improved Elden Ring compatibility compared to Proton 8.0-1. It can still be a bit finicky.</li>
<li>Fixed memory leak in Trackmania and Ubisoft Connect overlay.</li>
<li>Added a temporary workaround for EA Launcher crashing. Steam Deck's on-screen keyboard may not pop up automatically while using it.</li>
<li>Fixed Madballs in Babo: Invasion claiming the game wasn't purchased.</li>
<li>Fixed PlanetSide 2 launcher.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>Since there's many different Proton versions it can get a bit confusing, so head on over to my <a href="http://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">beginner's guide on Steam Play and Proton</a> for more info.</p>

      <title>Core Keeper is getting pets and a creative mode on May 10th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming "Paws &amp; Claws" update for Core Keeper sounds wonderful, adding in two major features with pets and a creative mode.</p>
<p>Releasing on May 10th it will have an entirely new Meadow biome featuring cattle, animal companions you can hatch and lots of new game mechanics. There's also going to be new decorative items too like glass that could be useful. Adding a creative mode sounds good too, for those that prefer things a bit more peaceful. This creative mode also has a god mode, allowing you to move much more freely including through objects.</p>
<p>Check out the brand new trailer.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="J3AHHSdTaHk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55ae7bbc66043f835e7786142a6055fb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/J3AHHSdTaHk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Pricing of the game is also going to change on May 29th with prices going up, however it's also on a 20% discount from the currently lower price now until May 22nd. As for the rising price they shared these as an example of what to expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Price in GBP = £12.99</li>
<li>Updated Price in USD = $15.99</li>
<li>Updated Price in Euros = €15,99</li>

<li>Updated Price in THB = ฿330</li>
</ul>
<p>From the press release:</p>

      <title>UK CMA blocks the Microsoft takeover of Activision</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's some industry news for you: the UK's Competition and Markets Authority has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/microsoft-activision-deal-prevented-to-protect-innovation-and-choice-in-cloud-gaming" target="_blank">announced</a> today they've blocked Microsoft's takeover of Activision.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the main concern of the UK CMA here seems to be around Cloud Gaming specifically. As they said in their statement "Microsoft has a strong position in cloud gaming services and the evidence available to the CMA showed that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s games exclusive to its own cloud gaming service." and that "The deal would reinforce Microsoft’s advantage in the market by giving it control over important gaming content such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft. The evidence available to the CMA indicates that, absent the merger, Activision would start providing games via cloud platforms in the foreseeable future.".</p>
<p><em>Quite a big blow to the $68.7 billion deal!</em></p>
<p>We saw Microsoft attempt to get around these concerns, with various Cloud Gaming deals being announced over the last year but it seems that just hasn't been enough. An interesting part of the CMA announcement was on a proposal submitted by Microsoft, to address some of their concerns, this proposal was to set out "requirements governing what games must be offered by Microsoft to what platforms and on what conditions over a ten-year period" but one of the shortcomings noted was "It was not sufficiently open to providers who might wish to offer versions of games on PC operating systems other than Windows.". Nice to see.</p>
<p>The UK certainly isn't the only country to be concerned by the power this deal would hand to Microsoft with the US FTC also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/12/microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-hits-a-bump-as-ftc-seeks-to-block-it/" target="_blank">trying to block it</a> and according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/no-substantive-settlement-talks-between-us-ftc-microsoft-over-activision-lawyer-2023-01-03/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> earlier this year there were no substantive settlement talks on it. So now with the UK blocking it, that will likely boost the FTC's argument to block it too. On top of that, there's also the EU regulators decision coming up next month.</p>
<p>Microsoft, naturally, will be attempting to appeal the decision.</p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts?</em></p>

      <title>Valheim is getting siege weapons, fortresses and fearsome foes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The upcoming major update to Valheim with The Ashlands is sounding increasingly exciting, as the developers have another spoiler-filled development <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com/news/development-blog-fearsome-foes/" target="_blank">blog post</a> up. Naturally, you'll want to avert your eyes if you don't want anything spoiled.</p>
<p>While there's no expected release date yet for The Ashlands because they're still working out all the mechanics, this is an exciting glimpse into what to expect from it. However, we might see some public testing within the next couple of months.</p>
<p>It seems the land will be filled with fortresses and siege weapons, something that was teased on <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinEyreArt/status/1646798139930681344" target="_blank">Twitter</a> recently but now we have a clear shot of one:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20765479481682506191gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20765479481682506191gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>These fortresses will come with some scary looking creatures too like the Fallen Valkyrie and the Charred:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14217335941682506322gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14217335941682506322gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19348428301682506321gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19348428301682506321gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sure they look scary, but I would argue the scariest foes in Valheim are still those damn Deathsquitos, sneaky little things. Lost count of the amount of times I've been bested by them.</p>
<p>Oh and if that wasn't enough, there's going to be a Bonemaw Serpent ready to chomp sections of your ships away, or your arms and legs if you happen to fall into the water:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8095496471682506414gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8095496471682506414gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>All this plus the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valheim-is-getting-extensive-difficulty-options-including-a-creative-mode/" target="_blank">upcoming customisation</a> of the difficulty options (and a creative mode) really has me excited, the future of Valheim is sounding simply awesome.</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Stellaris: Galactic Paragons announced for May 9th and a big free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Stellaris: Galactic Paragons is the next expansion for my favourite space strategy game from Paradox Interactive and it's coming May 9th. This DLC will give deeper character and story progression allowing for more customisation of your leaders.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“There are endless stories to tell in the Stellaris universe. Breathing life into the stories of the leaders in the Galactic Council and your empires is a perfect showcase of the team’s commitment to expanding the ways our players can explore a vast and wondrous galaxy,” said Stephen Muray, Game Director for Stellaris. “Our players push us to bring Stellaris to new heights, and we'll be exploring the galaxy alongside them for years to come.”</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NrWoHmBntTw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7793c3863bcba899f8e683d776969bc6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NrWoHmBntTw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique Council Roles</strong>: Specialized roles and benefits are included in Galactic Paragons to expand upon the new Council Mechanics in Stellaris! Find dozens of unique council roles based on your civics and government types, and unlock additional positions as your empire evolves.</li>
<li><strong>New Dynamic Leaders</strong>: Recruit, improve, and follow the leaders of your empire through the ages! You may shape them by picking their traits, selecting their veteran class, and guide them towards their destiny, up until they retire - or perish!</li>
<li><strong>Meet Galactic Heroes</strong>: Attract paragons of renown to your council: unique leaders with their own art, events, and stories may join your empire and bring their own benefits to your government. Or, discover four Legendary Paragons with intricate event chains and unique mechanics!</li>
<li><strong>New Traditions, Civics, And More</strong>:
<ul>
<li>A new “Under One Rule” Origin that tells the tale of the leader who founded your empire</li>
<li>Eight new Civics focused on leadership, from immortalizing the personalities of leaders past in digital archives to heavily optimized council selection via corporate charter</li>
<li>12 new Veteran Classes</li>
<li>Hundreds of new Leader Traits</li>
<li>Two new Tradition Trees, giving players new edicts and improved leaders</li>
<li>New ships, art, and story content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will of course drop alongside the 3.8 update which I mentioned recently, that will include two co-op modes. You can get a lot more info on the co-op mode in their <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/stellaris-dev-diary-293-introducing-coop.1577064/" target="_blank">explainer forum post</a> but essentially it comes down to these key points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cooperative PvE</strong> allows players to join together as a single empire to take on enemy empires. This presents a great opportunity for players to teach their friends how to play the game or divide the responsibilities of empire management for a more relaxed gaming experience.</li>
<li><strong>Cooperative PvP</strong> allows groups of players to join opposing empires to fight against each other. Splitting up duties may reduce barriers to entry of competitive multiplayer by being less overwhelming. For more competitive players, empires can also be locked and require a password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck gets a Preview update with STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor is releasing on April 28th, so Valve has released an updated graphics driver in the Preview update branch for Steam Deck. This is the work covered previously where Valve wouldn't name the game, so we got <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-improving-mesa-graphics-drivers-on-linux-for-a-secret-game/" target="_blank">a bit too excited</a> about it.</p>
<p>Released on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3729585915988347091" target="_blank">April 25th</a>, the Steam Deck OS 3.4.7 Beta available in the Preview branch simply notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the graphics driver with performance improvements for STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you're wanting to get the best out of Jedi: Survivor on Friday, be sure you've opted into the Preview branch on Steam Deck which you can do in the Settings &gt; System &gt; Steam Update Channel.</p>
<p>The next major SteamOS update for Steam Deck should be quite an exciting one, as SteamOS 3.5 is planned to come with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/hdr-and-colour-management-patches-for-steam-deck-amd-gpus-under-review/" target="_blank">support for HDR</a> for external screens when docked along with an upgraded Linux kernel and various improvements elsewhere.</p>

      <title>Grounded 1.2 out now and Steam Deck Verified but desktop Linux needs a small fix</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The survival game Grounded from Obsidian Entertainment and Xbox Game Studios has now released version 1.2 and it got bumped up to Verified on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/grounded-from-obsidian-adds-steam-deck-support-in-v120/" target="_blank">I reported previously</a> during the Beta, the developers managed to fix up the issues that were causing the game to not run and even with workarounds the Xbox login was still a mess. All those issues were solved and it really is looking pretty great on Steam Deck now.</p>
<p>See their update video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-OH6IZ3Yf_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d78b7bbde26f5810f2a4d93bc05a9dc5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-OH6IZ3Yf_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam Deck fixes include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The game now boots past the initial loading screen.</li>
<li>The Xbox log-in window properly displays.</li>
<li>Tuned the default graphics settings for Steam Deck to provide an enjoyable experience. Also includes some Steam Deck-specific optimizations.</li>
<li>Steam Deck virtual keyboard pops up when selecting any input text field in the game (entering a multiplayer game password, naming your trail marker / storage, pet, etc.)</li>
<li>Control prompts no longer flip flop between displaying gamepad and mouse/keyboard controls when using the touch pad or gyro.</li>

<p>Grounded will be having a Free Weekend on Steam as well from April 27th until May 1st, so you'll be able to check it out on Steam Deck and see all the fancy new stuff too.</p>
<p>For Linux gamers on <em>desktop</em>, sadly it still won't run out of the box. However, to get it to work all you have to do is remove or rename the <code class="inline-code">SpeechSynthWrapper.dll</code> file found in the <code class="inline-code">Grounded/Maine/Binaries/Win64/</code> install folder. You can find the installed folder in Properties -&gt; Local Files / Installed Files and hit Browse. Here's a shot from it running just fine after that on Fedora KDE 38:</p>

      <title>Using a Steam Deck to control a Ukrainian automatic turret, now I&#39;ve seen it all</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>People have used their Steam Deck to do all sorts of crazy things but this latest is nuts. It seems people in Ukraine are using it to help work an automatic turret. From ТРО Медіа on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tro.media.news/posts/pfbid02WH8wn384mZtJtagg9QnK9MnEFNpmjX6NLTyd3xzFsEtMmWM9cV55hVkvT8GvjJeEl" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, they shared a post giving a few details into it with it translating roughly as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sablya" is a Ukrainian automated remote-controlled fire complex designed for stationary installation on real estate objects or special transport.</p>
<p>The Shable Coordination is done via a remote control, camera and monitor, which allows combat from up to 500 from the rig, while preserving the operator's life.</p>
<p>A combat platform can be installed both stationary at checkpoints, border and other zones, including to defeat low-flying enemy "drones". On the platform you can install any light anti-infantry or anti-tank weapon weapon, for example, machine gun kalashnikov.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what did people spot in the pictures? A Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17221077421682436293gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17221077421682436293gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9027042651682436292gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9027042651682436292gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Well, it is an entire computer in your hands with a screen, with a full Linux desktop mode available. So sure, why not. Thinking plainly, it's not too different to them sitting with a laptop of any other brand, just that little bit more portable. <em>The other side is that they could just be using it to play some games in between testing and who could blame them eh?</em></p>
<p>There's spotting a Steam Deck "in the wild" and then there's this. Quite a surprise.</p>

      <title>AMD Ryzen Z1 Series announced for handhelds, ASUS ROG Ally first to get it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After many leaks, AMD has now formally announced their brand new Ryzen Z1 Series, which directly target the handheld gaming space like the Steam Deck. </p>
<p>The chips being announced today are the Zen 4 based Ryzen Z1 and Ryzen Z1 Extreme that come with RDNA 3 architecture-based graphics. AMD also announced clearly that the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/asus-rog-ally-gaming-handheld/" target="_blank">ASUS ROG Ally</a> will be the first device launching with them.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“At AMD, we’re continually advancing the next generation of gaming experiences, from consoles to desktops to on-the-go handheld devices,” said Jason Banta, corporate vice president and general manager, Client OEM at AMD. “Ryzen Z1 processors deliver gamers an elite gaming experience and extreme portability in exciting gaming form factors.”</p>

</table>
<p>The processors support USB4 and the latest LPDDR5 and LPDDR5X memory standards.</p>
<p>AMD also said in their press release that more info on the ROG Ally will be announced on May 11th.</p>
<p>“Having a great gaming experience doesn’t mean you have to be tied to a chair or a charger,” said Shawn Yen, product management director of Gaming Business Unit, Asus. “With the new Ryzen Z1 Series processors, we’re working with AMD to deliver the power, visuals and efficiency needed to enable a superior portable gaming experience — whether you’re traveling, commuting for work or simply want to game untethered.”</p>
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/processors/ryzen-z1" target="_blank">AMD page</a> for the new processors, AMD give more details and yet they're showing a Nintendo Switch and a Steam Deck in pictures before the Ally:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21165147581682435295gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21165147581682435295gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The question is why are they showing two devices not using these chips? An error left in, or are we just supposed to assume it's to showcase power from low to high without naming them directly? Curious. Or even upcoming new versions of both with these new chips (not likely).</p>
<p><strong>Update 20:12 UTC</strong>: AMD removed the Switch and Steam Deck so it's now just the Ally:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1553915221682449836gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1553915221682449836gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<hr/>
<p>So at least now we know what processor the ROG Ally will use but can it really compete with the Steam Deck? Until we know pricing, nothing is clear on that. With more power comes more battery drain too, there's so many unknowns about it.</p>

      <title>KDE apps like Kdenlive get big upgrades for KDE Gear 23.04</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KDE Gear is the name of the big bundle of software the KDE team create, and with the KDE Gear 23.04 release there's new apps and plenty of improvements to making the desktop experience better.</p>
<p>One of the newer apps is Tokodon, a desktop client for Mastodon that supports multiple accounts, which is super useful if you have multiple accounts on the same host. <em>FYI you can follow <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gamingonlinux" target="_blank">GamingOnLinux on Mastodon</a>.</em></p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10807629541682421056gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10807629541682421056gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the improvements include the ability to see previous messages when replying and the ability to send polls to your followers, plus you can also configure a proxy for it before logging in now as well.</p>
<p>The Kdenlive video editor, my go-to app for editing all GamingOnLinux videos got support for nested timelines, this new feature allows you to group several clips together to treat them as a single sequence, allowing you then do all sorts of things to the clips together like effects and transitions. Sounds incredibly useful. Honestly this is probably the feature I am most excited about, it sounds like it might end up saving a lot of time when editing videos with lots of different clips together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/716827921682422320gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/716827921682422320gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Lots of other improvements elsewhere to the likes of their YouTube Music app called AudioTube getting a redesign, NeoChat for Matrix also has an upgraded design, the screenshot tool Spectacle now allows you to annotate screenshots and record your screen on Wayland (and it also had a redesign), the Filelight app for monitoring disk space gained a useful list view and lots more.</p>
<p>More can be seen on the <a href="https://kde.org/announcements/gear/23.04.0/" target="_blank">announcement page</a>.</p>

      <title>Paradox announce first &#39;Immersion Pack&#39; for Victoria 3 and free upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Victoria 3 from Paradox Interactive is getting it's first "Immersion Pack" on May 22nd and here's what to expect from it.</p>
<p>It's called Voice of the People, Paradox say it challenges you to handle some of history's greatest political agitators. Coming with a new Agitator system that's highlighted with the addition of dozens of historical figures who break convention and build political power behind the force of their personality. Meet intellectuals like Mikhail Bakunin, conservative militarists like Georges Boulanger, and voices for freedom like Frederick Douglas.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jAEsJek9fW4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7abea2eaab323e568a78e3d96171bb18.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jAEsJek9fW4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 60 New Historical Characters: Explore new alternate histories with real historical characters, including John Brown, Emmeline Pankhurst, and Enver Pasha.</li>
<li>Special Agitator Actions: Aid the agitators by promoting them to lead Interest Groups, or send them into exile to blunt their impact. You can also, in some cases, invite other nations’ exiles into your society to take advantage of their ideas.</li>
<li>Unique French Content: New events, journal missions, and decisions inspired by French history. Press your advantage in Northern Africa, back one of many royal claimants, or establish a strong French Empire in Europe and worldwide.</li>
<li>New French Buildings: Historic structures from France added to the map.</li>
<li>New Art: A paper map unique to Voice of the People, wrapped in a new art nouveau appearance. New animations for revolutions highlight the interest groups in revolt, and new clothing and uniforms are added for many societies.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you decide to pre-order it they will throw in an extra three historical French characters - the great Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, the author and political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, and Jules Brunet, the French military advisor to Shogunate Japan. The DLC will be priced around $14.99 / £12.99 / €14.99.</p>
<p>At release as usual for Paradox titles there will also be a big free upgrade for all players too. This free update does include the agitator system but there will also be new political ideologies for France, changes to the world map, and reworks of the legislative and revolutionary processes, along with many other changes.</p>

      <title>Valve moves ELDEN RING back to Proton 7 as it has issues with newer Proton</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Certain games on Steam that you play across either Linux desktop or Steam Deck get a specific version of Proton set by Valve, and at times they don't quite work right like ELDEN RING.</p>
<p>In this case Valve had set Proton Experimental to be the default to run ELDEN RING, where it did work previously, however they just recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-upgraded-with-proton-8/" target="_blank">upgraded Proton Experimental</a> basing it upon the newly released <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">Proton 8</a>. With any new Proton version can come breakage as the translation layer isn't quite perfected just yet and in this case the popular game is having issues with the Proton upgrades.</p>
<p>As mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1650299941699596288" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The launch issue with ELDEN RING has been addressed by temporarily reverting the game to using Proton 7 while the Proton 8 update issue is being investigated. Restarting Steam will pick up the fix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you're forcing a compatibility option on ELDEN RING, you might want to uncheck it to pick up what Valve set or change it yourself back to Proton 7 to have it work again.</p>
<p>Nice to see Valve continue to keep on top of compatibility like this.</p>

      <title>Linux and Steam Deck compatibility tool Luxtorpeda gets upgraded in v63</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/luxtorpeda" target="_blank">Luxtorpeda</a> is a very interesting project. It's a compatibility layer (like Proton) but designed to help you run Native Linux game engines for various Steam games.</p>
<p>Why? Well, quite a number of games on Steam actually have much more modern community-made game engines, that can give all sorts of quality enhancements. Luxtorpeda allows you to easily download these and run them directly through Steam.</p>
<p>Version 63 was recently released and here's the main technical changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Switch to using Steam Linux Runtime - Sniper for the built engines. This provides newer tooling for builds, which should make future development easier, for example being able to build qt 5.15 and have gcc 10 available. The 100+ engines have been re-built. Note that previous clients should still work on the older soldier, but any new updates will only happen to sniper (this client and above). If you run into any issues with the engines, please open a new issue in the <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">packages</a> repo.</li>
<li>Rust panics, if they occur, should now be caught and displayed in the Godot UI.</li>
<li>[dreamer] Use steamlocate v2 alpha</li>
<li>Bump h2 from 0.3.15 to 0.3.17</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from that, there's been numerous <a href="https://github.com/luxtorpeda-dev/packages/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#630-2023-04-13" target="_blank">upgrades</a> to the various game engines it offers up to help you get the most out of your gaming. You can see a full list of <a href="https://luxtorpeda-dev.github.io/" target="_blank">supported titles here</a>, along with any notes on the supported status of each one and there's quite a lot now.</p>
<p>I previously <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/03/steam-deck-using-luxtorpeda-for-morrowind-warzone-2100-and-x-com/" target="_blank">did a guide</a> on how to use it, and while focused on the Steam Deck the same applies to using it on a Linux desktop:</p>

      <title>Pixel-art Sims styled game Tiny Life hits Early Access on May 3rd</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ellpeck Games have announced their pixel-art game inspired by The Sims, Tiny Life will be releasing with Linux support on May 3rd. From what I've played of some of the earlier builds, it showed a huge amount of promise.</p>
<p>"Tiny Life is a fun simulation game that aims to capture the essence of games like The Sims series, but in an isometric pixelart style. In the game, you control a set of people that live together in a household. You take care of their daily needs, build their skills, forge new relationships... or just mess up their entire life in whatever way you can think of!"</p>
<p>Their current trailer is a little old but gives you a good idea on what to expect:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="iw-D7queVUI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/897b57f5d30bca7e02888d7f82dfd714.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/iw-D7queVUI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At the Early Access date the developer said it will contain this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Everything that is currently in the Tiny Life Demo.</li>
<li>Three free, always-installed Sets of content: The Familiar Attire Set, the Woodworking Set and the Fitness Set, two of which come with lots of additional stuff to do!</li>
<li>The large Maple Plains City map which was featured in the Tiny Life Beta.</li>
<li>The ability for adult Tinies to get pregnant, and give birth to babies.</li>
<li>The baby life stage, which features unique interactions, personalities, and skills.</li>
<li>The ability to export, share and import lots, households and custom maps, both manually and on the Steam Workshop.</li>
<li>The ability to create and share custom mods for Tiny Life using the official C# Modding API, both manually and on the Steam Workshop.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1651490/view/5306971121514693921" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developer mentioned they've seen around 15,000 people wishlist it, so clearly there's been a good amount of interest in this one.</p>

      <title>HDR and Colour Management patches for Steam Deck + AMD GPUs under review</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Melissa Wen recently sent in <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/amd-gfx/2023-April/092215.html" target="_blank">patches</a> to improve HDR and Colour Management on Linux for Steam Deck and potentially other AMD GPUs. The work is being done by Melissa Wen, Joshua Ashton and collaboration with Harry Wentland.</p>
<p>Exciting stuff, as eventually with this we should see some HDR fun on Linux with the likes of Gamescope. In the RFC (Request For Comments) patches, it was also specifically mentioned that SteamOS 3.5 is aiming to have "gamut mapping, HDR, SDR on HDR, HDR on SDR, and much more".</p>
<p>Excerpts from the RFC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joshua Ashton and I (with the great collaboration of Harry Wentland - thanks) have been working on KMS color pipeline enhancement for Steam Deck/SteamOS by exposing the large set of color caps available in AMD display HW.<br/>
[…]<br/>
So far, we keep these properties' usage under an AMD display config option (STEAM_DECK). However, we are fine with having them fully available to other DCN HW generations. In the current proposal, we are already checking ASICs before exposing a color feature. We can work on 3D LUT resource acquisition details to fit them to DCN 3+ families that support them. Indeed, before moving to these config boundaries, we started working on an open solution for any AMD HW.</p>
<p>The userspace case here is Gamescope which is the compositor for SteamOS. It's already using all of this functionality (although with a VALVE1_ prefix instead of AMD) to implement its color management pipeline right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like developers on KDE are interested in the work too, with Wen noting that Xaver Hugl from KDE was interested in experimenting with it for their HDR / colour bring-up too.</p>

      <title>Roblox intentionally blocking Linux with Wine in their new update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It seems the days of using workarounds to play Roblox on Linux may be coming to an abrupt end, with the upcoming launch of their new client blocking Linux intentionally.</p>
<p>This new client appears to be undergoing testing, and users quickly <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528" target="_blank">noticed</a> it wasn't working under the Wine compatibility layer on Linux. It seems the issue comes from Byfron, software for anti-cheat and anti-tamper that joined up officially with Roblox back in October 2022.</p>
<p>In reply to the forum post, a staff member for Roblox <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/2" target="_blank">mentioned</a> it is intentionally blocking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Jrelvas, Unfortunately this block was intentional. With the Windows 64-bit client launch we made the conscious decision to block the use of Wine. We came to this decision due to a combination of security and compatibility concerns. As a Linux user I am sure you understand the challenges of the Windows ecosystem. Wine is not officially supported but we are committed to working towards compatibility where possible. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a specific timeline for this support. However, I assure you that it remains a priority for our team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems it may not be forever, going by what they said above and below as this new 64bit client is undergoing intense testing right now as they gather feedback, bug reports and crash logs. In a follow-up post, another staff member <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/28" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your well thought out post. First and most importantly, we are not trying to punish the use of Wine.<br/>
Our Windows 64-bit client is in some regards quite different from the 32-bit client. We are currently gathering telemetry to analyze and hopefully fix existing issues and prevent future ones from popping up. For this process to work, it is of utmost importance to collect data from the [intended] target operating system. You will also find that we blocked the usage of VMs for the very same reason.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies some of the thought process behind the blocking of Wine. As MrEaker mentioned before, Wine remains a priority for our team, and we are certainly not deaf to the voices of our community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they seem to have <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/34" target="_blank">no plans</a> to block Wine use at all with Roblox Studio.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why they can't simply filter out the unwanted Wine results, since they obviously detect it just fine. Another few posts from the Roblox staff attempted to clear it up, as they <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/the-new-roblox-64-bit-byfron-client-forbids-wine-users-from-using-it-most-likely-unintentional/2305528/38" target="_blank">mentioned</a> their client will crash "compromised processes intentionally" and since they're going through so many thousands of crash logs, it would be quite a nuisance to add more to it. Sounds like it's complicated in many parts.</p>
<p>If / when they issue an update that does allow Wine players on Linux back in, I'll let you know.</p>

      <title>Flathub app store for Linux and Steam Deck gets overhauled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The redesign of the <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">Flathub</a> app store for Linux is now live, bringing with it a refreshed look along with showing verified developers and their apps. A much needed change that really does look a whole lot better.</p>
<p>With the new launch everything just looks a lot cleaner, and having a proper verification system in place means you will know if you're downloading something maintained by the creators and not a third-party. There's even a category just for <a href="https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/collection/verified/1" target="_blank">verified apps</a>.</p>

<p>Pictured above is an example of the Games category which features not just games but launchers, emulators and more, everything related to gaming. You can see the blue ticks to clearly show verified apps.</p>
<p>While the front-page isn't massively different, the biggest visual change is to individual app pages. There's quite a bit more detail included on them like install size, download size, how many people have installed it, direct links to the website and documentation for help, a graph of installs over time, a collapsible changelog of the most recent update and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17764174091682155923gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17764174091682155923gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>On <a href="https://mastodon.social/@barthalion@treehouse.systems/110241570500375384" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, the Flathub maintainer Bartłomiej Piotrowski mentioned "A redesign of #Flathub is live! Drop by <a href="https://flathub.org" target="_blank">https://flathub.org</a> to see all the shiny new things, such as developer verification and download graphs. There's more under the hood, including the long awaited subsets to enable only verified or FLOSS apps. Stay tuned for more updates!".</p>
<p>Flathub has quickly become my go-to place first to find downloads for any apps on Linux now. Especially with it being the main way to install extra apps on the Steam Deck too (through Discover), it's nice to have things the same across different systems.</p>

      <title>Valve improving Mesa graphics drivers on Linux for a &#34;secret&#34; game (update: Jedi Survivor)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/plagman2/status/1649562547908120576" target="_blank">Twitter</a> it’s for the upcoming Star Wars Jedi Survivor.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here's something interesting for you. Valve developers seem to be improving the Mesa graphics drivers right now towards a secret game. First noticed by <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/" target="_blank">Phoronix</a>, developer Samuel Pitoiset has been working on improvements in Mesa for the RADV driver (AMD Vulkan). This is the driver used by most for gaming on AMD + desktop Linux and also the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22556" target="_blank">merge request</a> from April 18th, one of the commits noted there was an improvement to "a depth-only pass by +35% in one upcoming game". <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22579" target="_blank">Another one</a> from April 19th notes it gives another performance improvement of around 10% in "that game" (continuing to be rather cryptic). Then from April 20th there's <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22589" target="_blank">another</a> and when you read into the comments, Pitoiset <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22589#note_1879550" target="_blank">notes</a> it's "again this upcoming (secret) game" that was pointed out by SadlyItsBradley on <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1649512643273674753" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought perhaps it was just going to be preparations for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and they just didn't want to name the game of a partner they were testing for because it's coming soon. However, the continued secrecy around it and even saying directly it's a "secret" definitely now has my curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>Do we think this is a new Valve game? It would make sense that Valve have their people working on performance improvements, and not naming it because then the internet would go wild. Perhaps Left 4 Dead 3 that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/left-4-dead-3-appears-in-counter-strike-2-files/" target="_blank">was spotted</a> being named in Counter Strike 2 files? Perhaps finally Half-Life 3 (yeah likely not but I can dream).</p>
<p>Pure speculation of course and it may not be a Valve game at all. It really could actually just be a game they're testing for a third-party, as we know Valve do get to do driver fixes and Proton fixes at times before a game releases on Steam so it's ready for Steam Deck. Either way, it seems we'll <em>eventually</em> find out on this one…</p>

      <title>Dota 2: The New Frontiers Update is out and it&#39;s huge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dota 2: The New Frontiers Update might be one of the biggest updates to Valve's free to play MOBA ever and it's here now.</p>
<p>Starting with a new map that has been massively expanded with 40% more terrain. The interesting thing here is that the lanes aren't further away and everything is still focused on going through the centre but the expanded space opens the game up some more for new strategies.</p>
<p>Roshan has new homes, there's teleport towers to get from one corner of the map to another, there's Lotus Pools on the left and right sides of the map that spawn fruit to give Mana and HP which you can stockpile into a larger fruit too. On top of that there's powerful new neutral creeps to fight, special towers to capture to give extra vision, a new way to get out the back of your base when the enemy is attacking front and loads more. See the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="eH6UJ4xDn4Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/99bc9518e15f711fcce78f831864e788.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/eH6UJ4xDn4Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Another big change is to heroes with a new attribute type with Universal Heroes, Valve say it's a "new main stat group composed of existing heroes that now gain 0.6 damage from each stat, of any attribute". Neutral creeps will get stronger over time now too, killing other players should have more of an impact now too, abilities that disable you have been nerfed so there's less sitting around, there's major changes to how matchmaking works and the list of changes just seems nearly endless.</p>
<p>I think it may be time for me to get back into Dota 2…at least I would, if it wasn't completely <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/2294" target="_blank">broken</a> for me right now. Seems the new release has come with some issues, mine won't even launch on Fedora 38. <u><strong>Update</strong></u>: turns out my issue was a known bug with Vulkan loaders you can <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Dota-2/issues/2285#issuecomment-1518051805" target="_blank">work around</a>.</p>
<p>See all on the <a href="https://www.dota2.com/newfrontiers?v=2" target="_blank">big update page</a>.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck hitting retail stores in Japan from April 29th, South Korea to follow</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Komodo announced today that they're expanding the retail presence of the Steam Deck into Japan now, with South Korea to follow after.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-hitting-retail-in-hong-kong-taiwan-and-later-japan-and-south-korea/" target="_blank">Back in March</a>, they put the Steam Deck in the first retails stores in Hong Kong and Taiwan. That will expand starting April 29th, with the first store in Japan receiving the Steam Deck and the official Docking Station at EDION Namba Main Store (Namba, Chuo-ku, Osaka).</p>
<p>Komodo mentioned additionally there will be an in-store trial event which will run from April 29th until May 7th. More retail partners in Japan will be announced "Soon" and they stated South Korea is next up in the list.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We are excited about opportunities that provide Steam Decks to more people,” said Ricky Uy, CEO of KOMODO, “and we hope anyone interested in trying Steam Deck in Osaka has the opportunity to visit the EDION Namba Main Store during the trial week.”</p>
<hr/>
<p>All good news, and with the Steam Deck reportedly on track to hit well <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/report-steam-deck-to-pass-3-million-sales-during-2023/" target="_blank">over 3 million sales total</a> this year, an expanded retail presence is only going to keep pushing that number higher. The Steam Deck from Valve is just going from strength to strength, especially with big Proton upgrades further improving compatibility like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/valve-rolls-out-proton-80-to-further-improve-steam-deck-and-linux-gaming/" target="_blank">recently launched Proton 8</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/proton-experimental-for-steam-deck-linux-upgraded-with-proton-8/" target="_blank">Proton Experimental update</a> following it.</p>

      <title>System76 launch multiple new powerful Linux laptops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Not one, not two but three product announcements from System76 today as they're launching a range of new Linux powered laptops. First is the Serval WS that will be getting a refresh but they're also bringing back the Adder WS and the Bonobo WS.</p>
<p>System76 said all of them can be configured with up to 64GB RAM, have at least a 144Hz display and up to 8TB of storage. In the case of the Serval WS it has a 165Hz screen, and the Bonobo WS can have up to 12TB of storage. So there's something that will hopefully fit every need.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8088464511682014864gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Adder WS — Starting at $1599!</strong>
<ul>
<li>For the first time, System76 offers a laptop with NVIDIA 40 Series graphics — up to the GeForce RTX 4070. The new Adder WS is also equipped with an i9 13900HX CPU (24 cores, 32 threads) and DDR5 RAM. The NVIDIA RTX 4070 has more VRAM and a 54% higher clock speed than the previous generation. With its formidable speed, the Adder WS is perfect for budding professionals setting out on the next phase of their career.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Serval WS — Starting at $1799, shipping mid-May</strong>
<ul>
<li>In addition to an i9 13900HX CPU, DDR5, and NVIDIA 40 Series graphics, the 17” Serval WS brings a 4K display option back to the System76 line. A 15” option is also available with a 1080p matte display at 165 Hz. Serval WS provides high-speeds ports like USB 3.2 gen 2, Thunderbolt 4, and 2.5GbE ethernet, and can power up to 5 displays (4 external). If you’re going to be downloading and uploading lots of data, this laptop is for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Coming Soon: Bonobo WS — Starting at $3299!</strong>
<ul>
<li>With an i9 13900HX CPU, DDR5, and up to an NVIDIA RTX 4090, the Bonobo WS once again returns as System76’s most powerful laptop. Amazingly, it’s also one pound lighter and 43% thinner than the previous Bonobo WS. Like the 17” Serval WS, the Bonobo WS features a 17” 4K display.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since they have a few laptop models back now, they've also launched a <a href="https://system76.com/laptops-powerful" target="_blank">comparison page</a> (which actually died as soon as it went live due to the demand). Clearly System76 are doing well, and they recently teased work on their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/system76-ceo-teases-in-house-linux-laptop-code-named-virgo/" target="_blank">upcoming custom laptop</a>.</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 23.04 is out now with GNOME 44 and a stable Steam Snap </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Canonical has today released Ubuntu 23.04, their latest short-term new-feature release (it's not an LTS) that will be supported until January 2024.</p>
<p>One of the big user-facing additions is the new installer that they say offers a "streamlined and more intuitive user experience". While it offers up a refreshed look the code behind the scenes is the biggest change - since it now shares the code-base with Ubuntu Server so they can give a more consistent experience.</p>
<p>This release also has GNOME 44, so you get all the latest enhancements there but Canonical also updated Ubuntu font, and they mentioned some big Snap update behaviour changes too. Instead of notifying you an update for a Snap was available and then making you go somewhere to update it, you will now get a background download and then it will be applied when the app is closed. You can also now pause Snap updates for as long as you want.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17882932881682006886gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17882932881682006886gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>There's plenty more like their Snap of Steam being promoted to stable. Canonical said over 150,000 people downloaded the preview version, so there was plenty of interest in it. This Snap bundles a bunch of dependencies needed allowing you to run new and old titles without messing with PPAs.</p>
<p>On top of that Ubuntu Cinnamon and a resurrected Edubuntu join as official flavours.</p>
<p>Canonical also did a video about their new installer:</p>

      <title>Stellaris 3.8 will add two co-op modes now in Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can safely say co-op is not something I ever expected for a strategy game like Stellaris but it's coming. You can even test it now. Version 3.8 is now in Open Beta on Steam, you just opt into the 3.8 version in the Properties -&gt; Beta window.</p>
<p>The two modes it will add in:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cooperative PvE can be initiated from the main menu - all players that hotjoin the hosted game will join the primary player’s empire. This mode is primarily intended for teaching new players or for lower intensity cooperative gameplay.</li>
<li>Cooperative PvP can be allowed by the host of a standard multiplayer game. When enabled, empires can open themselves up to allow other players to help control their empire. We expect this game mode to be useful for competitive team play.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These actually sound really great. I can think of numerous games I've had where a helping hand would have made things a lot easier, especially in the late game where you're controlling so much and there's constantly things happening. Great stuff from Paradox.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="79WxfMJSzWM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c77d58a750d4d5793abd5bb8745a68ba.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/79WxfMJSzWM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some of the other improvements coming in Stellaris 3.8:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added unique textures for Mercury, Venus, Neptune and Uranus for the Sol system.</li>
<li>Added unique textures for Earth and Mars when terraformed based off of available heightmap data.</li>
<li>Added new anomaly The Orb</li>
<li>Added a special solar system protected by the Lone Defender.</li>
<li>Added a decision to clear the wreckage on a Broken Shackles starting planet in the event that they are conquered before they enact the Memorial to the Unshackled decision.</li>
<li>Improved accuracy of tooltips on the galaxy setting screen and implemented experimental nested tooltip functionality.</li>
<li>The mind-wiped species from On the Shoulders of Giants will now have the Forcefully Devolved trait.</li>
<li>The Observation Insight Situation now remembers what approach you had when it last finished.</li>
<li>There is now a 1% chance that a pre-ftl civilization will spawn with the Forcefully Devolved trait.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Plus all the usual bug and balance fixes that Stellaris updates bring.</p>
<p>Stellaris is available from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stellaris?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stellaris?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Hotfix gets Minecraft Legends working on Steam Deck &amp; Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minecraft Legends just recently released on Steam and sadly at release it just wouldn't run, a quick bug report later and Valve has already <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1648890302621683712" target="_blank">solved</a> it with Proton Hotfix.</p>
<p>Initially trying through any Proton version tested it just wouldn't load, and it was the exact same problem on Steam Deck and my Fedora Linux desktop. It would just bring you right back to your Steam Library. I opened a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6696" target="_blank">bug report</a> and now thankfully it's solved. So now as long as it's set to Proton Hotfix, you're good to go. Valve have set Proton Hotfix on it, so as long as you're not forcing a different version, it will pick it up automatically.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S58JyK-lXck"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3169862688b668401478236e3bcd429b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S58JyK-lXck" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Once again, Valve and their developers working on Proton have reacted very quickly to a brand new release, which is really good to see. I have found that sometimes it will just randomly crash though. Not overly often but it does happen.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, you'll want to drop it from High to Medium in the graphics settings, which seems to give overall a rather stable 60FPS and it's very smooth apart from minor loading hiccups. On High settings on Steam Deck, it will dip down to 40FPS and sometimes below, so still doable but honestly it's perfectly fine on Medium and looks great.</p>
<p>Another issue I noted, specifically on desktop Linux with the Stable Steam Client, is that the Microsoft Account login was just a blank window in the Steam browser that pops up. However, if you simply resize the window, it then renders correctly. There's an existing <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/9014" target="_blank">bug report</a> for this for the main client. The login there worked fine.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck, the login may seemingly not work getting stuck after entering a password, but reloading the game showed me logged in just fine. You can also try the login on Desktop Mode on Steam Deck but for me in Gaming Mode simply restarting after waiting a minute after entering password worked.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10023681001681994731gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10023681001681994731gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Ultra settings on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>So a few quirks but overall once you in, it performs great and looks great with Proton Hotfix.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928870/Minecraft_Legends/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>If You Like… Slay the Spire</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>When Slay the Spire launched, back in January 2019, it represented the pinnacle in what became a well recognised genre - Deck Builders. Let’s delve into that genre and see lies beneath the surface.</p>
<p><em>IYL (If You Like) will be a short series of articles delving into various genres and looking at the best examples in each. I’ll follow a standard layout. I’ll start with a bit of history about the most famous game representing the genre. Next, I’ll cover a game that’s very similar to the original, then (hopefully!) any games that have surpassed it since, and finally any games that do things in a unique way, but still tipping their hat to the original. Then it’s over to you to tell me how wrong I am, in the comments!</em></p>
<p>Note: I did a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/deck-builders-round-up/" target="_blank"><u>very similar article last year</u></a>, so there will be serious overlap! Future IYL articles will of course cover different genres!</p>
<p>Before we start, let me be clear that while Megacrits’ game “represented the pinnacle” on its launch, it didn’t define the genre exactly. There were many predecessors that led to its creation and it would do several fine games a disservice to suggest that StS was first.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/208485801681923722gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/208485801681923722gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>If you fancy a dip into what must surely be the inspiration for StS, you could look at Deep Sky Derelicts, The Guild of Dungeoneering, Ironclad Tactics or even the excellent Hand of Fate games. But it was Megacrits’ game that rolled all the elements into a compelling package. It sold 1.5M copies at a recent count, half a million in early access alone.</p>
<p>I’m not going to pick bones about “Deck Builders” vs “Engine Builders” vs “Card Battlers” here. Let’s just dive in.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>A direct clone - Neoverse [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/994220/NEOVERSE/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h4>
<p>What happens when you take Slay the Spire’s three wonderfully constructed character choices and replace them with scantily clad female alternatives? Well, if the developer is Tinogames, you get an original take on StS with well thought out unique decks and mechanics, but with gorgeous, fully animated graphics thrown in. Playing Neoverse is very similar to playing StS, but sometimes feels more like a Final Fantasy game due to the gorgeous wind-ups and cinematic take downs.</p>
<p>Whether you play as Naya with her radioactivity, Clare with her shield and blocks, or Helena with her summons, each fight feels fair and crucially, just like StS, some enemies are easy as one character, but brutally difficult as another.</p>
<p>It might be unfair to call this a StS clone, since Neoverse launched only around three months later, so presumably started development pretty much alongside its famous rival, but I can’t find any developer retros and later is later, so here we are.</p>
<p>Should you buy it? Mostly yes - it has a lot of nuance that grows on you over time, like the parry, combo and precision systems that reward careful gameplay. Just be aware that it’ll look like you’re playing a dodgy porn game while you’re taking down those demons.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Games that do it better - Roguebook (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1076200/Roguebook/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/roguebook" target="_blank"><strong><u>GOG</u></strong></a><strong>) and Breach Wanderers (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1394130/Breach_Wanderers/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>)</strong></h4>
<p>Oh boy, this’ll get me into trouble, I’m sure. But what it boils down to, for me, is that I’d rather play either of these games, than even one more run of StS.</p>
<p>Roguebook is set in the world of Faeria (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397060/Faeria/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general_archive/faeria_an_amazing_strategy_trading_card_game_scg" target="_blank"><u>GOG</u></a>), by Abrakam Entertainment, a game I couldn’t get into. But other than tapping into the Faeria lore, the two games are very different. Roguebook takes the StS formula, then gives you two characters to play with. Block is shared, only the first character takes damage (usually), and cards have a simple mechanic to swap your characters around - if you block, or play a <em>charge</em> card, you go to the front. And it works amazingly well, opening up a huge series of tactics around positioning, blocking and healing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4846536321681925186gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4846536321681925186gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15536601561681925188gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15536601561681925188gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17879619341681925189gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17879619341681925189gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>But that’s not all - each of the four characters have their own decks and own unique capability which means that the synergies between these decks can be amongst the most game-breakingly satisfying that I’ve ever come across. Like in StS when you get your Ironclad to 999 block and draw a <em>Body Slam</em>. Seriously. Endorphin city.</p>
<p>The overworld map is beautiful, the sound design is endearing, enemies are diverse and (for the most part) fun to battle, and the attention to detail is just wonderful. It’s a masterpiece.</p>
<p>As for Breach Wanderers, the recommendation is just as heartfelt, but… murkier. Launching at Steam Next Fest back in Q3 2020, and still in Early Access today, the developers are two friends in Montreal with a vision. That vision is that their unique take on the Deck Builder puts the emphasis on the building. In Breach Wanderers, you can choose (with a few well considered restrictions) what your opening deck will consist of AND what will be in the pool of available cards throughout your run.</p>
<p>Having grown up on first edition Magic the Gathering, the ability to customise your opening deck is simply wonderful. After 110 hours of Slay the Spire’s opening four or five fights being absolutely identical in nearly every way, here was a game that gave me a choice of four opening fights with a custom deck tailored to <em>exactly</em> how I wanted to play the game. Throw in around 8 characters, interesting new game mechanics and a very grindy (in a good way) meta game and it’s plain that this one has some serious longevity beyond simply throwing Ascensions at you until you fall over.</p>
<p>It’s early days for me with the game, but so far the combination of the familiarity of StS, but with the freshness of actual deck building is an absolute winner. Highly recommended.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Something a little different: Hadean Tactics (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1260590/Hadean_Tactics/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>) or Monster Train (</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/" target="_blank"><strong><u>Steam</u></strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/monster_train" target="_blank"><strong><u>GOG</u></strong></a><strong>)</strong></h4>
<p>Remember Dota Underlords (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046930/Dota_Underlords/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a>)? God I loved that game. Until I didn’t anymore, but that was after 150 hours, so not bad for a freebie! Anyway, so did the developers of Hadean Tactics, a husband and wife team from Brazil. So much so, that the base game involves choosing your core hero, recruiting two to four followers, then throwing them into a grid-based auto-battler which could be easily mistaken for Valve’s PvP timesink.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3155545701681929992gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3155545701681929992gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2738531461681929991gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2738531461681929991gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>The differences wrack up pretty quickly though. To start with, this is PvE. Also, every 7 seconds, the game pauses and you have the familiar three mana to spend playing a choice of five cards. These can be straight up damage dealers, but the most interesting cards reposition the board, or can buff or debuff a few seconds of the fight. There’s a StS-style progress map, and of course, relics and upgrades for each of your units along the way.</p>
<p>It’s slick, it’s different and it’s definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Next up, Monster Train - often cited as one of the best deck builders out there, I was excited to finally give it a try a few months ago. And yep, it’s excellent. The basic format is almost like a tower defence, as enemies enter your four-level train at the bottom and work their way upwards toward the train’s core on the top level. That gives you three levels to place your “heroes” and buff them with your deck options.</p>
<p>The graphics are absolutely stunning, the overworld map is simple but fun and the fights are usually very fair. Variety is bolstered by having around 5 or 6 factions that you can play, each with their own deck, and each run is a combination of two of these factions to further mix up possible synergies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19748689721681932986gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19748689721681932986gol573.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/757381731681932984gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/757381731681932984gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>But while it is a truly excellent game, I have a similar problem with Monster Train as I do with Slay the Spire - after a certain point, the only replayability is in Ascensions, which simply rank up, introducing harder bosses and more punishing runs. That’s fine to a point, but it feels a little bit lazy, especially compared to Roguebook’s excellent mix-and-match challenge system which affects not just difficulty, but even how the core game is played.</p>
<p>I have no regrets though, as my nearly 60 hours in the game will attest.</p>
<h4><strong>And the rest</strong></h4>
<p>And wow, this is a big list. I’m too lazy to link all of these to their various stores, but if you’re serious about your deck builders, you don’t want to miss out on…</p>
<p><strong>Griftlands</strong> - two decks, one for fighting, one for diplomacy, all wrapped up in a story-driven series of missions. It’s out of Early Access now, and highly rated on Steam, but something didn’t quite click for me on this, particularly odd since it’s made by the awesome Klei team.</p>
<p><strong>Nowhere Prophet</strong> - guide your fledging army across the wasteland to find them a new home. Hints of base building in this one, with a Darkest Dungeon vibe at times.</p>
<p><strong>Across the Obelisk</strong> - Four heroes, four times the fun, with a story-driven overworld map. Some complicated mechanics on show here, but it’s highly-rated on Steam. I only played a handful of hours during Early Access and it’s one I’ll be going back to, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Trials of Fire</strong> - One of my favourites due to the lovely table-top feel the fights have. A really interesting open-world over-world map and a loose set of mission objectives to drive you forward. More tactical than the others, since the fights factor in position, range and line of sight.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Sky Derelicts</strong> - one the daddies I mentioned earlier, this is a sloooow starter, but worth sticking with as you build your team to take on the sci-fi themed enemies. Your deck is defined by a combination of your equipment and your character, giving some nice customisation.</p>
<p><strong>Card Hunter</strong> - a freebie, and like Trials of Fire, this introduces tactical positioning and elements like area of effect. Gets a bit naggy about buying a subscription eventually, but there’s tens of hours of enjoyment to be had first and the Dungeons &amp; Dragons vibe is hard to resist.</p>
<p><strong>Inscryption</strong> - part deck builder, part escape room, this dark, creepy adventure will keep you guessing throughout its three story-driven acts. I can genuinely say that it’s the first game in which pulling out your own tooth with a pair of pliers is a good thing!</p>
<p><strong>Tainted Grail</strong> - some unique takes on familiar mechanics and a 3D third-person overworld based around the idea of a torch slowly burning down gives this one great tension. I need to play more, as there are heaps of characters to unlock.</p>
<p><strong>Hellcard</strong> - only a couple of months old this one, but already showing promise as you put three adventures up against the army of darkness. It’s co-operative, apparently, but I don’t know how effectively that works. In single player, each character takes a slice of “pie” on the battlefield as the enemies surge towards you, each character playing their own decks, with their own special capability. One to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>Room for one more? Check out Liam's recent article on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/takara-cards-is-a-unique-space-sci-fi-deckbuilding-tactical-strategy-game/" target="_blank">Takara Cards</a>, a new Early Access, space-themed deck builder.</p>
<p>And that’s it for deck builders. Did I miss any? Is Slay the Spire still the king for you? I haven’t mentioned its various excellent mods, such as Downfall, so perhaps you’re all still enjoying the champion of deck builders through its total conversions, or fan-made characters &amp; decks! Let me know in the comments!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>POSTAL 2 from Running With Scissors just had a big upgrade for the 20th anniversary and there's lots of improvements to this classic violent first-person adventure.</p>
<p>Quite possibly one of the most ridiculous games ever made, there's so many terrible things you can do in it which is great if you love a bit of dark humour. Not me of course, you would never find me laughing at the ability to give yourself the middle finger in a mirror.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17069294231681918390gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17069294231681918390gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>

      <title>Takara Cards is a unique space sci-fi deckbuilding tactical strategy game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fusing together the best elements of deckbuilders and tactical turn-based battles, Takara Cards is a little unusual to get into but full of charm to keep you wanting more. It feels like an evolved idea from their previous game, NEXT JUMP: Shmup Tactics, which was also a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It's showing a huge amount of promise for the rather quirky story to it, one that sees you chasing Dragons through space as you build up your deck of abilities, progress through various turn-based battles and encounter various strange events. The combat is certainly interesting, with your deck being both your pilot and your ship and the battles are you travelling through space with your aim to destroy as much as possible and survive to continue on.</p>

<p>Currently in Early Access and available now on Steam, it comes with full Native Linux support and the developer mentioned they're ensuring it works nicely on Steam Deck as well. It's made with Godot Engine and other open source tooling as well.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play cards in a <strong>DEEP tactical turn-based Combat.</strong></li>
<li>Over <strong>70 cards</strong> and 34 unique units (so far).</li>
<li><strong>Create your character</strong> by choosing Cards and Reputation, among other things!</li>
<li>Your Deck is your Pilot and your Ship: <strong>Build it by venturing </strong>through the Cosmos and Events.</li>
<li><strong>Exoteric Karma System</strong> that influences your Character and Ship.</li>
<li><strong>Synergize between</strong> dozens of UNIQUE cards to <em>clear</em> the board of enemies <strong>in one Turn.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Go and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932210/Takara_Cards/" target="_blank">check it out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.1 to get FSR 2.2, better 3D support for OpenGL, shader improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seems like the next update for Godot Engine is going to be a nice one for game developers, with multiple graphics enhancements on the way. Detailed in a new <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/rendering-priorities-4-1/" target="_blank">blog post</a> they revealed some of the focus for Godot 4.1, now that the dust has began to settle on the huge Godot 4.0 release that provided Vulkan support.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1266249911681911728gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1266249911681911728gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Godot 4 with the <a href="https://github.com/perfoon/Abandoned-Spaceship-Godot-Demo" target="_blank">Abandoned Spaceship demo</a>.</em></p>
<p>With the 4.1 release planned for this year, now they're moving to more regular releases, some of what they have planned to add includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify bottlenecks in 3D rendering to improve performance.</li>
<li>Time slicing DirectionalLight3D shadows to reduce GPU pressure for shadows.</li>
<li>Background pipeline compilation to improve shader loading times.</li>
<li>Finishing the 3D renderer for their OpenGL compatibility that targets lower-end and mobile devices.</li>
<li>FSR 2.2 for their Temporal AntiAliasing solution, along with integrating a bunch of effects with it like SSAO, SSR, shadows and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Godot Engine is a free and open source game engine for developers, you can see more on the <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed added a slick story campaign</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed is a shooter all about toys, a bit like the classic movie Small Soldiers and back in late March, it had a huge free upgrade. Honestly, this would have been my dream game to play through growing up. With movies like Small Soldiers and Toy Story, I probably would have had a tiny heart attack of excitement seeing this.</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support, it's Steam Deck Verified and I checked it out a bit today in the new mode with all the improvements and it feels great! Looks fantastic too, they really have the toy style down nicely. With the new update that landed on March 27th, they really put the work in on this one with it filled full of cartoon-strip 90s inspired cutscenes, lots of voice over and overhauls to multiple parts of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7720567981681909910gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7720567981681909910gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>All the major changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added the new Story mode to the base game. Cinematics and missions!</li>
<li>Added Primary and Optional missions to all levels. Some missions are completable in Free Roam for extra time.</li>
<li>Added new Boss enemy. The big man himself: Major Evil.</li>
<li>Added new Max Damage and Major Evil unlockable characters with multiple skins for characters and weapons!</li>
<li>Added new level (Rental Lair), the final stand against major evil in this upscale fancy apartment.</li>
<li>Added Story Cinematics menu to Extras so you can rewatch the cutscenes.</li>
<li>Added Max Ammo minigame playable Arcade Machine to the new Apartment map.</li>
<li>Added Max Ammo minigame button to the Extras after completing all objectives on the new map.</li>
<li>Added new Map selection and Campaign lobby for offline Singleplayer/Splitscreen to a better view of enemies and objectives.</li>
<li>Added Objectives list to the ingame Pause menu so you can more easily check your objective progress.</li>
<li>Added new random poses to characters in the Lobby menus.</li>
<li>Added new music tracks. Some music in earlier levels has been moved around for a more fitting gameplay experience.</li>
<li>Added level specific Bots that match the cutscene characters!</li>
<li>Added Options &gt; Controler slider for adjusting the Aim Damping effect.</li>
<li>Added a system to detect a corrupt save file and to restore a valid one from a backup.</li>
<li>Added objectives to end of round screen.</li>
<li>Added spectator-death mode to track enemy that killed you.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A shooter that blends in tower defence, with you facing off against many different types of enemy toys, what's not to love about it? You can play it solo or in co-op with up to 4 people with local and online multiplayer supported.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hypercharge-unboxed?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/523660/HYPERCHARGE_Unboxed/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Europa Universalis IV: Domination and free update out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Domination is the latest expansion for the popular strategy game from Paradox Interactive and there's also a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"Centered on the most popular and powerful nations in Europa Universalis IV, Domination revisits and revises once familiar pathways while adding more historical context and challenges to great nations like China, England, France and more. In some cases, branching missions will force you to make a choice that will irrevocably change the course of your nation, focusing your priorities in a particular direction."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x9tkAlvUXQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d28c136338e57dfba4b82bd2f739b2f8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x9tkAlvUXQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Europa Universalis IV: Domination includes new national mission trees and features for:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The Ottoman Empire: A revised conquest tree with new rewards for pushing Ottoman dominance, including expansion through the new Eyalet system, and new internal changes, such as the new Janissary estate, the new Ottoman Decadence mechanic, and the ‘Ottoman Power Struggle’ disaster.</li>
<li>China: Different mission trees for the Han Ming and invader empires like the Qing. Choose between expansion and Inward Perfection, and counter the power of the Eunuchs to build a more stable empire.</li>
<li>Japan: Unite Japan as you deal with the power of the Shogun and the independent Daimyos. Choose to open the country to foreign influence or keep it isolated, while deciding upon different paths of expansion and reform.</li>
<li>Russia: Free your country of the Tatar yoke, and transform it into a Great Empire. Choose the path of Peter’s reforms to modernize the state, so your mission tree as well as your mechanics will change and evolve as the game progresses. Use the power of Cossacks and Streltsy to expand your Empire to East and West.</li>
<li>Spain: Expanded mission trees for Castile and Aragon, with different paths to form Spain, a new mechanic available for the new ‘System of Councils’ government, and decisions about the Army and Navy to get the mighty Tercios and Spanish Armada.</li>
<li>France: Fight the end of the Hundred Years War, centralize France into an absolute monarchy while dealing with the Wars of Religion, expand into Italy and the Holy Roman Empire, and lead the Revolution through an expanded mission tree.</li>
<li>Great Britain: Separate paths for either a British Empire or an Angevin Britain, as well as a deeper internal gameplay, with unique features for the English Parliament and changes to the English Civil War disaster.</li>
<li>Minor nations: Mission changes, new government mechanics and expanded flavor for Prussia, Portugal and Korea.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there's also the v1.35 "Ottomans" update, which along with a ton of fixes it brings in these extras:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added 3 new sets of Ideas (Infrastructure, Court, and Mercenary), and further rebalanced all the Idea Groups.</li>

<li>Added more Ruler, General and Admiral personalities.</li>
<li>Added 7 new Parliament bribes and National Bribes, which are more expensive versions of bribes, but cover multiple parliament seats at a time, to Common Sense DLC.</li>
<li>Added 21 new Imperial Reforms, 21 new Decrees, and reworked special Age Abilities for Mandate of Heaven DLC.</li>
<li>Added 11 new Naval Doctrines to Rule Britannia DLC.</li>
<li>Added 11 New Iberian Holy Orders to Golden Century DLC.</li>
<li>Added the Latin Empire as a tag which can be formed through the Crusader mission tree to Emperor DLC.</li>
<li>Added 7 new Great Projects to Leviathan DLC.</li>
<li>Added 9 new Achievements.</li>
<li>Re-Added the Trade Protectorate subject type, available for countries that confirmed Thalassocracy.</li>

      <title>Fedora 38 is out now with GNOME 44, official Budgie desktop spin and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fedora has a big new release available in version 38 which came a bit early. As usual lots of new features and fixes, plus a fancy new Budgie desktop spin.</p>
<p>You can grab it as the main Fedora Workstation which includes an upgrade to GNOME 44 that's filled full of new features like the thumbnail view in the file picker, a new lock screen, enhanced quick settings with a "background apps" section, improvements to accessibility settings, better Flatpak support along with the new unfiltered view of applications on Flathub and so on. The Fedora team also made an adjustment to make shut downs faster.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14124217601681837433gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14124217601681837433gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - Fedora Workstation 38</em></p>
<p>This release also brings with it new official spins (alternative desktop environments) like the Budgie Desktop, "Sericea" that comes with the Sway window manager in an rpm-ostree version and a Phosh image for mobile devices. This is in addition to the existing spins with KDE, Xfce and more.</p>

<p>Various other upgrades like the inclusion of the updated dnf5 package manager for testing that has performance improvements, a smaller memory footprint, and a new daemon that can provide an alternative to PackageKit.</p>

      <title>Survival game Vintage Story set for a huge update with a big story event</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Vintage Story is a survival game that I simply love to watch and casually dive into now and then, and it's probably one of the most impressive indie open-world survival games around, if you like things hardcore.</p>
<p>Inspired by lovecraftian horror themes, it's often thoroughly uncompromising and it has a ridiculous amount of depth in some areas. The soon to release v1.18 update is going through the last release candidates right now and there's absolutely loads new including the first major story event, where you discover and go through a vast underground structure.</p>
<p>Another major change is the upgraded world generation with various new land forms, a geologic activity system, large scale mountain regions and more additions to world gen. Loads more added including a butterfly net and 160+ new types to collect, a glider to flow down from high altitudes, rafts, treasure maps, a writing system and bookshelves, an overhaul to doors, angled beams for construction, an improved tutorial system, ruined weapons, improved chiseling (one of my favourite features to craft!) and the list goes on and on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zD_Ui1dq-FU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e4a01f40891a38f9afc4de47d3e03cf9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zD_Ui1dq-FU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seriously impressive stuff from a tiny team, especially for a game not sold on Steam. All the changelog details can be seen in their <a href="https://www.vintagestory.at/blog.html/news/" target="_blank">News forum</a> for 1.18.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, they're also working to update from .NET Framework 4.6 to .NET7 concurrently, which will be in a future release. They're hoping to see "smoother performance, some future-proofing, and potentially broader stability on Linux and MacOS".</p>

      <title>Zoria: Age of Shattering now skipping Early Access to release in September</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of the upcoming squad-based tactical RPG Zoria: Age of Shattering have changed their release plans, and they're now going to skip Early Access entirely with a small release day.</p>
<p>Originally they planned to release into EA in April, but now they're instead doing a full release on September 19th. Why? They said "We evaluated our latest milestone and realized that Zoria is so close to being completed that putting it on Early Access would only water down our progress. Launching Zoria in EA would mean launching an incomplete game for a few months when in reality, we only need a few months to finish the game.".</p>
<p>You can check out the previous trailer (now with the wrong date) if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xiaxUtG0KbI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3daae76b1a7a3e7969dbaa07abdebba8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xiaxUtG0KbI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Zoria is a squad-based tactical RPG with fluid turn-based combat, outpost, and follower management, set in an expansive fantasy world. In the game, you will lead a team of four heroes at a time with their unique skills and perks. Every team member will contribute to the battles you will undertake.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are the Commander </strong>- Lead your diverse team through the fantasy lands of a Uram continent and challenge countless groups of monsters and bosses.</li>
<li><strong>Explore the world of Zoria</strong> - Zoria has now fallen prey to the sheer brutality of the hellspawn that roams its land. Its lush forests, mysterious caves, and majestic buildings have transformed into haunting locations. Explore these mysterious lands to uncover the mysteries within.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Turn Based combat </strong>- Use the unique skills of all of your party members to fight your way through the land. Attack from close range or distance with different attack patterns and directions; heal or shield allies with various spells and commands and use your surroundings to your advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Craft, rest and survive</strong> - Keep a keen eye on your equipment and vitality as they both deteriorate over time. A bonfire in Zoria's provides a safe spot to restock your resources and prepare for the next battle.</li>
<li><strong>Class based accessibility </strong>- Take care of each of your warriors' skill development, and it will repay you on the battlefield. Having an individual with the right skills can get you into previously inaccessible places and quests. Specific characters interacting with various objects in the world of Zoria may lead you to discover hidden treasures or make your travel easier, so explore all the options!</li>
<li><strong>Base management </strong>- You have to be wise in and out of the battle. Players can regularly update the base by unlocking new wings to the buildings, which will reward you with resources, quests, or items.</li>
<li><strong>Follow missions</strong> - In your outpost, you can plan and assign tasks to your companions. Send selected party members on an autonomic mission, in which you won't participate but will receive what they find along the way. Never forget that their lives are in your hands!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be available with Native Linux support on <a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/zoria_age_of_shattering?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1159090/Zoria_Age_of_Shattering/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There's also a demo available.</p>

      <title>Valheim is getting extensive difficulty options including a creative mode</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valheim continues to be one of the most popular survival games on Steam, and it seems in an upcoming update there's going to be much more extensive customization of the difficulty.</p>
<p>Teased in <a href="https://twitter.com/jsmars/status/1647968860711145481" target="_blank">Twitter</a> post by developer Jonathan Smårs, there's a quick video and a follow-up gif to show off some of the new options coming. After watching the quick video here's a breakdown of the modes shown off (all subject to change of course):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easy</strong>: Combat is easier and there are less raids on your base.</li>
<li><strong>Hard</strong>: Combat is harder and monsters will raid your base more often.</li>
<li><strong>Hardcore</strong>: Combat is a lot harder and monsters will raid your base more often. When you die all items you are carrying and skills are lost forever. You have no map and you may not use portals.</li>
<li><strong>Immersive</strong>: In immersive you have no map and you may not use portals so you will need to use your wits to keep track of where you are in the world.</li>
<li><strong>Hammer Mode</strong>: In Hammer mode you can build all buildings for free. There are no raids on your base, and monsters will not attack you until you provoke them. Other difficulty settings are normal.</li>
<li><strong>Casual</strong>: In casual mode monsters will not attack you until provoked, there are no raids on your base, resources are plentiful, you will not drop equipped items or lose skills on death and combat is a lot easier and events are based on your individual progress.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are just the <em>preset</em> levels though as there's sliders and tickboxes for various things underneath you can change like: the combat difficulty, death penalty, resources, raid rate, portal items, no build cost, player based events, no map, no portals and passive enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7656789351681820678gol1.jpg"/>Source - Jonathan Smårs on Twitter.</em></p>
<p>In replies Smårs clarified you will be able to change them whenever you want, and it will be set per-world for all players and can be changed on current worlds.</p>
<p>When to expect it? Smårs said it is planned to come with the "Hildirs Quest update coming soon".</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Picma - Picture Enigmas gets a free Steam release, lots of Picross styled puzzles</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your Picross? Check out Picma - Picture Enigmas, a new Steam release with Native Linux support and it has a lot of content. It's also free to play, to a point. </p>
<p>I'm sure most of you know what Picross and related games are? You match up tiles in a board, based on the numbers at the sides and it eventually reveals a picture. They can be a great way to unwind and test your brain at the same time. </p>
<p>"Uncover hidden pictures using your logic skills. With a library of over 100,000 community-created puzzles, distributed across multiple puzzle types, you are unlikely to run out of challenges. So, have a seat at the Moonberry Café, let Charlotte bring you a cup of your favorite drink, and relax as you sip and solve through Picma - Picture Enigmas." — Moonberry Arcade.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-LdJx_2fLrc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fff4475df8331b269d12d81213f88d51.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-LdJx_2fLrc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Much more than Nonograms</strong> - Find your favorite picture logic game from our selection of three puzzle types (more coming soon).</li>
<li><strong>Quality despite quantity</strong> - Our user content is curated by the community and only a fraction of the submitted images become puzzles.</li>
<li><strong>True logic puzzles</strong> - All of our puzzles are machine-verified to have a single logical solution.</li>
<li><strong>Massive puzzles</strong> - Our puzzles range from the tiny 5x5 all the way to the gigantic 50x50.</li>
<li><strong>True multi-color puzzles</strong> - What you solve is what you get, with up to 8 colors per puzzle.</li>
<li><strong>Play for free daily</strong> - Create and rate images to earn Coins and play at no cost.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The monetization might put some people off though. It does come with ~72 free puzzles split across three different modes, so there is quite a decent share of free content but the rest you need to pay for in some way. You can either buy coins, or buy a ticket for a length of time to access everything (like $5 for a full month), you can create puzzles to earn coins, or vote on other's designs to also earn coins. So there's multiple ways. </p>
<p>An interesting way to do monetization on a free game, although I can't see that being overly popular. I went to earn some free coins by rating what people had made, and it just instantly said there weren't any left. Still, the free stuff that's there was all pretty good. <u><strong>Update</strong></u>: the developer messaged to mention you still get a coin reward for going to rate images if there's none left (and they're right, I missed the coins it sent). They said they're going to make that clearer.</p>

      <title>MangoHud performance overlay gets a few needed fixes in v0.6.9-1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After the previous release of v0.6.9, <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud" target="_blank">MangoHud</a> has another nice update out that fixes up a few lingering problems for the Linux performance hud that's also used on Steam Deck for the built-in performance info.</p>
<p>Here's the changes in v0.6.9-1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that applied picmip without option being set.</li>
<li>Reverted x11 poller that was causing segfaults <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/commit/06edee407159f9c52cc060fa5ba135539d4c909a" target="_blank"><tt>06edee4</tt></a>.</li>
<li>Fixed issues with horizontal and legacy_layout.</li>
<li>Fixed amdgpu APU power and temperature reading.</li>
<li>Fixed certain hud elements displaying incorrectly in horizontal.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing segfault when using <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_CONFIG</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The issue with some elements not being in the right place with the horizontal layout was a little annoying, which I reported, so I'm really glad to see such a quick fix there so we can cram in more details. Here's a fresh example on the latest version on Fedora KDE with Everspace 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7407494031681817597gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7407494031681817597gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you're interested in this layout you can use this below, place it into your MangoHud configuration file. The main one can be found in: <code class="inline-code">~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>horizontal<br/>
legacy_layout=0<br/>
hud_no_margin<br/>

      <title>Iris and Sodium for Minecraft move to Modrinth away from CurseForge</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you use the popular <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/iris" target="_blank">Iris</a> and <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium" target="_blank">Sodium</a> mods for Minecraft? Well there's been a bit of an issue lately, so the developers have dropped support for CurseForge and fully moved over to Modrinth.</p>
<p>What are the mods? Sodium is a free and open-source rendering optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves frame rates and stuttering while fixing many graphical issues. While Iris is an open source shaders mod. Both rather well-known for Minecraft fans.</p>
<p>What's going on? Well, according to the official <a href="https://twitter.com/IrisShaders/status/1647359296584417280" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account for Iris, they explained they were having technical issues with CurseForge along with difficulty in actually uploading anything. Apparently the newer CurseForge is quite broken and according to the Iris team CurseForge are "prioritizing modpacks that rip off out mod's branding in search results" and their revenue from CurseForge has been declining "despite the fact that the number of downloads has been increasing month-over-month". In a later Twitter post, the Iris team <a href="https://twitter.com/IrisShaders/status/1647702711771725824" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that "Effective immediately, Iris and Sodium have been pulled by Overwolf for encouraging users to download from Modrinth and archiving files. Modpacks will be broken.".</p>
<p>So now they're recommending all users move over to <a href="https://modrinth.com/" target="_blank">Modrinth</a>, an open source mod hosting platform, that works directly with many popular Minecraft launchers like <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Prism</a> that work great. Here's a shot I took with Iris, Sodium and Complementary Shaders v4:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4455812901681749976gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4455812901681749976gol1.jpg"/></a>OOOoo pretty!</em></p>
<p>Seems like a messy situation, hopefully the move to Modrinth will go well. Modrinth overall seems like a good platform for Minecraft modding, putting the power more in the hands of everyone.</p>

      <title>Publisher of King under the Mountain backs out so it&#39;s re-releasing as Mountaincore</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>King under the Mountain was a pretty nice colony-building game from Rocket Jump Technology, and it was going through a huge upgrade. Sadly, their publisher cancelled on them so they're having to re-release as Mountaincore.</p>
<p>It's a bit of an odd one this. The developer went from working on it solo, to having a publisher come along to help fund further development allowing them to build a small team. The plan was to continue working solidly on it for 9 months, then do a brand new release under the publisher. Just as work was coming to an end the publisher backed away.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they've been allowed to just carry on, including with all the work funded by the publisher (who they won't name). So it's getting re-released anyway now independently as Mountaincore and all original owners will get the newer game too, so no one needs to re-buy anything. Sounds like a win-win for all involved.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S9XP3rGsGBs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20264c023daebedd90b4a257920d1d53.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S9XP3rGsGBs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Originally inspired clearly by Dwarf Fortress, it also mixes in elements from other games like The Settlers, Prison Architect and Dungeon Keeper with an aim to be more approachable. Some of the new features due to arrive in the updated and renamed release include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A completely redesigned UI - no more placeholder UI.</li>
<li>Skill levels so your settlers can develop over time.</li>
<li>Weapons, military management and a detailed combat system.</li>
<li>Monsters to deal with in the caverns of the mountains.</li>
<li>Invasions by hostile Orcs (other races to come soon).</li>
<li>Trading with merchants to plug the gaps in your industry.</li>
<li>Animations and general graphical improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2370310/Mountaincore/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It's due to release into Early Access on May 18th.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley set for another update in v1.6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the most popular games on Steam (and one of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/heres-the-top-steam-deck-games-for-march-2023/" target="_blank">most played Steam Deck games</a> too), Stardew Valley is coming back for another update in version 1.6.</p>
<p>The developer, Eric Barone who goes by Concerned Ape, mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1647638975568568320?cxt=HHwWgIDTjea6y90tAAAA" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: "There is going to be a Stardew 1.6 update. It's mostly changes for modders (which will make it easier &amp; more powerful to mod). But there is also new game content, albeit much less than 1.5. I'm taking a break from Haunted Chocolatier to work on this at the moment. Then back to HC".</p>
<p>Looking back on it, this was actually already announced back in February where it was mentioned at the bottom of the 7 year anniversary <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/413150/view/3644012366894749557" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam. Seems the scope has expanded a bit though to include new content, as only modding changes were mentioned previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5244091971681740201gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5244091971681740201gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The modding scene around Stardew Valley remains as popular as ever, with all kinds of mods big and small like the extensive <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/3753?tab=description" target="_blank">Stardew Valley Expanded</a>. Plenty of the modding scene is thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI" target="_blank">SMAPI</a>, an open source modding API for Stardew Valley.</p>
<p>You can buy a copy from <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/stardew_valley?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/stardew-valley?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p><em>Great to see it being supported for so long.</em></p>

      <title>MineClone2 v0.83 out now, the sandbox game for Minetest inspired by Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired might be pushing it a bit eh? MineClone2 as the name suggests really is a clone of early Minecraft, although this is free and open source powered by the Minetest game engine. A big new release is <a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?p=423766#p423766" target="_blank">out now</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/minetest-570-out-now-with-graphics-improvements-performance-upgrades/" target="_blank">recent Minetest upgrade</a>.</p>
<p>MineClone2 v0.83 "Safe and Sound" is full of new features and honestly it sounds really great. You will find new and updated music, new sound effects, biome coloured foliage and water, mobs can ride minecarts, hoppers can put items in minecarts, new and improved /clearmobs commands, Iron Golems now protect themselves and villagers, various performance improvements, improved translations, lots of bug fixes and the list goes on.</p>
<p>You can see their latest release video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="F-Lai53_Ry4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f05edd2f7dd886b2a4b06a112619509a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/F-Lai53_Ry4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see this great free and open source Minecraft alternative coming along so nicely.</p>
<p>You need <a href="https://www.minetest.net/" target="_blank">Minetest</a> to play it, and then you can download it via the in-game content downloader.</p>

      <title>Lueur blends city-building with survival from a former Ubisoft developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Darenn Keller previously worked on the likes of Assassin's Creed and Ghost Recon, but now they're going indie with their city-building survival game Lueur.</p>
<p>Inspired by their love of 4x and city builders, but specifically a free little game called <a href="https://poppants.itch.io/lost-settlers" target="_blank">Lost Settlers</a>. Lueur is a minimalist tile-based city-builder, where you discover more as you explore and go through it. Developed to be cozy while building, but just a little challenging with the survival aspects of it — all with really simple controls. A key point here is the length, most games will only be around 40 minutes or so. You also build across various different levels, each with their own story and challenges to overcome.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19918943791681728711gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19918943791681728711gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The tiles have little mini-games inside them too, so you'll play a tiny arcade game to do various things. It sounds so thoroughly unique I feel like I have to play it. A fun fact for you here: not only will it support Linux, the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/DarennKeller/status/1644344494194675713" target="_blank">told me</a> they're creating it on Manjaro too and they're using <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>.</p>
<p>There's also different modes available depending on your preference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Settlers: A cozy and relaxing experience. You are not completely safe, but you'll have time to experiment, learn and build your beautiful city. </li>
<li>Survivors: It's gonna be a real challenge to survive. Your choices matters and time is of the essence. </li>
<li>Deity: A fast-paced unforgiving experience very close to an RTS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer gives a fun overview of what to expect below and it seems full of surprises:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xCB-JrcixkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d3d44738be07ae9ffa7ffc1239181d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xCB-JrcixkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I'm very keen to give this a go, it looks great!</p>
<p>You can wishlist / follow <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308630/Lueur/" target="_blank">directly on Steam</a>.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One I missed recently that you should check out: Black Reliquary is a free total conversion mod for the original Darkest Dungeon, and it's available now with a whole lot of content to play through. While it's completely free, it will need you to own the full game of course but it also needs the The Shieldbreaker DLC, and the Crimson Court DLC since it pulls features from them.</p>
<p>More about it: "Black Reliquary is a complete overhaul mod for Darkest Dungeon that harnesses the original systems whilst building upon, refining, or transforming nearly every single aspect of them. This mod features an entire new story and campaign in an exotic new desert locale, with fully voiced narration and an original soundtrack. Venture into The Valley, reach the Black Reliquary, and reveal its ancient secrets."</p>

      <title>Try out a free prologue of Shogun Showdown right now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Shogun Showdown: Prologue is a demo of the upcoming turn-based combat game with rogue-like and deck-building elements. It will have full Native Linux support at release, with a version available in the Prologue now too. From Goblinz Publishing, Gamera Games and Roboatino, the Prologue has so far been gathering some rather positive user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>For those of you who like repeatable games, it looks like a fun concept where positioning really counts during combat and you'll unlock plenty more as you go through it. Another game where you get that tasty "just one more run" feeling, before you realise it's 1AM and you really should be going to sleep.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="rZHtTQP5FR8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5347de93467a071193999afa94067311.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/rZHtTQP5FR8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available in the Prologue:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Play The Wanderer: a lone warrior haunted by her past who travels the land seeking redemption through battle.</li>
<li>3 combat locations: The Bamboo Grove, The Waterfall Caves and The Port City.</li>
<li>14 attack tiles.</li>
<li>8 quests and 2 challenges.</li>
<li>10+ skills.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Last of Us has more Steam Deck improvements and lots of other fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fires continue to be put out by Naughty Dog and Iron Galaxy as they fix up The Last of Us, with a new patch landing with lots of fixes.</p>
<p>Available in v1.0.3 are these <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1888930/view/3730711090586078092" target="_blank">changes</a> just for the Steam Deck:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the native UI overlapped the ‘Look’ prompt.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the DualSense™ motion sensor function may not register the player shaking the camera to fix the flashlight when prompted.</li>
<li>[Left Behind] Increased the size of the Arcade’s mini-game button user interface.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Performance hasn't really been fixed up yet for Steam Deck, with it still pretty messy in lots of places and it's currently rated as Unsupported by Valve through Deck Verified. As Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann said <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_Druckmann/status/1643305179901739008" target="_blank">previously</a> "Getting VERIFIED isn’t a priority. Optimization &amp; stability (on the Steam Deck &amp; other pc platforms) is!".</p>
<p>So eventually, once it's had more optimizations and fixes across the whole game, it might eventually be a reasonable experience on Steam Deck. At least on desktop Linux last I checked it worked reasonably well and this patch does include numerous crash bug fixes, texture problems and lots of other fixes.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-last-of-us-part-i?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1888930/The_Last_of_Us_Part_I/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>MangoHud performance overlay version v0.6.9 is out now as a nice update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a while since the last release but a nice update to the performance hud and benchmarking tool MangoHud is out now. This is the tool used for the performance stats on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Something I'm a big fan of, because I use it plenty on desktop Linux too, it's one of the most useful open source projects for gaming. An example of a pretty basic layout for performance:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14976972521681555066gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Version 0.6.9 brings these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for it8603 sensor</li>
<li>Conform to <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VkDeviceCreateInfo.html" target="_blank">VUID-VkDeviceCreateInfo-pNext-00373</a></li>
<li>Add GalaxyClient, RedLauncher, Amazon Games and gamescope to blacklist</li>
<li>Add Artix and Nobara to build.sh</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a crash when using zink, and certain games using DXVK e.g. FarCry 3/4</li>
<li>Fixed reporting amdgpu clock speed</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with <code class="inline-code">exec</code> causing certain games to crash</li>
<li>Fixed incorrect metrics for ryzen 7000 series iGPUs</li>
<li>Fixed discovery of wine binary when using wine64 build</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also the addition of additional options to further tweak the experience how you want it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">exec_name</code> - Display current exec name.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">hud_compact</code> - Display compact version of MangoHud.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">hud_no_margin</code> - Remove margins around MangoHud.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">horizontal</code> - Display Mangohud in a horizontal position.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">toggle_hud_position</code> Toggle MangoHud postion. Default is R_Shift + F11</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">fps_limit_method</code> If FPS limiter should wait before or after presenting a frame. Choose <code class="inline-code">late</code> (default) for the lowest latency or <code class="inline-code">early</code> for the smoothest frametimes.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">picmip</code> Mip-map LoD bias. Negative values will increase texture sharpness (and aliasing). Positive values will increase texture blurriness (-16 to 16)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">af</code> Anisotropic filtering level. Improves sharpness of textures viewed at an angle (0 to 16)</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">bicubic</code> Force bicubic filtering</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">trilinear</code> Force trilinear filtering</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">retro</code> Disables linear texture filtering. Makes textures look blocky</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">position</code> new option: <code class="inline-code">bottom_center</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An example of a nice clean horizontal layout I tested today with Everspace 2:</p>
