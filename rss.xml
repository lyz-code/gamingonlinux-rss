      <title>Mining sandbox adventure Core Keeper gets its first major post-release update on March 10</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Core Keeper from developer Pugstorm has a fresh major content upgrade coming, the first post-release update and it's going to release really soon on March 10. The 'Bags &amp; Blasts' update will bring a whole new sub-biome, a brand new skill tree and one of "Core Keeper's biggest bosses yet".</p>
<p>Check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="C0WfnRSzUlM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f974b2e675f3dd8130c76c15eff6c1e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/C0WfnRSzUlM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Core Keeper: Bags &amp; Blasts Update – Key Features:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<li><strong>Supersized Boss Fight –</strong> Take on Nimruza, Queen of the Burrowed Sands, in this colossal fight against a supersized insect. Tackle Nimruza alone or buddy up with friends online in one of <em>Core Keeper’s</em> biggest boss fights yet.</li>

      <title>Trailmakers 2.0: Pioneers is out now and it&#39;s like a whole new game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trailmakers has managed to pull in a lot of happy players since the original 2019 full release, and the developers at Flashbulb have been busy building up the massive free update with Trailmakers 2.0: Pioneers that's out now. <em>Note: my key was originally provided by their PR team.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jIPBtURAWxU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2bbf95c845d821dd54623523936ef8d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jIPBtURAWxU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Just to remove any doubt right away if you're excited to jump in — the game works great on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p>It's currently rated Steam Deck Playable, due to Valve noting it requires manually bringing up the on-screen keyboard. In my testing, that was still the case with this update. Not a big deal though, but it would be good if the developer fixed that and it's not an issue on Desktop Linux of course. For the Steam Deck, I would suggest tweaking the graphics settings down just one level with the default being "Pretty but Slow" down to "Middle Road", as it just helps it keep more at 30FPS to make it smoother.</p>
<p>What we've been given with this update is practically a whole new game. It's a huge update, and quite surprising to see it be released free for all existing players as a plain update. While all the sandbox stuff is still there, it's a lot easier to get into now thanks to the brand new cinematic intro, new tutorial and a full campaign mode to play through.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Trailmakers: Pioneers </strong><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign Mode: </strong>On Planet Gregory, craft blocks and build vehicles to protect the Froggit inhabitants from the evil BOTNAK robots, complete missions, and upgrade settlements.</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>“Our players have shaped Trailmakers since its release in 2018, constantly pushing the boundaries of creativity and making vehicles that amaze us at every turn. Pioneers expands the breadth of possibilities, deepens exploration, and challenges players to build and survive like never before,” said Flashbulb Games Co-Founder Ole Teglbjærg. “Pioneers is a major step forward, but the future of Trailmakers is even brighter. Player creativity has always been at the heart of our game, and their feedback continues to shape what’s next.”</p>
<p>They also shared a roadmap of more to come:</p>

<p>If you enjoy games where you get to explore and be creative, this is definitely one to go and grab. You can get lost in it for so many hours as time just fades away.</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH gets a smaller download on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix have updated FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH and they've managed to cut down the download size for the Steam Deck and by quite a bit too.</p>
<p>Version 1.003 was released today, March 6th with these notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved overall game stability, including several bug fixes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the application sometimes crashes while playing the game on a PC using certain AMD Radeon products.</li>
<li>Reduced the package size when downloading on Steam Deck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Comparing a fresh download between my Steam Deck and Desktop Linux, the Steam Deck download for it is now 88.1GB whereas on Desktop it's showing as 144.2GB. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2599237011741273177gol1.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Developers can actually set up a special Steam Deck only content depot on Steam which they could use to put in smaller texture packs, smaller movies and so on (as just two basic examples). <em>Not many developers actually do this. </em></p>
<p>Nice to see our favourite handheld get the update treatment from major studios, especially making it easier to actually get the game downloaded saving a whole lot of time and bandwidth for people.</p>

      <title>THE FINALS broken on Linux / Steam Deck (yes again) with Update 5.12.0 </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A reoccurring theme here with THE FINALS from Embark Studios is that it appears to break on Linux / Steam Deck each major upgrade, and it has happened again with the launch of Update 5.12.0.</p>
<p>It's not clear yet what's happening, but it could be anti-cheat related. Their update notes did mention a tweak to their anti-cheat, but it may also be unrelated since this situation has happened before multiple times and then fixed by Valve in a Proton update.</p>
<p>For me, when I go to launch it gets to the Easy Anti-Cheat loading screen and then quits with this error box:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5500218841741272607gol1.png"/></p>
<p>There's already replied noting this on the Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7317" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub ticket</a>. Hopefully Valve's Proton developers can take a look soon, and we may see a Proton Hotfix update like we've seen in the past.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 gets a fix for Linux / Steam Deck being detected as cheating</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Grinding Gear Games are showing clear support for Linux / Steam Deck with Path of Exile 2, ensuring it continues working properly.</p>
<p>Ahead of the huge Content Update 0.2.0 coming that they keep teasing, it seems a recent smaller patch to the game caused problems. Playing on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton would throw up a pretty alarming warning, noting how they'll only tell you once about using cheating software and continued use would terminate your account.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it was a false alarm. The developer released 0.1.1f Hotfix today that <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3732353" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a>: "Fixed Steam Deck and other Wine-based clients being incorrectly warned for modifying the client."</p>
<p>Great to see continued and prompt support on issues like this.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Eric Engestrom announced the released of Mesa 25.0.1, the first bug-fix release for the Mesa 25.0 series. It should hopefully now be safe enough for you to upgrade from the previous major Mesa release.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Zink: Kopper’s present thread causes Wayland protocol races.</li>
<li>GLmatrix needs aligned malloc.</li>

<li>radv/sqtt: assertion “layout transition marker should be only emitted inside a barrier marker”.</li>
<li>[radv] Glitchy ground geometry regression in Total War Warhammer III on RX 7600.</li>
</ul>

      <title>11 bit studios working on getting Frostpunk 2 up to Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>11 bit studios latest game Frostpunk 2 was recently rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve, with the developer noting they are working towards getting it bumped up to Verified.</p>
<p>Writing in a post on Steam the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455087556" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re glad to inform that Frostpunk 2 is playable on Steam Deck!<br/>
<br/>
The Story Mode is fully stable and playable, with solid performance. Thanks to your feedback, we’re aware that Utopia Builder mode has some UI issues, and late-game saves might take longer to load.<br/>
<br/>
We're working on further performances and an official control layout fixes to earn the Steam Deck Verified badge ✅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see another developer keen to improve their game.</p>

<p>More about it: "Frostpunk 2 elevates the city-survival genre to a new level. Take the role of a Steward and lead your city through a cascade of calamities taking place in a postapocalyptic, snowy setting. Build large city districts with their string of endless needs and demands. Navigate through conflicting interests of factions that populate your metropolis. As the needs of the city grow and factional power at its core rises, only you can steer the society towards an uncertain future."</p>
<p>The developer also updated their roadmap recently to note on May 8th a free major content update will arrive, along with the Spectrum DLC sometime in August.</p>

      <title>FINAL FANTASY XVI removed Denuvo Anti-tamper</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Square Enix released a fresh small update to FINAL FANTASY XVI on March 4th, noting a couple of minor fixes but it appears they also removed Denuvo Anti-tamper. The game originally launched on Steam on September 17, 2024.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2515020/view/520831973411782758" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> only notes these two changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphics not displaying properly on certain screens.</li>
<li>Textual errors in select languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2515020/history/?changeid=U:58860670" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> picked up that Denuvo was also removed and it's no longer listed on the Steam page.</p>
<p>So if you stick to skipping over titles with Denuvo, it may be time to give it a try. This change also means it will no longer have problems with you switching Proton versions on Linux / Steam Deck, which can end up causing you to be locked out for 24 hours.</p>

      <title>Humble Choice for March 2025 has Pacific Drive</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Humble Bundle have released <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/membership" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Humble Choice for March 2025</a> and it has Pacific Drive, making it a good deal even just for that one game.</p>
<p>This bundle isn't getting a good reception from subscribers though for two reasons. The first being that two of the headline games in this bundle have a below 50% review score on Steam (Homeworld 3 and Wild Hearts). That and there's <em>two</em> EA / Origin keys this time, which has caused mass complaints across Reddit and other social media (people really prefer their Steam keys), which also makes them more of a pain to claim and play on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Aside from that when you consider the lowest price of Pacific Drive on Steam being £14.99, with the Humble Choice bundle being £8.99, it's a good price even if you only want that. And Pacific Drive is a fantastic game.</p>
<p>Here's all that's included in it this month:</p>

      <title>Tony Hawk&#39;s Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake launches in July</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Galaxy Studios and Activision have revealed that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake is real and it's going to release on July 11. This time around it will not be Epic Games Store exclusive, and appears to be entirely skipping the Epic store. <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 was Epic Exclusive for multiple years.</em></p>
<p>With Iron Galaxy Studios at the helm this time, it will be interesting to see what they can do with it. They've been co-developers on the likes of UNCHARTED: Legacy of Thieves Collection and The Last of Us Part I. A few original games too like Killer Instinct and Extinction.</p>
<p>Check out the reveal trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D-PedsiljOc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/64a1dc67661b87b109e027da16673864.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D-PedsiljOc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They're also offering a Digital Deluxe Edition, which gives you 3 days early access (although they haven't correctly added it as Advanced Access on Steam yet), the Doom Slayer and The Revenant as playable skaters, additional songs for the in-game soundtrack and more.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1hGDSTGCTso"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/41190fd5aa4f39f05ed307205ac7ddf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1hGDSTGCTso" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Main Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Reunite the crew with cross-platform online Multiplayer for up to 8 skaters in new and returning game modes.</li>
<li>Drop in to new parks or tear it up across the timeless parks from both Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 3 &amp; Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 4, authentically remade in jaw dropping 4K resolution with streamlined goals and the epic 2-minute format.</li>
<li>Hit ‘em with some drip in the expanded Create-A-Skater and Create-A-Park modes, including the ability to create custom goals to share with friends for the first time ever.</li>
<li>Shred harder than ever with more challenging goals and an enhanced New Game+ mode.</li>
<li>Whether you’re a total casual or a grungy pro, the same smooth handling and simple-to-learn controls from Tony Hawk’s™ Pro Skater™ 1 + 2 will have you shredding like a Pro.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The online multiplayer requires an Activision Account. </em></p>
<p>If you pre-purchase you will also get access to the "Foundry Demo" in June that lets you play "two playable skaters, two parks, and a selection of songs". So basically, you get a demo if you pre-order any edition of the game.</p>

      <title>Absolum is a beat &#39;em up RPG from the makers of Streets of Rage 4 and TMNT Shredder&#39;s Revenge </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Pulling together the teams behind hits like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge and Streets of Rage 4, today we have an exciting reveal of Absolum. It's an all-new fantasy "rogue 'em up" from Dotemu and Guard Crush, with animation from Supamonks.</p>
<p>Considering both of the aforementioned games were reviewed so well, clearly their teams know what they're doing when it comes to the classic beat 'em up style. This is the first properly original game being co-developed by Dotemu, so one to watch for sure.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="YvI172bkKDk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/71e2702709b2fb5bb38a5ad47b748031.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/YvI172bkKDk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Absolum is Dotemu's boldest creation yet, standing as our first original IP and a crucial new venture for the future of Dotemu," said Cyrille Imbert, CEO of Dotemu. "Absolum builds on knowledge gained from our previous beat ‘em up collaboration with Guard Crush Games and our publishing work on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, as well as a lifelong passion we share with Guard Crush Games for classic and modern beat 'em up titles. Our ultimate goal is to fundamentally evolve the genre’s potential in a way that’s unique from the traditional brawlers we’ve all come to love, and I knew the team was well suited to accomplish this from the first time I played Absolum."</p>
<p>More from the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After revitalizing the beat ‘em up genre with acclaimed titles, beat ‘em up experts Dotemu and Guard Crush Games teamed up with the incredible animators and artists from Supamonks to master a rogue 'em up subgenre in Absolum. The vision for Absolum is twofold: thrilling arcade beat ‘em up action akin to Dotemu and Guard Crush Games’ previous collaboration is at the heart of Absolum, with intricate, refined combat offering a rewarding level of depth; equally important is Absolum’s innovation of brawler design conventions, resulting in maximized approachability and replayability. Unlock items, quests and permanent warrior upgrades while mixing character skill combinations, exploring Absolum’s depth of combat in runs steeped in variety, excitement and challenge.</p>
<p>With branching pathways to explore, quests to discover, intriguing characters to encounter, and a deep variety of challenging bosses in store, Absolum’s gripping fantasy tale unravels a challenging adventure and channels the spirit of classic brawlers like Golden Axe and Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara. The entirety of Absolum’s journey is playable solo or in two-player local and online co-op.</p>
<p>Fight as one of four different rebels, each with their own unique skill set, personality and motivations, navigating through the original fantasy world of Talamh, a mysterious land filled with wonder and twisted cosmic horrors. Absolum’s announcement trailer introduced two of its distinctly formidable playable warriors: Galandra, an agile, sword-clad fighter suited for close-quarters combat; and Karl, a tanklike dwarf commanding devastating punches as well as a rifle to foil foes from a distance.</p>
<p>Absolum features an engaging narrative with themes of foiling an unbridled, dictatorial power and cheating Death itself. In the world of Talamh, a cataclysmic event caused by magic prompts the Sun King Azra to conquer all lands and sources of magic through brutal warfare, slaughtering any wizard unwilling to serve him. Talamh’s hope now lies with a defiant band of rebels aided by a mysterious, mythical mentor known as Uchawi and the similarly powerful Root Sisters, who together oppose Azra’s pursuit of total power by wielding an ancient, forbidden magic. These mythical forces empower our rebels with astonishing magic as they stoke a resistance, fight Azra's iron grip on Talamh, and discover the secret behind Azra’s ever-growing dominion.</p>

<p>Definitely one to watch! We don't yet know exactly what platforms will be supported.</p>

      <title>Studio Fizbin will be closing after releasing Reignbreaker</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another developer closing up due to a tough industry. Studio Fizbin have announced they will be shutting after releasing Reignbreaker which arrives this month. Posted in an <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on their website from Alexander "Pepe" Pieper, this follows their studio being in the industry for 14 years.</p>
<p>Studio Fizbin were responsible for developing The Inner World, The Inner World - The Last Wind Monk, Say No! More, Minute Of Islands and the upcoming Reignbreaker.</p>
<p>Their announcement can be found below in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Studio Fizbin's Last Magic Trick: “Reignbreaker” </strong></p>
<p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>The name of our studio comes from a fabled magic trick, because game development often feels like an impossible feat of conjuration. But every magic show has an end, and after 14 years of giving it our all, Studio Fizbin will be winding down operations this spring after releasing <em>Reignbreaker.</em></p>
<p>The games industry is in a tough situation right now, and we’ve been affected like countless other incredible studios in recent months. Our parent company Thunderful made the decision to drastically reduce internal development in November 2024 (<a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LINK</a>), which, as Thunderful’s CEO Martin communicated in the latest quarterly report (<a href="https://www.redeye.se/events/1067750/live-q-thunderful-group-3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LINK</a>), also affected Studio Fizbin. Since then, we’ve been exploring various opportunities to work on after finishing <em>Reignbreaker</em>. Unfortunately, none of these projects will move forward, leading us to make this difficult decision.</p>
<p>This means that <em>Reignbreaker </em>will be Studio Fizbin’s final game. We believe it's going to be the best game we’ve ever released, and our amazing team will be working hard to launch it on the 18th of March as well as providing post-launch support. In our remaining time, our focus lies on two objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping the best game possible after two and a half years of hard work</li>
<li>Supporting our exceptionally talented team in finding new opportunities in the industry</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to support us, please spread the word about <em>Reignbreaker</em> and play the demo (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3384770/Reignbreaker_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">LINK</a>), and support our team by reaching out to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dbb3b2a9b2b5bc9ba8afaebfb2b4f6bdb2a1b9b2b5f5bfbe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a5cdccd7cccbc2e5d6d1d0c1ccca88c3ccdfc7cccb8bc1c0">[email protected]</span></a> if you’re looking for amazing talent in a wide range of disciplines.</p>
<p>We want to thank every single one of our fans for your purchases, your fan art, your comments, your reviews, your passion, and your seemingly endless support.</p>
<p>We also would like to thank all our business partners, Medienboard, the MfG, Creative Europe, and the federal funding partners for all their support.</p>
<p>And finally, we’d like to give the biggest thanks to our team – those who are here until the end, and the many others who have found a different path on the way. Fizbin and its games are defined by its team members, and you all made this the most inspiring place to perform the world’s most difficult magic trick: making games.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Alexander “Pepe” Pieper</p>

      <title>Acclaim Entertainment returns to &#39;support indie developers and reignite classic franchises&#39;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another old name has returned. Acclaim Entertainment that was originally founded in 1987 has relaunched, with a plan to bring back some classic games as well as new indie games.</p>
<p>They're a name I've not heard of in a long time, after filing for bankruptcy in 2004. They were previously involved with titles like Burnout, Mortal Kombat, Alien Trilogy, Turok and NBA Jam. It will be interesting to see what classics they bring back, as well as what indie developers they will pick to fund. The industry is having a tough time right now, so hopefully this opens up some opportunities for more developers.</p>
<p>According to the press release the leadership and board "spans the entertainment industry—licensing icons, professional athletes, living music legends and seasoned veterans". One such name is wrestler Jeff Jarrett: "For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the ‘80s and ‘90s," said Jarrett. "From my early involvement with the publisher’s hit 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>They've also pulled in industry veteran Alex Josef to lead as CEO, who has worked in various places across the industry, including previously leading Graffiti Games: "It’s an absolute honor and pleasure to be leading the charge in bringing Acclaim back to the forefront of the games industry," said Josef, "We’re fortunate that we have an extremely talented team and that we’ve already signed some incredible indie titles, which we’ll be revealing soon."</p>

      <title>Inspired by classic 90s animation Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon has a new trailer you need to see</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OutOfTheBit have put up a brand new trailer for their action-platformer that's inspired by the style of 90s animations. Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon is looking really good! <em>The developer previously made the positively received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1859580/Full_Void/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Full Void</a>.</em></p>
<p>Be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/interview-with-outofthebit-on-their-cinematic-platformer-nanuka-secret-of-the-shattering-moon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my previous interview with the developer</a> for some more background on the game, their inspiration and plans for it. I was already pretty excited for this one, and this trailer has absolutely sold me on the design of it. The world looks wonderful, the action looks pretty intense and I just love the presentation here. </p>
<p>Check it out below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_-zerAtFGqY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9f9f451f95dcae609db7da919b498d73.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_-zerAtFGqY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nanuka will take players on an adventurous expedition through diverse regions, each with its own distinct environmental and architectural influences. Along the way, numerous enemies will endeavor to block your path and fellow allies will come to your aid as the mystery and secrets behind the planet’s moon begin to unravel.</p>
<p>Inspired by the Sicilian landscape, the journey begins on an island that, while initially portrayed as peaceful and picturesque, soon reveals a tale of magical abilities and a looming disaster that players must strive to avert. As the adventure and story progresses, the importance and acceptance of diverse races and beliefs will shine through preciously.</p>

      <title>Monster Prom 4: Monster Con now has a demo live on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Developer Beautiful Glitch has put up a brand new demo of Monster Prom 4: Monster Con, so you can give it a try early and see what's new in this upcoming dating sim with a whole new setting.</p>
<p>Just as crazy as previous games but unlike Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip, which focused on the adventure, Monster Prom 4 returns  more to the series dating roots. This multiplayer narrative adventure is set at a Monster Con, which is a "massive convention filled with video games, comic books, anime… and more than a few paranormal activities".</p>
<p>The developers suggested that a new trailer may come sometime soon, and they're aiming for a release sometime in the "Spring". Original reveal trailer below:</p>

<p>From the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What can you expect to find at the Monster Con?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The signature style of the Monster Prom franchise: unique, charming characters and irreverent humor</li>
<li>New mechanics! During the Con, you’ll get a chance to build your own comic book that you'll get to see by the end of the run.</li>
<li>Intimate conversations to get to know your favorite characters.</li>
<li>TONS of beautiful art!</li>
<li>You can play with friends via local and online multiplayer!</li>
<li>Compete for the heart of a character! If you share your romantic tastes with your friends, be ready for some stiff competition.</li>
<li>There's a sexy clown. Honk!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 gets an Easy Anti-Cheat upgrade - finally works properly on Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 from developer Fatshark just got an upgrade for Easy Anti-Cheat, and this finally makes online play work properly on Linux. The developers have moved from the old-style EAC to the newer version supplied by Epic Online Services.</p>
<p>Before this update if you were playing on Linux with Proton, you would have to host the game to play with friends, otherwise it would crash quite quickly. Now that appears to no longer be a problem, although the developers aren't directly supporting it.</p>
<p>There's still one problem though! The default stable version of the game fails to launch on Linux due to the launcher, so you have to opt into the "Bypass Launcher" Beta on Steam.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13497731581741096337gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13497731581741096337gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>After that, you'll then get launch options when you go to play the game. Select Bypass Launcher.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16462169161741096630gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16462169161741096630gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The game will then load up correctly. I've personally tested it working perfectly online joining others with Proton 9.0-4.</p>
<p>From their Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/552500/view/546728306451416317" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve just pushed a patch that swaps our old version of Easy Anti-Cheat for the newest version. The previous version is scheduled to shut down on March 4, which would’ve meant no protection to the game from cheats or tampering unless we did this upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things to note about this change:</p>
<ul>
<li>For normal gameplay, <strong>there should be no notable difference.</strong> The game will continue to run normally in both Official and Modded realms, and no extra actions need to be taken from you as players to continue playing.</li>
<li>Operating Systems that had incompatibility issues with our EAC may find those issues gone with this update. We still can only officially support Windows 10 &amp; 11, but nonetheless there might be one barrier less in that aspect.</li>
<li>The system necessary to support Sanctioned Mods is changing. This means that <strong>until sanctioned mods are updated by their authors, they might not work in the official realm.</strong>
<ul>
<li>We are currently in communication with mod authors to find the swiftest solution to this issue for all sanctioned mods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connecting to other lobbies might take longer than usual at first. Will go back to normal after some time.</li>
<li><strong>Versus Quickplay will be temporarily disabled</strong> as we update the servers.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
We're working to fix the issues with Sanctioned Mods and Versus Quickplay Dedicated Servers as soon as possible, we'll keep you updated.
<blockquote>
<p>Hotfix 6.3.4 patch notes - 3rd of March</p>
<p>Features &amp; Tweaks</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the Kamu Easy Anti-Cheat for Epic Online Service</li>
<li>Improved error messaging for banned players to show reason &amp; duration.</li>
<li>Temporarily disabled Versus Quickplay / Dedicated Servers.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Really nice to see.</p>
<p>I've updated our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated anti-cheat compatibility page</a> to note the change in the status. Along with this I've added support for us to add a comment to each game on the page, like in this case where it needs the Beta as noted above.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While EA have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/ea-just-open-sourced-command-conquer-red-alert-renegade-and-generals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">officially open sourced a bunch of classic Command &amp; Conquer</a> titles like Red Alert and Generals, the cross-platform OpenRA project continues advancing with a new release out now.</p>
<p>OpenRA is a free and open source RTS game engine that supports playing Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Dune 2000 with online play and lots of enhancements. You can also make entirely new RTS games with it.</p>
<p>OpenRA release 202500303 includes a much revamped Map Editor that includes new features like draggable selections, draggable actors, measurement tools, a marker layer, a play button, a delete area button and more. Making it easier than ever to craft some epic maps to battle on. OpenRA also now supports post-processing effects out of the box!</p>

<em>Pictured - Red Alert in OpenRA</em></p>
<p>Another major improvement is significantly improved support for HD art assets from the C&amp;C Remastered Collection for Tiberian Dawn. With faster starting times and improved performance but it's still a separate download for now.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.4 is out now with Jolt Physics, Ubershaders, Interactive in-game editing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Godot Engine 4.4 has been released bringing with it a plethora of advancements for game devs, so it might be time to give it another look.</p>
<p>From the update page: "Look forward to plenty of quality of life improvements hidden within this release. Faster load speeds, reduced stutter, streamlined processes — spotting all the optimizations that have been applied in the background will take some time. On top of that, long-awaited comfort features like embedded game windows and interactive in-game editing will feel more in line with other software on the market, making transitioning between them an even smoother experience. The editor overhaul alone takes up a big chunk of this release, after all."</p>

      <title>Scarlet Hollow - The Roads Untraveled update out now, first episode free in the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scarlet Hollow is an award-winning gothic horror narrative adventure developed by Black Tabby Games (who also made Slay the Princess). Now it's better than ever with a soft relaunch with The Roads Untraveled update out now.</p>
<p>The relaunch comes as part of the Steam Visual Novel Fest that also launches today on Steam. The demo currently available features the entire first episode with progress carrying over to the full game. Plus, the full game is 25% off if you decide you want more.</p>
<p>In this big upgrade to the game you can expect to find an expanded script of more than 70,000 words from Abby Howard and Tony Howard-Arias across four episodes. As they said in the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved player agency in the first two episodes of the game.</strong> Over <em><u><strong>70,000 words</strong></u></em> of new story content in Episodes 1 and 2 to explore previously unseen paths. What happens if you don't venture into the woods in Episode 1? What happens if you do your best to stay out of any and all danger at the start of Episode 2?</li>
<li><strong>A user interface and visual overhaul.</strong> That means a bigger textbox to see more options at once, and it means more immersive UI elements. Please note that while the new textbox has a little more transparency than the old one, if you'd like to remove that transparency, there's a toggle in preferences if you'd prefer the older, more opaque style (high contrast textbox).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a new trailer to go along with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="pjBop46lTn8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/919a9171ea1c9d3e8646716f32133801.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/pjBop46lTn8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“We’re still hard at work on chapter five and beyond, but we didn’t want to wait to make significant changes and improvements to the Scarlet Hollow experience,” says Tony Howard-Arias, co-founder of Black Tabby Games. “Try the first chapter for free – and see what dangers await.”</p>
<p>It has Native Linux support and is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Secret Mode splits from Sumo Group (Tencent) to be an independent publisher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Secret Mode is a name some of you may know from publishing titles like Wobbledogs, Still Wakes the Deep, Eternal Threads and more have announced a split from Sumo Group (Tencent).</p>
<p>In their announcement they said they're going to be an "independent publisher, focused on supporting indie PC and console games". The buyout from Sumo was helped by Emona Capital, an investment firm that already has the likes of Relic Entertainment and Blackbird Interactive under their wing, with this being Emona Capital's first investment into game publishing. Emona Capital partnered with Ed Blincoe (VP Publishing) and James Schall (Co-Founder) of Secret Mode to lead the buyout.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5517820011741014944gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>James Schall at Secret Mode said: “By becoming independent, we can now put all our efforts into uncovering the indie gems that gamers never knew they needed in their lives. We are committed to bringing our players the very best indie titles; not just of the future, but also by helping them discover existing indie masterpieces that have undeservedly flown under the radar in years gone by. We are working hard to empower independent developers across the globe, and hope to make some exciting announcements on this front in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Dominik Dolenec, Managing Partner at Emona Capital said: “Secret Mode has made great waves in its formative years as a publisher of independent games. We look forward to supporting Secret Mode’s mission within the independent games sector across PC and consoles.”</p>

<p>I actually picked up Still Wakes the Deep that Secret Mode published a while back but have yet to play it. Was a nice reminder today that I <em>really</em> should get to it.</p>

      <title>The MechLock wall mount for Steam Deck looks ridiculously slick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want to mount your Steam Deck to a wall, you could do so with something like the Deckmate but the MechLock looks far slicker with the super-smooth locking system where you can add a charger. I have no need for it, but I definitely want it just purely based on how cool it looks.</p>
<p>This just makes me wish Steam Deck had a bottom USB-C port, so you could dock it in one smooth motion like you do with the Nintendo Switch. But hey, attach a USB hub to this and you might be able to do something similar. As I type this out, I really feel like I need to try it. Check out their quick video below:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8234236171741013405gol1.mp4"></video>
</div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>MechLock, credit: DesignMakeShip</em></p>
<p>From their Etsy page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>𝖬𝖾𝖼𝗁𝖫𝗈𝖼𝗄 stands for "mechanical locking". This unique design uses a gearing system to secure the SteamDeck in the mount as well as ensure the USB-C charging cable is engaged. The gearbox has a gearing ratio between the upper and lower rack that causes the upper rack to move faster than the lower rack. As the lower rack moves down the upper rack engages with the top of the SteamDeck securing the system in place.</p>
<p>𝒕𝒍;𝒅𝒓: Your SteamDeck will be secured at top and bottom by its own weight.</p>
<p>This mount also offers the ability to add your own charging cable so that you can dock and charge your SteamDeck in one smooth motion. No more free hanging cables!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a few different versions available depending on what you want. One that will fit a standard Steam Deck, and then different tweaked versions for those of you that keep it in a case like JSAUX or dbrand and others. You can customize the logo colour on it too.</p>
<p>Personally, I just think it's neat.</p>
<p>You can check it out on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1790825219/steamdeck-mechlock-wall-mount-with" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">their Etsy page</a>.</p>

      <title>Bored? Check out the Museum of All Things and dive into Wikipedia in 3D</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a really clever idea. The Museum of All Things is a free to download experience made in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> that allows you to explore various subjects pulled from Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons data.</p>
<p>It's a living museum of knowledge you can run on Linux, macOS and Windows. You walk around and pick a subject, and then it will generate a room full of things to read and look at. A really clever idea to get more people interested in learning. The developer said they were "Deeply inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jR0vRuZkxdw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">educational videos</a> that I watched as a kid, and the liminal spaces produced by early CGI, I want to recapture the promise that the internet can be a place of endless learning and exploration".</p>

<p>The Godot team even <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/museum-of-all-things/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">did an interview</a> with the developer recently. While it's had the 1.0 release, the developer isn't done with it. On the <a href="https://may.as/moat/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a> they talked about some future plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the Museum of All Things version 1.0 is released, I plan on continuing to update and improve it in the future. Some features which I would like to add in the future include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiplayer support</li>
<li>Greater variety in room theming and layouts</li>
<li>Support for more media types, like audio and 3d models</li>
<li>Support for Wikipedia languages aside from English</li>
</ul>

      <title>R.E.P.O. is a new co-op horror game with silly physics currently exploding on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a Steam image of a stupid smiley face that made me initially ignore it when seeing it (the kind I would expect from some basic cheapo game), R.E.P.O. is actually pretty darn amusing and it's rocketing up the charts on Steam.</p>
<p>It runs out of the box on Linux with the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>. It also works on Steam Deck but you'll need to change the controls in Steam Input (there's no proper controller support yet). If you enjoy games like Lethal Company, you'll probably quite like this one too. <em>Hopefully it will have a longer life than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/horror-scavenging-game-kletka-is-like-lethal-company-but-an-elevator-wants-to-eat-you/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KLETKA</a> though.</em></p>
<p>Here you and up to 5 friends (6 total players) can run around together collecting valuables in various dark locations. It's a lot more on the <em>silly</em> side compared to Lethal Company and various other similarly styled co-op horror games that have appeared.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O. is all about the <em>physics</em> with you needing to be careful not to break your acquired valuables, or reduce their worth by smacking them into everything, especially when you're running for your life and hiding. I've lost count of the amount of loot I'm smashed to pieces. <em>The characters are all pretty stupid looking too…</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19502734681740998093gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19502734681740998093gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - R.E.P.O on Linux</em></p>
<p>You have a little beam you shoot out to interact with everything from doors to valuable loot. Using this you'll fill up a special cart you'll be pushing around, to eventually push it into an extraction point to complete the level and earn some monies. A job that's easier said than done, as there's a lot of strange stuff going on that will make you jump, run for your life and maybe even let out a little squeal.</p>
<p>I'll admit seeing a bunch of little gnomes for the first time was creepy as hell, and when I realised they were moving and then they all suddenly turned to me and chased me — I did let out a little "aah!".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4716260421740999645gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4716260421740999645gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - R.E.P.O on Linux</em></p>
<p>The vibe in this one is great, I actually like it a lot and look forward to pulling in some friends to play this with. Check out the release trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="0jke-4sBcMw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/92e1655eeb0f674299d896b60b299758.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/0jke-4sBcMw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The Steam release (February 26th) in Early Access just rocketed up to 54,854 concurrent players in the last 24 hours, making it one of the most popular games on Steam. However, they were a bit <em>unprepared</em> for this and have forced the online play to be friends-only due to "hackers" jumping into games. So now they're also working on a matchmaking system and a server browser, which hopefully won't take too long. So for now, you have to have Steam friends to play it online.</p>

      <title>No support for Assassin&#39;s Creed Shadows on Steam Deck at launch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One from earlier in February I missed was a Q&amp;A post from Ubisoft about Assassin's Creed Shadows, and it's bad news for players hoping to run it on Steam Deck. It releases soon on March 20th.</p>
<p>In their <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Q&amp;A</a> post a question was posed from someone in the Ubisoft Creator Program of "Will the game be Steam Deck certified at launch?", to which Pierre F, Technology Director on Assassin's Creed Shadows, replied: "At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC".</p>
<p>Not exactly surprising though. An increasing amount of brand-new AAA games are just beyond the capability of the Steam Deck. However, their wording of "at launch" leaves me at least a little hopeful they might have some further optimisations they can do. Who knows, maybe Valve can get some updates into Proton to make it run better too, like we've seen numerous times in the past.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Xs2w3qSEBCs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8940cc5cc7829ead0ca3510584129c23.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Xs2w3qSEBCs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>At least if you're on Desktop Linux or a more powerful handheld, you likely won't have too much trouble. Unless the Ubisoft Connect launcher ends up being a nuisance.</p>

      <title>EchoPatch mod is a great way to modernise the classic shooter FEAR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the news recently about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/wb-close-f-e-a-r-and-shadow-of-mordor-dev-monolith-productions-and-other-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Monolith Productions closing</a>, perhaps you might be wanting to jump back into the classic shooter FEAR (stylised as F.E.A.R.). Here's a mod to make the experience better. At least perhaps until we know any improvements GOG will make with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/gog-adding-f-e-a-r-to-their-preservation-program-with-monolith-games-on-sale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their plan to put FEAR into their Preservation Program</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Wemino/EchoPatch" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">EchoPatch</a> was released recently bringing with it a bunch of enhancements like HUD Scaling, a Framerate Limiter, an FPS Drop Fix, the option to Disable Letterboxing, Auto Resolution detection, an option to Skip Splash-screens, an Infinite Flashlight and more.</p>
<p>I've tested it and thanks to the improvements for modding in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-experimental-adds-initial-speech-synthesis-support-lots-of-game-fixes-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent Proton Experimental update</a>, the mod will run out of the box if you set it to use that on Steam. Or, if you're running it outside of Steam (like GOG with the Heroic Games Launcher), the latest GE-Proton will also work.<em> I couldn't get it to work with Proton 9 even with setting WINEDLLOVERRIDES.</em></p>

      <title>Sonic Unleashed gets a full fan-made PC port with Linux / Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sonic Unleashed from the Xbox 360 has made its way onto PC, although not by SEGA. This is a fan-made port created through the process of static recompilation.</p>
<p>The developer notes it offers Linux and Windows support with "numerous built-in enhancements such as high resolutions, ultrawide support, high frame rates, improved performance and modding". However, it does not include the game assets, you need to provide them yourself by owning a copy of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5563991291740993453gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/5563991291740993453gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17451592251740993455gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17451592251740993455gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Sonic Unleashed on Linux</em></p>
<p>Nice to see there's even a dedicated Steam Deck / Linux section in the readme, which notes there's a Flatpak version available so it can be easily installed. For Steam Deck you'll need to be in Desktop Mode to install it.</p>
<p>For modding it includes a loader that supports the Hedge Mod Manager, a mod manager for Hedgehog Engine games on PC. Interestingly, there's a new version of Hedge Mod Manager in progress (Hedge Mod Manager 8 Beta) that has a Linux version too!</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>GOverlay app to help you configure the MangoHud overlay v1.3 released</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOverlay can help you set up the performance display MangoHud with buttons and checkboxes, instead of needing to edit a config file. A new v1.3 was released making it portable. Now it should run on most Linux distributions out of the box with an AppImage, along with some further enhancements to the app itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5133188721740990948gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5133188721740990948gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - A customized MangoHud with GOverlay</em></p>
<p>From the developer in the <a href="https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay/releases/tag/1.3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>: "Since the early days of GOverlay, packaging for different distributions has always been a challenge. While some distros worked flawlessly, others required extra effort. A portable format seemed like the ideal solution, but creating something that "just worked" felt like an impossible task for me. That's when our incredible community stepped in and gave me the boost I needed. In just a matter of days, AppImage specialists from PkgForge not only created a fully functional AppImage for GOverlay but also set up an automated process for nightly builds. This is a game-changer for accessibility and usability across all Linux distributions!"</p>
<p>What's new in the release includes:</p>

      <title>Kaizen: A Factory Story announced from former Zachtronics developers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Coincidence, which includes a bunch of former Zachtronics developers, have announced the open-ended puzzle automation game Kaizen: A Factory Story.</p>
<p>Zachtronics are pretty legendary in the programming-puzzler space, although not a huge name, their games are much loved by their fans. It was a shame when they announced their closure back in <a href="https://kotaku.com/zachtronics-farewell-goodbye-closing-eliza-last-call-bb-1849096767" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2022</a>, but now they're sort-of back under a new name and with a new game.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">More about Kaizen: A Factory Story:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of Opus Magnum, SpaceChem, and Infinifactory comes Kaizen: A Factory Story — another masterfully engineered game.</p>
<p>Weld, rivet, cut, and drill the optimal design and share your solutions to build the simplest, fastest, and sleekest items in your factory. Export animated GIFs to show them off.</p>
<p>But wait! There’s more! In case you want to take a break from factory life, you can spend your days playing Pachi-Sol, an exciting new pachinko-themed solitaire game.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Over the weekend Steam managed to break yet another concurrent online user record, smashing the previous that was set back in December 2024.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, just after 2PM UTC today Steam hit <strong>40,270,997</strong> online with <strong>12,727,475</strong> actually in-game playing something.

<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals</li>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.16 released with improved Steam Deck / Linux game compatibility </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher continues to evolve into an even more impressive cross-platform game launcher for GOG, Epic Games, Amazon Prime and more with v2.16 bringing some great enhancements.</p>
<p>For people using it on Linux / Steam Deck there's some nice compatibility improvements to see from it. For starters, the UMU project is now the default, which is a unified way to run Windows games with Proton outside of Steam, including various automatic fixes being applied for you. This also switches the compatibility layer to GE-Proton, from the now unmaintained Wine-GE.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12125036671740937041gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>There's a ridiculous amount of other changes, making it what they said is "one of our biggest releases yet".</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Env Variables in Known Fixes: Customize game fixes with environment variables for better compatibility.</li>
<li>Launch Arguments via URLs: Pass game arguments directly through protocol URLs for streamlined launching.</li>
<li>Steam Shortcuts for Uninstalled Games: Add Steam shortcuts for games you haven’t installed yet.</li>
<li>Anti-Cheat Logging: Anti-cheat details now appear in logs for easier troubleshooting.</li>
<li>Gamescope "Force Grab Cursor" Toggle: Prevent cursor escapes in full-screen games.</li>
<li>GOG game setup improvements.</li>
<li>DXVK-NVAPI Enabled by default for NVIDIA GPU users on Linux.</li>
<li>+ various UI improvements and other smaller updates.</li>

      <title>Steam sees a big rise in Simplified Chinese for February 2025 bringing Linux down below 2%</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey numbers for February 2025, and there's a pretty massive increase in Simplified Chinese as language which has pushed about all the numbers everywhere else.</p>
<p>As a result of this there's also been a big increase in Windows 10 (+10.47%), which as we've seen repeatedly in the past ends up bringing down the overall Linux numbers. The +20.88% for Simplified Chinese in a single month is pretty striking though (although not the biggest swing we've seen) so I've asked Valve if this is correct.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Taking the numbers as they are right now gives us overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 97.58% +1.03%</li>
<li>Linux 1.45% -0.61%</li>
<li>macOS 0.97% -0.43%</li>
</ul>

<em>See the interactive version on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a>.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">On the Linux side Valve list these as the most-used distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 34.67% -0.26%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.70% +0.29%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 24.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.16% +0.15%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 22.1 64 bit 4.53% +4.53%</li>
<li>Ubuntu Core 22 64 bit 4.21% +0.08%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS 64 bit 3.56% -1.28%</li>

      <title>A Review and Dev Interview: Broadside Renegades</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This ain't your dad's Vampire Survivors. We take a look at a hidden gem and talk to the developer about the development process.</p>
<p>​The diligent reader will know that GamingOnLinux is no stranger to the Vampire-Survivors-like genre. Liam has been captivated by<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/brotato-abyssal-terrors-is-going-to-ruin-my-free-time-especially-with-co-op/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> several</a><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/void-scrappers-is-my-new-favourite-coffee-break-game-m-try-the-free-prologue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> titles</a>, and the author of this article once made an (unsuccessful) attempt to<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> name the genre</a>. In brief, this group of games attempt to combine run-based roguelike upgrades with hordes of encroaching enemies that get steadily more difficult to survive. The genre has matured considerably over the past five years, so much so that it is rare that one breaks through enough to re-capture that original spark.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14977431201740913597gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14977431201740913597gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Enter Broadside Renegades, a new horde survival game hybrid by indie developer Joseph Renzi. I had the fortune to get an interview from Joseph about his game, which you will find below the review section.</p>
<h4><strong>The Review: Broadside Renegades</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>Gameplay</strong></h5>
<p>In Broadside Renegades you play as a pirate out to loot the galaxy. You kill enemies and collect coins to level up and choose between a selection of randomized weapon upgrades and passive abilities. You unlock passive meta-upgrades between runs like more HP, faster speed, and so on. There's a danger meter that ramps up the longer you play, which means more and scarier enemies. You are virtually guaranteed to die, but hopefully not before you turn your ship from a plinking little tugboat into a rocket-propelled Death Star that spews missiles, lasers, drones, cannons, mines, sentient plasma, and all manner of horrifying space ordnance. This is done alongside great pixel art and an absolutely slapping original score. So far so good- these are all elements of a good Horde Survival game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8598593241740913616gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8598593241740913616gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>However, there are also features that distinguish Broadside Renegades from its horde survival competitors. First, the combat is much more active than your typical horde game. Most player ships have a primary active ability that you need to aim to use. You manually control your ship's speed, which changes how quickly you can turn. The dogfighting is much more skill-based and feels more like<a href="https://fractalsoftworks.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Starsector</a> or<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Space Pirates and Zombies</a> than your usual horde survivor.</p>
<p>"Bah," I see you typing in the comments, "there are plenty of games that combine more active combat with horde survival." I beg your patience, reader. Broadside Renegades has a number of other features that bring it to the cutting edge of the genre.</p>
<h5><strong>Spaceships That Switch Up Your Style</strong></h5>
<p>The first ship is a slow-moving brick in which you manoeuvre your sides to the enemy to hit them with broadside attacks. This is a fitting starter ship, as playing it feels like you're a pirate sailing captain ship bringing your broadside cannons to bear on your enemies. Personally, I couldn’t wait to get out of it and into something more agile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20407239441740913663gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20407239441740913663gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The ships you will unlock, though, play completely differently. My current favourite, the rail gun ship, is extremely fast in a line but slow to corner, and has to stop and transform to fire a huge spike through enemies. This, combined with a shield ability, favours long-range hit and run attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20404633841740913690gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20404633841740913690gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Next is a high-agility ship that dodgerolls and can flip 180 degrees. The gameplay here is space dogfighting, getting behind enemy ships and pulling off crazy dodgeroll stunts through blobs of enemies. Close-range weapons are your friend here. There's a literal space tank where you manually rotate the turret independently of the ship’s orientation. This favors a kiting playstyle with midrage damage. There’s a fighter that shoots waves of torpedoes. The most recent ship I unlocked has a giant steel beam across its prow for hurtling yourself into smaller fighter craft, which sends them careening off into space very satisfactorily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10656437481740913719gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10656437481740913719gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<h5><strong>New and New-ish Mechanics</strong></h5>
<p>Perhaps my favourite mechanic that is entirely new to the genre (as far as we are aware) are "scavenger" ships. These ships putter about the arena with no weapons, scooping up any XP coins they find before making their way to a jump gate to escape. If you find and kill one, all the XP they looted is yours for the taking. This is by far my favourite solution to the problem this genre has with XP being scattered all across the map. The genre solution is to add some kind magnet pickup which collects all the XP strewn across the map. Having these scavengers is a great solution to this problem because it turns the magnet-pickup into a much more active gameplay mechanic. Each scavenger ship is like a miniature flying magnet pickup, and if you don't find them in time they might escape with your hard-earned XP.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11505891991740913745gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11505891991740913745gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There are other great additions as well. There are two basic resources for you to loot: fuel and gold (XP). Fuel allows you to escape and move to the next level, while XP makes you more powerful. This means there is a strategic trade-off between staying in a level longer to power up, or focusing on fuel so you can progress to the next stage while minimally increasing the danger meter.</p>
<p>There are also bosses that appear which you can fight or flee from (although they will chase you to the next stage and demean you if you decide to run). There are different factions of enemies that have distinct ships and combat styles. There are different kinds of stages with different dangers and visual appeal. There is full mouse-only mode support. There is controller support. Did I mention the soundtrack is fantastic?</p>

<p>After about 10 hours in the game we reached out to Joseph Renzi for an interview on his game and the development process. There has been some light editing for clarity and conciseness.</p>
<h3><strong>Developer Interview</strong></h3>
<p><strong>GOL: First off, tell us something about yourself and how you got into video game development.</strong></p>
<p>JR: I have always loved world building and making little pen and paper games for my friends, or my little brother. I originally intended to get into concept art as I love worldbuilding, but around 2021 I came down with an autoimmune disease pretty bad (Ulcerative Colitis). More or less, being stuck inside for a solid year made me eventually just dive in solo. I was always waiting for coder friends to be open to work on a project, but it's hard to convince people making good money at their day job to commit to a game project. Luckily I ended up liking the coding part too!</p>
<p><strong>GOL: Give us your one-sentence pitch for Broadside Renegades</strong></p>
<p>JR: Broadside Renegades combines the auto-firing weapons of bullet heaven games with skill based active abilities to get you into space battles as fast as possible!</p>
<p><strong>GOL: How did you develop the game? Is this your first solo game? How was the experience of developing?</strong></p>
<p>JR: It's my first solo game (and game in general). It was a learning experience all around, from art to coding to design (I still don't know how to social media). I developed it mostly on nights and weekends over the course of about 18 months. Before that I worked on eight ideas that I felt I could finish at some point, and luckily many of those ideas gave me tools (and sometimes even code) I could port over to Broadside Renegades. There was a lot of burnout, but it was worth it to get something out there into the world.</p>
<p><strong>GOL: The game works perfectly well via Proton. Was Linux or Steam Deck compatibility something that was on your radar during development? </strong></p>
<p>JR: I had a lot of people around me raving about Steam Decks when I was developing, so I considered Steam Deck compatibility pretty important. I believe roughly a third of my players use a Steam Deck to play. I am impressed that Gamemaker didn't really require me to do anything for Linux in particular; the version you're running is actually the out-of-the-box Windows build. I was lucky enough that two of my testers both preferred Steam Deck, so I knew at launch it at least didn't have critical failures!</p>
<p><strong>GOL: What feature of the game are you most proud of, or turned out better than expected? What feature did you find surprisingly difficult to implement?</strong></p>
<p>JR: For better-than-expected it's actually the post-launch mouse steering system. I severely underestimated how much demand there was for mouse controls, assuming WASD or controller was sufficient given the arcade style of the game. Now it's primarily how I play if I'm not testing a feature with the other control sets. The boat-like steering feels much more intuitive with a mouse cursor.</p>
<p>Menus across the board are significantly more difficult for me than I'd like to admit, but I've learned a lot in the process. Menus (and polishing menus) took much more time than I had budgeted.</p>
<p><strong>GOL: BR has a chaotic mix of genres. What were the big inspirations behind BR? What are some of your favourite games to play?</strong></p>
<p>JR: Vampire Survivors is the most obvious. Originally the main concept was just that but with angles (hence the ship controls and broadsides). The game getting harder with time probably came from how many hundreds of hours I've put into Risk of Rain 1, its sequel, and Risk of Rain Returns. The original concept was actually very inspired by Star Sector, which is much less apparent in the final game. Not necessarily for BR specifically, but games from the Trese Brothers really inspired me creatively in general to get into development. Templar Battleforce in my mind stands next to bigger projects like XCOM (which I also love), despite being from a much smaller development team. I hope eventually I can bite off a bigger project like that myself. <em>(Interviewer note: Trese Brothers are also the author's favourite indie development team, and always support Linux with native builds. Check out their</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/TreseBrothers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><em> gameography on steam</em></a><em> and their newest project: a turn-based tactical cyberpunk simulation,</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1021210/Cyber_Knights_Flashpoint/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><em> Cyber Knights</em></a><em>).</em></p>
<p><strong>GOL: BR has an amazing soundtrack that really complements the gameplay. How did you find your musical artist and what was it like working with them?</strong></p>
<p>JR: He usually goes by Joseph Lee/Dramamine. I showed my original trailer with my "developer music" to my friends, and my composer pretty much demanded that I fix it. It was a first game project for both of us and I am pretty blown away with every track. It helped a lot that he was enthusiastic about the closed demo builds, so he sort of came to get the feel for the battle tracks just from playing the game himself. It's also a good lesson that we can't do everything ourselves. I cannot emphasize how bad my own music was.</p>
<p><strong>GOL: Any final thoughts on the development process? </strong></p>
<p>JR: Mainly that I encourage anybody even a little bit curious about game development to just jump in. Work-life balance is essential though. My biggest lesson learned was how easy it was to burn myself out trying to do everything solo with a day job. Set realistic time frames, especially if you don't have a publisher/deadline. Finishing a project is as important for learning as they say it is.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>So, what are the negatives? The most significant factor for your enjoyment will be whether you enjoy the combat system, which is significantly more active than your usual horde survival game, but not as complex as larger games like Starsector. I find that BR strikes a good balance between the two, but that’s subjective. Less subjective are a few persistent bugs, notably with audio, that might impact your enjoyment. In particular, some of the audio mixing is still a bit wonky, with some effects sounding too loud or quiet relative to others. There is also a bug where the rail gun sound effect plays twice for a single shot in some instances. Mouse support was added recently to the game, and there is one clickable menu button that could not be clicked. The developer is responsive, though, so I expect these bugs to be ironed out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5365182421740913796gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5365182421740913796gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>So, for those who skipped everything above, the short version is that Broadside Renegades is an instant pickup for fans of space fighters and horde survival fans. I haven’t talked much about the negatives, but there are some. Some of the brighter level backgrounds make the HUD difficult to see. The sound mixing is inconsistent and still being patched. The railgun sound effect sometimes plays twice instead of once. That said, the developer is very active on steam and pushing out updates. The game is also affordably priced at around the Vampire Survivors price point.</p>
<p>There's one final thing to mention. The game is <em>criminally</em> underappreciated, with six reviews at the time of writing (all positive). This is a chance to pick up a great game that you can mention at fancy dinner parties when the topic of undiscovered gems comes up. It's sure to impress.</p>

      <title>March 25 reminder - GamingOnLinux needs your support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Welcome to March 2025 readers! Here's a gentle reminder that GamingOnLinux is primarily funded by readers - that's you! And we need your support. GamingOnLinux is entering its 16th year, and I hope to continue it on for a long time.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone reading, commenting, sending in tips and leaving comments!</p>
<p><em>Want to help support GamingOnLinux? See below!</em></p>
<p>Firstly, the <em>best</em> way is regular support via<a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Patreon</a>. For Patreon, a <em>suggestion</em> is to pledge around the <em>start</em> of a month, as it charges at the beginning of <em>every</em> month (although that is changing at the end of this year to the date <em>you</em> started each month). Generally the Patreon is just to have <em>regular</em> funding to keep bringing you the news.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">All other donations, without any special rewards can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=P85ZZX9W8HFMW" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Paypal Donations</a> or Monthly donation/sub suggested levels: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-6MU983833N166101WL3ZRB5I" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supporter</a> - <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-54T30471MU837021GL3ZRCMY" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Supporter Plus</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">You can also bookmark and buy games using our affiliate/partner links (and they really do help!):</p>

<p>You can find all the links to support us on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/support-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our dedicated page</a> any time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since the last time I posted, Humble Bundle <em>completely</em> changed their partnership system from a dedicated one they ran directly to a third-party called Impact. It's been far less generous and helpful, so our overall funding has reduced quite a <em>lot</em> and it has been felt. So any support you can give will be firmly appreciated.</p>
<p>Additionally, our Forum was closed in December 2024 due to the UK's new wide-reaching Online Safety Act. Not many at all actually used it as most of the community is on <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>, but it's still a shame. There's been a few other smaller changes in comments and profiles to keep us out of scope of the law to hopefully not have any issues. No changes are up for discussion on that. This does <em>not</em> affect our regular news posting at all.</p>
<p>Onto brighter news - it’s going to be another big exciting year!<br/>

</blockquote>
<p>As for what performance to expect these below are from AMD's own slides in comparison to the RX 7900 GRE:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7948243951740750316gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7948243951740750316gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2434064461740750317gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2434064461740750317gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13919872471740750317gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13919872471740750317gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16900471511740750318gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16900471511740750318gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For FSR 4, AMD said to expect 30+ games supported immediately at launch including: Marvel Rivals, Smite 2, Space Marine 2, Spider-Man Remastered, Spider-Man Miles Morales and Spider-Man 2, Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, God of War Ragnorok, The Last of Us Part 1 and more. AMD said to expect over 75 titles to add FSR 4 support during 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11034823831740742968gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11034823831740742968gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2969886801740742969gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2969886801740742969gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a shame you have to upgrade your whole GPU for the full benefit of FSR 4 though, as the quality of it does look pretty impressive based on the bits they've shown. AMD have made seriously great progress on FSR since it was first released, and this does look like quite a big overall enhancement to their tech on both quality and performance.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3105069551740743275gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3105069551740743275gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4202375431740743276gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4202375431740743276gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>AMD FSR 4 Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Available exclusively on AMD Radeon™ RX 9000 Series graphics cards, AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition™ adds a new easy-to-use AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 4 (AMD FSR 4) Upgrade feature that helps maximize performance at maximum quality in over 30 games at launch, with 75 coming later this year. AMD FSR 4 delivers a substantial image quality improvement over AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling, with the new ML-based algorithm helping to improve temporal stability, better preserve detail, and reduce ghosting.</li>
<li>Utilizing features already built into the AMD FidelityFX™ API added when game developers integrate AMD FSR 3.1 into their games, AMD FSR 4 enables an easy upgrade for supported FSR 3.1 games and can be combined with existing in-game AMD FSR 3.1 advanced frame-generation and AMD Radeon™ Anti-Lag 2 for ultra-smooth, ultra-responsive gaming at incredible frame rates on AMD Radeon RX 9070 Series graphics cards.</li>
<li>The new ML-accelerated AMD FSR 4 upscaling algorithm is trained using high-quality ground truth game data on AMD Instinct™ Accelerators and uses the hardware-accelerated FP8 Wave Matrix Multiply Accumulate (WMMA) feature of the AMD RDNA™ 4 architecture to ensure maximum upscaling quality while still providing a substantial game performance boost.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course during the event there was plenty of <em>AI this AI that</em> talk.</p>

      <title>HASTE: Broken Worlds is a speedrunning Sonic-like platformer from Landfall with a demo up now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gotta go fast? Landfall, developer of Totally Accurate Battle Simulator and Clustertruck, have released a demo for HASTE: Broken Worlds that's worth a look.</p>
<p>It's a speedrunning platformer, with a feel that I can only describe as being Sonic-like. The main mechanic (apart from running, obviously) is that you need to build up an energy meter by landing as perfectly as possible. As you run you will auto-launch yourself into the air from any little hill, and then it's your job to time your button pressing to send yourself flying downwards to land nicely to build up your energy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1849222331740747124gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - HASTE: Broken Worlds Demo on Linux</em></p>
<p>With your energy built up, you can then use your special ability to jump on a sort-of hover-board to build up more speed and distance while in the air. The game is made up of procedural worlds, so you never quite know what sort of area you're going to be running around, which will keeps you on your toes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="voVRktkV62A"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c5cd8585f57397f8c299bdcdf8a5dffb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/voVRktkV62A" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The progression in it is a bit similar to various roguelites with you speeding through each level, to then pick a path on a map to progress through each shard (shards being their worlds). It also sprinkles in upgrades for you to pick between a few giving you various extras. So with the procedural worlds, the progression and the upgrades it's a highly replayable game even in the demo.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Third-person high-speed running gameplay.</li>
<li>10 Shards, each featuring a collection of procedurally generated levels that must be completed without fail to advance to the next Shard.</li>
<li>Items and Challenge levels that let you customize your build for each attempt to clear a Shard.</li>
<li>Spectacular biomes and different bosses to discover.</li>
<li>A story to explore and a lovable cast of characters to befriend.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The demo was released as part of Steam Next Fest and there's a Native Linux version available. On Steam, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1796470/discussions/0/595142122210928693/#c595142122210940090" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> they plan to get it Steam Deck Verified too.</p>
<p>Definitely a demo worth trying out. Only one issue on my Desktop is that every time I alt+tab it quits, but apart from that it really runs great and is quite entertaining to run through it. Performance is great though and it has an absolutely banging soundtrack to go with it.</p>

      <title>Everything to grab from Prime Gaming, February 28th edition for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for February 28th, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon's previous VP of Prime Gaming said they "tried everything" to disrupt Steam</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Civilization VII updates roadmap revealed - new update and DLC due out on March 4</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>2K and Firaxis have revealed the updates roadmap for Civilization VII, along with dates on when to expect some of it and we're set for some big changes. It's been a tough launch for them with thoroughly mixed ratings from players. Hopefully the updates will improve things for everyone.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The first update v1.1.0 is due March 4th that will have these highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Natural Wonder to discover: Bermuda Triangle (free to all players).</li>
<li>Additional UI adjustments, polish, and addressing of reported issues.</li>
<li>Significant changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory; AI leaders will also be better at completing a Cultural Victory (so expect fewer Explorer Unit stacks!).</li>
<li>Now able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. Note that when players create their own Missionary Units, they will always follow the player’s chosen Religion.</li>
<li>Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers.</li>
<li>Balance pass on several Mementos.</li>
<li>Refinements to the Army Unpacking action.</li>
<li>Addressing reported issues with multiplayer and adding friends with a 2K Account.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time the Crossroads of the World Collection - Part 1 DLC will also release. Things includes the new leader Ada Lovelace, the new civs Great Britain (Modern Age) and Carthage (Antiquity Age), and the Natural Wonder Pack including four new Natural Wonders: Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9135914921740744208gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The next update after v1.1.1 will be due March 25 and the highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional UI improvements and refinements; specifics will be shared later with the Update 1.1.1 Notes
	<ul>
<li><em>Note: Ongoing improvements to the User Interface continues to be a top priority for the development team. The updates being introduced on March 25 are just one part of a much larger plan that aims to improve the UI over the next several months. </em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scouting and Settling improvements for AI, including less aggressive “forward” settling by AI</li>
<li>Adding Quick Move functionality</li>
<li>Adding the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities</li>
<li>Renaming the existing maps to be "Start Position: Balanced," which will be the default Start Position setting for multiplayer games</li>
<li>Adding a new Start Position of "Standard," where the landforms on maps are less predictable, closer to how map generation works in <em>Civ VI</em></li>
<li>Adding an optional Restart button that rerolls the player’s map generation now that these less predictable start positions are possible</li>
<li>New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest (free to all players)</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Again here another DLC will release with the second half of the paid Crossroads of the World Collection. After that, they're not giving any dates. But some of what to expect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing UI improvements.</li>
<li>Adding a “One More Turn” button that will let you continue playing past the end of the Modern Age.</li>
<li>Implementing Auto-Explore.</li>
<li>New map sizes (all platforms except Nintendo Switch).</li>
<li>New Resource types and adjustments to map resource allocation.</li>
<li>Teams support in multiplayer.</li>
<li>Hot Seat local multiplayer.</li>
<li>Research Queuing.</li>
<li>Mod tools and Steam Workshop support.</li>
<li>Additional game setup customization options.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20451460461740744149gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20451460461740744149gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>Split Fiction from Hazelight Studios and EA gets Steam Deck Verified and no EA app needed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The co-op adventure Split Fiction from Hazelight Studios (It Takes Two) and EA releases March 6th, and the good news is that it will be easy to play on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2001120/view/500565775095959232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> has been posted to Steam to confirm that it's been Steam Deck Verified, and it will be a fully Native Steam game, so no EA app will be needed for it either. This is great news, because the EA app and various other publisher launchers can be a serious nuisance on Linux platforms that play Windows games via Proton.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">In the post they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steam Deck Verified</p>
<p>For starters, we’re happy to announce that Split Fiction will be Steam Native and Steam Deck verified! Similar to It Takes Two, Split Fiction will not require the EA app either, meaning you’ll be able to play the game using just the Steam Client on PC, no other application needed. You will be able to easily send game invites and join your friends on Steam directly through the Steam Friends List system, allowing you to get into the chaotic action quicker. Please note, however, that you’ll need a free EA account if you want to connect with a friend who’s playing on a different platform through crossplay, such as Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>Whether you’re at home or on the go, you will be able to transport yourself into the world of Mio and Zoe’s mind-boggling adventure as Split Fiction is Verified on Valve’s Steam Deck handheld device, giving you even more options to take advantage of Split Fiction supporting crossplay. You will also be able to take advantage of the Steam Cloud Save functionality, meaning you can play on your PC, save and close the game, then carry on where you left off on your Steam Deck and vice versa! We’re excited to see all the unexpected locations the community will end up playing Split Fiction at launch and beyond.</p>

<p class="plain-list-title">They also listed a few accessibility options that will be available:</p>

<li>Subtitles with optional backgrounds.</li>
<li>Closed captioning.</li>
<li>Skippable checkpoints for sections players may get stuck at.</li>
<li>Toggleable option to replace button mash prompts/analogue stick spinning/stick wiggling prompts with more simplified inputs.</li>
<li>Adjustable damage modifiers to reduce the amount of damage enemies inflict on the player.</li>

<p>I'm just really happy to see more bigger budget split-screen games like this. Even better when it's playable on Linux platforms thanks to Valve's Proton.</p>

      <title>Linux GPU Configuration Tool (LACT) upgrades NVIDIA clockspeed configuration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you want to fully control your GPU on Linux you may want to check out the latest update to Linux GPU Configuration Tool (LACT), which brings in various new features. Version 0.7.1 was released on February 27th.</p>
<p>Main changes in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated clockspeed configuration on Nvidia GPUs. Clockspeeds are now configurable per-pstate, and are displayed as an offset value. Note: existing clockspeed settings will get reset to default.</li>
<li>LACT now detects GPU device changes, automatically picking up added or removed devices without requiring a service restart. While this is not a very common scenario, it is useful for certain use cases such as reloading the driver or dynamically reattaching a GPU.</li>
<li>Minor info reporting improvements, such as showing resizeable bar support on Nvidia and Intel.</li>
<li>Custom p-states are now only applied when actually configured in the UI. This can help with custom clock settings not applying when using a custom performance level on RDNA3 GPUs.</li>
<li>Graphs window no longer causes system lag on some setups.</li>
<li>Process and gamemode listener fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to admit, I never really mess with pretty much any GPU / CPU stuff at all. I generally stick with stock everything to not cause any potential issues. However, I really like the layout of this and how it gives you an easy readout of everything. Here's how it looks on my AMD GPU:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2241669101740740595gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/2241669101740740595gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1755122731740740596gol1.png" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/1755122731740740596gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>The California Fire Relief Bundle is live on itch.io</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Necrosoft Games have organised a big California Fire Relief Bundle that's hosted on itch.io. Your chance to get a whole load of games while supporting relief efforts.</p>
<p>From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Southern California has been hit by an incredibly destructive wildfire which is tracking to become the most destructive in California history. More than 18,000 structures have been leveled or damaged and 29 people have died with more than 30 still missing.</p>
<p>The affected neighborhoods include a diverse swath of California residents, from the rich to the poor to the unhoused. 37,728 acres burned between the Palisades and Eaton fires alone. 150,000 people had to be evacuated.</p>
<p>Hundreds of game and tabletop game developers have gotten together to create this bundle in support of easing this pain. All proceeds, minus processing fees, go to <a href="https://www.coreresponse.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CORE</a> (Community Organized Relief Effort), a Los Angeles-based organization which offers direct monetary support to survivors of the fires, and supports projects for fire resilience in affected areas (and potential disaster zones). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's $10 minimum and there's some really fun stuff included. The bundle minimum price is lower than the historic low for TUNIC, a wonderful game that's included so this is a genuinely good deal regardless.</p>

      <title>EA just open sourced Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Renegade and Generals</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I can't quite believe it either. Command &amp; Conquer, Red Alert, Command &amp; Conquer Renegade and Command &amp; Conquer Generals (inc. Zero Hour) have their code officially open sourced.</p>
<p>This is how it should be done. When a game is old enough, open source it so the community can keep it alive and learn from and perhaps even improve them. Looking over them they're all under the GPL3 license. However, there are some additional terms added like EA not granting any "trademark or publicity rights", you don't get the right to use "Command &amp; Conquer" or any other trademark for example.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">EA did more than just open sourcing their older titles though. They've also enabled Steam Workshop support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>C&amp;C Renegade</li>
<li>C&amp;C Generals &amp; Zero Hour</li>
<li>C&amp;C 3 Tiberium Wars and Kane’s Wrath</li>
<li>C&amp;C Red Alert 3 &amp; Uprising</li>
<li>C&amp;C 4 Tiberian Twilight</li>
</ul>
<p>They also launched a new video going over some rare gameplay footage from the early development of C&amp;C Renegade and C&amp;C Generals:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qN2gryZYz6g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/617610065f927cb354f8439f9580a97e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qN2gryZYz6g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">All of them are now on GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert</a></li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To do this EA worked with Luke "CCHyper" Feenan, who they said was "part of our Community Council for the C&amp;C Remastered Collection, and was involved in bringing the C&amp;C Ultimate Collection to Steam back in March 2024". You can see the full message from EA and Feenan in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2229890/view/502818210084553731" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>To mark 10 years this indie game changes price every hour to London&#39;s temperature</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As far as publicity stunts and indie dev anniversary celebrations go, this is both clever and quite amusing. The puzzle game <strong>A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</strong> from Alan Hazelden / Draknek &amp; Friends will change price every hour on <a href="https://draknek.itch.io/a-good-snowman" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. <em>Not on other stores though, as only itch supports doing this.</em></p>
<p>What Hazelden <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/draknek.bsky.social/post/3lj66gnc3fb2t" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">called</a> "pay what the temperature is", the price is being set based on the current temperature in London (UK). The developer is pulling the data from <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">OpenWeather</a>, and then changing the price to match on the <a href="http://draknek.itch.io/a-good-snowman" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">itch.io page</a>. As of the last reading the temperature was 9.9°C and so it's priced at $9.99.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uWJIkfiKmQk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fbba1ebfbc83101347d30720da31fa8d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uWJIkfiKmQk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Some bits of the FAQ are also quite funny:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why are you doing this?</strong></p>
<p>Introducing this as a permanent price model is our really stupid way of celebrating the game's 10 year anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>What if the temperature is below 0°C?</strong></p>
<p>Ha ha, nice try. The game will be free.</p>
<p><strong>I use Fahrenheit though!</strong></p>
<p>Okay, if you insist. 9.9°C is 49.82°F, so you can set the payment amount to $49.82 in the checkout process.</p>
<p><strong>I use Kelvin though!</strong></p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your generosity! 9.9°C is 283.05°K, so you can set the payment amount to $283.05 in the checkout process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't get a Steam key though, as they don't want them to end up being "resold on dodgy second-hand marketplaces that we don't want to support".</p>
<p>Great game too, according to our previous contributor flesk <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2015/02/adorable-sokobanlike-puzzler-a-good-snowman-is-hard-to-build-released-today-a-musthave-for-puzzle-enthusiasts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">who said</a> it's "without a doubt the most charming puzzle game I have ever played".</p>

      <title>Metro devs 4A Games Ukraine rebrand as Reburn and reveal futuristic sci-fi shooter La Quimera</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update: 03/03/25</strong> - 4A Games <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> their own statement to clear up some confusion that has been caused by the announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>We understand there is some confusion out there about 4A Games and Metro, and we just wanted to give you a quick update to reassure everyone.</p>
<p>We are 4A Games.</p>
<p>We are the team that created and built the Metro games you know and love. We’re still making the next Metro with Dmitry Glukhovsky, the same core founders, leadership, developers, and nearly 20 years experience on the series. We also have our other new IP project in the works. We’ll reveal more about both when we’re ready.</p>
<p>We are proudly Ukrainian in our roots, and in the majority of our diverse team. We make games from our offices in Kyiv and Sliema, as well as remotely, and even sometimes from the front line in Ukraine. We now have studios in two countries, but the majority of our team remain in Ukraine - roughly 150 out of about 200+. The rest work in Malta, or remotely.</p>
<p>In 2014, we, led by the original "four A's" - the founders of 4A Games - formed “4A Games Limited” and created a new HQ in Malta with roughly 50 of our fellow team members.  We have since grown and work to this day on Metro under contract with Deep Silver and Plaion. </p>
<p>We continued to work closely with our remaining Ukrainian colleagues at “4A Games Ukraine” on Metro Exodus through an outsource relationship led by us. Once Metro Exodus and its DLC was released, we created another Kyiv studio under 4A Games Limited and welcomed roughly 50 more of our colleagues to continue on with us, while 4A Games Ukraine continued to pursue their own project La Quimera, as a completely separate entity and recently renamed themselves Reburn. We wish them every success.</p>
<p>The 4A Games you know and love have not changed, and we are not rebranding. We are the same developers of Metro that brought you Metro 2033, Metro: Last Light, Metro Redux, and Metro Exodus.</p>
<p>We’re humbled to see everyone’s support for us, our work, and their love for the Metro series. We can’t wait to celebrate Metro 2033’s 15th birthday in March with all of you, and at a later date, show you what we’ve been working on.</p>
<p>Now let’s get back to making Metro!</p>
<p>The 4A Games team.</p>
<p>Слава Україні!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>La Quimera is an upcoming story-driven FPS set in dystopian future Latin America. Developed by Reburn, formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine. As a big fan of the Metro series, I'm keen to seen what a bunch of their team can do with this new setting.</p>
<p>The setting blends together Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology. It will be playable solo or with up to two friends in co-op (three players). Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8u_qFKhoB8c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1a07a2a96f54d6f10877271cea15a762.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Reburn have a talented team, making me all the more excited about it. They have over 100 developers whose past work includes gameplay design, art, sound engineering, programming, and more from across the entire Metro series as well as the original S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Oleksandr Kostiuk serves as project lead on La Quimera. CEO and founder Dmytro Lymar has worked in games since 2006, and previously served as director and CEO of 4A Games Ukraine.</p>
<p>From the press release: “Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series,” said Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn. “We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.”</p>

      <title>Promise Mascot Agency releases April 10 and is &#34;Steam Deck Ready&#34; with a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Promise Mascot Agency from Kaizen Game Works is confirmed for launch on April 10th, and the good news for Steam Deck / Linux players is that it should work great with the developer noting it's "Steam Deck Ready".</p>
<p>More about it: "From the creators of Paradise Killer comes a mind-bending open-world narrative adventure mascot management simulator where mascots are more than just symbols - they’re unpredictable forces of nature! Step into the chaos, unravel the conspiracies, drive a tiny truck and try to keep it all together in Promise Mascot Agency!"</p>
<p>You can try it out yourself right now during Steam Next Fest and it's definitely worth a look. Check out the new release date trailer that went up yesterday:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="bwTNI-MKKPE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e7e5a1f8a9f34895031f150ad80dab4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/bwTNI-MKKPE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As for the Steam Deck support? According to the developer it's looking good! So good in fact that "Playing Promise Mascot Agency on Steam Deck rules so hard!". Now that's what I like to hear.</p>
<p>Here's what they put in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2585830/view/501692310177710901" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We play Promise Mascot Agency on Steam Deck a lot, and we're happy to report that it works wonderfully!<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3068952161740669033gol1.jpg"><br/>
<br/>
It works without any tuning as we detect you're running on Deck and automatically set the graphics options to what we've found give the best results for visual fidelity, frame rate and battery life. A suite of graphics options are included for you to tweak as well.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us play handheld, and some docked with Bluetooth controllers. It rules!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all of your support and interest in the game!</img></p>

      <title>GOG Preservation Program expands to add 11 LEGO games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG's</a> special Preservation Program, where they ensure games are kept up to date and continue working on modern systems, has expanded with 11 LEGO games now included. That's on top of the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/gog-adding-f-e-a-r-to-their-preservation-program-with-monolith-games-on-sale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent announcement about F.E.A.R. also joining up soon</a>.</p>
<p>Lots of games get lost to time due to developers moving on and so it's nice to see such preservation efforts, especially when the games are DRM free too.</p>
<p>With today's announcement these have newly launched on GOG:</p>

      <title>NVIDIA stable driver 570.124.04 released for Linux with VRR for multiple displays and various bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from the 570.86.16 Beta that was released on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/nvidia-beta-driver-570-86-16-released-with-vrr-for-multiple-displays-and-lots-of-improvements/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">January 30th</a>, NVIDIA have today put up a new stable driver release with 570.124.04. As a reminder following a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/nvidia-release-new-gpu-driver-updates-for-linux-and-windows-after-announcing-security-issues/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent security bulletin</a>, you'll want to ensure you're up to date.</p>
<p>Since the 570.86.16 Beta release these are the <strong>new</strong> changes for the stable driver:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that could prevent displays from being restored correctly when resuming from suspend on some systems with multiple displays.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression which stopped VRR from working on HDMI displays.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue which caused stuttering and performance issues when scrolling windows in Wayland with GSP firmware enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that resulted in corruption or application crashes when using PRIME render offloading between two NVIDIA GPUs with modeset=1 enabled in nvidia-drm.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To save you a click and for those who didn't try the Beta, all these below are also included in 570.124.04 that were first released via the 570.86.16 Beta:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused the nvidia-settings control panel to crash when querying VRR attributes on some monitors.</li>
<li>Updated the nvidia-settings control panel to use NVML rather than NV-CONTROL to control GPU clocks and fan speed. This allows related functionality to work when using Wayland, where the NV-CONTROL X extension is not available. Note that as a result, some operations which were previously available to unprivileged users, due to the privileges of the X server, may now require elevated privileges.</li>
<li>Added support for VRR on systems with multiple displays.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to improve performance on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to resolve a corruption issue on Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Mirage.</li>
<li>Implemented support for the VK_KHR_incremental_present extension.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some Vulkan applications to crash when responding to window resize events.</li>
<li>Updated GPU overclocking control to be available by default in nvidia-settings, for GPU boards that support programmable clock control. Previously, this was only available when bit 3 was set in the "Coolbits" X config option.</li>
<li>Disabled a power saving feature on Ada and above generation GPUs for surfaces allocated with the DRM Dumb-Buffers API, for example, when using a DRM fbdev. The power saving feature could cause black screens for DRM Dumb-Buffers which use front buffer rendering instead of KMS flips.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause some multi-threaded OpenGL applications, for example Civilization 6, to crash when running on Xwayland.</li>
<li>Added support for querying Dynamic Boost status via the 'power' file in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/*.</li>
<li>Enabled 32 bit compatibility support for the NVIDIA GBM backend.</li>
<li>Added a new kernel module parameter, 'conceal_vrr_caps', to the nvidia-modeset kernel module. This parameter may be used to enable usage of features on some displays such as ULMB (Ultra Low Motion Blur) which are incompatible with VRR. See the "Direct Rendering Manager Kernel Modesetting" (DRM KMS) chapter of the README for further information.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause games to crash when the "PROTON_ENABLE_NGX_UPDATER" environment variable was set to a value of "1".</li>
<li>Added /usr/share/nvidia/files.d/sandboxutils-filelist.json which lists all the driver files used by container runtime environments such as nvidia-container-toolkit and enroot.</li>
<li>Added support for the systemd suspend-then-hibernate method of system sleep. This feature requires systemd version 248 or newer.</li>
<li>Enabled the nvidia-drm fbdev=1 option by default. When supported by the kernel and the nvidia-drm modeset=1 option is enabled, nvidia-drm will replace the system's framebuffer console with one driven by DRM.<br/>
	This feature can be disabled by setting fbdev=0.</li>
<li>Implemented a feature that allows low latency display interrupts to be serviced even when the system is under heavy contention. This is especially useful for reducing stutter when using virtual reality.<br/>
	This feature is experimental and disabled by default.<br/>
	This feature can be enabled by loading nvidia.ko with the `NVreg_RegistryDwords=RMIntrLockingMode=1` kernel module parameter.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, introduced in 555.58, where some DVI outputs would not work with HDMI monitors.</li>
<li>In Linux kernel 6.11, drm_fbdev_generic was renamed to drm_fbdev_ttm. Use drm_fbdev_ttm when present to keep supporting direct framebuffer access needed for Wayland compositors to present content on newer kernels.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. The driver now supports enumerating modes on hotplug events through the DRM fbdev API.</li>
<li>In linux-next commit 446d0f4849b1, intended to be included in Linux kernel 6.12, output_poll_changed is removed from struct drm_mode_config_funcs. Do not implement the function pointer member when not present to ensure the driver can compile with newer kernels. Populating modes for DRM connectors during hotplug events will not be supported with r535 and kernels containing the relevant commit.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause external displays to become frozen until the next modeset when using PRIME Display Offloading with the NVIDIA dGPU acting as the display offload sink.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Fallen Aces the crime noir FPS is now Steam Deck Verified with the Wheels of Steel update </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fallen Aces from Trey Powell, Jason Bond and New Blood Interactive looks awesome and now it should be even better. With the Wheels of Steel update there's been a few bits added, overhauled and now it's Steam Deck Verified too. If you're after an FPS that's a bit different then this is one to stick into your wishlist.</p>
<p>What is it? "The A.C.E.S, watchful guardians of Switchblade City, are being taken down, one by one. Now it's up to one man, with two fists, to get to the bottom of it all. Fallen Aces is a crime noir FPS that plays right out of the '90s and looks like it's right outta the comics."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13549989861740659411gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The big thing included in this update are the remade vehicle assets across the whole game so they should look a lot better. But there's plenty of smaller bits to it like new Tommy Gun animations, new punch and automatic pistol sound effects, improved enemy path calculations (plus other enemy character fixes) and lots of bug fixes. My favourite change though is that you can throw enemy bodies through breakable doors — sounds fun.</p>
<p>Additionally, for Steam Deck players, it's a good one too as it's now Steam Deck Verified! They've updated it to make some UI elements bigger, there's better controller navigation in some places, improved sliders and more.</p>
<p>Plenty more to come with Episode 2 "all storyboarded out and into production" but before that they're going to add in a Level Editor and Steam Workshop support.</p>

      <title>Valve updates the Steam Daily Deals program and gives some stats</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have done a little adjustment to the display of Steam Daily Deals to show more games. They also now give developers some more stats, and gave us all a bit of an overview.</p>
<p>For gamers the only real difference here is that they're bumping up the display from four to six games in total in the special offers section. The name is also a little deceptive, since it's not just a single day as the deals often run for quite a bit longer, which Valve said "We found that many of the platform effects of a game running a discount, particularly a featured discount such as the Daily Deal, causes a lot of additional visibility, buzz, and lift in sales for days following the initial day. Extending the discount to run for a week makes the promotion accessible to more players and allows the game to benefit from higher visibility on Top Sellers and other charts throughout Steam."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13069639071740651605gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Giving us some stats and background on it during 2024 they highlighted these points:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>2,843 games from 1,160 different developers and publishers were featured in Daily Deals.</li>
<li>These games came from developers in 68 different countries around the world.</li>
<li>Each game featured as a Daily Deal typically gets over 10 Million impressions on the Steam store during the one-day promotion.</li>
<li>Each Daily Deal spot can be focused on a single game, or can lead to a multi-game sale event. The largest multi-game sale event was the Czech &amp; Slovak Games Week, which featured 277 games from developers located in that region.</li>
<li>The range of revenue generated from the Daily Deal featuring is broad and depends on a lot of factors such as the age of the game, the discount percentage, the interest in the game, and so forth. We've seen games earn anywhere from ~$10,000 to $2,000,000.</li>
<li>87% of Daily Deals in 2024 were for games that had never previously been featured as a Daily Deal. Some were new releases while others were titles that we were now able to highlight as a result of the updates to our program.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For developers they've added a new post-promotion recap on the Steamworks dashboard, so developers can see how it did at a glance. There's also a new daily deal history section for developers to look back on.</p>
<p>How exactly do Valve decide what games to actually show to us all? Valve said they've refined it over time and they use a "prioritization algorithm", which is based on what you've played to match you up with the current games running a promotion. So you might see a list of deals that are different to others.  You'll see your daily deal picks across the Steam homepage as well as the tag / genre pages too.</p>
<p>Of course all the sales are available on the dedicated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sales page</a> at any time.</p>

      <title>WB close F.E.A.R. and Shadow of Mordor dev Monolith Productions and other studios</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Seriously tough times in the gaming industry, with even more publishers pulling back and closing studios. Now Warner Bros. have confirmed they've closed multiple studios.</p>
<p>First reported by Jason Schreier (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lizk5skwps2d" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>) of Bloomberg, and then later confirmed in an email to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>. WB have closed Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. These developers between them were responsible for creating F.E.A.R., Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, Middle-earth: Shadow of War, MultiVersus and many more.</p>
<p>The statement sent to Kotaku:</p>

<p>We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -– Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones. After careful consideration, we are closing three of our development studios – Monolith Productions, Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This is a strategic change in direction and not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them.</p>
<p>The development of Monolith’s Wonder Woman videogame will not move forward. Our hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities. This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith’s storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games. We greatly admire the passion of the three teams and thank every employee for their contributions. As difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Especially frustrating for gamers, because the really fun nemesis system from Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is patented and it seems WB are now doing nothing with it since the Wonder Woman game was cancelled that was reportedly going to use it. According to <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Google Patents</a>, WB own the patent until 2036.</p>
<p>Hopefully the people affected will find something again soon. There's been far too much of this happening over the last few years. It's ridiculous. So much knowledge being lost in the process. Developers and publishers can't expect to keep ever increasing their revenue, while losing a lot of the knowledge from the people actually responsible for doing the work.</p>

      <title>Valve&#39;s in-development Deadlock gets a huge map overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's upcoming MOBA shooter Deadlock has received one of the biggest updates to date, which includes a big overhaul to the map that makes it a bit less complicated. While it's in development access is still locked behind invites.</p>
<p>Before this update there were four separate lanes to ride on the rails and battle through, with one of them being ripped out. Valve have redesigned a lot of the map to bring it down to three lanes, and I think they're onto something here. It's a bit more streamlined, less overwhelming and a bit quicker on the action thanks to it. The game is still pretty deep but a bit less crazy now.</p>
<p>The map layout change includes changes to "visuals, building layouts, pathways, neutral camps, air vents, breakables, powerup buffs, juke spots, mid boss" and so on. There's also a new Explore Map feature, so you can just run around the map to learn it now — very useful.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18527574251740579118gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Another major change is to some of the progression. Much like with Dota 2, you needed to get a last-hit in order to get the full benefit. This has been removed from Deadlock. Now the AI troopers will generate Soul Orbs for XP and currency as long as you're nearby, although you still need to shoot them to get the extras. Additionally, gaining souls from kills now has a visual effect of them flying towards you.</p>
<p>Various other technical additions in the update include support for DLSS, they upgraded FSR2 to AMD's new FSR3 temporal upscaler, Valve enabled NVIDIA Reflex and AMD Anti-Lag 2.0 for reduced latency, various netcode improvements and there's a lot of general smaller gameplay changes too. There's even a bunch of improvements for controller players to make it feel better. </p>

      <title>Dune: Awakening looks like it may be playable on Steam Deck - benchmark tested</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dune: Awakening is releasing May 20th from Funcom, and surprisingly it looks like it may actually be playable on the Steam Deck. That is, unless Funcom decide to put in some anti-cheat that blocks Linux. There's currently no anti-cheat mentioned on the Steam page. <em>I did email Funcom about any anti-cheat, and they haven't yet replied.</em></p>
<p>A benchmark mode has been made available for the upcoming MMO, so I gave it a test-run on an LCD Steam Deck to see how it went and the results actually surprised me. As long as you're not expecting a constant 60FPS and don't mind running on low details, you might be okay here.</p>
<p>First up testing on Low with FSR3 set to <u>Ultra Performance</u> resulted in all sections giving above 50FPS on average:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17065616361740575262gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17065616361740575262gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Changing over FSR3 to <u>Performance</u> still gave over 40FPS on average in all sections:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21043532121740575619gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21043532121740575619gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Also see how it went when setting FSR3 to <u>Balanced</u>. It's still getting averages above 40FPS in all parts:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1145948611740576003gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1145948611740576003gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>The real concern are the <em>minimums</em> though, which in all cases shows drops below 30FPS. It just depends how often it will dip in the full game.</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend Frame Generation either. For a lot of games on Steam Deck it will bring up the overall FPS, but it destroys the Frame Timings making it a mess. Frame Generation is generally only good if the game is already able to perform to at least 60FPS.</p>
<p>If you actually locked it down to 30FPS, this might actually give a reasonable experience if you're wanting to play the brand new MMO on Steam Deck when it releases. It remains to be seen how the rest of the game fares though but this is at least somewhat promising from the benchmark.</p>

      <title>The Wipeout-like racer BallisticNG gets Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>That's another game with the green tick that you might want to pick up. BallisticNG is a Wipeout, Rollcage and Jet Moto inspired racer that's genuinely good. With the still in-development updates, it's now Steam Deck Verified. It also has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>For the best experience on Steam Deck though you do need to opt-in to the "development" Beta on Steam. This does highlight a bit of a flaw in Valve's Deck Verified rating system, as it already shows as Deck Verified on the Steam page despite needing the Beta.</p>
<p>As the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/473770/view/525335573256211983" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on Steam "1.4 Dev 6" brings quite a lot of work. There's a lot of UI updates that went into this, with developer Neognosis noting how they've been "addressing feedback from both the community and Valve through the Steam Deck verification process". There's new standardized input prompt positions, campaign info pages are now tabs making understanding it easier, there's a controller events system, fixes to controller assignment, larger text sizing in some places and more.</p>
<p>Their most recent proper trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e0vWr5aBqEU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2adfb360d73aefb134bf017776c5989d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e0vWr5aBqEU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see so many developers making their games better on Steam Deck, with a lot of the benefits just making the games better overall.</p>

      <title>X.Org X server and Xwayland have 8 more security vulnerabilities revealed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You should probably keep an eye on your software updater, as the X.Org X server and Xwayland have more security vulnerabilities that have been announced.</p>
<p>The security advisory was <a href="https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg/2025-February/061894.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> to the xorg-announce mailing list on Tuesday, 25th February from developer Olivier Fourdan. A few hours later xorg-server v21.1.16 and xwayland v24.1.6 were released to deal with all of the reported issues. Hopefully distributions will get the updates in quickly.</p>
<p>Here's the listed issues:</p>
<p>CVE-2025-26594: Use-after-free of the root cursor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The root cursor is referenced in the xserver as a global variable. If a client manages to free the root cursor, the internal reference points to freed memory and causes a use-after-free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26595: Buffer overflow in XkbVModMaskText().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The code in XkbVModMaskText() allocates a fixed sized buffer on the stack and copies the names of the virtual modifiers to that buffer.</p>
<p>The code however fails to check the bounds of the buffer correctly and would copy the data regardless of the size, which may lead to a buffer overflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26596: Heap overflow in XkbWriteKeySyms().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The computation of the length in XkbSizeKeySyms() differs from what is actually written in XkbWriteKeySyms(), which may lead to a heap based buffer overflow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26597: Buffer overflow in XkbChangeTypesOfKey().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If XkbChangeTypesOfKey() is called with 0 group, it will resize the key symbols table to 0 but leave the key actions unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
If later, the same function is called with a non-zero value of groups, this will cause a buffer overflow because the key actions are of the wrong size.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26598: Out-of-bounds write in CreatePointerBarrierClient().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function GetBarrierDevice() searches for the pointer device based on its device id and returns the matching value, or supposedly NULL if no match was found.<br/>
<br/>
However the code will return the last element of the list if no matching device id was found which can lead to out of bounds memory access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26599: Use of uninitialized pointer in compRedirectWindow().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The function compCheckRedirect() may fail if it cannot allocate the backing pixmap. In that case, compRedirectWindow() will return a BadAlloc error without the validation of the window tree marked just before, which leaves the validate data partly initialized, and the use of an uninitialized pointer later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26600: Use-after-free in PlayReleasedEvents().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a device is removed while still frozen, the events queued for that device remain while the device itself is freed and replaying the events will cause a use after free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVE-2025-26601: Use-after-free in SyncInitTrigger().</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When changing an alarm, the values of the change mask are evaluated one after the other, changing the trigger values as requested and eventually, SyncInitTrigger() is called. If one of the changes triggers an error, the function will return early, not adding the new sync object. This can be used to cause a use after free when the alarm eventually<br/>
triggers.</p>

      <title>Fortune Avenue is a hyped-up fast-paced chaotic spin on Monopoly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fortune Avenue is Monopoly but not as you know it. A hyped-up and colourful spin on the classic game, with a rather different way to play and it's highly competitive. Developed by Binogure Studio in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a> on Linux, the same developer behind City Game Studio.</p>
<p>If you've ever played Monopoly you'll understand the basics. You each pick a character and move around the board, building up your collection of properties. Fortune Avenue is far more chaotic though with you all voting on various rules throughout the game, and you can even buy-up someone else's property if you have the monies for it. There's a fair amount of random events that happen during each game to keep you on your toes too, there's always something going on to keep you interested.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12758179531740566819gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Giving you the ability to buy-out others is quite fun, and frustrating at the same time. Nothing is safe in Fortune Avenue, especially when you get to spin the wheel of fortune, and end up with a card that allows you to free up any city to remove a building. You can really mess with others in it.</p>
<p>There's a demo available for Steam Next Fest that's definitely worth checking out. With Native Linux support it works great. I think Fortune Avenue could end up being a favourite, especially as we don't see a lot of board-game styled titles like this and it's a genuinely fun twist on a classic.</p>
<p>Valve have also rated it Steam Deck Verified as of the latest updates to it. Nice to see that ahead of release.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Board Elements: From melting ice floes to bustling airports, every corner of the board holds a surprise.</li>
<li>Strategic Rule Voting: Every 12 dice rolls, players vote on new rules that can drastically alter the game's dynamics.</li>
<li>Speed Up Mechanism: A helicopter targets the poorest players, ensuring a fast-paced game that minimizes frustration.</li>
<li>Elimination Bonus: Gain a $100K bonus for each player you eliminate, adding a competitive edge.</li>
<li>Anti-Cheat Measures: With physics-based dice and wheel of fortune, plus advanced obfuscation and VAC, the integrity of the game is maintained.</li>
<li>Rich Multiplayer Experience: Peer-to-peer connectivity with a robust recovery mechanism ensures seamless gameplay.</li>
<li>Diverse Game Pieces and Boards: Choose from 12 unique pieces and explore 4 different themed boards.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Maze Mice feels like Pac-Man and Survivor-like Bullet Heavens had a baby</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Survivor-like bullet heavens are are all the rage right now from Vampire Survivors to Brotato and everything in between. Maze Mice answers the question no one asked: what if it was like Pac-Man?</p>
<p>Saying Pac-Man and the bullet heaven survivor games had a baby here really is the most accurate way I could describe it, and after spending a bunch of time with the demo I am absolutely hooked on the idea. Made by TrampolineTales in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>, the same developer who gave us the excellent Luck be a Landlord.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8690193901740566021gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Much like the Pac, you go through a little maze picking up orbs along the way while trying to avoid cats (you're a mouse). In true survivor-like style these orbs give you experience to level up, and then pick some abilities. These abilities can give you all sorts of powers like auto-firing projectiles, leaving a path of fire behind you to take down some cats and more.</p>
<p>It has a time-stop mechanic too, so there's absolutely no rush, it's surprisingly chill. Nothing moves until you do.</p>
<p>Try out the Steam Next Fest Demo it's well worth your time.</p>

      <title>Framework announce the Framework Desktop, Framework Laptop 12 and upgraded Framework Laptop 13</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework continue doing some really impressive stuff with their modular approach to hardware, and they just had a big event to reveal the Framework Desktop, Framework Laptop 12 and an upgraded Framework Laptop 13.</p>
<p>An especially interesting event for Linux fans too, with Framework founder Nirav Patel giving their Linux compatibility a shout-out on stage at the event on how they "design deliberately for Linux compatibility". Linux support was mentioned multiple times during the event, and in the Desktop segment there was even a direct shout-out for Bazzite and Playtron with both of them having demos at the event too. According to Patel, 2025 is "truly the year of the Linux gaming desktop".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20107925681740563510gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The upgraded Framework Laptop 13 brings with it AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series, a revamped thermal system, a new keyboard and there's also new Bezel and Expansion Card colour options. They said that "any Framework Laptop 13 owner, going all the way back to the original 11th Gen Intel Core version in 2021, can pick up the new modules and upgrade". This is expected to ship in April.</p>
<p>Another fun one is the newly announced Framework Laptop 12. This is a convertible (foldable) touchscreen notebook, that takes the repairability and upgradability they're known for and puts it all into a smaller lower-cost device. This is expected to ship mid-2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18864005401740563554gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>One I'm very interested in though is the Framework Desktop. A really small Mini-ITX desktop powered by AMD Ryzen AI Max processors. Desktops are <em>already</em> modular though but they said how they wanted to "make this space as accessible as we possibly can by building a desktop that is simultaneously small and simple and incredibly powerful and customizable". More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Framework Desktop’s Ryzen AI Max-powered Mainboard is a standard Mini-ITX form factor with ATX headers, a PCIe x4 slot, and a broad set of rear I/O (including 2x USB4, 2x DisplayPort, HDMI, and 5Gbit Ethernet), so you can drop it into your own case if you prefer. We developed a semi-custom 400W power supply with FSP in a standard Flex ATX form factor. We use standard 120mm CPU fans with a thermal system co-developed with Cooler Master and Noctua, and you can choose to bring your own fan as well if you prefer. We enabled two PCIe NVME M.2 2280 slots for up to 16TB of storage and Wi-Fi 7 through an RZ717 Wi-Fi module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Plenty of customization is enabled on the desktop too along with a carrying handle to move it around, as it really is small. They even make use of their Expansion Card system from Framework Laptops, with two slots on the front of it available for front port customization. A downside here is that the LPDDR5x is soldered on, as working with AMD they said how they "ultimately determined that it wasn’t technically feasible to land modular memory at high throughput with the 256-bit memory bus". Not cheap though, starting at £1,135 for the AMD Ryzen AI Max 385 model with 32GB RAM and that's <em>without</em> storage or a CPU fan. First shipments expected early Q3 2025.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck Folio is a slim protective travel cover that doubles up as a stand</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a lot of different stands and protective cases for the Steam Deck, all with their own unique selling point and the Steam Deck Folio looks like another interesting option. Coming soon to Kickstarter, one of the designers involved emailed over details about it.</p>
<p>Compatible with the LCD and OLED Steam Deck it covers up and protects the screen, locks the sticks in place and can double up as a stand as well. It's really slim so it doesn't take up much room at all, which is great for space conscious travellers. It even fits inside Valve's travel case for that extra bit of protection and still fits into a dock while attached.</p>
<p>I did have a concern about the attachment system since it uses magnets, and we've seen big issues with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/project-killswitch-sales-suspended-as-the-kickstand-messed-with-the-steam-deck-fan/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">magnets messing with the Steam Deck fans</a> (and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/01/stop-mixing-magnets-with-the-steam-deck-or-face-fan-and-temperature-troubles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another</a>) in the past. Remembering those issues, I spoke to their team about it and they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In regards to magnets, the Dbrand Project Killswitch placed powerful magnets very near to the central fan hub itself.</p>
<p>The magnets used in the Steam Deck Folio are positioned so as to not interfere with the fan.<br/>
We have performed practical testing and magnetic field strength analysis on Steam Decks with both Delta and Huaying fans without issue.</p>
<p>In addition we will continue to perform more testing as we move through the development process, if the Kickstarter is successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have a look at it in the video below: </p>

      <title>Simple GOG client for Linux, Minigalaxy v1.3.2 released with improved game installs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you prefer to buy your games for Linux on <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, there's a fresh update to Minigalaxy, the open source simple GOG client.</p>
<p>Compared with the likes of Lutris and Heroic Games Launcher that bundle lots of features and different stores, Minigalaxy has a singular focus — getting your <a href="http://gog.com" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> games simply and easily on Linux. Either Native Linux games or Windows games with Wine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5098355631740487620gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The major changes in Minigalaxy version 1.3.2 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Completely reworked windows wine installation. This should solve a lot of problems with failing game installs. Innoextract (if installed) is only used to detect and configure the installation language. (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Variables and arguments in game settings can now contain blanks when quoted shell-style (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Minigalaxy will now create working Desktop Shortcuts for wine games (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Fix games with binaries in a directory not launching in some cases</li>
<li>Minor UI change in the dialog for third-party logins (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Desktop shortcuts created by Minigalaxy will now be updated with environment and launch argument changes from the game's property dialog when OK is clicked (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Clean-up and fixes of the code used for grid and list style library views (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Desktop shortcuts for windows games can now have icons, if gog provides them in the game info api 'images' section (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in download_manager that prevents correct resume of downloads with 50%+ progress after restart (thanks to GB609)</li>
<li>Make sure all translations are included in releases</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see the project has picked up another developer, GB609, who did a lot of work for this release.</p>

      <title>Happy three years to the Steam Deck - the Linux gaming machine that changed everything</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/steam-deck-initial-review/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">three years today</a> since Valve released the Steam Deck. Not only has Valve shown how incredible Linux actually can be as a gaming platform, but they really kicked the industry into gear on PC gaming handhelds.</p>
<p>What a success it's been! Selling multiple millions, although we don't know the exact number since Valve don't really like to talk in such specifics. And we're closing in on 18,000 games rated at least Playable (although the rating system is a bit off at times), that's a whole lot of gaming you can do from the comfort of your couch, on the bus, the toilet — wherever.</p>
<p>During this time Valve have released <strong>14</strong> major updates to Proton, the compatibility layer that runs Windows games on Linux systems like SteamOS / Steam Deck. Going from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/02/proton-7-easy-anti-cheat-improvements-more-games-for-linux-a-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 7.0-1</a> in February 2022 just before the Steam Deck release up to the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a> in December 2024. The progress on game compatibility has been impressive (although anti-cheat is still a real problem). That's only counting numbered Proton updates too, there's plenty more that have gone into Proton Experimental and Proton Hotfix in between. <em>If you're confused on the different Proton versions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">be sure to read my guide</a>.</em></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">We've seen some huge updates to SteamOS Linux during this time too. Going back through all the updates since the original release we've seen Valve add the likes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per-app performance profiles.</li>
<li>HDR, VRR and display colour settings.</li>
<li>Game recording.</li>
<li>A lock screen for security.</li>
<li>Refresh rate switcher.</li>
<li>A window switcher for when games have multiple windows (like launchers remaining open).</li>
<li>Night Mode.</li>
<li>Enabled customization of the performance overlay.</li>
<li>An improved Offline Mode (it used to require a reboot).</li>
<li>Major version updates to the KDE Plasma Desktop Mode.</li>
<li>Improvements for docking the Steam Deck like display interface scaling.</li>
<li>Various performance improvements and GPU driver upgrades.</li>
<li>Support for Bluetooth A2DP and BAP profiles.</li>
<li>Mura Compensation.</li>
<li>Added support for some HDMI CEC features to their official Dock.</li>
<li>Added overclocking controls on Steam Deck LCD.</li>
<li>+ so much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's just me cherry-picking additions in some big SteamOS updates, we've also seen some huge upgrades to the Steam Client as a whole too, a lot of which the Steam Deck has also benefited from. You certainly can't say Valve have been sitting around - they're always doing <em>something</em>. Who can also forget the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/steam-deck-oled-is-just-pure-joy-the-definitive-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam Deck OLED release</a>, Valve's definitive edition of the handheld with <em><strong>masses</strong></em> of improvements.</p>
<p>With Valve showing the way, we've seen an explosion in the number of different PC gaming handhelds too. Previously limited to smaller high-priced vendors, it's all become a lot more accessible. Valve <em>proved</em> there's a market for it. While others have been chasing refreshes with improved specifications, and at times ludicrous prices, the Steam Deck has soldiered on to be more of a dedicated platform. We've seen the ASUS ROG Ally and ASUS ROG Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go and Lenovo Legion Go S, Acer Nitro Blaze 7, 8 and 11, ZOTAC Zone, MSI Claw A1M and the MSI Claw 8 AI+. <em>That's on top of the constant refreshes from other smaller vendors.</em></p>
<p>One day hopefully we will see another Steam Machine / Steam Console. I had some thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/what-valve-would-need-to-do-to-make-a-steam-console-a-success/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">what Valve could do to make such a thing a success this time</a>. I'm also especially looking forward to the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">upcoming public Beta of SteamOS 3</a> to see what people and other hardware vendors do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Steam Deck Day everyone.</strong></p>

      <title>SteamDB now lets you filter out Steam games with AI Generation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you don't want Steam games that have AI Generation in them, you might want to check out the new filter on SteamDB. Making it a bit easier to get rid of them from your searches. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/indie-devs-have-begun-adding-a-no-generative-ai-stamp-to-their-store-pages/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Indie devs have begun adding a no generative AI stamp to their store pages</a>.</em></p>
<p>This new filter depends on the AI disclosures that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve require</a> developers to put on their Steam pages, so it's only as accurate as the developers who actually fill it out accurately.</p>
<p>On any of the lists on SteamDB, you need to open the "Filter by user tags" sidebar section and enter in "AI Content Disclosed" and then either pick to have them or not. Example shot below of the <a href="https://steamdb.info/sales/event/714486390316859705/?displayOnly=Demo&amp;sort=online_desc&amp;tagid=-1368160" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB Steam Next Fest page</a> filtered to just demos, and no AI content:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14328770431740479113gol1.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14328770431740479113gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Hopefully Valve directly will soon add a proper filter to Steam for this. But until then, the community site <a href="https://steamdb.info/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> keeps showing how useful it can be.</p>
<p>Activision also recently (finally) admitted it uses AI for Call of Duty, with the Call of Duty <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1938090/Call_of_Duty/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> page now having an AI content disclosure that reads "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets". Players have spotted a few places where it was likely used for cosmetics like some loading screens and player calling cards but Activision haven't specified where it's used. If the likes of Activision can't get away from disclosing it on Steam, hopefully Valve will keep ensuring more developers list it properly.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 Classic is coming to Steam thanks to Valve adding TF2 to the Source SDK</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Team Fortress 2 Classic, a mod that aims to re-imagine the early post-launch era of Team Fortress 2, will be released on Steam.</p>
<p>Recently we had the news that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/team-fortress-2-major-update-released-and-source-available-for-modders-via-the-source-sdk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve had effectively made Team Fortress 2 "Source Available"</a>, as it's now part of the Source SDK. In the announcement Valve said developers would be able to release their mods on Steam, and so it's happening. A new Team Fortress 2 Classic Steam page has been put up, although there's no date listed on it other than 2025.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8893674131740477792gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>More about it from the Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Team Fortress 2 Classic</strong> is a mod for Team Fortress 2 that re-imagines the early post-launch era — circa 2008 to 2009 — of the original game. Starting from there, we've added quality-of-life features, remade and reworked scrapped content, and built onto it with full-size updates in homage to TF2's timeless style and tone.</p>
<p><strong>NEW-OLD FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Meet the Civilian, a brand-new special class based on the legacy Team Fortress Classic character, and deliver him mostly-unharmed to the objective in VIP mode.</li>
<li>Use TF2 prerelease-inspired weapons like the Nailgun, the Dynamite Pack, and the Tranquilizer Gun, all redesigned from the ground up to feel right at home with what's already there.</li>
<li>Go on a rampage in Four-Team matches, where GRN and YLW bring their unique (yet strangely identical) brand of violence to Arena, King of the Hill, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>NEW-NEW FEATURES</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive new gamemodes, including Domination, Territorial Domination, and VIP Race — all playable on professional-quality official maps, with more yet to come.</li>
<li>Jump pads, flak cannons, bricks, chains wrapped around your fists; made-in-house weapons that go beyond mere sidegrades, and dramatically change how you play the game.</li>
<li>Extensive modding support, allowing players to customize the look of their game, and allowing servers to host advanced custom weapon packs and maps.</li>
<li>A whole host of visual enhancements, including improved textures, models, mapping features, and restored toon-style shading that was mostly absent in the retail release.</li>
<li>A chicken, or so we're led to believe.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developers of the mod likely have to port over their changes to the newer SDK, so it may still be a while until the Steam release is available.</p>

      <title>Seriously clever twin-stick shooter Windowkill adds Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Windowkill is a twin-stick shooter where the game window itself is constantly closing in on you. A really clever idea, and a game I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/windowkill-is-a-clever-multi-window-twin-stick-shooter-that-moves-around-your-screen/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">had a lot of fun with previously</a> and now it has improved Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>In the 1 year anniversary update that's now available, the developer mentioned it's now Steam Deck Verified, with Valve giving it the rating on February 11th on the Native Linux version (made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>).</p>
<p>New feature highlight for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2726450/view/501691675000703296" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update 4.0.5</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added custom asset refresh button
	<ul>
<li>This will reload custom asset files in the current tab, without needing to reload the game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added "now playing" popup when shuffle is enabled
	<ul>
<li>Includes a toggle option to disable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added "drag aid windows by center" option
	<ul>
<li>When enabled, this allows moving peer and drain without needing to click on the titlebar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new menu window to "friend"
	<ul>
<li>This allows toggling visibility, changing colors, and quitting to the title</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added a new audio visualization background type, and example background "thump"</li>
<li>Added challenge run icon to the in-game UI</li>
<li>Added "UI text scale" option</li>
<li>Added new "steamdeck" window theme</li>
<li>Added Steam Deck-specific controller input icons</li>
<li>Added silly anniversary-only crown change</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've not seen it before the trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="3fqqN2rsGz0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7973de61a6c6e9c7be82fdb947661128.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/3fqqN2rsGz0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I was curious how this would actually look on Steam Deck. As when you think about it, this game was really designed for a desktop PC. The whole idea of having multiple windows like that is not something you would see with how you usually interact with the Steam Deck in Gaming Mode.</p>
<p>So I gave it a fresh spin today to see how it was done and actually — it's still just as <em>brilliant</em> on Steam Deck. The window mechanic with how it's implemented works really well here too, even with the smaller screen.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2380524461740477213gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2380524461740477213gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>

      <title>The Talos Principle: Reawakened launches in April with a demo live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One of the best puzzle games ever returns! Croteam and Devolver Digital have announced The Talos Principle: Reawakened is set for launch on April 10, and there's a demo you can try out right now too as part of Steam Next Fest. <em>You'll need Proton to play this one on Linux.</em></p>
<p>The demo at least won't be leaving when Next Fest ends, as they've said it will be up until release. Remade with Unreal Engine 5, hopefully the performance on this one won't be problematic like a lot of recent UE games are (although Epic Games are making steps to help). This version of the game also includes a powerful in-game editor for modders.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Talos Principle: Reawakened introduces new content, enhanced gameplay, and a gorgeously upgraded presentation. Relive the critically acclaimed expansion Road to Gehenna and dive into an all-new chapter, In the Beginning. Discover the story of Alexandra Drennan as she faces profound existential questions while orchestrating the Simulation's first critical test, challenging players to think deeply about the human condition.</p>

      <title>Steam Next Fest - February 2025 is live with tons of demos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has launched Steam Next Fest, another good opportunity for you to jump in and test some upcoming games that runs through until March 3rd. You'll be able to download demos, watch developer livestreams and more.</p>

<p>Thanks to Valve's Proton, most of the demos should run on Linux without you even needing to check. Unless they have some kernel-level anti-cheat forced on them or other strange Windows behaviour not implemented in Proton yet.</p>
<p>Personally, I was quite excited for <strong>Mecha BREAK</strong> but the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/anti-cheat-stops-mecha-break-running-on-desktop-linux-but-works-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">anti-cheat is problematic</a> with how it blocks Desktop Linux. Although it does allow people to play on Steam Deck. <strong>RoadCraft</strong> is another I was excited about but it's <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/sadly-the-roadcraft-demo-is-currently-broken-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sadly broken across Steam Deck and Desktop Linux</a>.</p>
<p>Another I checked out early was <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811340/Spray_Paint_Simulator/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Spray Paint Simulator</a></strong>. It's like the direct opposite of PowerWash Simulator and worked perfectly with the latest <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton 9.0-4</a>. Instead of cleaning up you're preparing with tape and papering over things you don't want painted, to then make a big mess everywhere. Something about it is just <em>incredibly</em> therapeutic and I want more of it — a lot more.</p>

<p>At the complete opposite end of the genre spectrum is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3351700/The_First_Berserker_Khazan_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The First Berserker</a></strong>, a hardcore action RPG souls-like. It's a lot more demanding of your attention and the demo runs <em>beautifully</em> too. So much so that it's gained a Very Positive user rating on Steam. This is not usually a genre I would go for but the visuals and the world really do look great, and it's impressive from a performance look as well with it being silky smooth. Definitely worth a shot if you're in the mood for some sword swinging with good visuals.</p>

<p>Another shout out for <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265960/Adventures_of_a_Cat_in_Space/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Adventures of a Cat in Space</a></strong> (Native Linux) because it's really sweet. If you love point and click adventures, it's one for you. Just don't blame me if the theme song gets stuck in your head. It randomly pops into mine at least once a day since testing out the demo <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/adventures-of-a-cat-in-space-is-an-upcoming-musical-adventure-starring-arthur-darvill/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously</a>.</p>

<p>Being a big fan of the original extreme sports game Descenders, I think <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Descenders Next</a></strong> could turn out to be another great one. This time with the addition of a few different board sports in addition to bikes, it's a whole lot bigger and better. So far it runs great on Linux too (and they just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/750515187597967691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a release date with it getting Steam Deck Verified). <em>They <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2375530/discussions/0/597393615056061535/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">need to fix</a> the demo launch options right now though.</em></p>

<p>Another pick for those who like things a bit more chill is <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2355150/Mudborne_Frog_Management_Sim/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mudborne: Frog Management Sim</a></strong> (Native Linux). A game about running around capturing and breeding frogs. From the developer of beekeeping sim APICO, this is high up on my list of wants.</p>

<p>I personally find these big events more than a little overwhelming. I fear I'm missing out on so much because masses of developers choose to only have their demos up for such a limited amount of time. I'll continue highlighting games and demos during the event, just like I do every day if there's some I spot that are particularly interesting. Check out the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Demo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Demo article tag</a> for any previous and future coverage.</p>
<p>Be sure to also join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a> to easily share more games you find.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Next Fest</a>. The event runs through until March 3rd.</p>

      <title>Sadly the RoadCraft demo is currently broken on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At least on AMD systems like Steam Deck and my Desktop Linux install, it seems like the demo of RoadCraft from Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment is quite broken. Shame, as this is one of the games I am currently most excited about from the team behind the popular SnowRunner.</p>
<p>On my Desktop Linux install (Kubuntu 24.10) tested across Proton 9 and Proton Experimental, it will completely lock up my system when trying to enter into a mission. This has been tested numerous times now and it just doesn't work. It could well be a RADV Mesa driver bug, I don't have an NVIDIA system to test.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck also has a similar problem, although it's more graceful where it will crash and quit back to the Steam Library.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1004374181740419964gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8474" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted a bug report with Valve</a> including some logs, so hopefully a resolution can be found. For now, it appears this one is a no-go, but at least with the demo we've been able to catch the issue before the full launch which is due May 20th so it's not far off.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck SteamOS 3.6.22 brings a fix for pre-compiled shader downloads</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve just released a tiny SteamOS 3.6.22 "Volcanic Activity" Beta for Steam Deck, which includes a fix for a rather annoying issue. You need to be in either the <em>Beta</em> or <em>Preview</em> update channels to receive this update before it's rolled out for everyone.</p>
<p>The only <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/519706073503894113?snr=2___" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">listed</a> change is "Fixed a recent regression where pre-compiled shaders wouldn't be downloaded", an issue I saw reported by quite a few people across various social media channels. Nice to see it sorted.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steam-deck-steamos-3-6-21-released-fixing-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-eyes-and-security-bugs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS 3.6.21 stable update released earlier in February</a>, which fixed some security issues and Indiana Jones eye rendering. If you missed it Valve also <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/proton-hotfix-updated-to-fix-marvel-rivals-and-indiana-jones-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">updated Proton Hotfix to fix Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones</a> on Steam Deck / Linux.</p>
<p>I must admit, every time I see a SteamOS update I get a little excited that it might finally be the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">public SteamOS 3 Beta that Valve have been planning</a>. Hopefully that will come soonish.</p>

      <title>Anti-cheat stops Mecha BREAK running on Desktop Linux but works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here we go again. One game I was excited about was the upcoming Mecha BREAK, which currently has a playtest demo on Steam but they've added in anti-cheat.</p>
<p>Specifically it's using the Kernel Level "Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE)" as noted on the Steam page for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870990/Mecha_BREAK_Demo/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">demo</a>. On Desktop Linux the launcher can appear, but the game will <em>not</em> actually load at all. The Start button can be clicked in the launcher, and it acts like it's going to load but after a while it will go back to saying Start. Nothing actually loads up apart from the launcher. <em>After getting the launcher to load once, it then wouldn't load up again after.</em></p>
<p>However, they are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2452280/view/503943474819629074" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">planning</a> Steam Deck support where they said: "Mecha BREAK is not yet fully optimized for Steam Deck. We're actively working on improvements to ensure smoother gameplay in the future". Right now, it <em>does</em> actually load up on Steam Deck, go in-game and is fully playable.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21225575111740407062gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21225575111740407062gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12252002101740407963gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12252002101740407963gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12678129341740407964gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/12678129341740407964gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mecha BREAK on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>On Steam Deck with the default settings it runs at an <em>acceptable</em> 30FPS out of the box and does actually feel pretty good in the combat without any tweaks needed. Numerous parts of the UI are too small though, especially the button icons, and due to the FSR the visuals can be a little on the blurry side due to the lower resolution.</p>
<p>Apart from that though, the gameplay is genuinely good fun. No issues going through the whole tutorial (picture above), and then playing online with others as well (pictured below).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17729914671740408775gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17729914671740408775gol1.jpeg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Mecha BREAK on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>Back to the other side though: the desktop Linux problem seems like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/delta-force-developer-mentions-they-will-look-at-supporting-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">same issue with Delta Force</a> which also uses Anti-Cheat Expert (ACE). It appears to approve the Steam Deck hardware directly, which is why it works there but doesn't work on desktop Linux.</p>
<p>This separation of desktop Linux and Steam Deck will end up quite problematic in the long-run, if a better solution isn't found. Especially with more devices coming with SteamOS like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/lenovo-legion-go-s-with-valves-steamos-is-official-expected-to-launch-in-may/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Valve planning a public SteamOS 3 Beta</a> for people to try on other handhelds. Seems like we may need to add a Steam Deck only tag to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our anti-cheat compatibility page</a> if this continues.</p>
<p><em>I've emailed the developer for a statement on any planned changes.</em></p>

      <title>Evolution sim Thrive adds radioactive chunks, environmental tolerances and thermosynthesis</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The open source and cross-platform evolution sim Thrive has added in some even more advanced gameplay elements, making it a whole lot more interesting. Survival is very much the name of the game here, evolution is a tough business and you start off at the bottom. Much like the classic Spore from EA, the microscopic stage is full of features. But they're still working on the later game.</p>
<p>Some big new features have been added in Thrive 0.8.1 including environmental tolerances, meaning you need to adapt to different conditions across the planet. There's new radiation-eating cells, be wary of the green lights, it's pretty — but may be deadly. You can adapt to eat away at the radioactive chunks though. There's even a new full thermosynthesis implementation meaning you can use temperature to generate energy, although this feature is only in non-LAWK (life as we know it) games which you can pick when you start a new game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="1wqj45ZsTmk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d83994640f92276a6cf474574f55f6ce.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/1wqj45ZsTmk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some other new bits in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added microbe background blur and enabled distortion effect by default.</li>
<li>Added an option to select between the different fullscreen modes supported by Godot Engine. When using exclusive fullscreen mode this fixes a one pixel border problem on Windows.</li>
<li>Late multicellular was split into its own full stage: Macroscopic.</li>
<li>Implemented multicellular organism statistics panel.</li>
<li>Various improvements to auto-evo to allow it to evolve new organelles / upgrades. And improved the microbe AI to be able to use newer features of the game.</li>
<li>Fixes to the organelle suggestions feature to make it not suggest the nucleus too early.</li>
<li>Improved cell image generation to make it less likely for the images to be cutoff.</li>
<li>Tutorial and Thriveopedia tips page improvements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>How fun is it? Right now, that's difficult to answer. It's a somewhat complicated game, it takes quite a while to learn and since the game evolves with you it's quite different every time. That, and every update brings in major new additions to it. Thoroughly interesting though and it has some really unique ideas, and more depth than pretty much any other evolution sim I've ever seen.</p>

      <title>Indie devs have begun adding a no generative AI stamp to their store pages</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AI this, AI that - you can't go anywhere without something trying to force AI on you. Usually a company trying to get you to buy into what they've wasted billions on. So indie devs have begun fighting back with their No Gen AI Seal.</p>
<p>There's an increasing amount of developers using some form of AI generation from small developers to the AAA lot that I keep spotting recently, and so you might want to pick some out that are actually 100% human made. While Steam (being the easiest example) does have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/valve-announces-new-rules-for-games-with-ai-content-on-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">newer rules around AI disclosures</a>, these are buried at the bottom of store pages and can be pretty easy to miss.</p>
<p>One way would be for developers to put a big badge on a store page to show off their human side, and that's exactly what some indie developers have chosen to start doing.</p>
<p>Announced by Alex Kanaris-Sotiriou of Polygon Treehouse (Mythwrecked &amp; Röki) on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kanaratron.bsky.social/post/3li7t5wpc7s2l" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, they've launched the free to use <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/no-gen-ai-seal" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">No Gen AI Seal</a> available via the Polygon Treehouse website. Writing about why it can be problematic the website states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generative AI is a technology that can create pictures, movies, audio (music or voice action) and writing using artificial intelligence. The issue is that these generative technologies are trained on existing works by human artists who have not given their permission, or been compensated, for their work being utilised. Essentially their work has been stolen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The seal looks like this:</p>

<p>You can see it on the store pages for the likes of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000210/Mythwrecked_Ambrosia_Island/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1226670/Rosewater/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Rosewater</a> and more in the sidebar.</p>
<p>Perhaps in future we might see stores add specific filters to select "No Gen AI". It's clearly a growing market though, which is what pushed Valve to add their new disclosure rules, and we're likely to see a whole lot more games use generative AI as time goes on. It's going to get more messy and confusing for consumers as time goes on, at least until the ridiculous bubble finally bursts.</p>
<p>There's a lot of silliness going around like how <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/phil-spencer-of-microsoft-gaming-thinks-generative-ai-will-help-game-preservation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming thinks generative AI will help game preservation</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/take-two-ceo-believes-ai-will-actually-increase-employment-and-productivity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Take-Two CEO believing AI will increase employment and productivity</a>.

      <title>The tactical FPS &#39;Due Process&#39; anti-cheat now supports Linux - plus it has a huge discount</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Due Process from developer Giant Enemy Crab uses Easy Anti-Cheat that previously blocked Linux (and so Steam Deck too), but they've now enabled Linux players to jump in. Commenting on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dueprocess/comments/1ivk6cg/comment/me67czg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> a developer directly mentioned "We pushed an update to the servers yesterday that should allow Linux users using Proton to connect".</p>
<p>The game just recently had a big update too, and it has a 94% discount on Steam until March 5, so this seems like the perfect time to jump in and play.</p>
<p>See the most recent update trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oHi8G6iXFg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1df80afd7421c417751e743fd1ca8ff5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oHi8G6iXFg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due Process is a tactical FPS about planning and teamwork that rewards communication with teammates, allows players to draw a "playbook" directly onto the map during the planning phases, and presents a novel situation each play session thanks to a bounty of procedurally generated, hand-curated maps.</p>
<p>Fresh maps make Due Process great. Levels are built in-house via a procedurally assisted level generation process and are delivered weekly via steam update, which means you won't be playing on the same stale level. Our level designers edit each level before it goes out and are constantly trying new concepts.</p>
<p>Teamwork starts with a goal. Discuss your strategy over voice chat, and use the planning phase to draw up a plan of attack. Deploy your assets wisely over the course of three rounds, as anything fielded from your armory won't come back if destroyed or lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also doing an AMA (Ask me anything) on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dueprocess/comments/1iwrr6g/due_process_ama_with_jett_and_tetra_at_6pm_gmt/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit</a> today at 9PM UTC.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux anti-cheat compatibility page</a> was updated to list it.</p>

      <title>Feed the demons, don&#39;t fight them in the deckbuilder Hungry Horrors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you love deck-builders? Hungry Horrors is quite an inventive take on the genre where instead of fighting them, you cook for them! <em>Another one made with <a href="https://godotengine.org" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Godot</a>.</em></p>
<p>Your deck of cards are built up from various recipes you learn, giving you access to throw various meals at the horrors that await you. For each creature you need to fill them up to satisfy them, before they get too close to slay you and then you're back in the kitchen.</p>
<p>There's some fun game mechanics here like certain foods causing creatures to crave something, and if you manage to get them to eat what they crave you'll get a bonus. It's a race against turns though, as they will gradually step closer towards you. Much like Slay the Spire, it will tell you what the enemy creature plans to do on the next turn, giving you a chance to prepare.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jOV7f-G-pic"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d05fb4aa35856a8a8603b56025eafe78.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jOV7f-G-pic" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's not just the creatures that get hungry though, you do too. You have to balance their hunger bar with your own as you progress through each battle. So your meal cards can also be used on your own character, as well as the enemy, but feeding yourself stops you feeding them in the same turn. Certain creatures really like certain dishes too, which you'll learn as you play through to get bonuses.</p>
<p>Really fun idea. Lots to enjoy about it. Looking forward to seeing this one expand.</p>
<p>There's an early Alpha available on the itch store. Can also be tested in the browser.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>Morrowind game engine OpenMW gearing up for a huge new 0.49 release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in the Release Candidate stage, Morrowind open source game engine OpenMW is getting ready for a huge new release. OpenMW is cross-platform and enables you to play Morrowind nicely on modern systems, with plenty of enhancements.</p>
<p>Their team recently put up an <a href="https://openmw.org/2025/openmw-0-49-0-rc-bringing-you-up-to-speed/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> to go over some details noting how it's the "largest release yet, having been in development since August 2022". One of the big changes they noted is to combat mechanics as they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.49.0 makes some large steps towards making melee combat reimplementation accurate to Morrowind. Importantly, it moves melee target evaluation from the point of impact to the moment of weapon release. This is necessary to ensure the correct audiovisual feedback for missed hits.<br/>
We do not intend to meaningfully overhaul or redesign the classical experience of Morrowind, and we believe it would best be handled by mods from the community. It is currently planned for combat dehardcoding to be a focus in 0.5X releases, which would allow scripts to overhaul it, and for certain combat AI changes to be introduced to further ensure melee combat remains as (not very) challenging as in Morrowind.<br/>
An important detail to note, however: in RC4 and later builds, like in 0.48.0, the target must be within weapon reach upon impact for the hit to be successful. This means that dodging attacks by quickly backing away from the opponent remains possible even if the hit is evaluated as a success upon weapon release. This is consistent with Morrowind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other changes can be checked out via the growing <a href="https://github.com/OpenMW/openmw/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">changelog</a> on their GitHub page which is really quite long. There's a lot of bug fixes but some exciting new features too. Here's just a few of the new bits coming in OpenMW 0.49:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infinite fall failsafe.</li>
<li>Shader-based water ripples.</li>
<li>Rain and snow collisions.</li>
<li>Animation blending - smooth animation transitions with modding support.</li>
<li>Playing music via Lua scripts and many more Lua modding improvements like a Factions API, Save Game API, Sounds API, NPC AI settings via Lua and more.</li>
<li>Specular lighting from point light sources.</li>
<li>Launcher improvements.</li>
<li>Support high-resolution cursor textures.</li>
<li>Support for non-adaptive VSync.</li>
<li>Controller binding for tab for menu navigation.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Neverwinter Nights Enhanced Edition gets a sequel DLC and it looks like Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition is on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition from Beamdog just got a brand new sequel story DLC, and it also seems we're getting Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition from Aspyr Media.</p>
<p>Neverwinter Nights 2 Enhanced Edition got listed on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2738630/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> recently, and while it hasn't yet seen an announcement, the EULA as shown on SteamDB mentions Aspyr Media. So we'll have to keep our eyes peeled for an announcement on that one.</p>
<p>Back to the original Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition from Beamdog, they teamed up with developer Luke Scull (author and lead designer of Tyrants of the Moonsea) to create Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition Doom of Icewind Dale, a full official continuation of the classic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3255336871740390265gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An expansive DLC with 10-15+ hours of gameplay</li>
<li>Navigate the world map to explore 14 areas in Icewind Dale including Icewind Pass, the Dwarven Valley, and the Reghed Glacier. Visit several of the famed Ten Towns!</li>
<li>Recruit from 5 different companions for your party, including returning characters from the original Wailing Death campaign as well as Tyrants of the Moonsea</li>
<li>14 new monsters to face off against, including new creature portraits</li>
<li>16 new music tracks and 24 new ambient area tracks bring Icewind Dale to life in all its majestic beauty</li>
<li>An official sequel to the Original Campaign that also ties in with the Shadows of Undrentide, Hordes of the Underdark, and Ossian Studios’ campaigns</li>

      <title>Proton Hotfix updated to fix Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve have released a fresh update to the special Proton Hotfix version. This fixes up issues on Steam Deck / Linux across Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you're confused on all the different Proton versions <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/why-are-there-so-many-different-proton-versions-proton-8-proton-9-experimental-ge-proton/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">see my guide for more info</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plagman.bsky.social" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said across two posts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix has been deployed to address the crash on startup with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the latest update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Proton Hotfix has been deployed earlier today to address the intermittent stutter issue with Marvel Rivals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see that Valve can get moving so quickly on issues in popular games. Hopefully with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/valve-confirms-a-public-beta-of-steamos-is-coming-as-steamos-expands-beyond-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamOS rolling out to more devices</a> we'll see developers test their updates more often instead of things getting broken like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/875175781740230253gol1.jpg"/><br/>
<em>Pictured - Marvel Rivals</em></p>
<p>If you have any Proton compatibility manually selected for them in the Properties on Steam, you can just unselect them to let Proton Hotfix be picked up for them automatically which Valve have now set as the default for both games.</p>
<p>Want to know how to change Proton versions? I also have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/guides/view/how-to-change-the-proton-version-on-linux-steamos-and-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a guide available for that</a>.</p>

      <title>Among Us 3D announced supporting cross-play with Among Us VR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While it's not compatible with the original 2D game, the announcement of Among Us 3D is quite exciting bridging the worlds of traditional 3D and VR together for the popular social deduction game. A demo will be available during Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>At release players in Among Us 3D will be able to play with those across  Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO. The VR version is actually going to get a rebrand to just Among Us 3D along with bringing a new in-game currency to expand the customization options and support ongoing expansions to the content.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UYMaaMTgxa4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/727de1ac106366beca092f5db3075c54.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UYMaaMTgxa4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Native Proximity Voice Chat — Yap with your friends directly in-game. No need for additional third-party platforms! </li>
<li>New and Returning Minigames —  Experience the tasks you know and love, along with some new ones. Now, with first-person controls.</li>
<li>Crossplay Functionality — Join lobbies with other VR players! (Note: The game is NOT compatible with the original Among Us game. Sorry, beans.) </li>
<li>Customize Your Beansona — Expand your wardrobe of hats, gloves, and skins with an endless number of cosmetic customization combinations!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">From the press release:</p>
<p>"With Among Us 3D, we're excited to bring the first-person perspective to an even wider audience," said Ryan Hall, Project Director at Schell Games. "By uniting VR and PC players, we’re opening up even more ways to brutally betray your friends—your whole crew can get in on the fun!"</p>
<p>"The launch of Among Us VR gave players the chance to step inside the game, bringing an entirely new level of suspense and hilarity to the social deduction experience,” said Victoria Tran, Community Director at Innersloth. “This crossplay feature strengthens our amazing community, making it easier than ever for players to team up—or backstab each other—regardless of their platform."</p>

      <title>What to claim from Prime Gaming, February 21st edition - plenty for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's the up to date list of games available on Amazon Prime Gaming for February 21st, and what compatibility you can expect for Linux / SteamOS and Steam Deck. <em>ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/amazons-previous-vp-of-prime-gaming-said-they-tried-everything-to-disrupt-steam/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon's previous VP of Prime Gaming said they "tried everything" to disrupt Steam</a>.</em></p>

Compatibility may be <em>slightly</em> different since the games are from various stores. Some of the games might also have <em>no</em> ratings right now.</p>

      <title>Playstation 2 Emulator PCSX2 enables Wayland by default</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For people who enjoy seeing improvements for emulation on Linux, and for Wayland support - the Playstation 2 Emulator PCSX2 has now enabled support for it by default.</p>
<p>Earlier this month I <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/ps2-emulator-emulator-pcsx2-should-get-wayland-support-in-the-coming-months/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared the news</a> that they were working towards it, after previously stopping it being the default due to lots of issues. With the latest code that's been <a href="https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/12333" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">merged</a>, it is now enabled by default for an upcoming release.</p>
<p>They have also filed a <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-133919" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug</a> with upstream Qt "Wayland rendering bug when using native windows on GNOME/Weston". Hopefully that will also be solved in a future Qt release.</p>
<p>Great for continued game preservation on modern Linux. You can see more about the emulator on the <a href="https://pcsx2.net/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking over email, Luke Short, Director of Linux Engineering at Playtron gave a little more detail about this new <a href="https://github.com/playtron-os/gamelab" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GameLAB</a> tool and their plans for it. Luke Short said it "revolves around community submissions" and that it's "similar to Lutris in how you can create custom installation scripts". In the short-term they want to get their fixes put back into protonfixes, so GE-Proton and the like can benefit from it directly. Long-term they want to "make all of our fixes easily accessible to everyone. Possibly with a conversion tool between different providers (protonfixes, Heroic Games Launcher, Lutris, Phoenicis, etc.)".</p>
<p>The only device currently planned to ship with it is the weird crypto device <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/the-first-handheld-to-use-playtronos-is-some-web3-thing-the-suiplay0x1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SuiPlay0x1</a>, but there's hints that something else may be on the table soon. I'll be keeping an eye on it.</p>

      <title>My favourite comedy dungeon crawler Lucky Tower Ultimate just got a big content update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The update simply called "Content" brings a whole lot of extras to Lucky Tower Ultimate, my current favourite dungeon crawler that keeps on making me laugh.</p>
<p>It's a truly silly game that will keep you coming back for more. It's equal parts frustrating as it is funny though, like any good dungeon crawler it can be a challenge but it's all the stupid interactions that really sell it. There's so many surprising things that can happen and they just keep expanding on it. It's Steam Deck Verified (and does work great) and works just fine on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8883893751740139064gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Update 2: Content was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1700270/view/497187708384314044" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> Wednesday, adding in various content from community votes including these major additions to the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>The Pipefitter</h3>
A team of industrious sisters in the village that let you carry more tower items outside. Once you help build an elaborate chute system, you will have a slot in each segment of the tower that you can use for one item. That item will be transported to the next segment in the current run. Once the item is outside, it can be bought in the village at the pipefitter.<br/>
<h3>The Bard</h3>
You’ll meet a Bard in the village who needs new instruments to impress the townsfolk… who currently hate their music. Fascinated with the musical wonders that you carried outside, the Bard will enter the tower once you’ve fulfilled their quest (to disastrous results). You will then be able to loot their corpse in the tower, which will be located in a random place every run. The corpse contains a new instrument and other useful items.<br/>
<h3>Snowy &amp; Puffles</h3>
This trap is inspired by one from the original Lucky Tower web game. At the end of a room, you’ll discover three doors with names above them. When you choose one of them and enter a small chamber, the door closes behind you and you’ll face whatever is in it. It might be a harmless snail, a peasant companion, or a tough enemy. You can deduce the room’s contents by the name above the door, which will be combined from a pool of possibilities.<br/>
<h3>The Pipes</h3>
The tower's sewer system becomes all the more visible with this trap. Unfortunately, the tower has such horrible plumbing that, from time to time, these pipes shake and…<br/>
1. Unleash a poisonous cloud into the air<br/>
2. There's also a chance they are clogged by slime, which will drop from the pipes instead<br/>
3. Or they do nothing (lucky you)<br/>
<h3>Bear Trap + Rake</h3>
<p>What's more slapstick than a rake handle to the face or a bear trap? These will be placed randomly in rooms just like mouse traps, but both have their own little twist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll also get over 270 new voice lines, new unique rooms, new items to find, new architecture to see all over the tower, you can buy a beard from The Barber, new achievements and so on. It really is a big update to the game, and I've had a blast again attempting to run through to spot some of the new stuff. Really great game to relax with.</p>
<p>One not to sit on, a seriously easy recommendation to pick up.</p>

      <title>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle gets DLSS 4 and FSR 3.1 but breaks on Steam Deck / Linux with Mesa</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle just got a major update with some fancy new features, but it seems like it's now broken on Linux with AMD GPUs using Mesa like Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Reports have begun appearing on Valve's Proton <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8292" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> report tracker, with a Mesa RADV driver <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/12652" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bug report</a> now open, but Valve developer Samuel Pitoiset mentioned "This is indeed a game bug, it passes through a pNext chain loop for the physical device creation..." and so it seems the game itself may need to be fixed this time before it will work again.</p>
<p>Going by reports it still works on NVIDA GPUs on Linux.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6751200331740136452gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/502817574909640811" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">patch</a> contents it added NVIDIA DLSS 4, AMD FSR 3.1 with Frame Generation, Intel XESS 1.4 and support for Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. Plus numerous game bug fixes.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll see a resolution for Linux systems soon. Would be good to see since AMD FSR 3.1 could make it perform a fair bit better on the likes of the Steam Deck. Especially since Valve fixed the graphical bug with characters eyes <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/steam-deck-steamos-3-6-21-released-fixing-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-eyes-and-security-bugs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in a recent SteamOS update</a>.</p>

      <title>Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2 is now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Surprisingly, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 has been given the Steam Deck Verified checkmark by Valve, after the latest patch was released with more updates planned. Valve verified it against the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/12/proton-9-0-4-is-out-now-bringing-big-compatibility-improvements-for-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Proton 9.0-4</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">A third patch was released today with various improvements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Release Notes (1.218.0.0)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated NVIDIA Streamline SDK to version 2.7.2.</li>
<li>Fixes for various visual bugs in cinematics on ultra-wide monitors.</li>
<li>Various visual bug fixes related to reflections.</li>
<li>Various visual bug fixes related to ray-traced shadows.</li>
<li>Various fixes for low quality texture assets.</li>
<li>Various user interface bug fixes and improvements</li>
<li>When opening the Suits menu, the list will now always scroll to the selected suit.</li>
<li>'Pull' Quick Time Events now work when Space or Left Mouse Button are assigned to Jump or Dodge.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during 'Graffiti in Trouble' with text language set to Spanish.</li>
<li>Various stability improvements and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2651280/eventcomments/597393274090583972?snr=2_9_100015_#c597393274090584835" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> in a Steam post that they are "actively working on more updates with additional bug fixes and performance optimizations".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21170869761740071679gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>I've yet to play it myself, so I can't comment on if it deserves the rating or not. However, I've seen a lot of talk about it across social media, with the initial release being full of issues across Desktop and Steam Deck but it seems like these first few patches have really cleaned it up. At least from various recent reports I've seen it can <em>mostly</em> stay around 30FPS, which is generally the floor Valve go for with Deck Verified.</p>
<p>Have you played it on Deck? Let me know if you agree with the rating in the comments, especially after this latest patch.</p>

      <title>A year later, Palworld hits 32m players while continuing to fight off Nintendo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's been a little bit over a year now since Palworld arrived in Early Access, with developer Pocketpair announcing how well it's done along with another patch out now. ICYMI: <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/01/palworld-developer-pocketpair-launches-pocketpair-publishing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pocketpair recently launched Pocketpair Publishing</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/en-palworld.pocketpair.jp/post/3lijyufslqk25" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> the Palworld account revealed "It's been a year since Palworld was released, and thanks to you our fans, Palworld has surpassed over 32 million players across all platforms! (Steam, Xbox, PS5)". A truly incredible number but not particularly surprising given all the attention on it, especially with the ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo / The Pokémon Company.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13809198951740057969gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Palworld version v0.4.15 was also just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/496061541789991031" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a>:</p>

・Fixed several Xbox and SteamDeck crashes.<br/>

・Adjusted the elemental chest rewards. They are now guaranteed to drop Dog Coins and also have a low chance of dropping work suitability books too.<br/>
<br/>
▼Network<br/>
・Added measures to address the player rubberbanding issues in multiplayer.<br/>
<br/>
▼Optimization<br/>
・Optimized save data file sizes.<br/>
<br/>

・Fixed an issue where neutral NPCs spawned in random events would not become criminal when attacked<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals would not work if summoned too close to a tree<br/>
・Fixed an issue where NPCs would sometimes shake when firing their guns<br/>
・Fixed minor bugs such as texture issues<br/>
・Fixed an issue where anti-aircraft missile launchers would occasionally respawn<br/>
・Fixed an issue where some buildings would not align properly<br/>
・Fixed an issue where Pals would not enter caves<br/>
<br/>
==<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your continued support of Palworld<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
The following changes in the v0.4.15 patch were not applied correctly and accidentally left out of the patch:<br/>
<br/>
・Adjusted the elemental chest rewards. They are now guaranteed to drop Dog Coins and also have a low chance of dropping work suitability books too.<br/>
<br/>
We're currently working to correct the issue.<br/>
<br/>
We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your continued support of Palworld.</p>

<p>Whatever happens with the lawsuit, it's going to be one for the history books given how Nintendo's patents cover a fair amount of features that quite a number of other games either use or use something very similar. Pocketpair <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/11/palworld-dev-details-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-for/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">previously gave more info</a> on some of the patents involved. Nintendo also continue to fight for getting more patents approved in the US, so this lawsuit <em>could</em> eventually go multi-national.</p>

      <title>Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming thinks generative AI will help game preservation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Microsoft recently announced Muse, "a generative AI model of a video game that can generate game visuals, controller actions, or both". And somehow, Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming thinks it will help game preservation.</p>
<p>Speaking in a video that has been set as unlisted (hidden) on YouTube, but included in their Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Phil Spencer of Microsoft Gaming goes off talking about how this somehow might magically help game preservation. No, I don't know how it would either, that's not how it works. Getting a generative AI to hallucinate games is not really preserving anything.</p>
<p>Anyway here's what Spencer said: "I'll tell you one of the things that I get excited about. You know, one of the things we care a lot about at Xbox is game preservation. And I think about an opportunity to have models learn about older games, games that were maybe tied to unique pieces of hardware where that engine on that hardware, is kind of time will erode the amount of hardware that's out there that can actually play a game. But you can imagine a world where from gameplay data and video, that a model could learn old games and really make them portable to any platform where these models could run."</p>
<p>Continuing Spencer said: "We've talked about game preservation as an activity for us. These models and their ability to learn completely how a game plays, without the necessity of the original engine running on the original hardware opens up a ton of opportunity."</p>
<p>The video can be viewed below:</p>

<p>At some point, this whole "AI everything" thing will come crashing down. But until then, we will see more and more executives dreaming up things that won't happen. Game preservation is absolutely vital, and there's so many ways to do it correctly, but getting an AI to dream one up that it thinks is accurate is definitely not it.</p>
