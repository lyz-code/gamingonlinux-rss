      <title>Vampire Therapist is a unique dark comedy narrative adventure with a great voice cast</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Being a Vampire Therapist is not something that's high up on my wishlist of jobs, but it certainly sounds interesting and you can try out the fresh demo now. Created in conjunction with licensed therapists, you'll take on the role of Sam in this intriguing therapy 'em up.</p>
<p>"Vampire Therapist is a narrative adventure in the vein (get it) of What We Do in the Shadows, the horror works of Mel Brooks, Monty Python, and Horrible Histories where you play as a reformed bloodsucker helping other vampires find inner peace.</p>
<p>Take on the role of Sam, a former rootin’, tootin’ Wild West gunslinger who escaped his day-to-day of murder and mayhem and realized, after a hundred years or so, that there’s a whole lot more to unlife than blood, lace, and leather. Dragging himself from the quagmire of the Old West, Sam teams up with a 3000-year-old vampire living in Europe that’s willing to show him the therapy ropes."</p>

      <title>ZOTAC Zone is yet another AMD gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Every hardware vendor seems to want a go at making a handheld, and now its ZOTAC jumping in with the Zone.</p>
<p>Teased during Computex it will come with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U (Zen 4) and AMD Radeon 870M graphics (RDNA 3). It will also come with 2-stage adjustable triggers, hall effect joysticks and triggers, a 1920x1080 7" AMOLED multi-touch 120Hz display, a front-facing camera and even dual trackpads.</p>
<p>Zotac <a href="https://x.com/ZOTAC/status/1797951762500141381" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shared</a> some images on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2027732771717503466gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2027732771717503466gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17331566231717503468gol1.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17331566231717503468gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>It looks pretty big. And of course, it will come with Windows. So if you want to run it on Linux, you'll need to wait for drivers to be worked on and for the likes of ChimeraOS and Bazzite to get support ready for it.</p>
<p>“Ever since the establishment of the ZOTAC GAMING brand, we have strived to provide an unmatched gaming experience for enthusiasts worldwide,” Said Tony Wong, Chief Executive Officer of ZOTAC. “We have made considerable efforts to raise the bar with our debut handheld, tailor-made with competitive features for all gamers.”</p>
<p>Valve well and truly lit a fire under everyone didn't they with the Steam Deck and Steam Deck OLED? Handheld PCs for gaming are now really becoming a bigger mainstream thing. We also had the silly-named <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/only-three-months-after-the-claw-msi-reveal-the-new-msi-claw-8-ai-gaming-handheld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a> revealed recently too.</p>
<p>The ZOTAC Zone will launch in September priced <a href="https://www.geeknetic.es/Noticia/31877/ZOTAC-nos-ensena-su-GAME-ZONE-en-el-COMPUTEX-lanzamiento-previsto-para-septiembre-por-800-euros.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reportedly</a> around $800. So they're not even remotely trying to compete with the Steam Deck at that price. The price alone may be the biggest issue with it.</p>

      <title>Persist Online is a new MMORPG from the developer of the classic Tibia</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After almost 30 years, CipSoft, the veteran multiplayer game developer behind 1997’s Tibia, is back with another MMORPG: Persist Online. It's confirmed that it will support Linux, macOS and Windows - so everyone on PC can get involved in the fun.</p>
<p>There's no current release date yet as they're still building it but they plan various playtests, before an Early Access release and it will be free to play.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sxzgFyMbVg0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c10d2c8947d1127ba7675e6447eeb2d9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sxzgFyMbVg0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“The true charm of an MMORPG lies in the diverse interaction possibilities among players and the unpredictable stories that emerge from them. Decades of operating Tibia have continually shown us this," said Benjamin Zuckerer, Lead Product Manager. “It’s why we believe a good multiplayer game can only be created together with the community, and even before the Early Access period, we will regularly organize game tests.”</p>
<p>“Persist Online began as a hobby project and is the brainchild of two long-standing CipSoft employees. We just started developing the game we wanted to play ourselves. The core team now consists of 14 people and has access to all departments and the entire expertise of the company."</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Masses of Players and Zombies:</strong> Join forces with other survivors to keep the zombies at bay and take on mutated bosses in a sprawling open world. In this persistent online world, without instances, hundreds of players can enjoy (and survive) this harsh environment together.</li>
<li><strong>Friends, Foes, and Temporary Allies:</strong> Exercise caution against other players looking for some PvP action, or team up and form guilds to defend strategically important locations, amassing resources quicker. Friendly fire is also engaged, so look out for that, too!</li>
<li><strong>Boomsticks, Frying Pans, and Fishing Nets:</strong> Fend off foes (zombies or other players) with a variety of looted or crafted weapons, which can each be upgraded. Melee the undead with a sturdy frying pan, blast them to smithereens with a powerful shotgun, or put points into the fishing skill on the skill tree and give the fishing net the ability to paralyze enemies.</li>
<li><strong>An Unforgiving Open World:</strong> This world isn’t just big; it’s also big on details. Every building is accessible, and a dynamic day and night cycle can have a genuine impact on gameplay.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Roll the dice to attack enemies in Dice &amp; Fold, try the demo now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dice &amp; Fold is another upcoming game from Tinymice Entertainment and Rogue Duck Interactive, who are also involved in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/vertical-building-colony-sim-stellar-settlers-space-base-builder-hits-early-access/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellar Settlers: Space Base Builder</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/neoduel-backpack-monsters-blends-an-inventory-pvp-auto-battler-with-a-monster-fusing-twist/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters</a>.</p>
<p>The developers got in touch to mention Dice &amp; Fold, a turn-based dungeon crawler where your only way of attacking the enemy is by rolling dice. Roll dice to damage enemy cards to FOLD. Inspired by classic Solitaire, in a top-down table and enemies made out of cards, try to beat the dungeon with 20 unique classes. Build your deck, kill monsters.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from Solitaire, Slay the Spire, Vampire Survivors and various classic table-top RPGs. I like the idea of this one, giving off a little <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/07/dicey-dungeons-reunion-is-a-huge-free-update-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dicey Dungeons</a> vibes too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i7G41z_t8FU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dd0902b8f5de986fa78019aec491c436.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i7G41z_t8FU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Definitely worth a look!</p>
<p>The developer also told me via email "All current games and future games we make will also target Linux and be tested on it." which is great to see.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo for Dice &amp; Fold on Steam</a>. It's due out later this year.</p>

      <title>Only three months after the Claw, MSI reveal the new MSI Claw 8 AI+ gaming handheld</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>One problem with a few handheld vendors is that they constantly spawn new models, and it seems like MSI are now doing the same with the MSI Claw 8 AI+ gaming handheld.</p>
<p>While most handheld vendors (like Valve with the Steam Deck) go for AMD, MSI with the Claw went for Intel. It didn't go particularly well, with a lot of reviews absolutely slating it. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Verge</a> pulled no punches and said bluntly "The MSI Claw is an embarrassment".</p>
<p>So what are they doing? Well of course, just three months later they're announcing a whole new model with the MSI Claw 8 AI+ that's powered by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/06/intel-revealed-more-lunar-lake-processor-details-with-their-new-xe2-graphics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intel's Lunar Lake</a>. Yes, that's <em>really</em> its name. It has AI in the title, because clearly that's how you sell things now, everything <em>needs</em> to somehow mention AI.</p>
<p>From their very short <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Sparks-AI-Frenzy-at-COMPUTEX-2024-Grand-Opening-143713" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MSI proudly introduces the Claw 8 AI+, the world's first gaming handheld powered by Intel® Core™ Ultra processors (codenamed “Lunar Lake”). This revolutionary device boasts an 8-inch FHD display, a Thunderbolt 4-supported USB-C port, enhanced LB/RB button feedback, increased battery capacity, and a lighter charger, making it the most powerful 8-inch gaming handheld on the market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally from their <a href="https://www.msi.com/news/detail/MSI-Unveils-Next-Gen-AI--Gaming-and-Business---Productivity-Laptops-with-Latest-Processors-at-COMPUTEX-2024-143709" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other</a> press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to the next-gen processor's improved energy efficiency, MSI has actively listened to user feedback and upgraded several hardware specifications accordingly, such as adding an additional Thunderbolt 4-supported USB-C port, enhancing the tactile feel of the LB/RB buttons, increasing battery capacity, and replacing the charger with a lighter wall-mounted charger. Claw 8 AI+ is expected to be the most advanced 8-inch gaming handheld in the market. After the official release, a one-month free trial of Xbox Game Pass will be provided, allowing users to enjoy the most popular AAA games of the moment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn't include a price, expected release date or even any pictures of it in the short press note. So not exactly showing too much confidence in it. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-first-look/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Digital Trends</a> did snap a few pics of it though:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18179259941717497863gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18179259941717497863gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like most handhelds though, it will still ship with Windows 11. So you'll have to wait until the likes of ChimeraOS and Bazzite get the driver situation sorted if you wanted to test out Linux on it.</p>

      <title>Intel revealed more Lunar Lake processor details with their new Xe2 graphics</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Intel has provided more details on the upcoming Lunar Lake processors, which will come with an impressive sounding bump in graphical power. <em>Set to release sometime in Q3 2024.</em></p>
<p>From what details Intel provided they're claiming "60%" better battery life for these mobile processors in "real-life usages". Impressive if true, but just as exciting is the huge advancement of the graphics side with Xe2 which they claim will bring improved "gaming and graphics performance by 1.5x over the previous generation".</p>
<p>Intel also say you're likely to see "up to 40% lower system-on-chip power compared to the previous generation" as well, which is also mighty impressive there.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's an overview:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compute Tile</strong> – A new compute tile contains the latest-generation Efficient-cores (E-cores) and Performance-cores (P-cores), both of which introduce new microarchitecture enhancements and together bring unprecedented x86 efficiency. Also housed on the compute tile are the new Xe2 graphics processing unit (GPU), neural processing unit (NPU 4) and image processing unit (IPU).
<ul>
<li><strong>Xe2 GPU</strong> – Brings more than 80% more gaming performance and more than five times the AI throughput over the previous generation, delivering more than 60 tera-operations per second (TOPS) New microarchitecture for the display and media engines delivers a best-in-class visual experience.</li>
<li><strong>NPU 4 </strong>– Delivers three times more TOPS over the most recent generation, up to 48 TOPs, to accelerate AI computations with impressively low power.</li>
<li><strong>IPU</strong> – Provides a great camera experience with reduced power.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Platform Controller Tile (PCT) </strong>– The PCT is where security and connectivity are integrated. Security components deliver a robust integrated security solution with built-in security engines designed to establish a solid foundation for system protection. The upgraded connectivity suite integrates Wi-Fi 7.0, Bluetooth 5.4, PCIe Gen5 and PCIe Gen4 ports, and ThunderboltTM 4 ports.</li>
<li><strong>Memory on Package</strong> – Enables fast access to data and reduces latency, decreasing the overall power consumption of the system.</li>

<p>The "Memory on Package" is quite a big one there. Basically, they've ditched separate RAM as it will be baked into the package itself directly. So you won't be able to upgrade the RAM, you get what it comes with.

      <title>Kaspersky release a free Virus Removal Tool for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, this is interesting. Kaspersky have <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/kvrt-for-linux/27662/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released</a> KVRT (Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool), which is free to use to scan your systems for issues.</p>
<p>This is <em>not</em> an active virus scanner, it <em>doesn't</em> constantly run on your system. Only when you load it and tell it to scan. It also <em>doesn't</em> auto-update, you need to go and download it fresh from their website each time. Still, it's interesting to see such a big name jump into something like this for Linux don't you think? They say it can "detect both malware and adware, as well as legitimate programs that can be used for attacks".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18454173471717414718gol1.png"/><br/>
<em>It may look like a Windows application but that really is on Linux.</em></p>
<p>As they said in their blog post announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern-day cybercriminals aren’t ignoring Linux-based operating systems. Recently, we published a <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cve-2024-3094-vulnerability-backdoor/50873/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">series</a> of <a href="https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-1/112354/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posts</a> about <a href="https://securelist.com/xz-backdoor-story-part-2-social-engineering/112476/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">malicious code</a> in the open source set of utilities XZ Utils, which managed to find its way into several popular Linux builds; wrote about a <a href="https://securelist.com/dinodasrat-linux-implant/112284/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Linux implant</a> for the DinodasRAT malware — also known as XDealer; and warned about a backdoor in the <a href="https://securelist.com/backdoored-free-download-manager-linux-malware/110465/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Trojanized version of Free Download Manager</a>. Despite all this, the myth that Linux is mostly immune to cyberthreats persists: companies rarely devote funds to protecting machines running this operating system. Therefore, we’ve released a dedicated free product that allows you to check Linux computers for modern threats — Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool (KVRT) for Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your thoughts on this, and what do you use on your Linux desktop to keep it secure? Maybe it's time to give over some suggestions in the comments on that. </p>

      <title>The SaveTF2 campaign to get Valve to beat the Team Fortress 2 bots has begun</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/team-fortress-2-fans-have-launched-a-new-campaign-to-get-valve-to-save-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcing the SaveTF2 campaign recently</a>, today the actual campaign to get Valve to fix up Team Fortress 2 has properly begun.</p>
<p>The petition on their <a href="https://save.tf/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campaign website</a> has now reached over 100,000 signatures, which the organisers say they will forward onto Valve directly to try and get their attention. On top of that, they're asking people today to use the "#SaveTF2" hashtag across social media to highlight the problems. It's already massing a whole lot of <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/SaveTF2?src=hashtag_click&amp;f=live" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posts on X</a> (formerly Twitter) about the issues people face trying to play it and has entered X's trending topics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15478980841717410267gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15478980841717410267gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It has been a problem for a few years now, and while Valve has put out various updates, the bots as always fight back. The game appears to be full of not just aimbots, but according to the campaign website the bots also "abuse the in-game text and voice chats to spread the most vile hate speech imaginable, while simultaneously advertising their “bot immunity services” in an attempt to scam the players desperately looking for a solution" and… "They’ve used these same means to dox people’s personal information and broadcast it to the player-base against their will. Bot hosters have even gone so far as to commit actual crimes, such as using AI voice-modifiers to impersonate and slander non-consenting parties, launching persistent DDoS attacks, and have even swatted one of their most ardent critics".</p>
<p>You would think if the problem was that serious, that Valve would have put a bit more developer time on it by now. Although, they are still updating it now and then, like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/team-fortress-2-gets-64bit-support-released-plus-vulkan-for-linux-via-dxvk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the 64bit update recently</a>.</p>

      <title>Interview with OutOfTheBit on their cinematic platformer Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OutOfTheBit are currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2810190/Nanuka_Secret_of_the_Shattering_Moon/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon</a>, a cinematic puzzle platformer after previously releasing the positively received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1859580/Full_Void/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Full Void</a>.</p>
<p>Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon looks great! Inspired by the Sicilian landscape, the journey begins on an island that, while initially portrayed as peaceful and picturesque, soon reveals a tale of magical abilities and a looming disaster that players must strive to avert. As the adventure and story progresses, the importance and acceptance of diverse races and beliefs will shine through preciously.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_DYwZOunu_8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c3d558236216ccc01add917eb195c6a5.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_DYwZOunu_8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I had the chance to catch up with the team to shoot off some questions and here's what they said.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Could you tell us a little about the inspiration behind Nanuka: Secret of the Shattering Moon?</strong></p>
<p>"We’re all huge fans of the old-school game aesthetic. While Full Void was inspired by games like Flashback and Another World, Nanuka was more of a natural progression in its creation through team brainstorming sessions. That said, we're huge fans of the humor in the Monkey Island games, and Nanuka’s humor has definitely been influenced by those.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tom—one of the artists working on the game along with Leo—is a great fan of cartoons like Tom &amp; Jerry and Looney Tunes. The goofiness of Nanuka has some traits inspired by those classic cartoons, adding a playful element to the game."</p>
<p><strong>Q: So what exactly is a "cinematic puzzle platformer", how would you say it's cinematic and different to other platformers?</strong></p>
<p>"A cinematic puzzle platformer is all about combining the platforming gameplay with a strong narrative and film-like presentation. What makes it cinematic are the custom animations and seamless transitions that create a movie-like experience. The story is intertwined into the scenes and animations, rather than just relying on text or dialogue.</p>
<p>In our games, we focus heavily on custom animations for characters' movements and interactions to bring the story to life. Each transition is designed to keep the player immersed, much like watching a film. This way, players are not just playing a game but experiencing a continuous and engaging story."</p>
<p><strong>Q: What lessons did you learn from your previous release Full Void?</strong></p>
<p>"The biggest lesson we learned from Full Void was the importance of refining our engine to handle the specific needs of a cinematic platformer. We developed a custom file format to store large animations using minimal memory, which was extremely important for achieving the visual quality we wanted without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Another key takeaway came from the experience we gained working together as a team. Developing Full Void helped us build trust and learn how to bring out the best in each other. We now have a great workflow that suits us perfectly, making our development process much smoother, quick and efficient."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Just how difficult is it to get noticed on stores like Steam now as a small team?</strong></p>
<p>"I think it’s difficult for any sized team. Because of the amount of content available, getting noticed on digital stores can be an uphill battle, but we believe that if your game is good it will always find its audience. Wishlisting on stores is incredibly important for all games, but especially indie games. I think Social Media presence and PR also help with getting more eyes on what you’ve created. TikTok seems to be a great tool for getting indie games in the eyes of players, but that in itself is its own art form."</p>
<p><strong>Q: How was your experience releasing on GOG compared with Steam?</strong></p>
<p>"Both platforms are extremely mature and have made releasing on their stores quite an easy task. Steam, with its massive user base and well-established ecosystem, provides significant visibility and community engagement opportunities. Their tools for developers, such as Steamworks, are robust and user-friendly, making it straightforward to manage releases, updates, and community interactions.</p>
<p>GOG, on the other hand, is known for its curated approach and strong focus on DRM-free games, which appeals to a niche but important audience. The process of releasing on GOG feels more personal, with their team providing direct support and feedback throughout the submission process. This can be especially beneficial for indie developers seeking a more tailored experience."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Any thoughts on the repeating mass layoffs in the AAA industry?</strong></p>
<p>"It's a very complex issue. It's been quite disheartening to witness the numerous layoffs and the closure of beloved studios like Tango Gameworks and PlayStation London Studio, among many others. In our opinion, one major factor is that the development costs for AAA games have become so high that it's increasingly difficult for publishers and console vendors to recoup their investments. Additionally, the current generation of consoles has probably not sold as well as hoped. On the upside, there's a resurgence in PC gaming, and the Steam Deck and similar devices are expanding rapidly, benefiting indie games as well. Nintendo is also rumoured to be working on the Switch 2. So, who knows? Things might turn around in the next few years."</p>
<p><strong>Q: With Valve's compatibility tool Proton, how do you feel about continuing Linux support?</strong></p>
<p>"Fair question! Proton is truly amazing and every single Windows-only game we tried so far has worked great on Linux thanks to Proton! Ali, our lead developer, is a big Linux fan and his development setup consists of a PC running Kubuntu. Our games work well with Proton but we prefer making a native port for Linux, that way our games run well on older hardware and are kinder on the battery."</p>
<p><strong>Q: Any thoughts on the Steam Deck? Are you fans?</strong></p>
<p>"The Steam Deck is a fantastic piece of hardware, and it’s been great to see a new kind of handheld come to the market, and bring a different experience comparative to the Switch. We’re fans of gaming, so any piece of hardware or digital storefront that enables gaming to be experienced by more people is never a bad thing. We are looking forward to seeing the evolution of the Steam Deck in future iterations, as well as the Switch 2, and the capabilities of both devices."</p>

      <title>Free planet-colonising strategy game Planet S added Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free game Monday! Check out Planet S, a real-time strategy game where your goal is to colonize multiple planets in a solar system to advance your civilization. Originally released back in October 2023, the developer has continued expanding it and they added Native Linux support at the end of May, 2024.</p>
<p>The Linux version came with a big expansion to the game to add in Steam Workshop support! The game may be simple in the presentation, but clearly the gameplay has sucked plenty of people in with a Very Positive rating. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="CPhl8S5YTok"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f55f9dd336feef3a5585de48a3f6a93b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/CPhl8S5YTok" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Procedural planets</strong> - The world consists of up to 16 procedurally generated planets which you can colonize. A planets type affects things like the appearance, the farm productivity and the kind of resources you can find on it. Every player starts the game with a spaceship and enough materials to colonize their first planet. Uncolonized planets can be claimed by building a spaceport on it. Once you claimed a planet, you can integrate it into your economy!</li>
<li><strong>Build your civilization</strong> - To advance your faction and unlock new buildings you need to attract residents and provide them the goods they require. By gaining more and more residents, you will unlock new production chains which will increase in complexity. At some point, your first planet won't be able to supply you with the resources you need, so you need to expand to other planets.</li>
<li><strong>Choose your path</strong> - While you start your population with workers, you need to make a decision when you advance to the second tier. You can upgrade your residents to the science or military civilization type. You can adjust the direction in an adjacent city center. Your decision will determine your path for the game and set a focus on either a more peacefully or a violent way of playing and winning the game. It may be rational to carefully consider your decision and adapt to the situation you are in.<br/>
Residents of a civilization type generate either science or military research points, which you can invest into research. The two research trees unlock bonuses and unique buildings for the corresponding civilization type. Through that, the game experience will rely heavily on the path you select.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be played solo or even online with up to three friends.</p>

      <title>ASUS reveal the ROG Ally X with more RAM, more storage, larger battery</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ASUS have given their handheld an upgrade with the ROG Ally X now getting a full announcement, along with specifications and a price. <em>Hopefully they actually fixed the SD Card issue this time…</em></p>
<p>While they're still bundling it with Windows 11, I doubt it will be long before the likes of ChimeraOS, Bazzite and others get updates to allow you to easily run Linux on it.</p>
<p>The updated ROG Ally X now ships with a larger 1TB M.2 full 2280 for storage, faster 7500Mhz LPDDR5X RAM bumped up to 24GB, an 80 Wh battery, an additional USB-C port, overhauled internals for better cooling and a revised case design for better ergonomics (it's much more <em>round</em>). They also re-positioned the thumbsticks and gave it new thumbsticks that should last longer, there's a new macro button on the back, a redesigned d-pad and lots of small improvements elsewhere.</p>
<p><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21031497591717325490gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21031497591717325490gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Priced at $799 it will be available in July. See more on their <a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/gaming-handhelds/rog-ally/rog-ally-x-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">store page</a>.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting, that ASUS have been catching some fire lately for their terrible user support experience, which the excellent Gamers Nexus went over across two videos titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pMrssIrKcY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ASUS Scammed Us</a> and the follow-up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3DwhTc7Z4o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ASUS Says We're "Confused"</a>.</p>

      <title>Linux user share on Steam breaks 2% thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A moment I've no doubt many Linux fans have been waiting to see. The Linux user share on Steam has smashed through the 2% barrier.</p>
<p>Not actually for the first time though, it did initially rise up above 2% in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2013/03/steams-february-stats-are-out-linux-rises-again/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">March 2013</a>, shortly after the original Steam for Linux release when it left Beta. Part of the reason it had higher numbers at the start, was that Valve added a special Tux item into Team Fortress 2 only on Linux but it <em>quickly</em> dropped in the following months.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">With the latest info though from the May 2024 survey, Linux has now hit 2.32%.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.21% -0.55%</li>
<li>Linux 2.32% +0.42%</li>
<li>macOS 1.47% +0.12%</li>
</ul>
<p>If I have my historical data correct, we haven't seen Linux be over 2% since 2013. Take into account the explosive growth of Steam as a platform and that's quite a lot of people now. Mostly thanks to Steam Deck.</p>

<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.90% -0.34%</li>

      <title>Selaco is now in Early Access - one of the best shooters I&#39;ve played in forever</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The day is finally here, Selaco from Altered Orbit Studios has now entered Early Access so you can see what absolute insanity they've been able to do with the GZDoom code.</p>
<p>Not a GZDoom "mod" though, this is a proper game. It's also easily one of the absolute best shooters I've played in a long time. I don't say that lightly either. In a time where we have big developers focusing ever-more on photo-realism, Selaco pulls it back to focus a lot more on the gameplay. That said, it still looks damn good though and it absolutely kicks-ass.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nUbF8Ytadx0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f9d495c1130ff6c161a0637adada5e7c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nUbF8Ytadx0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since it's in Early Access and not technically finished, I'm <em>not</em> giving it a full review (yet), more of just general thoughts. Although, the game <em>is</em> as big as some full releases, bigger even. The game right now now has 31 action-packed maps, which the developers say they "consider the entirety of the Base Campaign and covers the majority of the game". The point is, they wanted the Early Access release to be as big as possible and worth the price. Well, it certainly is. They're planning a second chapter before launch, and a third chapter as a free update <em>after</em> launch. So lots to look forward to.</p>
<p>Once you finish what's there, that's not the end, since it's also launching with Steam Workshop support right away. There's also various gameplay modifiers to play through it differently including a much more punishing hardcore mode, with more modifiers planned to be added in.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13115295081717079165gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13115295081717079165gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Inspired by F.E.A.R, Half-Life, QUAKE and DOOM it's very clear in the gameplay. From the smart AI that will constantly surprise you and actually react to you, to the level layouts with the coloured key hunting to open doors. Personally, I just can't get over how satisfying it is filling up a room with all the purple goo that oozes out of enemies when you annihilate them with the various 11 weapons you're given. Sliding into enemies to send them flying into a wall, and then filling them with hot lead — it's bloody glorious.</p>
<p>The gunplay as well, gosh, it really hits the spot. The weapons feel like they have some real power to them, and as a more tactical shooter they've clearly put a lot of thought and polish into the actual action, which is consistently completely over the top in every section. You do get brief moments to breathe, but most of the time it's on-rails action where you're dancing around levels filling them up with bodies.</p>
<p>The level of world interactions on show here are constantly impressive too. From simple things like picking up objects and smashing them, turning lights on and off, to turning computers on and just emptying a trash bin because why not, the level of detail is downright silly. Smash through glass windows, flip things over for cover from bullets and turn them to face enemies. Or how about throwing and shooting a fire extinguisher for some smoke cover. There's just so much of everything! It's useful though, and sometimes essential to throw stuff around, so almost everything has meaning.</p>
<p>One of my favourites: opening a pizza box, and eating each <em>individual</em> slice of pizza for some needed HP.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8226233201717072536gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8226233201717072536gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Turns out, you <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1796159506415513691" rel="noopener" target="_blank">might not</a> get as lucky as me on the pizza.</em></p>
<p>Also, please don't tell the janitor, but I flushed a bottle of bleach down a toilet which caused it to overflow with bubbles and eventually completely explode. That was genuinely hilarious. I didn't expect it to actually do anything, especially not flush the bottle down but this was stupidly brilliant, a proper laugh out loud moment.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10718978651717074353gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10718978651717074353gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>I wonder how many of these little silly but awesome touches I've missed during my play-through. I might have to go back and play with every little thing just a bit more to see what I can find.</p>
<p>As you play through and progress the enemies will of course get new tricks to combat you. This is done through Invasion Tiers. Now and then it will pop up noting the Tier level has been bumped up where enemies will suddenly have grenades, smoke grenades, deployable shields, personal mobile shields...and more that I won't directly spoil for you. </p>
<p>For those of you who like following the lore, there's plenty of that to uncover. There's no cut-scenes or anything to actually get in the way of the action though. As you progress, and if you actually slow down enough to take a look around, there's a lot of datapads to find that will sprinkle in plenty of paragraphs of what's been going on. Emails between people talking about the world, their issues and strange happenings. A good few fun secrets to find too.</p>
<p>Of course, what's a shooter (and a retro-styled one) without a little platforming? Yes, Selaco has that too. It's probably the only part of the game I didn't overly enjoy, mainly because I don't like 3D platforming really at all in any game that I can remember (especially terrible in the newer DOOM). Although here, thankfully, it's not too annoying. These sections actually add to the experience overall, with you hunting down buttons to activate things. Shout out to the yellow-paint markers, Selaco has a little of that too, but sparingly and they kind-of joke about it in the emails you read.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5981024461717079100gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5981024461717079100gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The list of what Selaco offers you just keeps on growing. There's all the action, the puzzling, and then you even get various safe rooms too which you can use to customize and upgrade weapons, buy ammo and more to come. Although, you don't get to use it properly right away, as you need to find some upgrades for the safe room to then be able to upgrade your weapons. There's a lot of options there too for each individual weapon from fire rate to magazine size, ammo to smash through cracks in walls and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6620505341717079876gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/6620505341717079876gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10500449371717155370gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10500449371717155370gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>There's just so much to talk about when it comes to Selaco, that I really have no idea where to end this. As I went through it the game was just surprise after surprise. The levels themselves are so incredibly detailed and well thought-out, the set-pieces are fantastic to see in action when you having different types of enemies dropping into the map in various ways from blowing doors open, to cutting through the roof to drop down on you and more.</p>
<p>That is one of the interesting things about Selaco, not everything is just a run and gun fight. It is a tactical game. So there will be sections where you need to hunker down a bit, find some cover and potentially a position a friendly turret to help you out. </p>
<p>Main advice here overall: F6 quick-save is your friend, so use it often. Even on the Lieutenant difficulty, which they say is "Medium", lots of it was quite a challenge and I died — a lot. There's three higher main difficulty options after that (and two below) and even one more special difficulty after that's supposed to be quite impossible. So if you love a challenge, you'll get it. Or not, the easier difficulties are just fine for people who aren't quite so good at FPS games.</p>
<p>Considering all the door key and door code hunting you'll be doing, I was a bit worried I might get a bit lost as I do in other similarly-styled shooters. Thankfully, Selaco has a map you can bring up any time. Gameplay continues with the map up though, which means you can walk around with the map up and it shows the direction you're facing as you turn around making it actually pretty easy to find your way around overall. At least I thought so. Downside? Enemies can sneak up on you, so don't keep it up. It also nicely marks the doors, stairs and more for you. It's a pretty good map system overall actually. All that said, I did still manage to get entirely lost a couple of times, as some level layouts are a bit labyrinthine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/993596381717099501gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/993596381717099501gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The good thing about some backtracking though? Finding all those darn secrets. They've sprinkled quite a few across each level, and some of them are genuinely difficult to find, a good few I found entirely by accident by trying different things out in the levels and just trying to access areas I didn't think I could get to. But there's always a way…</p>
<p>I've mentioned how it's a tactical shooter right? So, you can sneak up on people. And I've also mentioned all the object interactions you can do too. When I realised you could pick up a knife from a kitchen, you can bet I carried around that damn thing until I found another enemy to use it on, who just so happened to have their back turned. Great success. I wasn't expecting it to really work, but it was worth the nuisance of carrying it around to test out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11732815711717159249gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11732815711717159249gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Want to know how truly crazy this GZDoom-powered game is? It even has a working train system, for you travel between safe houses across the levels, so you can easily go back and secret-hunt. This isn't some fancy loading screen either, it's a working train that you ride on and watch as you go through the area. Absolute madness. </p>
<p>I haven't even talked about the enemy variety yet. There's I believe 14 unique enemies in the game from your standard foot soldiers, to flying enemies and explosive scary spider-bots that make me jump every time I'm not expecting those damn things. <em>Death to all spider bots. </em>They all work together too, they will attempt to surround you and come up behind you, and some even buff up others to become even more of a nuisance. The AI here is actually really good, much better than various other FPS I've played.</p>
<p>The commentary you get from the soldiers is great too, giving out orders or panicking a little when you start taking them out one by one. I'm hoping (and I imagine they will) keep upgrading the AI to make it even smarter, because they have such an incredible foundation here.</p>
<p>You even get mini-games! There's a space shooter arcade machine! But, by far the best thing in the game? Their Cookie Clicker knock-off called Burger Flipper. The question is, how long before Burger Flipper becomes its own real standalone sci-fi clicker game? Asking the important questions here of course. Clearly…I spent far too long on it and I can feel you judging me already.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4492198031717162505gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4492198031717162505gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For research purposes of course, for work, I needed to see how far I could push Burger Flipper. <em>Sure did make me hungry.</em></p>
<p>Some nice customisation of the UI is available too. If you prefer to have it as if you're actually in the special suit, you can keep the visor UI on, but you can turn it off so it entirely fills your screen without the borders. You can go further, and also remove most of the UI too. You can also adjust HUD screen-shake, change the display scale to be bigger or smaller (nice touch), move the HUD closer to the middle of the screen and so on. They seem to have thought of almost everything putting a lot of other developers to shame.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18021003901717080720gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/18021003901717080720gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15790946661717080721gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15790946661717080721gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>First shot default, second shot HUD Visor Opacity set to zero.</em></p>
<p>Whoever did the music and atmospheric sounds as well deserves a chef's kiss. It really helps get the blood flowing and fits in beautifully with the setting and design of the game. And in other sections, it helps keep the tension, especially when things often get dark, it can be a little on the spooky side. Especially so when enemies appear you're not expecting, it made me jump a good few times. Some elements of the soundtrack even sound a bit Blade Runner. Wonderful.</p>
<p>Performance for me hasn't been an issue either. On my admittedly pretty powerful Kubuntu 24.04 system with an AMD Ryzen 5800X and AMD Radeon 6800XT at 1440p with mostly maximum settings, along with turning on the <em>extra</em> settings of Permanent Destruction and Flashlight Shadows, it's been almost always above 100FPS apart from some loading-blips. Somehow they also squeezed all of it into a 1.1GB package, madness.</p>
<p>The current plan is to leave Early Access in 2026. However, they have big ideas to keep expanding the game, and no doubt there will be a lot of player feedback, and due to the modding support they will likely make lots of tweaks and upgrades there so it may take longer. The point they're making is they're in no rush, and it's quite feature and content-filled already.</p>
<p>If you're after a retro-inspired shooter that seems to just have a bit of everything, right now Selaco is your best bet, it feels like a game from another time. Selaco has a lot of the charm I feel has been lost by all the modern-generation shooters and is a ridiculously easy recommendation. Selaco is so much fun to blast through! Perhaps my top release of 2024.</p>
<p>Selaco has Native Linux support and is playable on Steam Deck but no rating from Valve yet.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy Selaco on Steam</a> priced at $24.99 / €24.50 / £20.99. There's also a 10% discount for two weeks.</p>

      <title>HoMM-like sci-fi strategy game Silence of the Siren has a new demo and release date</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by classics like Heroes of Might and Magic, developers Oxymoron Games (Project Hospital) have revealed their sci-fi strategy game Silence of the Siren has a fresh upgraded demo and release date. It will have full Native Linux support, which the demo already has ready for you to test.</p>
<p>The new plan is to release into Early Access on September 30th. The developer told me the updated demo has "a new map with a bit of story-driven gameplay, a new orbital layer and the usual dose of base building, exploration and tactical battles".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10330283831717151608gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10330283831717151608gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<p>Silence of the Siren is a turn-based strategy game in which you will be thrown into a chaotic universe where several space-faring civilizations are fighting over control of a distant star system and trying to discover its dark history. Explore different planets, gather resources to expand your bases, raise an army and defeat your opponents!</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore a rich sci-fi world and discover secrets of a lost civilization.</li>
<li>Collect powerful artifacts, secure important resources, upgrade your bases, hire different units and build useful structures on the world map.</li>
<li>Level-up your commanders and crush your opponents in exciting turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Take control over several different species and factions.</li>
<li>Old-school strategy game with modern controls and intuitive UI.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The developer sent over a key, so I'll be taking a proper look for the release.</em></p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UDbUioVa84Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/961cce74eb908d1ed67bdb3158cb8f74.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UDbUioVa84Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While it has Native Linux support and looks good on desktop PCs, it's not quite ready for Steam Deck just yet. The developer mentioned it's already playable but they plan to improve things like different text sizes. The Steam Deck improvements may not be ready for Early Access but it will get there eventually.</p>

      <title>Gourdlets is a chilled sandbox game about building towns for cute vegetable folks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a demo available now and a release window revealed for sometime this Summer, Gourdlets looks like a really sweet and chilled game to try out with Linux support. It's another game built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a> too!</p>
<p>So what actually is it? An easygoing sandbox game about building towns for "cute vegetable folks". There's no objective here, you just build up a town and see what all the little veggie people get up to. It's all about "just good vibes" the developer said. There's a huge amount of customization on offer from outside to inside buildings, to arrange furniture exactly how you want. The Gourdlets will then make themselves at home and go fishing, read, go camping, farming and whatever else.</p>
<p>They're not quite ready to reveal the full release date yet, but it's getting close now. Thanks to the demo being up for the Cozy &amp; Family Friendly Steam event, along with the upcoming Steam Next Fest, you can now dive in too and the new demo has a lot of fresh content included. The developer mentioned they will probably expand the demo again for Next Fest.</p>

      <title>Path of Exile 2 will have couch co-op, cross-play and cross-progression</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know there's quite a lot of Path of Exile fans here, especially as it works so well with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Linux PCs and Steam Deck. Sounds like Path of Exile 2 is going to be a whole lot better too.</p>
<p>Announced during the Playstation State of Play Showcase, there's a whole lot of goodies coming to the next-generation free to play action RPG from Grinding Gear Games. Some of the big announcements include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Couch Co-op Mode</strong> - Players no longer need multiple devices to play the game with their friends. A new feature, couch co-op, is available on all supported platforms and requires two controllers to play. Players can play collaboratively on a single account, or log in with two separate Path of Exile accounts on the same PC or console.</p>
<p><strong>Redefined Controller Experience</strong> - Path of Exile 2 has a ground up redesign of its user experience for controllers. Dual Stick controls, a new binding system allowing you to fully customize your control scheme with 24 bind slots and a redesign of inventory management make the game much easier to pick up and play. In addition, each skill has received specific attention from a new dedicated console team to make sure that it plays well on a controller.</p>
<p><strong>Easier to Play</strong> - Path of Exile is a game with a reputation for complexity, but Path of Exile 2 makes it much easier for new players to explore and understand the deep mechanics of the game. As well as simplifying many mechanics, in-game skill tutorial videos explain how skills work and how to use them in combat, a new help system added to item hovers allows players to find out exactly how stats work at the push of a button, and a new system to allow players to see the exact effects that any choice would have on their characters makes understanding the game much easier.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-play, Cross-progression, Simultaneous Launches</strong> - Path of Exile 2 is introducing full cross-play and cross-progression on all supported platforms. Play with your friends on other platforms, or move from console to PC without losing any progress. The launch as well as all updates in the future will be shipping simultaneously with PC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Considering how well the first game works in Proton, I am hopeful this will too.</p>

<em>Pictured - Black Desert</em></p>
<p>Currently the post on GitHub has no replies, so I imagine most people missed the Release Candidate as well. So now you've got a weekend of testing ahead of you.</p>
<p>How to test?</p>
<p>Look for Proton 9.0 in your Steam Library, go into the Properties -&gt; Betas and select release-candidate from the drop-down box.</p>

      <title>God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn coming to Steam, requires PlayStation Network Account</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Both God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn are coming to Steam finally, but they will annoyingly require a PlayStation Network Account despite being single-player games.</p>
<p>This means players in various regions where the PSN is not supported will <em>not</em> be able to purchase and play either of them, just like the issue with Helldivers 2 and Ghost of Tsushima DIRECTOR'S CUT.</p>
<p>Sony <em>haven't</em> said specifically if either of them will have that fancy new PlayStation Overlay like Tsushima has, as their Steam pages only mention the PSN account requirement, which <em>may</em> be good news for Steam Deck / Linux players since the new PlayStation Overlay is not supported in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> yet. For comparison, the Tsushima store page <em>does</em> clearly note it uses the PlayStation Overlay.</p>
<p>Valve didn't reply to my previous email asking about Proton and the PlayStation Overlay, so we'll just have to wait and see if Sony add it to these games and if Proton will ever support it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">God of War Ragnarök</a></strong> arrives on September 19th.</p>
<p>Ragnarök will come with NVIDIA RTX Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) 3.7, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 3.1 and Intel XeSS (Xe Super Sampling) 1.2. It will also support NVIDIA Reflex, proper ultra-wide resolutions, various controls customization, unlocked framerates and it will also include the God of War Ragnarök: Valhalla DLC in the purchase for no extra cost.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20449078581717142282gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20449078581717142282gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Until Dawn</a></strong> has no specific release date yet but it will be this year.</p>
<p>This one should be interesting, as the developers say it's actually being re-built in Unreal Engine 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Until Dawn has been rebuilt with the latest tools and techniques. New and improved animations build on the success of the original character performances. Characters, environments and VFX have been upgraded – all for a truly enhanced cinematic horror experience.</p>
<p>We use a broader cinematic tonal colour palette and new perspectives to make the story more nuanced and emotional. We’ve been brave enough to shine a light into the dark, unseen corners of Blackwood Mountain and added a third-person camera, which means you can now look behind the curtain of the original game, exploring enhanced and new locations with new interactions and collectables.</p>
<p>Incorporating a third-person camera and adding contextual character movement animations, the game now allows the player to really feel the experience of that fateful night.</p>
<p>Until Dawn’s sound has undergone a massive overhaul too, featuring a new score from legendary horror composer Mark Korven.</p>
<p>We’ve endeavoured to keep the fantastic narrative integratory of the original, but we have seized the opportunity to expand upon unexplored emotional parts of the story.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Rack and Slay answers the question of &#34;what if a dungeon crawler was like billiards&#34;</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Answering the question you didn't think to ask, Rack and Slay has shown up to show you what happens when you combine a dungeon crawler with something resembling billiards and pool. It's as odd as it sounds but it works. <u>Note</u>: personal purchase.</p>
<p>Rack and Slay is all about the fun of creating ridiculous builds. Here you control a billiard ball, and you have to knock all the other balls into the holes (or traps and spikes). Each level is randomly generated full of monster balls, traps, collectibles, power-ups and more. It's another small, bite-sized coffee break game that's cheap and easy to get into, while providing hours upon hours of game time for whenever you feel like it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="yq5msXmcTe4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/85271d3f788165d8e2e76dc1aa287f3a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/yq5msXmcTe4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly a pretty unique idea. Here your ball can be hurt by traps, or by potting yourself into a hole, and your health is taken down for every remaining monster ball after you've used up your total allowed shots per level, so you have to sink as many of those balls into the holes as you can. No timers though, it's all very relaxed for you to line up that perfect shot.</p>
<p>There's a lot of different enemy balls including sticky balls that decrease your power if you touch them directly, balls that shoot themselves towards you after every turn, balls that shoot other balls at you, some will blind you so you can't tell where you'll end up, others just explode on you and the list goes on. It's all about figuring out how to deal with them all.</p>
<p>After each level you get to upgrade from over 100 items, some with huge game-changing effects that can stack up to create something truly ridiculous. The game will start off simple and slow, which is why some players may bounce off it, but if you stick with it Rack and Slay soon gets pretty nuts as you build up. Items can include: not setting off traps, shooting out extra balls when you take a shot, a longer movement prediction line, gold that spawns after each hit, increased item pickup range, throw out a bunch of bombs around you and the list goes on and on. There's a seriously big variety to what you can load up onto your ball and since they stack, it just gets insane.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20088645391717085025gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20088645391717085025gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The interface really reminds me of Slay the Spire, and just like it, the game explains everything quite nicely. You can hover over everything for details, so you're never really in the dark about what everything does. Still, you have to discover as you go and there's numerous little surprises.</p>
<p>As you play and level up, you unlock more items for the shop too, but because it's such a casual game, there's a button simply to unlock everything if you prefer to have nothing gated by progression, but some of the later items are more complex.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7788849181717085905gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7788849181717085905gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>111 game-changing items, with 50+ of them unlockable through playing any mode you like (and yes, in good Slice &amp; Dice tradition there is an "unlock all" option).</li>
<li>20 difficulty levels to unlock in packs (no need to go 1-by-1 if you're that good).</li>
<li>The full 10-level Crawl Mode for your good old ~30-minute roguelike runs.</li>
<li>The shorter Delve Mode with half the levels, but double the item drafts.</li>
<li>The one-level Raid Mode with random items for a quick burst of mayhem.</li>
<li>Daily Mode featuring a unique set of game-changing run modifiers every day.</li>
<li>Wild Mode for random (and sometimes extra crazy) sets of modifiers.</li>
<li>A set of Challenge Runs featuring pre-defined gameplay variants that will often drastically change the way you play the game.</li>
<li>A full Item Compendium to track your unlocks and collect badges for the highest difficulty you beat using each item.</li>

<p>It does basically everything it sets out to do, it doesn't need anything more than it already has, it's a great example of a small and complete game that can hook you right in. It is quickly becoming one of my most played coffee-break games on Steam and I think you'll enjoy it. Gets an easy thumbs-up from me for the fun idea, along with the nice and relaxing but engaging (and at times quite challenging) gameplay.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2311990/Rack_and_Slay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating currently.</p>

      <title>Dev of crowdfunded WW1 survival-horror game CONSCRIPT cancels Linux and macOS versions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>CONSCRIPT from Jordan Mochi/ Catchweight Studio and publisher Team17 is a promising looking first world war survival-horror that was crowdfunded back in 2020. Now the developer has cancelled the planned Linux and macOS versions.</p>
<p>"CONSCRIPT is an upcoming survival horror game inspired by classics of the genre - set in 1916 during the Great War. CONSCRIPT will blend all the punishing mechanics of older horror games into a cohesive, tense, and unique experience. In CONSCRIPT, you play as a French soldier searching for his missing-in-action brother during the Battle of Verdun. Will you be able to search twisted trenches, navigate overrun forts, and cross no-mans-land to find him, and ensure a home goes unbroken?"</p>
<p>Since getting a press email about a new demo arriving, and remembering following this along during the Kickstarter, I shot off a message to their PR team a few days ago, and today they got back in touch and the developer has now also published a post directly on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/562623591/conscript-ww1-survival-horror/posts/4112739" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> where they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Linux and Mac Notice</strong></p>
<p>Linux and Mac versions were part of the original Kickstarter campaign, and unfortunately I have to announce that these two platforms will no longer be natively supported. Back during the Kickstarter campaign in 2020 I naively promised things that I had never done before and so I did not realize how much work they were for so little trade off. For me to support these versions, I would likely lose money because the user base is just not there (both of these platforms account for roughly 0.6% of all my Steam wishlists).</p>
<p>Massive apologies for this cancellation, although I hope the announcement of the game on all these other platforms at least softens the blow a little bit.</p>
<p>If you were an original Kickstarter backer who was expecting a Mac or Linux version, feel free to reach out to me via Kickstarter DM and I can organize a refund for you out of pocket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The wording is a bit odd there with the developer saying it will be "out of pocket". Well, people gave <em>their</em> money to the project for something it's <em>not</em> doing now. So it's only natural to return it. Kickstarter though is very much a gamble on if you like the idea enough.</p>
<p>Sad to see for backers of the project, much like what we saw with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/nightdive-studios-confirm-linux-and-macos-ports-of-system-shock-are-cancelled/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nightdive Studios remaked of System Shock</a> doing the same. We also saw the developer of Blazerush <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/racing-game-blazerush-ends-support-for-linux-macos-and-steamvr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently announce</a> their ending of Linux and macOS support too. Once again, for macOS it's a <em>bigger</em> loss, since they get nothing, but at least for Linux players (and Steam Deck) it should <em>hopefully</em> be playable with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>

      <title>Framework Laptop 13 gets Intel Core Ultra with a 120 Hz display, and cheaper AMD models</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework, the popular maker of customizable, modular and upgradable laptops has announced a big upgrade for the Framework Laptop 13 across both Intel and AMD models.</p>
<p>The newest version of Framework Laptop 13 comes with the latest Intel Core Ultra Series 1 processors, an optional 13.5" 2880x1920 120 Hz display on both Intel and AMD systems, a new webcam with 9.2MP image sensor, and configurations designed for businesses and professionals with a 3-year warranty.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are open now with shipping starting in August for all 14 countries they're currently in, and they're launching in Sweden, Finland, and Denmark this June.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2671558901717069128gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>On top of that the AMD Ryzen 7040 Series Framework Laptop 13 has seen a permanent price reduction, and it also has the new 2.8k display and webcam along with the high-capacity 61Wh battery.</p>
<p>Nice to see Linux repeatedly get mentioned too, as they said: "Our focus this year is on refining the end-to-end experience for both current and new customers, making this the ideal laptop for Linux in addition to Windows, and enabling businesses to enter the world of repairable, customizable computing".</p>
<p>Speaking about the newer display they also said "Even better, that resolution allows for a streamlined experience in Linux through 2:1 display scaling." and for those of you who don't want a Windows logo on your keyboard they additionally said "We have one last bit of good news for Linux users too: you can now configure an English International keyboard with a “super” key instead of the logo from an OS you aren’t using.".</p>
<p>Of course, since it's Framework and their laptops are modular, you <em>don't</em> need to buy an entire new laptop. All the new parts will be up on the Framework Marketplace for you to pick up and slot into your existing Framework unit.</p>
<p>All the details in <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/blog/introducing-the-new-framework-laptop-13-with-intel-core-ultra-series-1-processors" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the blog post</a>.</p>
<p><em>One day I will get my hands on the DIY edition to build it myself, that's the dream anyway.</em></p>

      <title>Super-chilled management game Minami Lane adds full controller support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Minami Lane from Doot / Blibloop released with Native Linux support back in February, and the developer just released a major update adding in controller support.</p>
<p>"Minami Lane is a small, wholesome management game set on a Japanese-inspired street. Create and manage your own street, make sure everyone is happy, and watch the villagers live their lives! Enjoy 2 to 4 hours of playtime, cute tanukis and lots of cats!"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="770ODbo1lBY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6ec94a99648d0cfd5e6e166830205e01.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/770ODbo1lBY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2678990/view/4146204937626486851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they said</a>: "Minami Lane can now be played comfortably with a gamepad or on any handheld platform Like Steam Deck or ROG Ally. Xbox, Playstation and Steam Deck controllers will all show native input prompts, and other ones will use Xbox prompts. The "verified" tag for Steam Deck should come very soon!"</p>
<p>The update also comes with 6 new languages, various visual improvements, lots of quality of life updates and lots of bug fixes too.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>2-4 hours of play time.</li>
<li>Create and customize your own adorable street.</li>
<li>Manage shops by adjusting their inventory, recipes, and prices.</li>
<li>Play strategically to complete each level's mission objectives.</li>
<li>Keep the streets clean by picking up trash.</li>
<li>Tanukis and cats!</li>
</ul>
<p>With the sweet style and short playtime, this could be a nice one when you just want to switch-off your brain and relax for a bit. And now with the controller support that's certainly easier than ever.</p>
<p>It has an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2678990/Minami_Lane/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Athena Crisis looks a lot like Advance Wars and now its code is open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Entering Early Access on Steam back in March, Athena Crisis clearly takes inspiration from the classic Advance Wars and now the code has been made open source.</p>
<p>Like various other open source releases only the code is open under the MIT license but other parts are not like the single-player campaign, artwork, music and so on so you still need a copy of the game to work with it. In the <a href="https://cpojer.net/posts/athena-crisis-open-source" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> about it being opened up they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Athena Crisis is an example of how to build a high-quality video game using only JavaScript, React, and CSS. By open-sourcing Athena Crisis, we are following through on our commitment to open source our core technology and help push the Web forward as a game development platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also funding around $10,000 of community improvements to it, as they hope to pull in more people.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="dyCVlMW6mBY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7799b4b6f2b4414ffe37254a65e48191.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/dyCVlMW6mBY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Command 40+ infantry, ground, naval and air units in turn-based battles.</li>
<li>Explore seven environments with unique playstyles.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in a single player campaign with funny &amp; memorable characters.</li>
<li>Compete online in ranked or casual battles with up to 7 players at once.</li>
<li>Create your own maps and campaigns and share them with friends.</li>
<li>Available in English, German, French, Spanish, Portugese, Ukrainian and Japanese.</li>

      <title>Over 30,000 people are clicking a picture of a Banana on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Never a dull day on Steam, with there now being a game where all you do is just click a picture of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Banana</a>. Yes, that's it and over 30,000 people are playing it right now.</p>
<p>30,687 at time of writing to be exact, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>. Although, <em>playing</em> is perhaps <em>not</em> the right word for this. Loading, clicking a Banana once or twice and then leaving it minimized is probably much more accurate. It's an idle clicker game, one that you're not really supposed to do anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18726797691717065669gol1.png"/></p>
<p>So what's the point and why are people doing this? Well, you can thank the Steam Marketplace for that. Inspired by another clicker game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784840/Egg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Egg</a>, that has the same idea. The developer even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2923300/discussions/0/4362374548293264672/#c4362374970372870797" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> it's just a worse made version of it on the Steam forum:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18356340021717065797gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It's a free to play game, but it does drop Banana Steam Items every so often and everyone then dumps them onto the Steam Marketplace hoping to make some extra cash, which you can then use to buy Steam games. I had it loaded for only a few minutes and got a fancy looking Dogenana which is worth about £0.13 at time of writing and according to Steam 6,863 were actually sold in the last 24 hours. People are going Bananas over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20452190041717065874gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>Some of these Bananas are worth a lot like the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/2923300/Crypticnana" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crypticnana</a> currently at a lowest listed price of £199.18, and only 25 of them actually exist as items.</p>
<p>It has a Native Linux version, although that didn't actually work for me, but it did work on Proton 9. I'm not suggesting you go play it, because it's ridiculous, but thought it was somewhat amusing to highlight and perhaps you might find it as stupid as I do.</p>

      <title>Team Fortress 2 fans have launched a new campaign to get Valve to save it</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve fans sure are passionate and they're once again trying to get Valve's attention to sort out various problems in Team Fortress 2.</p>
<p>For a long time now, Team Fortress 2 (TF2) has had a problem with bots. From cheating to blasting music, spamming hate-speech over voice comms, spamming chats, advertising their bot services, kicking real players and just generally being a massive nuisance. </p>
<p>So now there's a whole new campaign that has been launched to get Valve to do something more. The website, <a href="https://save.tf/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SaveTF2</a>, explains the situation and asks people to sign their petition that currently has 14,974 people that have given their backing to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8632761671717064428gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8632761671717064428gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve are aware of the problem, and back in May 2022 they <a href="https://x.com/TeamFortress/status/1529970640224018433" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TF2 community, we hear you! We love this game and know you do, too. We see how large this issue has become and are working to improve things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And they <em>have</em> made several improvements since, but naturally the bot makers fight back and so the game is continually left in a rather messy state. Only recently though, Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/team-fortress-2-gets-64bit-support-released-plus-vulkan-for-linux-via-dxvk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did launch the 64bit TF2 upgrade</a>, so Valve clearly haven't abandoned the game at all.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's likely quite a complicated problem to solve, otherwise Valve would have no doubt fixed it by now. But, perhaps with another push from players like this, Valve might put some more developer eyes back on to give it another go.</p>
<p>So what are the campaign organisers asking apart from signing their petition?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 3rd, we’re all going to collectively group together to take a stand against Valve’s inaction in dealing with the bots. We’re going to showcase the absolute magnitude of this issue to the online masses. </p>
<p>Screenshots, videos, and personal stories surrounding the bots in action, all accompanied by the tag #FixTF2. Alongside this is our petition, which will serve to represent the sheer enormity of how many players Valve’s inaction has negatively affected. We plan on forwarding each and every signature to them at a later date. We hope to gain the attention of as many mainstream gaming news outlets as possible, further shining a spotlight on the issue at hand. TF2 is not dying, it is being intentionally killed.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Garry Newman of Facepunch comments on the Nintendo takedown of Garry&#39;s Mod content</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Recently it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/garrys-mod-forced-to-remove-nintendo-content-after-takedowns/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was pretty big news</a> that Nintendo issued takedowns to Facepunch for Garry's Mod content, and now Garry Newman of Facepunch (developer of Garry's Mod and Rust) has written up a blog post with some comments on it.</p>
<p>A lot of people thought it <em>wasn't</em> a legitimate takedown from Nintendo, with rather a lot of post on Steam and social media debating if it was real or not as the requests for this (and other takedowns before elsewhere) have not technically been <em>direct</em> from Nintendo. The emails often come from "Aaron Peters" via "mm-nintendo.com" and so naturally, people speculated and came up with conspiracy theories about copyright trolls and fake DMCA notices.</p>
<p>But Newman previously <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1783501547361411494" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X to be clear that it had been verified it <em>was</em> from Nintendo. And now in a <a href="https://garry.net/posts/aaron-peters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> Newman has explained a little more noting how they've been getting "a ton of dms, voicemails, emails and actual physical hand written letters about this" because fans won't let it go.</p>
<p>The MM in the domain mentioned above stands for Mark Monitor, a company that "Provides strategic domain management solutions that help protect the revenue and reputation of the world’s leading brands". Looking over them, they're a <em>fancy</em> business-focused domain registrar designed for <em>bigger</em> businesses. And that mm-nintendo domain is noted as having "Nintendo of America Inc." very clearly as the owner.</p>
<p>As for this Aaron Peters who is noted on a lot of takedown noticed? Newman thinks they don't even exist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This guy doesn't exist. Well, he might, but I don't think he does.</p>
<p>If you look at the history of takedowns, you will notice they started as real Nintendo employees. Then they all switched to Aaron. I would guess that this is because the internet is full of crazies.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that you invent a name to be the target of that stuff. Let the internet shout at an empty chair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newman noted, <em>again</em>, they've had it confirmed it's a <em>legitimate</em> Nintendo takedown. The ending of the blog was also quite interesting copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't really understand the anger people have shown about this stuff. It doesn't seem logical to me. Maybe I grew up in a different time where IP, trademarks and copyright laws were obvious no brainers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe because of streaming and Steam this generation grew up without real piracy. Maybe they don't understand all that because they can post music and videos in their memes on tiktok and no-one gets pissed.<br/>
<br/>
The attitude shouldn't be anger and outrage that it is being stopped; it should be surprise and delight that you got away with it for so long.<br/>
<br/>
Companies letting you use their IP like this isn't the default. When a company lets you get away with using their IP in UGC in another game they're a cool company. When they don't, they're a normal company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sums it up quite well really.</p>
<p>You would think we would have learned by now that you can't just take well-known characters, entire designs from companies, and not expect to get slapped by them at some point. All that effort would be better spent on something original.</p>

      <title>The supervillains won, so fight back in superhero strategy game Capes - out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Spitfire Interactive, former members of Defiant Development who made Hand of Fate, comes the superhero strategy game Capes. <u>Note</u>: a key was provided before release.</p>
<p>Story: Twenty years ago, the supervillains won. Since then, they’ve created a dystopian city where developing superpowers is a crime and no one has dared oppose them. Until now! Assemble a diverse team of heroes while fighting to take back their city, now controlled by evil despots! Play across the dark and gritty campaign and patrol assignments, push the story forward and reveal the truth behind the horrific Enhancement program of The Company that is pulling the strings behind the scenes.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Z-VDKNTUIa4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f02c624a4b0241d75e63bdbb46cd50e6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Z-VDKNTUIa4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Inspired by XCOM, here you get a cinematic and rather action-packed turn-based strategy game, that mixes in team management with a little comic book flair. So if you love superheroes and anything resembling XCOM, you're going to feel really at home with this one. Capes is all about rising from the ashes, as you build up a ragtag group of new Capes (their word for heroes) to hopefully take back the city, taking down The Company. And hopefully find out what they've been doing to all the captured heroes.</p>
<p>Capes is a pretty <em>intense</em> and brutal strategy game and not one to beat around the bush with the setting either. Even from the intro section you're greeted with supervillains and their goons gunning down civilians right in front of you — and of course you get the blame for it.</p>
<p>It's not as open as XCOM in how you play as it's a linear game, since it's firmly based on playing through the acts of the story, and certainly not on the level of graphical quality of Marvel's Midnight Suns (another superhero strategy game) with it being from a small team, but there's a huge amount of charm to it thanks to the strategy involved with each individual character. The combat is just a whole lot of fun but it does take a little learning, and a bit of trial and error, due to how unique each character you recruit is.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8381240701716923452gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8381240701716923452gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Not only can you move and attack in any order, as long as you have the points, but each character has multiple unique abilities. Some can teleport, create crystals to block line of sight or stop people in their tracks, use telekinesis to launch objects at enemies and telepathy to mess with minds and more.</p>
<p>The beauty in it though is how the abilities of the individual characters work together with the special link system, where multiple heroes link together if they're close enough to do a slightly more special attack. There's a good number of those team ups too and they really are powerful, but needing to keep your people close enough together can also be a big issue and your downfall on some missions. Adding to that, each character <em>also</em> has a unique <em>ultimate</em> ability that you have to charge up during a mission, with each charging up a different way based on their main abilities.</p>
<p>Another element to the battles are the need to disarm enemies, as various thugs that carry weapons can have it knocked right out of their hand either through the specific disarm ability if you're close, or by using some special hero abilities that disarm enemies in addition to taking down their HP. Needed often too, since weapons will cause more problems for you from enabling enemies to have range (terrible for low-HP heroes) and sometimes extra attacks on you.</p>
<p>There's another layer to the game with your base of operations, that sees your team hidden in the old spot where the original strongest heroes would meet up. Although it's looking a little worse for wear. Here you can upgrade your heroes and there's a good few different ability upgrades for each of them, along with unlocking entirely new abilities. Although, even with plenty of upgrades, they never really feel over-powered against enemies. You're still going to need to think tactically during every single mission making good use of all their abilities together.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206920631716927060gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18206920631716927060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Like me, you'll probably end up with some favourites for their abilities, as well as their link team-up abilities, and you'll end up hardly using some others. The best bit though? There's no random hit chance. No 99% miss. No lurking behind cover either it's all about the movement, positioning and using the abilities together.</p>
<p>There's an interesting challenge system to this as well. Each character has an <em>individual</em> set of challenges, doing each one will unlock more SP points, which you can then use to upgrade their abilities some more. It ranges from simply using abilities to more interesting challenges like hitting a certain amount of enemies in one go, knocking enemies off ledges and so on.</p>
<p>A useful feature is that you can also re-play missions, enabling you to "simulate" them to ensure you complete all the available optional bonus objectives. Some of them are pretty difficult too and nicely varied so they don't feel like a boring chore to get through, so you might end up going back a fair bit because you actually <em>want</em> to. And because it never gets old seeing all the special abilities smashing through multiple enemies. Completing them all fully allows you more time to level all your heroes up, to proceed further into the story if you need to. Or just practice time to mess with the various abilities if you need it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/554498811716987087gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/554498811716987087gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some missions will be straight-up fights, some (like pictured above) make you sneak around stealthily, some have you protect a specific character and so on. There really is enough variety there that it does keep you nicely on your toes. And you don't have to sit waiting either, as you can fast-forward the enemy AI turns to get control of your team again a bit quicker, which I do wish some other strategy games had — nice touch.</p>
<p>Those damn challenges though, some feel impossible without first levelling up your heroes, which I feel is part of the point but I was determined in some cases and ended up replaying through a few missions many times to do them. There's so many fun ways to do the missions once you get more heroes and upgrade them.</p>
<p>Lots of nice little details to it too, like the main cut-scenes having their speech bubble tail moving around with character's mouths as they're talking. All the little comic-book animations during conversations and through the UI really help bring it to life.</p>
<p>Issues: one real nuisance quirk I did have on Kubuntu Linux 24.04 (KDE Plasma), was having to switch between borderless and windowed mode to get it to actually fill the screen properly. First launch had the bottom cut, after that it kept going into a small window. Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> entirely solved that issue forcing it into a 1440p full-screen window. Apart from that, it worked beautifully (no other Linux issues noticed, that is).</p>
<p>Another issue, much like other similar games, is sometimes the camera angles during attacks get a bit weird. Not too often, but you probably will see a good few times that something is covering up the screen during an attack.</p>
<p>Performance all maxed out at 1440p on my Ryzen 5800X and Radeon 6800XT desktop has been great, constantly above 100FPS. No complaints there.</p>
<p>Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Be Mighty: Play as heroic protectors of the innocent, each with unique skills and powers. Master your hero and unleash devastating ultimate abilities!</li>
<li>Assemble Your Team: Select the right team for the right mission. Combat isn’t based on random numbers, so choose wisely to win the day!</li>
<li>Level Up: Complete challenging missions and side-quests to improve your heroes with new abilities and powerful upgrades!</li>
<li>Defeat Evil: Face down vile villains and criminal corporate henchmen. Do you have what it takes to free your city from the clutches of villainy!?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Capes has Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>If you love strategy games with a dark but fun story to follow, this is pretty much an essential purchase. The depth of the characters, along with all their abilities together is a <em>lot</em> of fun to smash through all the villains. Fun style too, although some of the characters look just a <em>bit</em> plastic, almost toy like in some cases, but it doesn't distract from the overall experience which is thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>A firm recommendation to go and buy. Only a villain would pass up on playing Capes.</p>
<p>You can buy Capes on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/capes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2081080/Capes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Quest Master is basically Zelda-maker and it&#39;s now in Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Giving classic Zelda vibes meets Mario Maker styled creation, Quest Master gives you plenty of tools to make dungeons, for you to go alone or in local co-op.</p>
<p>After releasing a demo that proved to be pretty popular, players ended up making over 250 dungeons for people to play through. With it now in Early Access the demo is still live, but the tools available in it are restricted. Seems fair.</p>
<p>Forge the story of Lanze, Javelynn and Shiv — the hero, heroine, and furry sidekick — by creating hand-crafted dungeons in a vibrant pixel art setting reminiscent of ‘90s top-down adventure classics. Fashion story-rich adventures or skill-testing obstacle courses for up to three adventurers at once, then share creations online with the Quest Master community complete with filtering options and ratings.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="QVpz8sWWn0U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4a35c26a0f40c4b6f0be0fe01e61b75c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/QVpz8sWWn0U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Not only will you be making dungeons like you always wanted, and playing through the creations from everyone else, there's also a Castle Town to explore full of mini-games and side-activities.</p>
<p>They've got a pretty exciting sounding roadmap to keep expanding it during Early Access including more themes, more enemies, more items, expansions to Castle Town, a full proper single-player campaign, expanded lore and possibly even online multiplayer which they're only tentatively saying for now.</p>
<p>“The reception of Quest Master's demo has been incredible. 260 dungeons have been created since the demo launched 3 weeks ago. Now that the Early Access launch has landed, we’re diving deep into new features for 1.0,” said Julian Creutz, Lead Developer of Quest Master. “This is just the beginning for our fans, new and returning. We’re crafting an experience that we believe will inspire dungeon designers for years to come.”</p>
<p>You can check it out in Early Access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094070/Quest_Master/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support. Currently it has no Steam Deck rating.</p>

      <title>Historical 4x strategy game Old World - Behind the Throne DLC brings plenty new</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Old World is a quality historical 4x strategy game that you should not pass up, especially if you love you Civilization styled games and this latest DLC adds in plenty of new content. The game has only continued to get better and better since it jumped from the Epic Store to Steam back in May, 2022. <em>It's probably one of the best in the genre.</em></p>
<p>Old World - Behind the Throne is the 5th main DLC for the game with this focusing on character interactions and court politics.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19304364571716985578gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19304364571716985578gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of what's included:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>350+ new events centering around court politics, intrigue, and personal ambition. The world behind the throne is a complex web of deceit, personal goals, and opportunities.</li>
<li>New historical characters
<ul>
<li>Alcibiades, Athenian statesman, and notorious political double-crosser.</li>
<li>Enlil-nadin-shumi, usurper of the throne of Babylon.</li>
<li>Harpagus, Kingmaker of Akkad.</li>
<li>Bardaisan, scientist, scholar, and philosopher of Assyria.</li>
<li>Mago the Author, Carthaginian writer on agriculture.</li>
<li>Avicenna, famed philosopher from Persia.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New projects and improvements
<ul>
<li>Estates, expensive new, improvements with a wide variety of benefits.</li>
<li>Opulence, a new project made possible by Estates. Use your wealth to generate additional victory points.</li>
<li>Slums, which balance faster population growth with risk of rebellion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Gameplay mechanics
<ul>
<li><strong>Rising Stars</strong> - Powerful non-leader characters who present dangers and opportunities as they accumulate experience, triggering a wide range of events with both negative and positive effects. If they become too much of a nuisance, there’s always ways of “dealing” with them.</li>
<li><strong>Stress &amp; Revelry</strong> - Stymied ambitions, jealous lovers, raging barbarians, and much more can all take their toll on a ruler. Will your ruler indulge in hedonistic pursuits to escape the stress?</li>
<li><strong>The Grand Vizier</strong> - Take the minutiae of managing your cities off your plate, handing control to Viziers who will manage based on their personalities. Wise Viziers will focus on culture, courageous ones will recruit military units faster, while disciplined ones create specialists and special projects faster. Be warned, though – power corrupts, and a trusted Vizier might turn their gaze towards your throne.</li>
<li><strong>New Political Eras</strong> - Civil wars, grand reforms, and periods of corruption and decadence will bring forth new challenges for your empire as a whole.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Old World has Native Linux support, and last I checked it ran really well on Linux. To go with the new DLC release the base game and previous DLC are all on sale.</p>
<p>Created by Mohawk Games based in Baltimore, Maryland (USA) the studio is led by Leyla Johnson and Soren Johnson, the lead designer of Sid Meier's Civilization IV and co-lead designer of Sid Meier's Civilization III. Mohawk Games previously released Offworld Trading Company.</p>

      <title>Puppygames bring massive-scale asynchronous PvP battle simulator Battledroid to Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Puppygames are launching a new game with Battledroid, a massively multiplayer online asynchronous PvP battle simulator that has a rather big scale to it.</p>
<p>For those who don't immediately recognise the name, Puppygames made the likes of: Revenge of the Titans, Titan Attacks!, Droid Assault, Ultratron and Basingstoke. Revenge of the Titans is a bit of a classic! One from the second Humble Indie Bundle which had the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131020134018/https://www.puppygames.net/blog/?p=914" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source code released</a>.</p>
<p>Using their own "state-of-the art custom voxel graphics engine" they call VOXOID, they wrote it from scatch in Java and OpenGL to allow them to "create spectacular battles" which they say supports "massive super-detailed landscapes, thousands of battling droids, and millions of particles to create explosive effects". Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="8AWQFimTZOA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fc9c40f7f7c46e9bb1bacaeedd385e82.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/8AWQFimTZOA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The trailer does a pretty poor job of showing off what the overall gameplay will be like but imagine an auto-battler on a massive scale as you will battle for territory across 250,000 tiles set across a persistent open world map of the real Earth, using actual terrain and environmental data.</p>
<p>You set up all your units (in defence, or attack), tweak their parameters a little, and then launch your attack - and sit back to watch them blow each other to bits. Winner keeps or takes the territory. There's a lot more explained and shown via gifs and screenshots on the Kickstarter.</p>
<p>They've been building the game on and off now for around 14 years from the initial designs back in 2010, to having a Beta available on Steam now (for backers). They're hoping to raise at least £27,600 from the new Kickstarter, so they can get working on it full time to push it over the finishing line.</p>
<p>Features at release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free to play!</li>
<li>Massive battles with up to 1000 units on each side.</li>
<li>Asynchronous online multiplayer - you can play even if your friends are offline.</li>
<li>Voxels! Voxels! Voxels! State-of-the art custom voxel graphics engine, with destructible scenery.</li>
<li>Editable environment and weather system with realistic fog, mist and volumetric lighting.</li>
<li>Tiny download, quick startup, and free to jump in and start blowing stuff up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Battledroid will have Native Linux support just like their previous games.</p>
<p>Check it out on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/puppygames/battledroid/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Kickstarter</a> and follow on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247710/Battledroid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Bella Wants Blood is a bite-sized &#34;roguelike terror defense&#34; game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After releasing the roguelike tower defense Core Defense in 2020, and then the rogue-lite survival base builder Landnama in 2023 developer Sonderland is back with something weird with Bella Wants Blood. <u>Note</u>: developer provided an early review key.</p>
<p>They're calling it an "absurd bite-sized roguelike terror defense game", which in a few ways builds on the ideas from Core Defense but puts it into a darker setting and gives you a Slay the Spire style path system to progress through.</p>
<p>"Trapping you in their world, the god-like Bella demands you play their game to feed them blood. Lay down gutters and destructive terrors to obliterate Bella’s friends and their grotesque minions. Just don’t let them reach the end of your maze or Bella will get upset. And if Bella gets upset, Bella might just keep you there forever."</p>

<p>Bella Wants Blood has Native Linux support.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3007660/Bella_Wants_Blood/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. There's no current release date mentioned other than sometime "soon".</p>
<p>Who are Sonderland? Three dads and close friends from Germany, France and Canada with different backgrounds and perspectives on gaming, united by the desire to make beautiful, minimalist games they love to play.</p>

      <title>Steam Beta adds Bluetooth device battery info for Steam Deck, various desktop PC updates</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another round of Steam Client Beta updates are here with Steam Deck and Desktop PC seeing lots of improvements and bug fixes, and it's especially nice for people using Bluetooth on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>These are just for the Steam Deck from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4177730135016134612?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">changelog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Show battery information for connected Bluetooth devices under Settings-&gt;Bluetooth and in the Quick Access menu.</li>
<li>Added a per-device toggle to Settings-&gt;Bluetooth that controls whether a device is allowed to wake Steam Deck from sleep.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the UI to show stale data for Bluetooth devices.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see on the Bluetooth changes, especially as you needed to use a plugin before to get better settings for Bluetooth devices. The Bluetooth device on wake though as far as I know, is still only on the OLED model.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/4146204937627686655?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the rest</a> of the Steam Client Beta for everyone on Steam Deck and Desktop PCs:</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inventory management games are becoming another popular thing at the moment. We've had all those survivor-like bullet-heaven games and now another genre is springing to life. NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters looks like a sweet spin on the idea.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/backpack-battles-is-another-clear-indie-steam-hit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Backpack Battles</a> that released back in March is a current favourite of mine, but NEODUEL: Backpack Monsters brings with it a nice twist with you stuffing monsters into your pack. It's all about getting the best combo you can, while battling other players and fusing these creatures together to make a more powerful one. </p>

      <title>Zelda 64: Recompiled, the Majora&#39;s Mask PC port v1.1 brings various upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Zelda 64: Recompiled was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/zelda-majoras-mask-gets-a-pc-port-with-a-new-open-source-tool-for-nintendo-64-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty interesting news recently</a>, a PC port of Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask using the new <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp" rel="noopener" target="_blank">N64: Recompiled</a> tool and now a fresh update is out to improve it further.</p>
<p>It was already impressive, and now even more so. It's only going to keep getting better thanks to it being open source. Linux players especially might want this one, due to a SDL crash fix. As a reminder, you do need a copy of the game to work with Zelda 64: Recompiled, since it does not provide that for you (obviously).</p>
<p>Version 1.1.0 brings:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added an analog "free" camera in the style of later entries in the series. Moving the right stick will allow you to freely rotate the camera, and pressing the Target button or going through an entrance will switch back to the normal camera.</li>
<li>Improved motion blur effect at high framerates by using a high precision internal framebuffer (won't be enabled on machines with less than 1GB of VRAM).</li>
<li>Implemented N64 noise dither (affects the motion blur scenes).</li>
<li>Extended Dawn of the X Day screen to account for faster load times to match console timings.</li>
<li>Added a configurable scaled deadzone option to the menu. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/257" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#257</a>)</li>
<li>Added the option to remap the menu button on controllers. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/181" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#181</a>)</li>
<li>Added an automatic save backup system to reduce chance of losing data if saving gets interrupted. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/260" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#260</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a Linux crash on startup by forcing SDL2 video driver selection to X11. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/197" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#197</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed the Skull Kid "curse" effect in very wide aspect ratios. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/259" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#259</a>)</li>
<li>Added a main volume slider. (<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/pull/267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">#267</a>)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

      <title>VoxeLibre (formerly MineClone2) v0.87 released moving away from Minecraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>VoxeLibre (formerly MineClone2), a free and open source sandbox game, has a brand new release available as they begin more movement to end the Minecraft clone wars. Well, as much as they can anyway, because it still looks and acts like Minecraft and is one of the best free alternatives.</p>
<p>Not only is this the first release with a new name, but it also has plenty of new mechanics and some new mobs included too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13774213861716915765gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13774213861716915765gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A rewrite of the Potions and Effects system. This includes new effects, new potions and brewing recipes being added.</li>
<li>Rewritten Nether Portals making them work better, and now they connect up properly.</li>
<li>Improvements to the mob spawning system.</li>
<li>New mobs:
<ul>
<li>Rover is a new mob, replacing the enderman.</li>
<li>Stalker is another new mob, replacing the creeper.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eating is now delayed instead of instant and has a first-person animation.</li>
<li>Multiple new blocks.</li>
<li>Capes are included in the character customisation.</li>
<li>Cherry blossom particles.</li>
<li>Leather armour can now be coloured (and washed).</li>
<li>Sign text editing.</li>
<li>+ much, much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sounds like a pretty exciting release for the project! Have many of you been playing it, what are your thoughts?</p>

      <title>Terraria: The Board Game live on Kickstarter - goal met almost instantly</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Terraria the smash-hit indie game is being turned into a tabletop experience with Terraria: The Board Game. It's crowdfunding on Kickstarter, and obviously it was going to do well.</p>
<p>Their goal was met almost instantly! At time of writing the main goal is £19,850 and they have £223,697 pledged. So yeah, clearly a lot of people are wanting in on this one and who could blame them? It looks great! Official too of course, made by Paper Fort Games in collaboration with Re-Logic!</p>
<p>With this adaption it will be playable for 1-4 people (solo play is an option) with world exploration, co-op play, dice-based combat, deck-building and little miniatures for bosses you can paint too.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OrX4wCKiVmA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e28e9b334e26b58c644f02a6b03406a4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OrX4wCKiVmA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's certainly not cheap though at £62 to get it (not including shipping), but this is a special game adaption, it's quite different to just going into a local store and picking up a copy of Monopoly. You're paying to support the creators as much as you are getting a board game for you to play.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paperfortgames/terraria-the-board-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full project on Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be jumping in for this one as well?</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

      <title>MangoHud performance monitor v0.7.2 out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MangoHud, the performance monitor you can put on top of games on Linux has a brand new release available with new features and fixes. This is the tech that powers the performance overlay on Steam Deck!</p>
<p>So with this you can get a readout of GPU and CPU use, RAM and VRAM use, FPS, frame timings and so much more. It's incredibly useful for tracking game performance across various settings, one of those now-essential tools.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883821101716895919gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20883821101716895919gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
Pictured - MangoHud 0.7.2 (top right) on Dying Light 2</em></p>
<p>The main changes in version 0.7.2 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">time</code> now has a label (you can remove this label with <code class="inline-code">time_no_label</code>)</li>
<li>Wayland keybinds have been added</li>
<li>rewritten exec function to have a persistent shell. Should reduce frametime spikes when using exec</li>
<li>exec is now right aligned to conform with every other item</li>
<li>meson options <code class="inline-code">with_x11</code> and <code class="inline-code">with_wayland</code> actually have a purpose now</li>
<li>added Pop!_OS and SteamOS to build script</li>
<li>added a mutex for config to prevent some crashes when accessing config at the same time as reloading</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">winesync</code> and <code class="inline-code">refresh_rate</code> have been changed to small font</li>
<li>added more stats to log summary</li>
<li>stop using <code class="inline-code">intel_gpu_top</code>, as it was causing too many issues. We can still get GPU load but the rest we'll have to wait for to be exposed in sysfs</li>
</ul>
<p>The fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>frametime color wasn't being correctly inherited, the user was not able to change it's color</li>
<li>fixed a crash when pressing Shift_R + F9</li>
<li>config options now correctly override preset options</li>
<li>fixed RPM and % being incorrectly assigned for GPU fan speeds</li>
<li>graphs had incorrect padding at start of graphs</li>
<li>fixed a crash when reloading the config while logging</li>
<li>check that cpu input gives a non-zero value</li>
<li>fixed minecraft-launcher crashing</li>
<li>graphs had incorrect padding leading to a smaller graph</li>
<li>fixed a build issue where some meson options would exclude opengl files incorrectly</li>
<li>fixed presets not working with <code class="inline-code">MANGOHUD_CONFIG</code> env</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">time_no_label</code> removes the label before <code class="inline-code">time</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">network</code> shows the throughput in kb/s for all interfaces or a specified list of interfaces e.g <code class="inline-code">network=eth0,wlo1</code></li>
</ul>

      <title>Co-op tower defense beat &#39;em up ChronoDojo adds various Steam Deck improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChronoDojo blends together two genres that I didn't think would work. Putting together tower defense and a beat 'em up sounds a bit odd, but I've seen a lot stranger. It reminded me of the classic Awesomenauts a bit, only co-op tower defense rather than a MOBA.</p>
<p>While it has no current official Steam Deck rating from Valve, the developers are clearly fans of the Linux-powered handheld. Writing in a post on Steam they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1428300/announcements/detail/4164219336136067403" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We so love playing and developing games for and from our couch! So naturally, we had to pick up a Steam Deck for ourselves and play ChronoDojo all over again!</p>
<p>While we're happy to say that it feels right at home on the deck, along the way we noticed many little tweaks, minor issues and opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>So! We bashed out this latest build and are happy to share it with everyone out there looking for a great game for their Steam Deck!</p>

<p>More about it: "Play solo or party with friends in this cute, cooperative combination of tower defense and beat 'em up action! Travel through time, leap through levels, quickly construct trusty towers, and battle against wave after wave of zany enemies!"</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play as adorable, humble heroes! (Custodian, Cook, Gardener, Fixer, Deliverer, Nurse).</li>
<li>Bash baddies, build towers and battle bosses in three unique times in history!</li>
<li>Accelerate and slow the flow of time in each level to achieve maximum victory!</li>

      <title>Physics-based roguelite bullet-hell Cosmo Rider improves Steam Deck controls</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cosmo Rider is a physics based roguelite bullet-hell-and-heaven horde-survivor action game. Upgrade your spaceship and traverse procedurally generated galaxies in this space survivors game. It has Native Linux support but no Steam Deck rating from Valve yet.</p>
<p>Recently it had a major upgrade to bring in randomized weapon attributes, and a new reinforcements system to help you out which sounds pretty fun. That was on top of a graphics upgrade back in April. They also recently added in key rebinds, along with better detection for Steam Deck controls, an updated tutorial, improved UI navigation and more.</p>
<p>Most recent trailer is below:</p>

<p>Looks like a whole lot of fun if you like space shooters, along with survivor-like gameplay too.</p>

      <title>Heroes of Might and Magic II game engine fheroes2 v1.1.0 released</title>
      <author>fheroes2</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dear fans of Heroes of Might and Magic 2 and fheroes2 project supporters! The team is excited to present to you the release of <a href="https://github.com/ihhub/fheroes2/releases/tag/1.1.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>version 1.1.0</strong></a> - the second major release of the fheroes2 engine! This release features a significant update that we are thrilled to share with you.</p>
<p>After more than a year of work, the team has completed the first version of the in-game <strong>Editor</strong>. The Editor is available on all platforms and is <strong>integrated into the game</strong>. You can access it by clicking on the canvas with a globe in the bottom-right corner of the Main Menu. The Editor works only with the full version of the game - <em>"Price of Loyalty"</em>. It is not supported in the demo or <em>"The Succession Wars"</em> versions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7416667021716892163gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The team redesigned the whole editor from the ground up to ensure that it is user-friendly and provides a smooth experience for map makers. A key feature we've added, which was missing in the original Editor, is the <strong>display of object passability</strong>. Now you can see the whole map and how the heroes will navigate around objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2836204501716892219gol1.png"/></p>
<p>The Editor uses a new map format - <em>.fh2m</em> . This license-free format is different from the original game's map format. It is very scalable, and we plan to expand it in future releases, offering map makers options to fine-tune many objects, add custom events, set unique loss and win conditions, and more. This also means that you can freely share your creations with others, and in the future, we are going to supply the engine with new maps.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the current version of the Editor <strong>lacks a few features</strong>. This was a deliberate decision to balance the release timeline and deliver well-tested and polished code rather than providing everything in a semi-finished state. <strong>Quality</strong> has always been our main priority. We will cover the missing features in the next release.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team enhanced AI on the Adventure Map, redesigned multiple UI dialogs and also updated several translations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6174342051716892258gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6174342051716892258gol1.png"/></a>~<br/>
<em>"Event" object new dialog.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17035579451716892308gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17035579451716892308gol1.png"/></a><br/>
<em>Random hero dialog.</em></p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your valuable and continuous support of the project, and we hope you will enjoy the game.</p>

      <title>No leaving a Steam account in a will after you die according to Valve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Doing the rounds right now is a post from Valve's Steam support (thanks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ars</a>), when a user asked about what would happen to their Steam account when they died and it's not great news for anyone hoping to pass on your Steam account.</p>
<p>This comes from a post on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resetera</a>, where the user asked if a Steam account could be transferred via a will. The Steam support staff member replied to note very clearly Steam accounts are plain and simply "non-transferable".</p>
<p>It's not exactly something new, or surprising, given that Steam's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Subscriber Agreement</a> clearly notes "You may not reveal, share or otherwise allow others to use your password or Account except as otherwise specifically authorized by Valve.". </p>
<p>Still, nothing actually technically stops you just writing down your details for someone and leaving it in a safe space, it's not like Valve actually go and confirm your identity. You also have the newer Family Sharing system, so someone could quickly go in and share it to your personal account and get <em>most</em> of the games.</p>
<p>It's also another reminder that on Steam, you <em>don't</em> own any games on it at all. Once again, as per the Subscriber Agreement, "Content and Services are licensed, not sold" and your "license confers no title or ownership in the Content and Services". </p>
<p>This will be the same across <em>nearly all</em> web stores that offer digital products you "buy", they're not yours. Epic Games Store is exactly the same as per their <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/eula" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EULA</a> which notes "All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by express license only and not by sale". Ubisoft are exactly the same in <a href="https://legal.ubi.com/StoreTermsofSale/en-GB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their terms</a> as well noting "we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensed, non-commercial and personal license". Think GOG are any better? They're not, as per GOG's <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/16034990432541-GOG-User-Agreement-effective-from-17-February-2024?product=gog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">agreement</a> "Your GOG account and GOG content are personal to you and cannot be shared with, sold, gifted or transferred to anyone else." and they make it clear multiple times you get a license again, not ownership of anything sold.</p>
<p>If you go through most other places, they all use similar language and we're not talking just game stores here but anywhere you digitally purchase movies, TV series and so on. You get the idea. You might be buying the item, but you have no ownernship at all.</p>
<p>Really, the only time this will change is when physical media properly dies off and people cause enough of a fuss that governments and legal bodies around the world put in new laws around digital ownership, which is not likely for a long time.</p>
<p>So, you probably should go and clear that backlog of games you've built up.</p>

      <title>2 Ship 2 Harkinian, another unofficial PC port of Zelda: Majora&#39;s Mask is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While we only recently had the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/zelda-majoras-mask-gets-a-pc-port-with-a-new-open-source-tool-for-nintendo-64-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Zelda 64: Recompiled release</a>, we've now also got another PC port of Zelda: Majora's Mask thanks to the Harbour Masters team with 2 Ship 2 Harkinian.</p>
<p>This one is from the same team that made <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/ship-of-harkinian-a-pc-port-of-ocarina-of-time-has-a-feature-filled-upgrade/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ship of Harkinian</a>, a PC port of Ocarina of Time, and so they've expanded their work to Majora's Mask. You do need a ROM file, so you'll need to actually have your own copy of the game to be able to play it. So much like the previous two links above, hopefully Nintendo won't come along and nuke it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9746723931716827021gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9746723931716827021gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With this first release the main highlights are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for higher frame rates<br/>
Similar to SoH, 2Ship allows you to up the framerate to as high as you want using Matrix Interpolation! The game logic still runs at 20 FPS, so this is all purely visual and won’t change any authentic game behavior.</li>
<li>Frame buffer effects - We hacked our way around needing to solve this in SoH, but with 2Ship we have a working frame buffer implementation that allows us to accurately recreate these effects like Motion Blur or capturing images for the PictoBox. You can read our blog post about this <a href="https://hmdev.blog/posts/frame-buffer-effects" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Free look - More camera freedom by allowing you to control your third person camera with the right analog stick.</li>
<li>Save related enhancements - Added the ability to auto save at timed intervals, back-ported "pause saving" from OoT, and preventing Owl Saves from being self-destructed when you load in.</li>
<li>Binary Save Import - While on file select screen, drag and drop save files from Recomp or Emulators to import your save into 2Ship. (Works with all of the save formats we were able to get our hands on, if you have something that doesn't work please create an issue on GitHub!)</li>
<li>DPad Items - Equip any item or mask to any DPad slot!</li>
<li>HUD Editor - Allow you to move and scale all elements of the hud. Includes presets for 4:3 (original) and widescreen HUDs.</li>
<li>Support for both N64 1.0 USA and GameCube USA roms!</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Rogue Prince of Persia arrives on Steam, devs will &#34;constantly&#34; improve it on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is now in Early Access on Steam, and the good news is that it should already work well on Steam Deck but the developer plans to keep improving it. So that's good news for desktop Linux players too. Since it uses Proton, as long as it performs well on Steam Deck, it should be no problem for a bigger desktop Linux PC.</p>
<p>It was entirely developed by Evil Empire, who previously maintained the very popular and rather brilliant Dead Cells, and you can definitely see they've learned some valuable lessons from their time working on it. Nice to see a developer who knows their stuff working on such a classic game series, one I started all the way back on the Amiga.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="LoYIyvwI__E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9143698811e2083e72c6c07705335f31.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/LoYIyvwI__E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking in a post on Steam the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2717880/discussions/0/4335356530803068912/#c4335356530803077171" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> "We will be constantly working on optimisation for the Steam Deck throughout Early Access too :)" and that they're waiting for Valve to verify it right now.</p>
<p>Early Access should last for around a year, and they have a lot of plans to expand it with double the current content planned for the 1.0 release. They said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now we have a fun solid nugget of a game - we're very confident that the acrobatic platforming and the combat moveset is a blast to play with and is a great base to build off during Early Access (and the music ain't half bad too, thanks ASADI! ;D).</p>
<p>We're well aware that we need to add more meta progression, upgrades, enemies, weapons, difficulty settings, other features and of course biomes, bosses and story acts, before the game can be considered complete.</p>
<p>But this is what Early Access is for, and our philosophy is that this is the best environment for us to build all of that in and to arrive at v1.0 with the best game possible, by working alongside a player community and in a fluid 'experimental' way.</p>

      <title>The Cozy Space Survivors post-release update has some simple lessons for indie devs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released on May 3rd, Cozy Space Survivors is a cute survival roguelite in space, one for those of you who don't have a lot of free time. It's a little gem and the developer has posted up some post-release thoughts.</p>
<p>As a tiny niche game, the developer clearly didn't have high expectations for it. They only expected about 10% of the release-day wishlists to actually be converted into sales. Showing just how truly <em>vital</em> wishlisting is on Steam, the developer had 1696 wishlists at release and ended up selling 1608 units, with 58 refunds. Not bad for such a game with basically no real marketing.</p>

<p>Against how long it took to make though over 10 months, about 650 hours they said (outside of their main job), with a pretty fun breakdown of how they spent that time with the vast majority of that time directly in <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot</a>. But a good few hours spread across Blender, sorting out audio, looking up tutorials and guides and so on.</p>
<p>Nice to see GamingOnLinux (that's us!) get a mention too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I did not expect, that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/cozy-space-survivors-is-a-sweet-time-survival-roguelite-in-space/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">an article about my game on a Linux gaming website</a> would be the biggest boost for my wishlists (before release). I also did not expect, that at/<strong>after release</strong> the spike would be the biggest ever. Makes no sense to me because the game did cost only $2 at release (May-03-2024) – I expected that people either buy immediately at such a low price or that they are not interested at all.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Also, quite funny how they <a href="https://simonschreibt.de/gat/cozy-space-survivors/#giveaway" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tracked down</a> someone that tried selling a key they gave them on G2A. That was a real <em>gotcha</em> moment. It's a reminder to game devs: Steam Curators do not need keys, you send the game directly to their curator page (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">like ours</a>!).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2657850/Cozy_Space_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy Cozy Space Survivors on Steam</a>. It's only £2.49 and there's a demo available. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Besiege: The Splintered Sea is out now with a free major sound system update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember Besiege from 2020? A physics building game about constructing mechanical machines to annihilate armies, obliterate castles and overcome challenging obstacles. Well, now you can go sailing in it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure sailing is the right word here. Besiege: The Splintered Sea allows you to make all sorts of crazy boats and ships to smash through things and it looks like a great addition to the main game. You can expect to see lots of new aquatic blocks, a new campaign and as you can imagine - lots of explosions with a brand new sandbox.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="79YkuLfpiAc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/35a5c146406898036b9e471c059f5a1e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/79YkuLfpiAc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The base game had a free update too which gives the sound system a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/346010/announcements/detail/6792069174998570968?snr=1_5_9_" rel="noopener" target="_blank">huge overhaul</a> to add in lots of new sound effects, collision sounds are now proportional in magnitude to the velocity of an impact and various different types of materials have new sound effects for actions. The biggest change is how each type of sound has its own independent track, which enables things to just sound a whole lot better to your ears instead of them all fighting for your attention.</p>
<p>Besiege has Native Linux support and it's rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve. You can buy Besiege from:</p>
<p><a href="https://af.gog.com/en/game/besiege?as=1636858786" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> (the expansion will <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/346010/eventcomments/5796774377119101460?snr=1_5_9_&amp;ctp=2#c5796774377120450472" rel="noopener" target="_blank">not</a> be on GOG though)</p>

      <title>TUXEDO Stellaris Slim 15 revealed for high performance in a small package</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another new laptop is on the way with the TUXEDO Stellaris Slim 15, the second revealed in the 6th generation of new Stellaris laptops from TUXEDO. This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/tuxedo-announce-the-desktop-replacement-stellaris-17-gen6-notebook/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stellaris 17 gen6 notebook</a> they revealed earlier this month.</p>
<p>So if the Stellaris 17 was too big for you, maybe this smaller one will be what you're after. This one also comes in two different editions with either AMD or Intel depending on who you prefer. And of course, full proper Linux support as standard with you able to pick between a few different Linux distributions.</p>
<p>From their email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The AMD base configuration with the Ryzen 7 8845HS, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 2x 8 GB 5600MHz DDR5 RAM, a 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD as well as TUXEDO OS pre-installed starts at 1.699 EUR (incl. Tax for german customers only) and around 1.430 EUR for customers outside europe (excl. Tax)<br/>
<br/>
The Intel base configuration with the Intel Core i7-14650HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 2x 8 GB 5600MHz DDR5 RAM, a 500 GB Samsung 980 SSD as well as TUXEDO OS pre-installed starts at 1.749 EUR (incl. Tax for german customers only) and around 1.470 EUR for customers outside europe (excl. Tax)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can upgrade the Intel model to an Intel Core i9-14900HX, and both models can also be upgraded to an NVIDIA 4070. Both come with a 15.3" screen at 2560 x 1600, 16:10 and 240Hz. The screen has 100% sRGB colour space coverage and a brightness of around 500 nits.</p>
<p>They also put together a new promotional video for this unit:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="JsWzdybqJJw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/918295ee303b9d7aa3bca5a6933f4c19.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/JsWzdybqJJw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For more info see the TUXEDO store for the <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-Stellaris-Slim-15-Gen6-INTEL" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Intel model</a> and <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-Stellaris-Slim-15-Gen6-AMD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AMD model</a>.

      <title>Steam Deck hits 15,000 games rated Playable and Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's popular Linux-powered gaming handheld the Steam Deck has hit a new milestone, with 15,000 games now rated either Playable or Verified. And it continues to sell well. Valve only <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-deck-hits-14000-games-rated-playable-or-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hit 14,000 back in early March</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/steam-deck-officially-hits-over-13000-games-playable-and-verified/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">13,000 back in January</a>.</p>
<p><em>For lots more Steam Deck news be sure to follow our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/category/Steam_Deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Deck tag</a>, it even has its own RSS feed.</em></p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that Deck Verified only includes what Valve have put through testing. Games not yet tested can still be played, you can try to play anything. Additionally, there are times the rating is wrong, like Unsupported games actually being fine or Verified games having poor performance (but we're talking a tiny percentage wrong here).</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's the current numbers of games rated by Valve</p>
<ul>
<li>Verified: 4,898</li>
<li>Playable: 10,102</li>
<li>Unsupported: 4,033</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Some recently Steam Deck Verified games that look great include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ANIMAL WELL</a></li>

<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17692038591716481592gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17692038591716481592gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1438480/Saviorless/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Saviorless</a>, Credit: Empty Head Games</em></p>
<p><em>Random shout-out to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/616620/Forest_Fortress/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Forest Fortress</a> (NSFW) </em><em>as becoming number 15,000 in the list. Bet Valve love testing all those games huh?</em></p>
<p>There's certainly no shortage of truly excellent games for the Steam Deck. There's more supported games than any one person can play, which is a pretty good place to be for a platform overall. You can see the proper numbers on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified&amp;refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B1%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, since that includes delisted games you can still play if you own them (which Valve still verify).</p>
<p>That leads me to the elephant in the room though: anti-cheat. What a pain in the ass it is. Various developers still have not enabled support via Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye including Rust, PUBG, Rainbow Six: Siege, Destiny 2 and more. And recently we've had <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/ea-sports-wrc-is-adding-ea-anticheat-breaking-another-game-on-steam-deck-linux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EA expand their own EA anticheat</a> breaking multiple games which is not looking good for their future titles on Steam Deck and Linux desktop. Hopefully Valve will eventually be in a position to do something about all that.</p>
<p>Additionally, while we don't get sales numbers from Valve on anything, we can see overall the Steam Deck has been selling well. Especially since the release of the Steam Deck OLED. Looking at the global <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topsellers/global/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">top sellers</a>, the Steam Deck constantly ranks quite high. While the Steam Deck is much more costly compared to regular games, remember those top games sell often tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands and more constantly. So it's clear Valve are shifting plenty of units.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Here's how it's doing on sales position over time:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722300811716468205gol1.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6722300811716468205gol1.png"/></a></p>

      <title>KDE Plasma 6.1 Beta released with Wayland Explicit Sync support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Time for testing, especially for those of you with an NVIDIA GPU as the KDE Plasma 6.1 Beta is now live with some new features. Currently the roadmap shows that KDE Plasma 6.1 will be released as stable on June 18th. So you have a good while to report any unexpected issues from testing.</p>
<p>Here's all the main stuff that's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Triple buffering in KWin for smoother rendering and animations</li>
<li>Support for the Wayland Explicit Sync protocol, which should improve life for NVIDIA users in particular</li>
<li>Support for the Input Capture portal</li>
<li>Remote Desktop system integration to allow RDP clients to connect to Plasma desktops, plus a new page in System Settings for configuring this</li>
<li>New UX for Plasma's edit mode to make its modality more obvious and visually fancier</li>
<li>Added a configurable edge barrier between screens, to make it easier to hit UI elements touching the edges between screens. This also allows auto-hide panels on edges between screens to work properly</li>
<li>Fake session restore on Wayland that at least re-opens apps that were open last time, even if they don't get positioned in the same place. Support for real session restore is still being worked on</li>
<li>Support for syncing the color of your keyboard's RGB backlight with Plasma's accent color</li>
<li>Support for using the color profile embedded into the display, for displays that bundle these</li>
<li>Support in Discover for replacing end-of-support Flatpak apps with their replacements</li>
<li>Support for the battery conservation mode features on many Lenovo IdeaPad and Legion laptops</li>
<li>Support for passwordless screen locking, for using it as a screensaver in an environment without security concerns</li>
<li>You can now middle-click the Power &amp; Battery widget to block and unblock automatic sleep and screen locking, and scroll over it to switch the active power profile</li>
<li>Slightly rounder corners, and more consistency between corner radius everywhere</li>
<li>Better window layout algorithm for Overview</li>
<li>The "Shake cursor to find it" effect has been enabled by default</li>
<li>New off-by-default effect to hide the mouse pointer after a period of inactivity</li>
<li>System Settings Keyboard page has been rewritten in QML</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers puts a new spin on Blackjack for deck-builder fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers is a different kind of deck-builder and given the popularity of Balatro, this could be another fun one to try.</p>
<p>Set in a tavern packed with the rough and ready, where everyone plays a very different version of traditional Blackjack. Players will have to try their hand at this newfangled card game in order to take down the greedy capitalists exploiting the Blackjack-addicted townsfolk.</p>
<p>Recently Yogscast Games picked it up to become publisher, and they've been jumping in to help development with some brand new art. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Q3IzShOv9Fk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1e3674b9344aa1701e2537aba3945eee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Q3IzShOv9Fk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“From the moment we first saw it, we knew there was something very special about Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers, so I’m relieved to be able to finally talk about our partnership,” says Simon Byron, managing director, Yogscast Games. “It’s been a real collaboration between us and Purple Moss Collectors and a genuine honour to help Mike bring the game to life. With the demo now live, I can’t wait for players to experience Dungeon &amp; Degenerate Gamblers incredible twist on a classic card game ruleset, which results in a fantastic roguelike deckbuilding adventure unlike any other. Yes, including that one.”</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>4 unique play styles based around card suits.</li>
<li>Unlock new starter decks when you complete runs, for a whole new way to play!</li>
<li>Over 250 unique cards!</li>
<li>60 characters to defeat.</li>
<li>Unique grimey pixel art aesthetic.</li>
<li>All the degeneracy from a seedy casino but with no risk to your finances, mental health, or your loved ones.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You can try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support with a release due later this year.</p>

      <title>Insane FPS &#39;MULLET MADJACK&#39; gets updated for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a popular recent Steam release is MULLET MADJACK, a very vibrant single-player FPS set inside a retro Anime. It looks absolutely wild and the developer has made improvements to it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>With a unique fusion of elements influenced by classic 90s FPS games, strategy, and intense action, this game promises to keep players entertained for hours on end. It arrived on May 15th and quickly shot up to an Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam.</p>
<p>In the recent <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2111190/announcements/detail/4182233099914510465" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch</a> the developers noted they "fixed bugs between save interactions carried out from pc to steam deck and vice versa messing with the game". Additionally they also added more resolutions to work with other handheld gaming devices too. Plus other bug fixes and optimizations.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kEtCK7U34Pw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dc34f4ed90cb9d203bfb019636a537b7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kEtCK7U34Pw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exciting</strong> and dynamic combat: Race against time and infiltrate a building alone, overcoming each floor until you reach your objective.</li>
<li><strong>Campaign</strong> mode: Clear floors filled with robots, and in crucial moments, execute ultraviolent finishes on your enemies to survive.</li>
<li><strong>Survival</strong> mode: Utilize your skills in an endless mode and outdo your friends.</li>
<li><strong>Unique visual </strong>and art style: The contrasting colors between black and vibrant neon evoke the aesthetics of violent and adult anime from the era of VHS tapes.</li>
<li><strong>Engaging</strong> narrative: Set in an Old School cyberpunk world full of robots, the aesthetics of 90s anime merge with an action-packed environment.</li>
<li><strong>Nostalgic</strong> <strong>soundtrack</strong>: Inspired by the synthwave genre, the soundtrack sets the tone and urban atmosphere of the game.</li>
<li><strong>Evolve your character:</strong> Enhance your character with smart choices so that you can reach the top floor in the best possible time or you'll have to try again, all in the best Rogue-Lite style. But remember that each upgrade will affect how the game is played. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Always good to see developers put some more effort into ensuring their games work well on Steam Deck. Valve haven't yet rated it officially but on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2111190?device=any" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> it has a Platinum rating so on deskop Linux you're good to go, and with this recent patch maybe it will see an eventual Deck Verified rating.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111190/MULLET_MADJACK/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Ruins To Fortress is a PvP and PvE side-scrolling post-apocalyptic survival game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ruins To Fortress is a side-scrolling multiplayer PvP and PvE survival indie game set on an atmospheric dystopian island. A bit like a side-scrolling Rust. Your journey begins as you hang and glide from a drone, landing on an island shrouded in mystery and inhabited by outlaws and corporate security guards, beckoning you to uncover its secrets.</p>
<p>An interesting idea for a survival game, that seems it may feel just a bit like Kingdom series (Kingdom Two Crowns, Kingdom: New Lands). If you love multiplayer games this could be a good one, especially since you can directly host a game yourself or set up a dedicated server for it too.</p>
<p>Check out their cinematic trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ElGXcyXS0CY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/aad17249828bcc61ef1ea6f15fe80bee.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ElGXcyXS0CY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Developed by NimbleBeasts, this is the same small team that created Moonshot - The Great Espionage.</p>
<p>There's a demo available with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585860/Ruins_To_Fortress/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Native Linux support on Steam</a>. The full game is due out sometime this year.</p>

      <title>Try the demo for Dreaming Isles, a farming life sim and a high-seas adventure</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love Stardew Valley and want something different? Dreaming Isles seems like a truly wonderful idea blending the farming life sim with a high seas adventure. It has a demo available with full Native Linux support, and it's due for release in October.</p>
<p>More about it: "Dreaming Isles is an upcoming cozy farm life sim that combines high seas adventure, relationship building, and Zelda-like sword and sorcery. Grow your own ammo (YawningDad is not liable for any damage to your farm or ship caused by the mishandling of frost berries, fire melons, or any other volatile plant life), win the hearts of the Islanders (with the possible exception of the Witch of the Woods, who has been known to turn suitors into toads), bring peace and prosperity to the land (or become a pirate and bring more of a mayhem-ey sort of peace and prosperity)."</p>
<p>Check out the trailer, it's a bit older but it's the latest they have that should give you a good idea of what to expect from this cute upcoming game:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="tiepN9PCqpM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/4d323555e05b07f0390b6eb9f9c6fb5f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/tiepN9PCqpM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Really seems like a fun blending of ideas here. From a solo developer too, which is always impressive to see. And nice to see proper Linux support again for another sweet game too. With full controller support, it should also be a good one for Steam Deck players.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2258320/Dreaming_Isles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Werewolf: The Apocalypse — Purgatory announced, a new choice-driven RPG thriller visual novel</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Werewolf: The Apocalypse — Purgatory was revealed recently by Different Tales, who also made the rather great Werewolf: The Apocalypse — Heart of the Forest (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/10/werewolf-the-apocalypse-heart-of-the-forest-is-out-now-and-its-great/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">that I rather enjoyed my time with</a>).</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from its predecessor, Heart of the Forest, Purgatory continues the saga with familiar faces from the Bialowieza forest alongside a new protagonist, characters, and landmarks of Poland. Players can once again be transported to the rich and immersive universe of Werewolf: The Apocalypse, where the line between humanity and monstrosity blurs. Through a blend of RPG mechanics and a visual novel foundation, they will navigate Samira's journey of self-discovery – confronting inner demons and real-life monsters that loom large.</p>
<p>Announcement trailer below:</p>

<li>Thrilling conspiracies – uncover the sinister secrets of the werewolves’ world through two distinct story paths, each offering different challenges and consequences.</li>

      <title>Action-adventure game &#39;Inside The Crystal Mountain&#39; looks wild and has been overlooked</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inside The Crystal Mountain from Intrugli Games released back in March, and it seems nearly everyone missed it and it looks pretty crazy. It has a demo available and Native Linux support, with a style that reminds me of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/05/resolutiion-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Resolutiion</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/04/the-gorgeous-looking-lilas-sky-ark-is-out-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lila’s Sky Ark</a>.</p>
<p>Inside The Crystal Mountain is an action adventure game with fast-paced combat and soulslike elements where you explore a mysterious world filled with ambiguous characters and challenging enemies.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aveF3WMAF4Y"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2376c6b3dbd5a2e6f04dab6cb852a275.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aveF3WMAF4Y" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "Explore a small, but dense, world filled with objects to find, characters to talk to, and new abilities to unlock. Featuring fast-paced and precise combat, every movement is critical, demanding skill and strategy to navigate through intense battles. You will progress through the experience gained, incremental upgrades, shortcuts, and secrets. As if that wasn't enough, you will be involved in a science fiction story that slowly reveals its secrets, challenging you to piece together its hidden narrative."</p>
<p>The developer told me it was developed on Linux too!</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2713740/Inside_The_Crystal_Mountain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out with a demo on Steam</a>. The full game is £6.69.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Gladius free to keep, plus new announcements from Skulls Showcase</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Warhammer Skulls Showcase has come along again, and we've got multiple new announcements plus you can grab a free game! <em>Here's just some of the announcements that were made.</em></p>
<p>Firstly, you want the freebie right? Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Relics of War from Proxy Studios is 100% free for keeps on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The first turn-based 4X strategy game set in the Warhammer universe and a lot of fun, it has Native Linux support too. Plus there's a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932380/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Demolition_Pack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius - Demolition Pack DLC</a> adding in 11 new units.</p>
<p>We have a fresh game announcement too with Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II now on the way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After millennia of slumber, Vargard Nefershah mobilises her dynasty’s legions to annihilate the Adeptus Mechanicus interlopers who unknowingly settled upon her world. Across the galaxy, Magos Dominus Faustinius is summoned to bring his hard-won expertise to bear and ensure the Necrons do not succeed. The conflict soon becomes a crucible of unanticipated significance, drawing to it external actors stranger and more deadly still. </p>
<p>In an exciting addition for the sequel, players will not just be battling as the Adeptus Mechanicus against the awakening of a Necron tomb world, but will also be able to fight as the Necrons for the resurgence of their dynasty , with both sides now fully playable over multiple campaigns.</p>

      <title>Atari acquires Intellivision brand and over 200 games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Since you all love reading about games industry consolidation, here's more for you! Atari have acquired a whole lot from Intellivision.</p>
<p>Atari have been making quite a few moves lately. They revived the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/atari-revives-infogrames-and-acquires-totally-reliable-delivery-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Infogrames brand and acquired Totally Reliable Delivery Service</a>, they also bought up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/atari-acquires-awesomenauts-swords-soldiers-and-digital-eclipse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Awesomenauts, Swords &amp; Soldiers and Digital Eclipse</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/atari-are-acquiring-night-dive-studios/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nightdive Studios are now owned by Atari</a>.</p>
<p>Clearly they're trying to make one heck of a comeback.</p>
<p>Now they also own the Intellivision brand, so Intellivision Entertainment LLC will now be rebranding to continue on with their AMICO console. The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/23/2887219/0/en/Atari-Acquires-Intellivision-Brand.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a> noted this deal includes giving Atari "the rights to more than 200 titles from the Intellivision portfolio and the Intellivision trademarks".</p>
<p>So now with that Atari plan to expand both digital and physical distribution of classic Intellivision games, and of course look to use their newly acquired IP for potential future games and licensing.</p>
<p>“This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision and the golden age of gaming,” said Wade Rosen, Chairman and CEO of Atari.</p>
<p>“Uniting Atari and Intellivision after 45 years ends the longest-running console war in history,” said Mike Mika, Studio Head at Digital Eclipse, an Atari-owned game studio.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental adds D3D12 support in OpenXR, Fixes for Foundry and Ubisoft Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Steam Deck and desktop Linux fans have more testing to do, with Valve releasing a new Proton Experimental update today fixing games, launchers and more.</p>
<p>Firstly, Valve noted <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2075070/KinitoPET/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KinitoPET</a> as now playable as of this release. Sounds weird: "A psychological horror experience that takes place through Kinito, an early 2000s virtual assistant.".</p>
<p>On top of that Valve added support for D3D12 in OpenXR. Which is great to see for VR, after bumping up OpenXR support to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/proton-experimental-openxr-command-conquer-the-desolate-hope/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version 1.1.36 in a previous update</a>.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title">The other fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously in Proton Hotfix: Fixed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2073850/THE_FINALS/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Finals</a> crashing on launch after a recent game update.</li>
<li>Fixed hosting multiplayer games in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/983870/FOUNDRY/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Foundry</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed Ubisoft Launcher not starting games with a fresh Proton prefix.</li>
<li>Fixed outdated Nvidia driver warning in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed issue causing no audio being played while <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250410/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_40th_Anniversary_Edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> displays developers logos.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4382395031716477545gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4382395031716477545gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Foundry</em></p>
<p>See the full Proton changelog on <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It's interesting to see more VR improvements like this. Not only are we seeing OpenXR get improved in Proton, but we've also seen <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steamvr-25-released-with-multiple-linux-fixes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multiple SteamVR fixes lately for Linux too</a>. Hopefully this is the start of more VR work for Linux and dare I say it, the long-rumoured Deckard VR kit from Valve eventually? One can dream.</p>

      <title>Mighty Marbles is an upcoming physics game that looks like a fusion of kids toys</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I remember playing with various crazy Marbles games when younger, and again with my own small person and now one developer is making a whole game about messing with them in Mighty Marbles. The plan is to release it into Early Access sometime this year. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Mighty Marbles, a cute physics based game where you control the level to guide the marble to victory. Inspired by the desire to see real life physics toys as a video game! Each level is a playground of diverse puzzles, each with its own unique set of controls. Fear not; an intuitive on-screen controller showcases how to navigate each puzzle, granting you the freedom to switch between challenges at your whim!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the trailer: </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PVstJrsnIBw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c678fdfb9a4c37eb5f8896f26a3b556a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PVstJrsnIBw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>PUZZLES - Prepare for a series of interconnected puzzles in every level, each presenting distinct challenges that put your mastery of physics to the test. Losing your marble leads to a swift rescue thanks to the adorable Bobby Copters, getting you back in the action quickly.</li>
<li>CAMERA - Tailor your gaming experience to your liking: opt for the close-up camera, immersing yourself in a detailed view of the puzzle, or switch to the bird's eye perspective for a comprehensive overview of the entire level. Can't settle on one? No problem! Switch effortlessly between the two views with a simple button press, ensuring you have the perfect perspective for every moment.</li>
<li>COURSES - The levels are organized into courses. Each course has 9 levels sharing the same theme with new puzzles introduced each level. Initially for early access there are 3 courses, toybox, machines and mini golf. Additionally each course can be played with different game modes to explore new and challenging ways to play.</li>
<li>COLLECT - No marble game is complete without the joy of collecting marbles! Completing fast times on each course and each mode will unlock new and exciting marbles. Once collected, these marbles become yours to choose from, allowing you to personalize your experience by selecting any of your acquired marbles before embarking on a course.</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer has been testing it working well on Steam Deck too:</p>

<p>Looks like good fun, could be a great one for kids too. A nice family-friendly playground.</p>

      <title>Check out the demo for Oblin Party, a wacky physics-based couch/online party brawler </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love a good bit of total chaos then check out Oblin Party, an upcoming wacky physics-based, couch/online party brawler where the hands do the talking. Built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and it has Native Linux support, there's a demo now available on Steam.</p>
<p>Utilize your elastic arms to wield powerful items, or swing, slingshot, grab, and punch to catapult your opponents off the map. It looks ridiculous - in a good way. Could be a great one for when you have a few friends over, and thanks to the online support you'll be able to play with anyone. Check out some of their demo gameplay:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hQoqUvloilg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a90fbe03873461d589c68070894a4367.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hQoqUvloilg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 to 4 players local or online multiplayer.</li>
<li>Last Oblin standing wins the round.</li>
<li>Limited Single Player mode (time trials).</li>
<li>Physics based movement and combat.</li>
<li>Lots of items and weapons.</li>
<li>Highly interactive maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The demo has local multiplayer and online support, but no public lobbies in the demo. It's only a small slice of what to expect but seems pretty funny and worth a look.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643290/Oblin_Party/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>DAVE THE DIVER gets a free to keep (but time-limited) Godzilla DLC</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is a bit unusual. DAVE THE DIVER from developer MINTROCKET has a new Godzilla DLC out now, which is entirely free to claim but it's not sticking around forever. DAVE THE DIVER is rated Steam Deck Verified and Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1868140" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>The DLC will only be available to claim until November 23, 2024. After that, no one else will be able to claim it. If you do claim it though, it's yours to <em>keep</em>. The gaming industry does some weird stuff at times. Why put all the effort into a collab to pull it away so quickly? Anyway, since it's free to keep you got nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="494_fDRoTHo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/28f9f6a7f57d2bd427beb01b49ea5bf1.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/494_fDRoTHo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>A truly wonderful game, and now with some extra free content too. Nice. There was also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1868140/view/4145079037715714518" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch</a> to fix some issues.</p>
<p>DAVE THE DIVER is currently 25% off on:</p>

      <title>Wraithbinder is a new metroidvania-inspired action RPG from the dev of Songbringer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Wraithbinder is an action roguelike RPG with metroidvania-inspired ability progression. It's just about to enter Early Access with Native Linux support from Wizard Fu (Songbringer) and Double Eleven. <u>Note</u>: developer sent a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>The Early Access release is scheduled for May 27th.</p>
<p>Each run you build a different sequence of weapons, abilities and relics. Abilities unlock new areas by allowing you to progress beyond where you could before. You get to keep your armour, status and gold across runs to keep pushing further. Right now it has solo play but the developer is also working to add in online co-op as well. Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fjKYZGE9rcA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5d4e1d0f530adafd24a92d11bf3fbb5a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fjKYZGE9rcA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Seems like a lot of fun if you love action-RPGs like this. Each run through gives you a randomly-generated dungeon to crawl through while building a new sequence of weapons and abilities. When you discover a new ability you get to choose between multiple, allowing you to craft your experience. New abilities will unlock previously inaccessible areas in a Metroidvania-like fashion.</p>
<p>There's some interesting character customisation on offer too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12811614141716463596gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12811614141716463596gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In my own early testing the game runs <em>great</em> on Linux with the Native build, tested on Kubuntu 24.04. So far, I'm really liking what I'm seeing here with the theme and the combat, worth a look. It's going to be in Early Access for about a year, as the developer plans to add in all sorts like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Online co-op multiplayer.</li>
<li>Cutscenes and other story elements.</li>
<li>New biomes, enemies, minibosses and bosses.</li>
<li>Many more relics, scrolls, armor and weapons to find.</li>
<li>New abilities, gameplay mechanics and objects.</li>
<li>A reliquary and bestiary.</li>
<li>Additional language support.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With Linux support and full controller support it should also run great on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Crownfall Act II and Update 7.36 are a big change for Dota 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The way you play Dota 2 is about to change in multiple ways, with Crownfall Act II and Update 7.36 out now and it sounds pretty exciting actually.</p>
<p>Crownfall Act II is an expansion to the new overworld map you can explore to do little quests, which was a fun addition in the last major update. This second part adds in a new overworld map taking place in the unforgiving deserts of Druud, along with a new story, new characters, new cosmetics, new mini-games and some "surprises". You'll be able to play all acts up until it's eventually removed when Crownfall is finished.</p>
<p>The biggest change is to the gameplay though with Update 7.36 adding in Innates Abilities, giving each hero a new ability for the entire game from beginning to end and every hero ability is unique. Some Innates grant a hero a unique effect. For example, Dawnbreaker reveals the whole map to allies when the sun rises.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10206956271716460074gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10206956271716460074gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Another big addition are Hero Facets. These are hero customizations to change the playstyle of any hero to better match up to player preference. Each hero has at least two possible Facets, and you can pick the one you want during strategy time or at the start of a match. For example: Viper can choose between adding an AoE damage burst to Poison Attack, or increasing defensive buffs while Viper remains in Nethertoxin.</p>
<p>Main gameplay changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Innate Abilities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Innates are abilities that are present on the hero for the entire game, from the very beginning of every match. Every hero has a unique Innate</li>
<li>The Innate for each hero can be viewed on the Hero page, or in-game by hovering a new icon between the hero talents and abilities</li>
<li>There are two types of Innates:
<ul>
<li>Some Innates grant a hero a unique effect. For example, Faceless Void slows enemy attack projectiles within range, and Dawnbreaker reveals the whole map to allies when the sun rises</li>
<li>Some Innates change a hero ability to have five levels and get a free ability point at level 1. For example, Kunkka's Tidebringer and Legion Commander's Moment of Courage now start at level 1, and can still be upgraded four more times like normal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Facets</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Facets are a hero customization choice that provide the ability to better align the playstyle of a hero with a specific match or player preference. Facets are specific to heroes: Each hero has at least two Facets, and every player can choose the Facet they prefer during strategy time at the beginning of each match</li>
<li>Hero Facets can be viewed on their hero page, below the hero name and tags. They can also be viewed in-game by hovering a new icon between the hero talent and abilities, on the scoreboard, or on the top bar when holding Alt</li>
<li>Facets are set for all players after the strategy time, and cannot be changed during a match. Facet choices aren't revealed to the enemy team until after the game begins</li>
<li>Facets can have a variety of effects, for example:
<ul>
<li>Viper can choose between adding an AoE damage burst to Poison Attack, or increasing defensive buffs while Viper remains in Nethertoxin</li>
<li>Wraith King can choose between summoning skeletons, or dealing additional curse damage when attacking</li>
<li>Leshrac can choose between his attacks restoring mana, or changing Diabolic Edict to explode faster but deal no damage to buildings</li>
<li>Lone Druid can choose between an improved Spirit Link, granting lifesteal in both directions, or allowing True Form to be cast on the Spirit Bear</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategy time is extended by 15/10/5 seconds for the 1/2/3 weeks immediately after a numbered patch</li>
<li>Glyph of Fortification no longer refreshes when the first Tier 3 tower is destroyed</li>
<li>Glyph of Fortification now refreshes when the first Melee Barracks is destroyed</li>
<li>AoE Bonuses now affect all auras and Cleave sources</li>
<li>Dominated Creeps no longer allow players to bypass Backdoor Protection</li>
<li>Hero Denies now grant experience to the hero who created the deniable debuff.</li>
<li>Mana Bars are always visible for enemies</li>
<li>Fountain Buff grants Couriers haste movement</li>
<li>If Courier has no items, pressing the Deliver Courier button sends the Courier back home</li>
<li>Mana Cost Reduction effects no longer work on abilities that drain mana over time</li>
<li>Attack Speed Display is no longer normalized to 1.7 BAT. This means heroes’ max attack speed is always 700, and a buff that grants 20 Attack Speed will display as +20 always instead of a different number based on the hero’s BAT (No actual gameplay change, just a display change)</li>
<li>Spell's Cast Range is now always listed with the new icon, which is located near Mana Costs and Cooldown</li>
<li>Holding Alt displays the vision range of all Watchers in the map</li>
<li>Experience gain from Abilities and Wisdom Rune will now show up separately in the post-game XP Breakdown for Dota Plus users</li>
<li>Added a "LEVELS WITH:" parameter for ability descriptions to show which ability needs to be upgraded to level this one</li>
<li>Ability tooltips now show icons next to ability values, indicating that those are upgraded by Aghanim's Shard/Scepter, Talents, or Facets</li>
<li>Updated spectator view controls for live and replays to match vision unlinking</li>
<li>Using Radiant/Dire Fog will now correctly hide members of Radiant/Dire that have had their vision unlinked and are not visible</li>
<li>Using the player perspective on a player whose vision is unlinked will correctly hide units they can no longer see</li>
<li>Pinging items of enemies that can't be seen currently no longer reveals information on whether those items were consumed or not</li>
<li>In demo mode -createhero command supports facets by adding facet name or its number at the end of the command</li>
<li>New Dota Labs Feature: "Persistent Range Indicators" -- If you hold Alt while right-clicking on either your experience indicator, attack range indicator (the stats part of portrait), or an ability/item, the game will draw a persistent range indicator in the world for it. You can only have at most one active at any given time, but it updates automatically when your attack/cast/AoE range changes</li>
<li>New Dota Labs Feature: "Dynamic Health Bar Focus" -- The health bar of any hovered unit will always draw on top of other health bars</li>
<li>Added the ability to type in a hero name to jump to that hero when viewing patch notes in the client</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ability Draft</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Innates have the following rules for Ability Draft</li>
<li>Innate abilities that do not appear on a hero's ability bar will be automatically assigned to the hero when spawning in, but cannot be drafted</li>
<li>Innate abilities that can be leveled with skill points are draftable, but will not be automatically assigned when spawning in</li>
<li>All other innate abilities are disabled for Ability Draft</li>
<li>Facets have the following rules for Ability Draft:</li>
<li>You can choose any hero facet belonging to your assigned hero during strategy time</li>
<li>Facets that grant new abilities are disabled</li>
<li>Facets that replace abilities will work if you draft the ability that is being replaced</li>
<li>If a facet has no effect on your hero you can still select it. In game, the facet will notate it has no effect</li>
</ul>

      <title>Microsoft&#39;s new Recall AI will take screenshots of everything you do - freaky</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This will be preaching to the choir for some readers, as you didn't exactly need another reason not to use Windows right? Microsoft's new Recall AI will take screenshots of everything you do and that sounds truly terrible. <em>Spyware as a service, courtesy of Microsoft's push to stick AI into everything.</em></p>
<p>You might think I'm being perhaps a bit sensational here or even clickbaity, but no, this is actually genuinely what Recall does. As Microsoft said: "Recall uses Copilot+ PC advanced processing capabilities to take images of your active screen every few seconds", and not only just on their new ARM PCs, they said it will roll out to x86 platforms too via a Windows update.</p>
<p>What's the point? It's to give you a special timeline of your day (it stores up to 3 months worth of what you do), allowing you to go back through it and find things, highlight things, open the original application shown in pictures and <em>eventually</em> open up whatever you were working on in the right application with the right content at the time. Basically, some fancy-pants AI search going over everything you've done.</p>
<p>Microsoft do say the storage is local to your device, and is "protected using data encryption on your device" and even using BitLocker if you're on Windows 11 Pro or an enterprise Windows 11 SKU. Microsoft also claim it doesn't share it anywhere else, at all, no advertisers or Microsoft themselves. But, how far do we trust data being fed into a black-box AI that no one can really see what it's doing huh?</p>
<p>Here's the thing: straight from their own <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/copilot-plus-pcs#faq2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ</a> (scroll down) it notes how "Recall does not perform content moderation" and it will "not hide information such as passwords or financial account numbers". Oh wow, that sure sounds good for your privacy doesn't it. But don't worry it "does not take snapshots of certain kinds of content, including InPrivate web browsing sessions in Microsoft Edge" and "material protected with digital rights management (DRM)" is also protected. We can't have Netflix or Disney getting annoyed with it taking a shot of that movie you watched, nope.</p>
<p>I'm not even what you may call a "privacy nut". I use big-name stuff all the time, my main browser is plain ol' Google Chrome and you get the idea. But still, this is super weird.</p>
<p>What happens if someone else gets access to your device? Lost, stolen, sold (and you forgot to wipe) and so on. If you get hacked, they'll end up seeing everything, it's another major attack point. Yeah great it's stored on your device, but people and companies get broken open all the time, malicious orgs will have a real party with your data. There's plenty of other times people may end up with access to your device to think about, I'm not going to list them all of course.</p>
<p>You can hear Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speak about it to The Wall Street Journal, skip to 3:23:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uHEPBzYick0?rel=0&amp;start=203"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a8affdd649ddde347c3fb6cb90475bed.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uHEPBzYick0?rel=0&amp;start=203" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No thanks. I'll pass, forever. I never want this. It feels creepy and gross.</p>
<p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) is already <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2024/05/statement-in-response-to-microsoft-recall-feature/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking into it</a>. No doubt others will be too. A privacy nightmare for everyone.</p>
<p>If you wish to try Linux, I can recommend <a href="https://kubuntu.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kubuntu</a> which is my daily-driver.</p>

      <title>Mesa 24.1.0 released with big improvements for NVK, Zink, Explicit Sync</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for the next upgrade to open source graphics drivers? Mesa 24.1.0 has now <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/mesa-dev/2024-May/226222.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released</a> bringing some big enhancements to many different drivers across AMD, NVIDIA, Intel and others.</p>
<p>With this release NVK (open source NVIDIA Vulkan driver) is now in a much better state, and is no longer considered experimental.

      <title>Racing game BlazeRush ending support for Linux, macOS and SteamVR</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Targem Games just announced their racing game BlazeRush is getting a big upgrade for the tenth anniversary but they're going to sunset their Linux, macOS and SteamVR support.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/302710/view/4190115033974331871" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> on Steam they didn't go into detail on the exact reasons other than some vague note about issues. Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello, intergalactic racers!</p>
<p>Due to technical difficulties, support for the game on Linux and Mac systems will be discontinued and the SteamVR version will also become unavailable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, downloading and running BlazeRush on Linux, Mac and SteamVR will soon be impossible.</p>
<p>This will not affect players who use Windows systems. In addition, we are happy to announce that a major update for the Windows version will soon be released to celebrate the tenth anniversary of BlazeRush! Stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the game has a Native Linux version and it is Steam Deck Verified. Valve's verification for Steam Deck was done on the Native Linux version too, so Valve will end up being <em>forced</em> to re-test this one on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> if it's to keep the Verified sticker.</p>
<p>What the developer said above is <em>technically</em> incorrect though. Even if they entirely removed the Linux version, all you'll need to do is use Proton, so it won't be as "impossible" as they say. If they do plan to just entirely remove them, that's a whole 'nother problem though which just <em>shouldn't</em> be a thing. Delisting so they're not advertised and updated? Fine, but completely removing is <em>incredibly</em> anti-consumer.</p>
<p>Still a shame to see this happen at all though, as I've played it a good few times over the years in local multiplayer and it's an absolute riot. It's a <strong>really</strong> fun game. So I'm thankful Proton from Valve exists yet again.</p>
<p>The game is available to buy from: <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/blazerush?ref=gol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fanatical</a> | <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/blazerush?partner=gamingonlinux" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> | <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/302710/BlazeRush/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>I did a video of this one a whole 5 years ago:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="RJ6uynCjVIs"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8731201266cfc2a0d5c3728d29a8529d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/RJ6uynCjVIs" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 24/05/24</strong> - The developer has released another Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/302710/view/4190115033981265543" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post</a> to clarify the situation a little. Here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last news we indicated that the version for Mac and Linux systems will become completely unavailable. This message was incomplete and contained an error!</p>
<p>We would like to correct ourselves and make things clear: the version for Linux and Mac OS will not receive the upcoming update. However, users of these operating systems will be able to continue to download and play the current version of BlazeRush.</p>
<p>We apologize for our mistake and wish you the wildest interplanetary races!  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least on Linux / Steam Deck, you will be able to just run the updated Windows version with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. But still, Valve will need to re-verify it for Steam Deck now too, which the developer did not mention.</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader updated for Steam Deck UI and Font improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader from Owlcat Games got updated this week to improve the experience of playing it on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Currently, it's rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve and Platinum on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/2186680" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> from users. For Steam Deck, Valve noted it had issues with small text, manual graphics tweaks being needed and you need to manually bring up the on-screen keyboard (STEAM + X).</p>
<p>At least some of those issues have been worked on now with the May 20th patch <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2186680/announcements/detail/6488076199785150488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a number of improvements and optimizations to UI and fonts for Steam Deck and controller interface;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That was amongst a whole bunch of bug fixes and improvements across the whole game. Nice to see, hopefully they will have a few more improvements coming there. It really doesn't take all that much to properly support the Steam Deck, as long as it performs well enough.</p>

      <title>Tchia updated to improve text on Steam Deck plus performance improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Tchia is a cute looking tropical open-world adventure from Awaceb and Kepler Interactive that released in March and now it should look better on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Join Tchia on her tropical open-world adventure as she sets off to rescue her father from the cruel tyrant, Meavora, ruler of the archipelago. Climb, glide, swim, and sail your boat around beautiful islands as you explore a physics-driven sandbox. Face the fabric soldiers created by Meavora in open encounters where your creativity gives you the edge. Take control of any animal or object you can find, make new friends and jam on your fully playable Ukulele. A poetic coming-of-age story inspired by New Caledonia."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="7Fh3uIAfEFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/48c52fd541b855043a32d0c35cd25cc9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/7Fh3uIAfEFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In an update released yesterday, May 21st, the developer <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1496590/announcements/detail/6010694637981385481" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some performance issues, especially one occurring during the rain.</li>
<li>Made some texts more readable, especially on SteamDeck.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently Valve has rated it only as Steam Deck Playable, due to those two issues above. So perhaps it might now be able to get Steam Deck Verified once it gets a re-test. For desktop Linux players, it has a Platinum rating on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1496590" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a> from crowd-sourced user reports.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>Cyberpulse is an arcade twin-stick thrower where you smash everything into the wall</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Blending together the visual style from the likes of Geometry Wars and other similar retro arcade experiences, Cyberpulse gets you to throw enemies around and smash them into the wall. <u>Note</u>: key provided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</p>
<p>So it's not a twin-stick shooter, but a twin-stick thrower with you using the power of cyberkinetic forces. Quite a fun and different spin on the bright pulsing neon arcade game, and one you can bring a friend a lot with too. There's a full campaign mode to smash through, where you can bring a friend. And on top of that there's a multiplayer mode where four players can dash around various arenas to try and destroy each other.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="SGLn-XL-Ft8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/73fa060d611218e95960498ffcb06256.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/SGLn-XL-Ft8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>I've tested a fair bit thanks to the developer sending a key, and it's actually great fun. Perhaps just a tad too fast for my tastes that really took some getting used to on some levels, but the idea is really entertaining and unusual in how you combat swarms of enemies. Across 50 levels in the non-linear campaign, there's a lot of different types of standard enemies, bosses and various secrets to collect as well. The developer said the levels are hand-crafted too, but with just a little randomness to keep it all fresh to chase high scores.</p>
<p>Nice to see more games like this appear that are trying to do something just a little different, it reminds me a bit of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/breakpoint-is-an-arcade-high-score-seekers-dream-and-its-ridiculously-fun/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breakpoint</a> which had a similar style and overall theme but you used melee weapons and now here we're using kinetic forces to throw things around. Pure joy.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A blend of genres: twin-stick shooters, shmups, arena battlers, and even metroidvanias contribute their mechanics creating a unique gameplay experience.</li>
<li>Innovative game physics: rather than shooting bullets, you control cyberkinetic forces to hurl your enemies into molten firewalls.</li>
<li>50+ hand-crafted levels in a non-linear campaign full of collective secrets to reward exploration.</li>
<li>Local two player co-op: coordinate your movements and try not to toss your teammate into a firewall (or throw them around just for the laughs).</li>
<li>Four player versus: dunk your friends in 100+ exhilarating versus arenas.</li>
<li>Customizable multiplayer experience: tweak dozens of settings to create exactly the kind of gameplay experience you want, from a crazy party game to a competitive arena brawler.</li>
<li>A modern take on retro classics with amazing vector-like graphics and an original synthwave soundtrack.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1318820/Cyberpulse/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now on Steam</a> with Native Linux support. Another easy recommendation for arcade smashing fun.</p>

      <title>Braid, Anniversary Edition updated to improve Steam Deck OLED support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Braid, Anniversary Edition (which released recently) got updated that should make it feel better specifically on the Steam Deck OLED model, and the frame limiter. </p>
<p>I missed the release on this one, as Thekla, Inc. (Jonathan Blow) were originally going to support Linux and macOS with it as I covered in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/08/braid-is-getting-a-much-upgraded-anniversary-edition-releasing-in-2021/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the original announcement</a> article. However, on November 8th, 2023 the website was updated to remove mentions of Linux and macOS (see the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20231105024859/http://braid-game.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Archive</a>). So now for Linux / Steam Deck you'll need to use Proton, as the original Braid on Steam has been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">delisted</a> (although it's still on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/braid" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> - for now).</p>
<p>Anyway: there's been multiple updates since the May 14th launch, but for the Steam Deck OLED update on May 16th it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/499180/view/6215608421519021097" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Restored World 4 audio timings to their OG speeds.</li>
<li>Restored the OG Chinese translations for the story text.</li>
<li>Fixed flickering ladders in World 1-1 at some frame rates.</li>
<li>Fixed confusing World 8 commentary door order.</li>
<li>Fixed falling through the floor after completing the game and playing a commentary in World 0-0.</li>
<li><strong>Improved support for OLED Steam Deck and for Steam Deck frame rate limiter.</strong></li>
<li>Enabled variable frame rate when vsync is explicitly disabled.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Control the flow of time to solve subtle platform puzzles in this update of the indie classic "Braid," featuring refreshed artwork and seriously in-depth creator commentary. Travel from a city house through a series of interconnected worlds where time behaves strangely, searching for an elusive Princess. Along the way you'll explore memories and regrets that still haunt you. This Anniversary Edition remaster of the award-winning platformer contains fully repainted high-resolution graphics, new sound effects and extensive audio commentary.</p>

<p>Braid, Anniversary Edition is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/499180/Braid_Anniversary_Edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: On May 3rd, Jonathan Blow <a href="https://x.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1786169573152117044" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter) "Proton. We will do Linux port later." in reply to a user question about it. So perhaps we may still see an official Linux version. Blow has GamingOnLinux blocked on X, so I missed it until it was <a href="https://x.com/jajdorkster/status/1793246624367419541" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed out</a>.</p>

      <title>Little-Known Galaxy is Stardew Valley blended with Star Trek</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you enjoy a space sci-fi theme and like your chilled games, you may want to take a look at the new release of Little-Known Galaxy. It's a cozy single-player RPG space adventure where you'll meet various friendly characters, go exploring, do a little crafting and of course farming too.</p>
<p>"Join Space Alliance as a new captain-in-training and work with your quirky crew to solve the mysteries of an ancient relic found on the Grey Planet. What mysteries will it uncover? What kind of adventure lies ahead? And who will you meet along the way? It’s up to you now Captain. Remember to support your crew, follow your heart, and always take care of each other."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="MWE6eBt9Qyc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/629dbfc201fd0bb15eb42999293397bc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/MWE6eBt9Qyc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The game released on May 20th and the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2521600/view/5991554339551136776" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted</a> they're waiting for verification from Valve on Steam Deck support but they mentioned how it's "100% Steam Deck compatible" including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Runs smooth.</li>
<li>Easy to use controls.</li>
<li>Steam Deck control button prompts.</li>
<li>Adjustable user-interface scaling. (if needed)</li>
<li>Text legibility.</li>
<li>Native resolution support with additional zoom options.</li>
<li>Re-bindable controls for your convenience.</li>
<li>Virtual keyboards for text input.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that it works well on Steam Deck, it will also work great on desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a>. Nice to see more developers hooking up good support!</p>
<p>Features include plenty of space customization, crafting / farming / cooking, story cinematics, various objectives to go through, the ability to befriend and romance, you can hatch and raise various little alien creatures, space exploration and much more. Sounds real sweet.</p>

      <title>ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree gets a new trailer ahead of June release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I know a great many of you are impatiently waiting for ELDEN RING Shadow of the Erdtree, so maybe this new story trailer will keep you going just that bit longer.</p>
<p>ELDEN RING is Steam Deck Verified and runs great on desktop Linux with Proton. It is also repeatedly one of the most-played (by hours) games on Steam Deck as it was <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/05/steam-deck-most-played-for-april-2024-has-plenty-of-fallout/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">6th in April</a>, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/04/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-from-march-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">5th in March</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-february-2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">4th in February</a> and I fully expect the expansion release on June 21st will bump it back up again. It's also just one of the best reviewed games on Steam overall.</p>
<p>FromSoftware didn't say much about the new trailer only: "The shadow of the story can now be told. Learn the history of the Realm of Shadow." so have a look below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6uT8wGtB3yQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b8c8a3a0ea7103c2a95888eed997860.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6uT8wGtB3yQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The Shadow of the Erdtree expansion features an all-new story set in the Land of Shadow imbued with mystery, perilous dungeons, and new enemies, weapons and equipment.</p>
<p>Discover uncharted territories, face formidable adversaries, and revel in the satisfying triumph of victory. Dive into the riveting interplay of characters, where drama and intrigue intertwine, that create an immersive experience to savor and enjoy.</p>

      <title>Nightdive Studios confirm Linux and macOS ports of System Shock are cancelled</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The System Shock remake from Nightdive Studios was originally funded on Kickstarter, and after delays it was eventually released on May 30th, 2023 but two platforms have been missing - Linux and macOS.</p>
<p>For their crowdfunding campaign, the Linux and macOS versions were a stretch-goal. The base goal for the campaign was $900,000, but they put both Linux and macOS together on a $1.1 million additional goal which was hit, as the campaign finished on around $1,350,700.</p>
<p>Nightdive were pretty silent on both platforms for a long time, especially after they ended up having a lot of issues actually making the game, at one point they entirely <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2018/02/development-on-the-new-system-shock-has-been-paused/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paused development</a> on it.</p>
<p>In a new Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/4106201" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update</a> posted May 21st, 2024 they confirmed neither versions will happen now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is System Shock still coming to MacOS and Linux?</p>
<p>Unfortunately no, plans for MacOS and Linux releases of System Shock have been shelved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>macOS is not exactly surprising, Apple are notorious for making things more and more difficult for developers. On the Linux side, it's also not overly surprising given that we have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/steam-play-proton-guide-valves-tech-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Proton</a> now which enables the game to run with a tick of box on Steam. I even <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/new-system-shock-remake-demo-on-steam-deck/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">showed it previously</a> running really nicely on Steam Deck with Proton using the demo.</p>

      <title>Kickstarter will now allow late-pledges for finished campaigns</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kickstarter, the popular platform for crowdfunding all sorts of things including video games and board games, is expanding with some new tools.</p>
<p>Announced May 21st in an official <a href="https://updates.kickstarter.com/a-new-vision-for-kickstarter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, one major addition that many have been asking for is a direct way to support a Kickstarter campaign after it has already finished. Creators have already been doing this via external means like the popular <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BackerKit</a> for quite a long time now.</p>
<p>Kickstarter have been testing this Late Pledge system with a select few since April, noting how creators have used these third-party services to collect more funding. Clearly, Kickstarter want more people to stay within their own system, and this feature just makes sense for them to add and so now it's available to all creators globally.</p>
<p>They've also formed a "Kickstarter Performance team", dedicated to help with marketing to promote campaigns. Kickstarter say this team "provides support every step of the way, from creative services and pre-launch marketing support to ad measurement and execution" and a select group have already been using it which they say has helped creators "raise nearly $1 million in pledges".</p>
<p>On top of that they're improving their survey system, which again creators often ended up doing outside of Kickstarter to collect info for special pledges. Kickstarter say their revamped tool will allow creators to gather your address, item preferences (like size, edition, colour etc), deal with add-ons and so on. Once again, it makes sense for Kickstarter to have all this themselves.</p>

      <title>IGN acquired the Gamer Network including RPS, Eurogamer, VG247 and more</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's not only game publishers that have been consolidating their power buying up lots of developers and other publishers, it's also happening in gaming media with IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buying up</a> the Gamer Network.</p>
<p>This means IGN Entertainment now control GamesIndustry.biz, Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, VG247, and Dicebreaker. They also hold shares in Outside Xbox, Digital Foundry, and Hookshot (which operates Nintendo life, Push Square, Pure Xbox, and Time Extension). They were purchased for an "undisclosed sum".</p>
<p>IGN didn't say in their own news post on it but right away they fired a bunch of people, as confirmed by GamesIndustry.biz in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their article</a> as they noted "As a result of the acquisition, some redundancies have been made across the UK-based organisation.".</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>As for why they are doing this? Well, the internet sucks right now. </em></p>
<p>More websites are employing the use of AI, pushing out actual people. Spamming search engines, which pushes down everyone else and it's only going to get worse as AI is pushed more and more. This feels like IGN ensuring people come to them, as eventually the only sites that may be able to weather the AI storm are those that are just too big to fall.</p>
<p>It's just another reminder to directly support those you find useful and whose content you enjoy.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA 555.42.02 Beta driver out bringing Wayland explicit sync</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The driver release many NVIDIA fans have been waiting on is here today. NVIDIA released the NVIDIA 555.42.02 Beta driver with some necessary upgrades for Wayland support.</p>
<p>Since it's a Beta driver, it should go without saying that there may still be some lingering issues and bugs. This is for testing, but it shouldn't be too long before NVIDIA push out a stable driver with a small version number bump for when it's ready for everyone. Not that this will stop you right? You all want to try it.</p>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>The main changes are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The GSP firmware is now used by default on all GPUs which support it. It can be disabled by setting the kernel module parameter `NVreg_EnableGpuFirmware=0`.</li>
<li>Added support for the linux-drm-syncobj-v1 protocol for Wayland explicit sync in EGL.</li>
<li>Added immediate presentation mode support to Vulkan Wayland WSI. This presentation mode instructs the compositors not to wait for a vertical blanking period to update the application's surface content, which may result in tearing.</li>
<li>Removed support for Base Mosaic on GeForce, which was previously available only on select GPU boards with some motherboards, and limited to five display devices.</li>
<li>Enabled HDMI 10 bits per component support by default; disable by loading nvidia-modeset with `hdmi_deepcolor=0`.</li>
<li>Added an interactive prompt to nvidia-installer to allow selecting between the proprietary and open kernel modules, on systems where both kernel module types are supported.</li>
<li>Added support for using EGL instead of GLX as the OpenGL ICD for NvFBC.</li>
<li>Changed the minimum required Linux kernel version from 3.10 to 4.15.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>The bug fixes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused "Failed to apply atomic modeset" and "Flip event timeout" messages to be printed to the system log when a DRM client such as ddcutil drops "master" permissions while a framebuffer console is being initialized.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug, when nvidia-drm is loaded with the fbdev=1 module parameter on some kernels, that caused incorrect colors to be displayed.</li>
<li>Fixed a regression that led to Xid errors when loading the NVIDIA driver on some notebook systems with RTX 4xxx series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused driver build failure when using separate kernel source and output directories on Linux v6.6 and later.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that incorrectly allowed `nvidia-smi -r` to reset the primary GPU when using the open kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceSupportKHR to incorrectly report support for Wayland surfaces when nvidia-drm is not loaded with modeset=1.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause the display to lock up when suspending on a kernel with CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DEFERRED_TAKEOVER enabled with nvidia-drm loaded with modeset=1 and fbdev=1.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to a system hang and "Idling display engine timed out" messages when VT switching on an HDMI Fixed Rate Link (FRL) display.</li>
</ul>

      <title>King under the Mountain (Mountaincore) went open source as developer shuts down</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em>King under the Mountain</em> from developer Rocket Jump Technology, a simulation-based settlement-building strategy game, that was going through a big upgrade and re-brand with <em>Mountaincore</em> ended up shutting down and being open sourced.</p>
<p>This is actually news from back in <em>January</em> that I missed (thanks for the tip, Sin), because there's just so much news all the time and smaller games end up getting a bit buried. Which, is actually part of the issue here, although only part of the problem though.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4387070301716294327gol1.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4387070301716294327gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - King under the Mountain</em></p>
<p>You see King under the Mountain was picked up by a unnamed publisher, who helped finance a big upgrade to the game. 9 months into expanding the game — the publisher <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/930230/announcements/detail/3684547928703321045?snr=2___" rel="noopener" target="_blank">backed out</a>. Why? As the developer said "They were worried that a number of similar games that have released in the time between would cause it to struggle to stand out.".</p>
<p>The developer mentioned they were able to continue it on, and eventually re-released it as Mountaincore. That didn't go well either, as the developer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2370310/view/7217647935762367813" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> on Steam back in January, with the release being so small they didn't pull in enough revenue to "keep even a single dev employed working on the game".</p>
<p>As a result the developer "had to be declared insolvent", and so they no longer exist to continue developing it in their free-time.</p>
<p>In this case though, it's <em>somewhat</em> a happy ending, and probably one of the best endings you can hope for, as the original game King under the Mountain was made fully <a href="https://github.com/rossturner/king-under-the-mountain" rel="noopener" target="_blank">open source</a> under the MIT license. So anyone who wants to hack away on it, or build something from it, can now do so. The upgraded version with Mountaincore couldn't be released as "the legal ownership of Mountaincore itself is still unclear".</p>
<p>Real shame this, as no one wants to see a developer have to shut due to low sales, but in this case it's also partly because the publisher backed-out after making them go silent on it for so long.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>APICO is a chilled beekeeping sim from TNgineers that just got a little bit more industrious, with the free APICO 4.0 update giving you some fun new tools. Update 4.0: A Hive of Industry, is the final update for the game and they're going out with a bang on this one with an automation system, seasonal events, new crafting materials and even pets.</p>
<p>The developers supports bee, beekeeping, pollinator and conservation-based charities with a portion of proceeds from each sale too. Gotta save the bees right? Where would we bee without them. Anyway, check out the update trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5WysLxj7yQU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/14028ccec353a5b13eed88ce69d47695.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5WysLxj7yQU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<li><strong>New Resource — Honeycore Crystals: </strong>Use the newly-added resonance meter and engage in its new mini-game to seek out different sounds throughout the various environments that will help you locate six different types of crystals. Melt them down in the forge and craft new crystal items, including Crystal chests, the Crystal axe, hammer, shovel, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Pets:</strong> Choose from 16 different adorable little companions to accompany you on your expeditions, including your very own tiny dinosaur!</li>
<li><strong>New Seasonal Events:</strong> Celebrate Hivemas, active during the month of December, and Hallowbeen, active during the month of October, in the world of APICO with the NPCs! Each event brings new decor, new paints, and secret easter egg items for you to enjoy. There’s no need to bee patient waiting for each event, as you’ll be able to toggle each event in the settings menu!</li>
<li><strong>…and so much more:</strong> TNgineers have added ten new quests, new decor, paints, new environmental events, and of course, new bees and pollinators! There’s also a new 100% completion surprise that the most dedicated beekeepers can uncover through the Hive Mother’s door.</li>

      <title>PERIMETER: Legate Edition released on Steam with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>K-D Lab have revived their classic RTS, with PERIMETER: Legate Edition now available on Steam with full Native Linux support and it's even open source. This latest version of the game includes numerous enhancements, along with bundling the Emperor’s Testament expansion.</p>
<p>Nice to see more classic games getting a revival with some extra features!</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-lrTdw7DSKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b7162d84d4a3eb9a3b9b1f9edf41713.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-lrTdw7DSKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features from the newer edition:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Cross-platform compatibility: Windows, Linux.</li>
<li>"Emperor’s Testament" add-on included in the main game.</li>
<li>Support for widescreen monitors with almost any resolution. You can change the resolution without restarting the game, and in windowed mode, changing the window size dynamically adjusts the game resolution.</li>
<li>Full support for online multiplayer gaming.</li>
<li>Capability for multiplayer with more than 4 players (on special maps).</li>
<li>Enhanced textures and models.</li>
<li>Support for custom mods.</li>
<li>Improved game balance.</li>
<li>Availability of all frames from both Geometry of War and Emperor’s Testament, as well as electro-technologies in battles and multiplayer. New player colours added.</li>
<li>Numerous minor improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Picking up a copy for myself, I can confirm it runs out of the box on Kubuntu 24.04 and performance is really good. Currently, there's no Vsync option, so it will run at multiple hundreds of FPS. So on Linux you may want to use <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Gamescope</a> to manually limit it.</p>
