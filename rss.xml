      <title>MangoHud 0.7.2-rc1 adds Wayland keybinds, a time label and bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The next version of the Linux performance overlay MangoHud is close, with a release candidate up now and ready for testing with MangoHud <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/releases/tag/v0.7.2-rc1" target="_blank">version 0.7.2-rc1</a>.</p>
<p>What is it? A Vulkan and OpenGL overlay for monitoring FPS, temperatures, CPU/GPU load and more on top of games and applications. You can use it on Desktop Linux, and it's what forms the Steam Deck's performance HUD too.</p>
<p>Here's all the <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/releases/tag/v0.7.2-rc1" target="_blank">improvements</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">time</code> now has a label (you can remove this label with <code class="inline-code">no_time_label</code>)</li>
<li>Wayland keybinds have been added</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>frametime color wasn't being correctly inherited, the user was not able to change it's color</li>
<li>fixed a crash when pressing Shift_R + F9</li>
<li>config options now correctly override preset options</li>
<li>fixed RPM and % being incorrectly assigned for GPU fan speeds</li>
</ul>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">no_time_label</code> removes the label before <code class="inline-code">time</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">network</code> shows the throughput in kb/s for all interfaces or a specified list of interfaces e.g <code class="inline-code">network=eth0,wlo1</code></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Since it's a pre-release, there's no pre-compiled packages so you'll need to build it from source or wait for the full release after it's had some testing time.</p>
<p>An example of MangoHud with a horizontal style (look at the top):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1061428281712152345gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1061428281712152345gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you like that configuration for it here's my settings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>horizontal<br/>
legacy_layout=0<br/>
hud_no_margin<br/>
font_size=25<br/>
table_columns=25<br/>

      <title>Linux Mint 22 moves to Pipewire, will ship newer kernels after release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some good news coming out of camp Linux Mint, as the upcoming release of Linux Mint 22 is set to be quite a good one for bringing it up to standard like other distributions on newer tech.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Mint's Clement Lefebvre mentioned various improvements coming like better localization support which will also use less disk space. Languages you don't pick will now <em>properly</em> be removed, and the ISO will actually have English, German, Spanish, French, Russian, Portuguese, Dutch and Italian requiring no extra downloads for those.</p>
<p>Something big for audio fans is that Linux Mint 22 will also finally swap over to Pipewire as the default sound server, the Software Sources tool will feature support for the new Deb822 format and the next version of Pix (their image viewer) will support JXL images.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7028874071712148126gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7028874071712148126gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - Linux Mint Cinnamon Desktop</em></p>
<p>Another big change is their kernel versioning. Mint has always been quite reserved on using newer kernels, often sticking with older versions. They have been shipping EDGE ISOs with newer kernels for a while, but now they're going to follow Ubuntu with shipping new kernel series release after Linux Mint 22 is live. As Lefebvre mentioned "we didn’t observe significant differences in terms of stability between LTS and HWE series" and that a "growing number of users with new laptops/chipsets relied on EDGE images" so this move makes sense.</p>
<p>They've also made a new XApp, <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/gnome-online-accounts-gtk" target="_blank">GNOME Online Account GTK</a>, with a goal to work across any desktop environment to connect to online accounts like Google, Microsoft and so on. </p>
<p>Snap is also another issue, as the Mint team continue to not particularly like Canonical's packaging format. With Ubuntu moving Thunderbird into a Snap, the Mint team will now be packaging it themselves as a .deb.</p>
<p>They're also continuing to work on <a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/jargonaut" target="_blank">Jargonaut</a>, a modern chat application that uses IRC under the hood.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6717160861712147954gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6717160861712147954gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>They're also now working with <a href="https://www.fastly.com/" target="_blank">Fastly</a>, to support their packaging repositories which should provide better speeds and overall stability.</p>

      <title>Escape Simulator adds VR support in the latest free update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Escape Simulator from Pine Studio has proven to be popular, so much in fact that they hit <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/escape-simulator-hits-1-million-sales-adds-voice-chat-and-new-map/" target="_blank">1 million sales</a> in less than a year and multiple expansions later there's another big free upgrade.</p>
<p>They've had crossover DLC with Among Us and Portal, which are both free, as well as a few paid extra DLC with more levels and content. Now they're back with a free VR upgrade. As they said in the announcement: "Escape from the base game as well as the additional free rooms in a fully interactive 3D environment, either by yourself or with friends. Throwing items to each other has never felt so real!".</p>
<p>You can even team up with players who don't have VR, which is a nice feature. To make all this work they said they actually "rebuilt the game from scratch for the VR version". However, the price will be increasing after April 14th, so picking it up now will get you it cheaper with all the updates.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="fD5cxMeadws"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/77fea50d22f9a88e4cf5b61c04f6bb85.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/fD5cxMeadws" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What can you actually play in VR? They said all 29 rooms in the base game and all of the DLC, according to their email "most of the 4.000 community-made rooms are now also available to enjoy in VR". This is great, because the level editor is one of the big pulls of the game and what helped make it so popular.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve puzzles. Face a growing collection of interactive escape rooms, spread across a variety of weird and wonderful locations such as the Labyrinth of Egypt, the Steampunk Airship, the Portal Escape Chamber or The Mini Skeld.</li>
<li>Team up with friends. Every Escape Simulator room supports online co-op! Join forces with friends to test your teamwork &amp; tackle puzzles together.</li>
<li>Powered by the community. Use the Room Editor to build your very own *dream* escape room. Or dive into one of the 4000+ custom rooms built by our creative community.</li>
<li>Dress to impress. Wear silly hats, customize your character &amp; wear a series of themed outfits, tailor-made for each puzzle environment.</li>
<li>Cause chaos! Smash vases. Melt locks. Rearrange the furniture. Make a mess! If it's not nailed down, you can pick it up (and inevitably throw it at your friends). Even more enjoyable in VR!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Cozy Space Survivors is a sweet time survival roguelite in space</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cozy Space Survivors is an upcoming simple cozy time survival roguelite in space, a game for people who don't have all that much free time.</p>
<p>The developer said they were inspired by the likes of Vampire Survivors for the general simple gameplay, Binding of Isaac for physicality of bullets, Halls of Torment for adding Quests to a Vampire Survivors-Like, Fallout for the story summary at the end of the game and Into the Breach for the little NPC dialog texts which add so much atmosphere and so they've blended all the basic ideas into a simple but sweet package with Cozy Space Survivors.</p>
<p>About it: "Explore a colorful, tiny universe. Help its cute inhabitants solve their problems. Use satisfying weapons to defend you and your new friends against hordes of quirky enemies. You can focus on controlling your shipy while shooting happens automatically. There are unique landmarks to discover, and enemies leave experience points for level-ups to gain new skills. In addition, you can mine chocolate asteroids to unlock permanent upgrades."</p>
<p>See their WIP trailer below:</p>

<p>The developer, Simon Trümpler, has previously worked on the likes of X:Rebirth, Sacred 2, RIME, The Invisible Hours and more and now they're making their own game.</p>

      <title>Stop Killing Games is a new campaign to stop developers making games unplayable</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've all been there right? You paid for a game, it required an active internet connection and a couple of years later the publisher decided they're done with it and shut it down leaving you with a broken game. Annoying.</p>
<p>Very annoying. It repeatedly happens, mostly AAA publishers that do it and their games are often quite expensive too. One of the most recent is The Crew from Ubisoft, a game that until late December last year cost £25.99. The developers at Ubisoft Ivory Tower <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/the-crew/the-crew/news-updates/mOR3tviszkxfeQCUKxhOV/an-update-on-the-crew" target="_blank">announced</a> on December 14th that as of March 31st, 2024 the servers would be shut down and so it will no longer be playable for anyone. The Crew 2 is still online, and Ubisoft are about to launch The Crew Motorfest on Steam on April 18th.</p>
<p>So now YouTuber Ross Scott of Accursed Farms, has launched the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign to try and better highlight the issue. As noted on the campaign website: "An increasing number of videogames are sold as goods, but designed to be completely unplayable for everyone as soon as support ends. The legality of this practice is untested worldwide, and many governments do not have clear laws regarding these actions. It is our goal to have authorities examine this behavior and hopefully end it, as it is an assault on both consumer rights and preservation of media. We are pursuing this in two ways:"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="w70Xc9CStoE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2b16c9ef99a758e1b97aad8bfe1f3159.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/w70Xc9CStoE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's definitely an interesting and often frustrating issue, especially for games that could seemingly continue to let you play offline without too much trouble. It's a complicated issue though, and the campaign might not end up going anywhere, but it's certainly going to be interesting to watch.</p>
<p>Unquestionably a campaign I can get behind though, because I've said for years it's a really poor situation for consumers to have your purchase suddenly stop working forever that you've not just put money into but often a ton of your time. It's a question of preservation too, the games are just — gone. <em>I miss the days where you could just host your own server.</em></p>
<p><em>What are your thoughts? </em></p>

      <title>Screenbound is a platformer where you play in 2D and 3D together</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>An upcoming game from Crescent Moon Games and Those Dang Games is Screenbound, and it really does look interesting for blending together 2D and 3D gameplay.</p>
<p>They say "Screenbound is a game about being distracted, but totally in control" and are claiming it's a "5D" game, since you have a Quantum boy device that transports you "into a weird dual dimensional space that occupies 5D = 3d + 2d". Now you've heard developers use 2D, 3D, 2.5D, 4D and so on but 5D? Okay then. Well, it does look genuinely interesting at least so I'll let 'em have it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="uR2K8InGAus"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6b0260dc6e8ad9695a96518515ac6889.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/uR2K8InGAus" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it from the devs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Screenbound is a platformer unlike any other. You move in first person view at the same time while playing in 2d on the screen of your Qboy. Mind bending environmental puzzles will force you to test the limits of dimensional space. Your jumping and movements are mirrored - but certain things affect the opposite dimension. Combat is in 2d and you will receive your loot in 3d.</p>
<p>Find and explore many hidden areas and weird ideas will be all around you.</p>
<p>So how the heck did this happen? Your mom invented the device and you found it in the garage. She was keeping it secret all this time, and other dark secrets start to come out as you delve deeper. You'll find other stuff too. But let's not spoil the plot.</p>
<p>Screenbound also has a level editor in a traditional 2d style - but here's another twist. It auto-generates the 3d level for you! Just imagine the possibilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2805070/Screenbound/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. </p>

      <title>Lemonade is an attempt to continue on the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" target="_blank">Nintendo took down</a> the Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu, the collateral damage was the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra which was also taken offline but Lemonade is an attempt to keep it going.</p>
<p>They don't directly mention Citra, probably through fear of it getting nuked from orbit and instead refer to it as the original "base" as mentioned on their website: "Lemonade was started after the base, a previous Nintendo 3ds emulator, was discontinued. The Lemonade Project was created to continue the work of base, fixing its issues and improving its performance and compatibility."</p>
<p>Most recently the Lemonade project put out a <a href="https://github.com/Lemonade-emu/Lemonade/releases/tag/Alpha-2" target="_blank">second</a> initial release which had initial support for Linux, macOS and Windows along with cleaning up a few issues. The Linux version is available as an easy AppImage.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be others that attempt to continue Citra, just like there's multiple that are currently trying to continue yuzu like suyu, although suyu already had an issue where <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/gitlab-takes-down-nintendo-switch-emulator-suyu-due-to-the-dmca/" target="_blank">GitLab took it down</a> so now they self-host their own Git for it.</p>
<p>Perhaps this one will stick around, maybe it won't, but for now it may be worth keeping an eye on it you're an emulation fan wanting to play some classic Nintendo 3DS games.</p>
<p>For those interested you can follow on <a href="https://github.com/Lemonade-emu/Lemonade" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and the <a href="https://lemonade-emu.github.io/" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

      <title>Of Life and Land is a promising settlement-building game with rich simulation out on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released into Early Access today is Of Life and Land (prev called Circle of Kerzoven), a settlement-building game from developer Marco Burri made in Godot. The release comes with Native Linux support. Note: key provided for me.</p>
<p>Having spent a little time with it, I can already see the charm here. It has a wonderful setting and style, and anyone who likes a city building challenge will probably enjoy it. The hook is really the heavy simulation going on, with every creature being independent. Even from the very beginning, you'll have all sorts of animals running around stealing your starting resources which is somewhat amusing.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2246777241712069440gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2246777241712069440gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For the impatient, it can be sped up quite a lot too with a 300x speed, a feature I quite appreciated when waiting for some necessary building resources to be gathered in the blink of an eye — nice. I wouldn't use that speed often though, unless you want your people to die off rapidly. </p>
<p>There's a lot of little individual things you need to learn about and keep an eye on here. Each villager has stats for food, water, rest, heat, overall health points and energy. So you need to ensure all their individual needs are met, while continuing to expand your village and keep everyone alive together. Quite something seeing everyone run around once you've built up a decently sized village to start unlocking more advanced buildings to expand further again.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16968560891712071269gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16968560891712071269gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>An interesting job system too. Each person can work multiple jobs, and they have a workload percentage, so you have to balance how many jobs they have and what jobs people do, to keep up with all your growing needs. Plus, on top of that, various buildings have multiple output types for you to pick your priorities on. There's just so much of <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>You also have events to deal with too with more people joining your village, or not, if you send them packing. Sometimes they have specific building requests too and I've no doubt the developer will expand the quest system through Early Access.</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique deep simulation of the nature in a building strategy game with complex interdependence of humans in nature.</li>
<li>Manage simultaneously the acquisition, refining and distribution of resources on multiple maps in different climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Manage the needs of the citizens. They are “alive” and have a specific home, workplace, and unique needs.</li>
<li>Animals are looking for food, get thirsty, sleepy and form social groups to find their place in nature.</li>
<li>Plants grow and are affected by the actions of the humans, animals, and their environment.</li>
<li>The seasons and climatic conditions affect the gameplay, as certain plants only grow in certain conditions and temperature affects humans, animals, plants, and the environment.</li>
<li>Interact and trade with other factions where all items were crafted with same rules as for the player.</li>
<li>Create own maps and scenarios in the editor and extend through mod support.</li>
<li>Charming and calm low poly art style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A fantastic start and with Early Access expected to last a few years, it has a lot of room left to grow still.</p>

      <title>Linux share on Steam bounces back to nearly 2% for March 2024</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thanks to all of Valve's effort with Proton, Steam Deck and their funding of people working on various other bits of Linux code like GPU drivers - the Linux share on Steam as of March 2024 bounced back to a near multi-year high.</p>
<p>After an odd <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-survey-for-february-2024-shows-a-big-bump-in-simplified-chinese/" target="_blank">dip in February</a>, where we saw a rise in Windows 10 and Simplified Chinese, Linux has jumped up a little again. Although the details are still a bit odd with Windows 10 seeing a bump again, but we saw <em>both</em> Simplified Chinese and English as overall languages each rise for March as well.</p>
<p>Overall the stats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.67% -0.24%</li>
<li>Linux 1.94% +0.18%</li>
<li>macOS 1.38% +0.06%</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly thanks to the Steam Deck, Linux as a whole is now quite a bit more popular on Steam than macOS.</p>
<p>You can see the Linux stats over the past few years on the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">GOL Steam Tracker</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1764339161712055101gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1764339161712055101gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center">The most popular Linux distributions on Steam are:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit (Steam Deck) 44.22% +0.67%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 7.66% -0.49%</li>
<li>Freedesktop SDK 23.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 5.97% +0.45%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS 64 bit 5.54% +5.54%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.3 64 bit 3.77% +0.21%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 3.42% +0.07%<img src="https://store.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/public/images/trans.gif"/></li>
<li>Other 29.41% -1.37%</li>

      <title>Flathub now prominently notes unverified Flatpak apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/oh-snap-canonical-now-doing-manual-reviews-for-new-packages-due-to-scam-apps/" target="_blank">After all the issues</a> with Canonical's Snap package scams lately, it seems the Flathub folks are continuing to ensure their platform is trustworthy.</p>
<p>For a while now developers have been able to get Verified on Flathub, and with it they get a nice blue tick to show off on app pages. This shows that the app is directly from the original developer. Now though, they're going a step further as noted on the official Flathub account on <a href="https://floss.social/@flathub/112175755723668238" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> as they're also now doing Unverified banners on pages that look like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11781715141712054096gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>As they said: "If you see this, it flags that the app has not been verified by its developer—it’s effectively a community-maintained package." and they <a href="https://floss.social/@flathub/112175778679496400" target="_blank">continued</a>, "This provides a bit of clarity around the source of apps while helping increase trust for the growing number of verified apps. While we don’t require apps be verified or submitted by upstream developers, we highly encourage it."</p>
<p>They also reminded people that they always human-review every app submission on Flathub. Their team also put up a <a href="https://docs.flathub.org/blog/improved-build-validation/" target="_blank">blog post</a> back in February on some other moderation improvements to apps.</p>
<p>A feature request for Flatpak itself was also <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5757" target="_blank">opened</a> to show the Verified or Unverified status via the CLI, although there was already a more <a href="https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/5320" target="_blank">generic request</a> open on that. So hopefully sometime soon it will show it all clear when you're not installing via an app.</p>

<p>If you somehow still don't own the Fallout games, and with the Amazon series coming up, maybe this <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/fallout-bundle?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fallout Bundle from Fanatical</a> might be a good time for you to dive in.</p>
<p>For £24.99 you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li>
<li>Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition</li>
<li>Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition</li>
<li>Fallout 76</li>
<li>Fallout Classic Collection:
<ul>
<li>Fallout</li>
<li>Fallout 2</li>
<li>Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall a pretty good deal that. All of them should work on Linux / Steam Deck with Proton too.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.fanatical.com/en/bundle/fallout-bundle?ref=gol" target="_blank">full bundle on Fanatical</a>. Apparently if you use the code "OMEN10" you may also get an additional discount.</p>

<p>Not surprising to see Balatro right up there in the list at number 2 with it being one of the biggest Steam releases in February. It's also much higher than it was in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/heres-the-most-played-steam-deck-games-for-february-2024/" target="_blank">February most played list</a>.</p>

<p>I imagine next month Horizon Forbidden West will make an appearance in the list since it was released quite late in March. Interesting to also see Vampire Survivors back in the list, people just can't stay away from it.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher v2.14 has GOG and Amazon fixes, category customization improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher version 2.14.0 has been released and with it some category customisation improvements, to make them easier to work with. Along with fixes for their GOG and Amazon integrations and plenty more.</p>
<p>For adjusting categories you can now add, edit or delete them directly from the drop-down menu making it a lot easier to move games around. There's various other UI improvements to make navigating the app easier, and a fix for issue with GOG as they're a GOG Affiliate and the previous version forced their affiliate links which caused issues with people who block AdTraction - so now it's optional.</p>

      <title>Free Settlers II inspired strategy game Widelands version 1.2 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's free, open source and full of features. Widelands, a game inspired by The Settlers II, has a big new release out now with version 1.2. The Settlers II, and the original, were some of the first strategy games I played so I love seeing projects like this continue their original idea on.</p>
<p>Widelands 1.1 was released back in October 2022, so the developers have had quite a while to expand it!</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8842296671712050581gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8842296671712050581gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Some of the highlights of this release include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI Plugins</strong> are add-ons that can add more functionality to the user interface.</li>
<li><strong>Naval Warfare</strong> preview: Invade foreign coasts using warships!<br/>
<em>This is included as a preview feature and needs to be explicitly enabled in the game setup screen.</em></li>
<li><strong>Soldier garrisons</strong> for ports and headquarters.</li>
<li>Balancing changes to the Amazon economy.</li>
<li>Fifth scenario for the Frisian campaign.</li>
<li>More settings in the game setup screen, such as configurable durations for timed win conditions.</li>
<li>Diplomacy handling for the computer players.</li>
<li>Stick <strong>pinned notes</strong> onto map fields to mark important points.</li>
<li><strong>Hyperlinks</strong> let you navigate within the encyclopedia and to the online help.</li>
<li>Easy <strong>maps publishing</strong> inside the editor.</li>
<li>High-resolution images for many more units.</li>
<li>Accessibility enhancements for many user interface components.</li>
<li>Expose more functionality to the add-ons and scenario scripting interface.</li>
<li>Fixed many crashes and hangs and enhanced error handling.</li>
</ul>

      <title>XZ tools and libraries compromised with a critical issue</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's been an urgent security bulletin sent out in a few places today in the Linux sphere that relates to the XZ tools and libraries with liblzma, as certain version have been compromised.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4" target="_blank">OpenWall</a> security list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After observing a few odd symptoms around liblzma (part of the xz package) on Debian sid installations over the last weeks (logins with ssh taking a lot of CPU, valgrind errors) I figured out the answer:</p>
<p>The upstream xz repository and the xz tarballs have been backdoored.</p>
<p>At first I thought this was a compromise of debian's package, but it turns out to be upstream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what they say the issue is present in version 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of the libraries.</p>
<p>This has led to Red Hat putting up an urgent <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/urgent-security-alert-fedora-41-and-rawhide-users" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the matter, noting that so far Fedora Linux 40 is okay but you should "immediately stop usage of any Fedora Rawhide instances" as they were updated but they're going to be reverting to an older version.</p>
<p>For those not clear on what it is, as Red Hat noted: "xz is a general purpose data compression format present in nearly every Linux distribution, both community projects and commercial product distributions. Essentially, it helps compress (and then decompress) large file formats into smaller, more manageable sizes for sharing via file transfers".</p>
<p>Red Hat also noted the "malicious build interferes with authentication in sshd via systemd" and so "Under the right circumstances this interference could potentially enable a malicious actor to break sshd authentication and gain unauthorized access to the entire system remotely".</p>
<p>Debian also has a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2024/msg00057.html" target="_blank">security advisory</a> up on it noting that "no Debian stable versions are known to be affected" but the compromised packages were part of "Debian testing, unstable and experimental distributions" which they have reverted as well.</p>
<p>On the Ubuntu side they have a Discourse <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/xz-liblzma-security-update/43714/3" target="_blank">forum post</a> noting the affected package was removed from "Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat) proposed builds" and they're continuing to investigate.</p>
<p>It has been assigned as <a href="https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-3094" target="_blank">CVE-2024-3094</a> noting it is a critical issue.</p>
<p>So you'll want to ensure any XZ packages are not at version 5.6.0 or 5.6.1, and check the news directly from your chosen distribution for updates on it.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Update 02/04/24</strong>: the Binarly Research Team <a href="https://www.binarly.io/blog/xz-utils-supply-chain-puzzle-binarly-ships-free-scanner-for-cve-2024-3094-backdoor" target="_blank">announced</a> a new <a href="https://xz.fail/" target="_blank">free tool</a> to scan an ELF binary for XZ backdoor detection.</p>

      <title>Maniac is classic GTA meets Vampire Survivors - out now on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>From Transhuman Design we have the next survivor-like game with Maniac, that puts it into a classic GTA setting while you go on a bit of a frenzy. If you love a good bit of chaos with plenty of upgrades and characters to unlock, this may very well be what you need.</p>
<p>If definitely reminds me of my earlier years playing the first and second Grand Theft Auto, complete with police car chases and helicopters flying around trying to catch you. Only here, you can keep levelling up to make everything all that bit more ridiculous.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Pzgopn35Gdk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7524d4e5a0e73a587bd29fe4089c82de.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Pzgopn35Gdk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Six insane characters with unique abilities. Cause chaos with Drunk Santa, Hot Dog Guy, and even clowns.</li>
<li>Heart-pounding chase-driven action built on explosive physics and destruction.</li>
<li>With each new crime, the law gets more ticked off - police, FBI, military, special forces and more will all be on your tail.</li>
<li>Buy guns, explosives, and special items to keep your runs going longer.</li>
<li>Unlockable items and upgrades across all characters - better guns, landmines, sturdier cars, and more cash-per-crime. The upgrade path is yours to choose!</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Linux version (personal purchase) it seemed to work really well, the only issue I noticed was the cursor in the menu being a bit too big which seems to be a common Unity game engine issue on Linux.</p>
<p>It's a lot of fun but gamepad support in it is weird since you only get auto aim, or aiming in the direction you're facing, which for this type of game feels like an odd choice. Having actual twin-stick aiming would make it feel a lot better on gamepad. The developer has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1482380/discussions/0/4358995119363962504/#c4358995119364969201" target="_blank">said</a> they do plan to add that in as soon as possible which is nice to see. Apart from that though, it's pretty much <em>exactly</em> as you would expect such a game to be. Over the top action, lots of explosions and complete anarchy as you smash through everyone and everything in your way.</p>
<p>If you love the idea then £4.29 is a great price for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1482380/Maniac/" target="_blank">Available on Steam</a> with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>The Triple-i Initiative gaming showcase is coming April 10th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>So we finally know what the mysterious Triple-i Initiative thing is! It's a big gaming showcase full of announcements and new footage for upcoming games centred around triple-i games and studios (big indies).</p>
<p>There's going to be a <strong>lot</strong> too, and I really do mean a <u>lot</u>. The event will be 45 minutes long starting April 10th at 10am PT / 7pm CEST / 5pm UTC and it will be pure gaming. So no adverts or extra fluff forced into it, just a feast for gamers wanting to see some great upcoming stuff.</p>
<p>What actually will be in it? Expect to see over 30 games with announcements and special reveals from the likes of the people behind Vampire Survivors, Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon, Hyper Light Drifter, Risk of Rain, Humble Games publisher, Assemble Entertainment and the list goes on.</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We felt a need for a showcase that highlights wildly different indie games but that have one thing in common; they resonate with millions of players around the world. Since using letters seems to be the trend in the industry, we figured that adding a couple of i’s to indie was a fair way to describe this new format. Also, triple-i just sounds cool," said Bérenger Dupré, Evil Empire’s Marketing Director.</p>
<p>“The goal is to have a straight-to-the-point show packed with announcements as a collective of studios, to speak directly to players, the people who have been directly supporting us since day 1. The show will run for about 45 minutes, featuring news by the most successful and creative folks out there. No hosting segments, no advertisements, no sponsorships, no extra fluff, just games,” ​ added Benjamin Laulan, Evil Empire’s COO.</p>

      <title>Squad-based online shooter Enlisted: Reinforced now on Steam with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/03/24</strong>: the Steam released has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2051620/view/4186732260754268307" target="_blank">been pulled</a> temporarily due to all the negative reviews about issues with account linking and the bundled DLC. </p>
<hr/>
<p>Gaijin Network (War Thunder) and Darkflow Software (CRSED: Cuisine Royale) have today released the online squad-based shooter Enlisted: Reinforced into Early Access on Steam. As they said they would <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/squad-based-shooter-enlisted-reinforced-from-gaijin-is-coming-to-steam/" target="_blank">when I covered it previously</a>, the release comes with Native Linux support.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="69OwvpQAgIo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/25e94491de482a304a6d2b526052226d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/69OwvpQAgIo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>While the game is free to play direct from their launcher the version on Steam costs £16.99 / $19.99 / 19,99€ which comes with two premium squads, 7 days of a premium account, 500 gold, a unique nickname decorator and 15 first aid kits for each squad. It <em>might</em> become free to play on Steam at some point after Early Access but it may not.</p>
<p>The developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2051620/view/7281829929759186146" target="_blank">said</a> recently in a Steam post they will also be upgrading it for Steam Deck with "unique features specifically for Steam and Steam Deck".</p>
<p>From my brief test with a full game on my main Kubuntu Desktop, it worked really well with pretty good performance too thanks to it using Vulkan. Need a lot more time with it before giving any kind of recommendation as of yet though. Much like War Thunder, it seems to be very much pay-to-progress, or grind for quite a long time to get through all the research and different weapons.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2051620/Enlisted_Reinforced/" target="_blank">out on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Take-Two Interactive buying Gearbox from Embracer, more Borderlands on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Embracer Group continue to sell off more with the latest being Gearbox, which has been picked up by Take-Two Interactive in a $460 million deal.</p>
<p>As noted in the Embracer <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-divests-gearbox-entertainment-for-a-consideration-of-usd-460-million-to-take-two-interactive-software-inc/" target="_blank">press release</a> that Gearbox Software (Frisco, Texas), Gearbox Montréal, Gearbox Studio Quebec along with the Borderlands and Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands franchises, as well as Homeworld, Risk of Rain, Brothers in Arms and Duke Nukem will be going to Take-Two Interactive.</p>
<p>Embracer will however keep hold of Gearbox Publishing San Francisco (to be renamed prior to closing, formerly named Perfect World Entertainment), including the publishing rights to the Remnant franchise, the upcoming Hyper Light Breaker and other notable unannounced game releases. They also keep Cryptic Studios, including MMO titles Neverwinter Online and Star Trek Online, Lost Boys Interactive and Captured Dimensions.</p>
<p>Interestingly the deal is being done using "100% in newly issued Take-Two shares", which Embracer said they plan to "sell these shares to receive cash proceeds soon after closing".</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240327928202/en/Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc.-to-Acquire-The-Gearbox-Entertainment-Company-Inc.-Developer-of-Highly-Successful-Borderlands-Franchise" target="_blank">press release</a> for Take-Two, it confirms "Gearbox currently has six key interactive entertainment projects in various stages of development, including five sequels, two of which are from the Borderlands and Homeworld franchises, and at least one exciting new intellectual property" - so Borderlands 4 is coming then it seems.</p>

      <title>Oh Snap! Canonical now doing manual reviews for new packages due to scam apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After repeatedly suffering issues with scam apps making it onto the Snap Store, Canonical maker of Ubuntu Linux have now decided to manually look over submissions.</p>
<p>I've covered the issues with the Snap Store a few times now <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/knock-knock-whos-there-more-scam-apps-on-canonicals-snap-store/" target="_blank">like on March 19th</a> when ten scam crypto apps appeared, got taken down and then reappeared under a different publisher. Also earlier <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/snap-store-from-canonical-ubuntu-hit-with-another-crypto-scam-app/" target="_blank">back in February</a> there was an issue where a user actually lost their wallet as a result of a fake app. Multiple fake apps were also put up <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/snap-store-from-canonical-hit-with-malicious-apps/" target="_blank">back in October last year</a> as well, so it was a repeating issue that really needed dealing with properly.</p>
<p>So to try and do something about it, Canonical's Holly Hall has <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/manual-review-of-all-new-snap-name-registrations/39440" target="_blank">posted</a> on their Discourse forum about how "The Store team and other engineering teams within Canonical have been continuously monitoring new snaps that are being registered, to detect potentially malicious actors" and that they will now do manual reviews whenever people try to register "a new snap name".</p>
<p>On top of that soon they will also be releasing a new policy regarding "crypto-wallet and other sensitive snaps" with "guidelines for how to publish such a snap". Currently all of this is not supposed to be long-term, as it's an evolving situation.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will begin to put an end to scam apps making it into the Snap Store and onto machines running Ubuntu and any other Linux distribution that enables Snap packages.</p>

      <title>PUNKCAKE Délicieux just added Linux support to a whole bunch of games</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PUNKCAKE Délicieux are a game dev duo that release small fun games around once a month, and they've just now given all of their available titles the Linux (and macOS) treatment. They've made some pretty fun games looking at the list so you may want to go and check out a few of these.</p>
<p>One game you might have heard of is Shotgun King: The Final Checkmate, a rather unique strategy roguelike based on Chess, but you replace your army with a shotgun. A game <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/bad-at-chess-bring-a-shotgun-in-this-roguelike-spin/" target="_blank">I covered back in 2022</a> when run through Proton and it was a blast. </p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="U_O1_a6CLog"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/967c3bbd8bf6e416489e11e5743c343b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/U_O1_a6CLog" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They've made many more recent games too, but you should definitely give that one a go as it has my personal recommendation. </p>
<p>Other games they've made include their newest release this month with Stray Shot, which is a small arena shooter with a good few twists that looks like some great chaos: "This is a unique twin-stick arena shooter where your own actions define the difficulty. Shoot recklessly at the walls and you will drown in enemies, but shoot too little and you will have a mediocre score. Observe the different monsters's behaviours and be strategic in the way you fight them. The more monsters there are in the arena, the more points you get for each one defeated."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="jfiTtrFZCRU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d0cc917d6c629fc95d6dff28f142b08f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/jfiTtrFZCRU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can find all their games on:</p>
<p><a href="https://punkcake.itch.io/" target="_blank">itch.io</a></p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/punkcake/" target="_blank">Steam</a></p>
<p>Most of the games are discounted right now across both stores, and there's a <a href="https://itch.io/s/121280/macos-and-linux-support-sale-" target="_blank">bundle of them on itch.io</a> to celebrate.</p>

      <title>SDL 3 will prefer Wayland Over X11, if certain protocols are available</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Less than a week ago, <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/" target="_blank">SDL</a> (Simple DirectMedia Layer) developers restarted the discussion regarding whether Wayland should be configured as the preferred over X11, and a PR was made to <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9345" target="_blank">revert</a> a commit that set Wayland as preferred due to issues with needing fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1 protocols. This was briefly touched on <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/sdl-3-has-a-first-preview-release-out-with-hdr-and-vulkan-for-the-2d-rendering-api/" target="_blank">in our recent SDL 3 article</a>.</p>
<p>Quoting the issue description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This reverts commit<a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/f9f7db4e086036bd8ef3bce0f303e9057ee63040" target="_blank"> f9f7db4</a></p>
<p>Wayland has a myriad of unresolved problems regarding surface suspension blocking presentation and the FIFO (vsync) implementation being fundamentally broken leading to reduced GPU-bound performance.</p>
<p>That is not to say "we should fix FIFO in Mesa/other drivers," but rather that it is completely unfixable without an additional protocol, in this case fifo-v1<a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/256" target="_blank">1</a>.</p>
<p>Without this protocol, vkQueuePresent or glSwapBuffers must stall for the 'frame' callback after presenting an image. The only reason we can get away with this on SteamOS is because Gamescope implements what is essentially fifo-v1 and we use that there.</p>
<p>The other side is surface suspension -- a very similar issue to the above wrt the frame callback being used in that way and blocking. If the SDL window is obscured, vkQueuePresent will block in FIFO, which games typically do NOT like. This is solved by the combination of fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1.</p>
<p>There is no advantage to games and average applications preferring Wayland over X11 -- only severe performance and unusability regressions right now.<br/>
Thus, we must revert this change until fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1 are released and at least in a stable release for major compositors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While SDL <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/commit/254fcc90eb22bb159ab365ad956222a9c5632841" target="_blank">tried</a> for the last two years to push Wayland by default and had to revert because there were a number of issues with third-party software (NVIDIA drivers, libwayland event overflow, libdecor not handling plugin load failures, Steam overlay not working with Wayland, etc.).</p>
<p>The situation is promising now because it looks like the pending issues from Wayland are being addressed and the developers are aware and doing their best to solve them. The PR that would revert the Wayland over X11 behaviour again got closed and the merge discarded with a new solution (and a new issue) proposed. <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9345#issuecomment-2023112550" target="_blank">Quoting</a> Sam Lantinga: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the feedback everyone!</p>
<p>It sounds like the Wayland folks are aware of the issues and are making progress towards addressing them. I'll leave Wayland default for now while they are doing that, so it's easier for people to test and provide them feedback. We will re-evaluate this as we get closer to full release.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton" target="_blank">@Joshua-Ashton</a>, can you create individual issues that impact this and create a task list in the original merge request report, for tracking?</p>
<p>I'm going to lock this conversation for now so we can focus on development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9345#issuecomment-2023413737" target="_blank">And</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the performance issues motivating this PR are resolved by the combination of fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1, let's check for those protocols before using Wayland by default.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton" target="_blank">@Joshua-Ashton</a>, I'll go ahead and close this PR. Can you open a new one implementing that?</p>
<p>For those following along, this change guarantees that high performance Vulkan applications like games have the best experience by default. Hopefully these protocols will land soon, but either way the user has final control over the backend being used, via the SDL_VIDEO_DRIVER environment variable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good news that a mechanism was implemented and instead of dropping Wayland by default in all situations, this will only happen after checking fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1 protocols.</p>
<p>Feel free to follow-up on that subject by tracking the freshly created issue: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9383" target="_blank"> video: Only prefer Wayland if fifo-v1 and commit-timing-v1 are available #9383</a></li>

      <title>EA anticheat arrives for Battlefield V in April, will break it on Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following on from adding EA anticheat into FIFA 23, Battlefield 2042 and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 we're about to see another game broken on Linux / Steam Deck with Battlefield V.</p>
<p>Released today is a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-5/news/eaac-and-battlefield" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official Battlefield website, which mentions the previous implementation for Battlefield 2042 but now it confirms Battlefield V will also be getting it in April. The post doesn't say the exact date, but the official X account <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1773001536206999598" target="_blank">posted</a> it will be live on April 3rd at 8AM UTC.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11846028811711561472gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11846028811711561472gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A shame to see more games get it, as there will be no option at all to play it on Linux and Steam Deck because EA AntiCheat simply doesn't support it at all. It's a kernel-mode anti-cheat and anti-tamper solution made in-house by EA, which is especially problematic.</p>
<p>Released back in 2018, Battlefield V still has plenty of players, with it hitting a peak of 38,736 in the last 24 hours on Steam.</p>
<p>Hopefully EA don't add it into Apex Legends which currently uses Easy Anti-Cheat that's enabled for Linux, as that will be a big loss, but no word on that so far.</p>

      <title>4D Golf is making my brain melt away</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released on March 22nd, 4D Golf is about exploring higher dimensions through Golf. It's absolutely wild visually and I think you need to see this. It's making my brain go "what the fuck?".</p>
<p>The developer describes it as "a mind-bending golf game unlike any other because it's set entirely in a 4-dimensional space. Complete fun and unique golfing challenges as you gain hands-on experience of the 4th dimension and beyond!" but uh, no amount of screenshots or descriptions will do the weirdness justice, just check out the trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="y53UNskR-zU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/27daccf0198d3359bd8e1b16ea9096dc.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/y53UNskR-zU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>And for a little more the developer did a quick talk on the journey:</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Over 120 levels and 7 vibrant themed worlds.</li>
<li>Tons of visualization options to master 4D space.</li>
<li>Build your own 4D courses in the level editor.</li>
<li>Race the clock in Marble Platforming Mode.</li>

<p>Reminds me of how brain destroying <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/08/you-could-play-chess-but-why-not-play-5d-chess-with-multiverse-time-travel/" target="_blank">5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel</a> was but even more chaotic.</p>

      <title>Now you too can lose all your time in Lost For Swords with the demo</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/ive-spent-way-too-much-time-playing-lost-for-swords/" target="_blank">Back in July 2023</a> I wrote about Lost For Swords, a roguelike deck-builder, where the cards in your deck shape the rooms you’re exploring. It was properly good fun and now it has a Native Linux demo too!</p>
<p>The developer is bringing it over from itch.io to Steam, and they gave it the Linux treatment recently as well. Reaching out to me recently to note since the last time I tried, it was on itch.io for either Windows or to play via the web. The game has expanded a lot since I last tried it too - great to see.</p>
<p>In Lost For Swords you make your way up the tower, equip weapons and armour, cast spells and scrolls, activate auras, collect loot and fight the monsters on each floor. The fun hook here is that your equipment, and the cards of the dungeon itself are all shuffled and place on the board making it unique each time. Equipment you pick up can only be used once too, so it's all about planning ahead. A really clever concept that works quite well and really sucks away time.</p>

      <title>No Man&#39;s Sky 4.6 &#39;Orbital&#39; adds starship customization and a space station overhaul</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>God damn this sounds great. No Man's Sky just got another free huge upgrade in update 4.6 "Orbital" that comes with a bunch of big new features.</p>
<p>While No Man's Sky had a lot of ships you could acquire and that was great, the customisation needed a boost and Hello Games have firmly delivered with the option to create a completely custom ship now too. You can also now disassemble starships, to give you components for making those custom starships.</p>
<p>Space stations also went through a huge redesign that improves on every part of them. Not just that, space station interiors are also now procedurally generated giving you lots of different types to explore.</p>
<p>There's also improved screen space reflections, a trade surge system to help you find good deals, fleets of frigates engaged in interstellar expeditions may reach out for help, a station merchant refresh, various space station base parts can now be used for building, various UI improvements like a new main menu, you can now easily swap your primary ship in a space station and lots more.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/orbital-update/" target="_blank">full update notes</a>. Clearly this is not the last update either, as once again they're saying "more will follow", so I can only imagine what they've got cooking up next.</p>
<p>No Man's Sky is Steam Deck Verified and works great on Desktop Linux with Proton.</p>

      <title>Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy from the ATOM RPG team has a demo and Kickstarter live</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The team behind the post-apocalyptic ATOM RPG have launched a demo and crowdfunding campaign for Swordhaven: Iron Conspiracy, a fantasy cRPG inspired by Infinity Engine titles like Baldur's Gate 1, Icewind Dale and other classics. Just like their previous games it will have Linux support too.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="WBEAV8_CvrE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a671b4eab9e9d96b2ab5a03a97b03705.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/WBEAV8_CvrE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A flexible combat engine. Experience battle as a tactician in turn-based combat, or hasten the pace with the real-time with pause (RTwP) mode.</li>
<li>A classless roleplaying system: each stat combination provides a distinctive gaming experience, exclusive dialogues, and novel ways to solve quests.</li>
<li>A classics-inspired yet modern User Interface with many Quality of Life improvements from our contemporaries;</li>
<li>A vast, nonlinear world filled with unique NPCs and multi-solution quests that reward exploration, always offering alternative approaches to satisfy any character build.</li>
<li>Dozens of hours of exploration, from quiet village hamlets to hidden temples of the ancients, horrid crypts, bizarre dungeons, and otherworldly locales.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>With it being on Kickstarter they have a minimum funding goal of €36,000 and considering they're a proven developer, along with this genre getting a nice boost from Baldur's Gate recently it's likely to get funded quite easily.</p>
<p>Check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2108180/Swordhaven_Iron_Conspiracy/" target="_blank">Steam</a> now and the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/atomrpg/swordhaven-iron-conspiracy" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> to help fund it.</p>

      <title>KDE Plasma app Ark gets support for self-extracting .exe archive files</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In another of their regular update blog posts, KDE's Nate Graham has highlighted some recent new KDE Plasma features coming soon to the desktop.</p>
<p>With the latest <a href="https://pointieststick.com/2024/03/22/this-week-in-kde-4/" target="_blank">blog post</a> the first noted item might have a lot of uses! As Ark, the KDE file compression/decompression utility, can now open and un-archive self-extracting .exe archive files. There's a lot of installers out there for games, mods and plenty more that use this and so just being able to extract them simply on KDE Plasma with Ark sounds really useful. This will come with Ark version 24.05.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11223387071711464261gol1.png"/></p>
<p>Some more work is going into tweaking the Plasma UI too including showing you shortcuts over menu items, like middle click for opening a file in the first entry inside the "Open With" menu. That simple but useful change is coming with Dolphin 24.05.</p>
<p>They've also made the floating panel’s float/de-float animation smoother when using a scale factor, in Plasma's global Edit Mode you can now click anywhere on a panel to show that panel’s own configuration dialog, entries in the System Settings Autostart page are now sorted alphabetically and more.</p>
<p>Lots of bug fixes coming too as the clean-up continues from the main Plasma 6 release. Like a fix to relax KWin's requirement on Wayland that XWayland windows can only put content on the clipboard when they have keyboard focus, as this was not a requirement on X11 and enforcing it was breaking some XWayland-using apps.</p>
<p><em>Have you made the jump to Plasma 6 yet? Or are you waiting for a bit for bug fixes to roll in?</em></p>

      <title>Sci-fi deck-builder Hyperspace Deck Command has a demo out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Hyperspace Deck Command is the next game in the Hyperspace Anthology from Sleeper Games that includes their two previous games Swirl W@tch and ---Red---Tether--&gt;.</p>
<p>It's a a sci-fi card-battler deck-building roguelite where you deploy spaceships that operate on individual turn timers, combine a wide variety of cards into powerful decks and master the dual-use status effects to defeat the hegemonising swarm.</p>
<p>Check out the previous teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="aBZprZeheIE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1b38a7283243dbea7b03bf64f27be5c3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/aBZprZeheIE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Speaking about the demo the developer said via email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the demo you can fight your way through 5 different simulation encounters using a randomized starter deck, with units that operate on individual turn timers and tech that works differently depending on if you play it against allies or enemies. To beat the final endurance battle you will need a powerful fleet and proper mastery of the game’s dual-use status effect system.</p>
<p>In the full game you will also be able to build widely different decks by combine ships and technologies of various factions. And you will explore remote star systems to uncover cards, upgrades and increasingly harsh enemy encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect your fabricator megaship from waves of advancing enemies in tactical, card-based combat.</li>
<li>Deploy and move your space forces across multiple orbital lanes.</li>
<li>Use high-tech ability cards to support your vessels in battle.</li>
<li>Carefully consider your actions: Units operate on individual turn timers and every card you play brings them closer to carrying out their next attack run.</li>
<li>Combine dozens of possible fabricators, deck commanders, randomly generated flagships and auxiliary vessels into thousands of possible starting decks.</li>
<li>Modify individual cards with stackable upgrades or augment your entire fleet with powerful artifact tech.</li>
<li>Explore star systems to collect new ships and technology cards.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's planned to release in full later this year.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2711190/Hyperspace_Deck_Command/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Nova, a Rust-based Linux driver for NVIDIA GPUs announced</title>
      <author>nwildner</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Danilo Krummrich who is a Red Hat display driver team Software Engineer, announced the Nova project, a Rust-based GSP-only driver for Nvidia GPUs. Nova, in the long term, is intended to serve as the successor of Nouveau for GSP-firmware-based GPUs.</p>
<p>Quoting his email from the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/Zfsj0_tb-0-tNrJy@cassiopeiae/" target="_blank">dri-devel mailist</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>With Nova we see the chance to significantly decrease the complexity of the driver compared to Nouveau for mainly two reasons. First, Nouveau's historic architecture, especially around nvif/nvkm, is rather complicated and inflexible and requires major rework to solve certain problems (such as locking hierarchy in VMM / MMU code for VM_BIND currently being solved with a workaround) and second, with a GSP-only driver there is no need to maintain compatibility with pre-GSP code.</p>
<p>Besides that, we also want to take the chance to contribute to the Rust efforts in the kernel and benefit from more memory safety offered by the Rust programming language. Ideally, all that leads to better maintainability and a driver that makes it easy for people to get involved into this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please look at the full email for more details on this matter.</p>
<p>Nova is aiming to be a modern replacement for Nouveau and focus on developing a driver from the ground without the legacy that comes with that older opensource driver, and focusing on GPUs that are newer than the RTX 2000 series which have a better GSP(GPU System Processor) support, while non-GSP GPUs were always tricky to deal with. This driver will also indirectly boost the morale of those trying to develop Rust-based drivers for Linux by providing examples for those who want to be involved in developing kernel technology using that language.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Nouveau will die soon, since it will still handle older GPUs that do not rely on GSP for hardware initialization and management, and we see a loot of improvement with NVK lately.</p>
<p>As for today, the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/nova" target="_blank">Nova repository</a> is looking really active and promising although the README file states that there is still a lot to be done until this driver can be considered ready for production use.</p>

      <title>Orange Pi Neo Linux gaming handheld starts at $499 with Ryzen 7840U, Ryzen 8840U at $599</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After being <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/orange-pi-neo-gaming-handheld-to-come-with-manjaro-linux/" target="_blank">revealed early in February</a>, the upcoming Orange Pi Neo that will come with Manjaro Linux now has a price, and there will be multiple versions of it although we still don't exactly have a clear release date.</p>
<p>The Manjaro Linux account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/ManjaroLinux/status/1772066928774848973" target="_blank">posted</a> that it was "launched" in Shenzhen, China. The device will be split across a Ryzen 7840U model at $499 USD and a Ryzen 8840U at $599 USD. It will join the Steam Deck in being powered by Linux, although not SteamOS, it will use a special immutable Manjaro Gaming Edition. Although if you don't get on with Manjaro, there's other options like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=ChimeraOS&amp;title_only=on" target="_blank">ChimeraOS</a> and <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/search-articles/?q=Bazzite&amp;title_only=on" target="_blank">Bazzite</a> that will no doubt get drivers sorted for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14175532881711450991gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14175532881711450991gol1.png"/></a></p>

<p>The starter $499 price actually seems quite reasonable don't you think?</p>
<p>I'm definitely excited to see more proper Linux handhelds coming to market, and unlike <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/playtron-plan-to-launch-playtronos-a-linux-based-system-for-gaming/" target="_blank">the recent Playtron announcement</a> this is an actual product releasing soon.</p>

      <title>GOG begin funding indie devs with Loco Motive releasing this Summer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have announced that they're getting into game funding, with the first partnership being a boost for developers from Robust Games and publisher Chucklefish for their upcoming title Loco Motive.</p>
<p>An interesting move, and not exactly unusual really when you think about it. GOG run a games store, if they think funding specific games that will release on GOG will increase sales — why not do it? Loco Motive is a game I actually wrote about <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/02/check-out-the-free-wonderful-point-and-click-mystery-comedy-loco-motive/" target="_blank">back in early 2021</a> due to the impressively styled free Game Jam version, which has a Native Linux version, although it looks like the full release will not so you'll need <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>. The developers say they've tested the game on the Steam Deck and "it works well!".</p>

<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>"We believe in game preservation – in every form. Where there is passion and love for gaming, we want to go there! Be it bringing back classic titles, making them playable, reviving unlisted gems… Or supporting the creation of new indie games, such as Robust Games’ Loco Motive" - Bartosz Kwietniewski, Head of Business Development at GOG</p>
<p>"As a small independent studio, we were thrilled to forge this partnership with GOG. We deeply value and appreciate the trust GOG place in us as their first investment into indies, and I'm confident that with their collaboration and support we will reach new heights of success." - Adam Riches, Co-Founder of Robust Games</p>
<p>I did shoot off an email to GOG PR about this, asking more questions about how this partnership actually works for GOG but they have not replied as of time of publishing. See GOG's <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/coming_soon_gog_chucklefish_and_robust_games_team_up_for_the_upcoming_game" target="_blank">announcement</a> for more.</p>
<p>Loco Motive is available for wishlists on:</p>

      <title>Ubuntu 24.04 increases vm.max_map_count for smoother Linux gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>At last! Users from Ubuntu 24.04 onwards that's scheduled to release on April 25th should hopefully see a smoother Linux gaming experience.</p>
<p>There's been an issue for quite some time now in various Linux distributions where the value of vm.max_map_count is too low, which is by default set to 65530, and this causes a whole bunch of games to crash. Fedora <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/IncreaseVmMaxMapCount" target="_blank">changed</a> this to a default of 1048576 back with Fedora Linux 39 and now it's the turn for Ubuntu to do the same.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/2057792" target="_blank">bug report</a>, it's been noted that a fix has been committed for Ubuntu 24.04 in the <a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/procps/2:4.0.4-4ubuntu2" target="_blank">procps</a> package that will now match the value that Fedora is using.</p>
<p>Some of the games that can be affected by it include The Finals, which I actually <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/the-finals-freezing-on-linux-heres-ways-you-can-fix-it/" target="_blank">wrote about with this issue</a>, and others including Counter Strike 2, Hogwarts Legacy, DayZ, and basically anything that might be invoking a lot of mmaps. Some specific games may still need a higher value, but at least bumping up the default will leave room for more games to actually work properly.</p>
<p>It's such a small change, but the benefit will be huge for an overall smoother gaming experience.</p>

      <title>Trackline Express is a bit like Unrailed! with even more chaos</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Trackline Express is a train and track building game from Bubblebird Studio that's planned to release on April 18th, and it sure does look like some wonderful chaos. From the same developer that created the chilled Haven Park.</p>
<p>Very much in a similar spirit as Unrailed!, which is an absolute gem, but here it's even more crazy in a few ways. You're not just building up tracks constantly here though, instead the focus is more on building up your train (but you can put down more tracks too). There's a fair bit of crafting, frequent attacks to fight off and you even get to be creative with having your passengers help you out all while trying to get the train to the next station. </p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>

<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>High replay value.</li>
<li>Many items to gather and craft.</li>
<li>Multiple game modes.</li>
<li>Online and local (LAN) multiplayer mode (experimental).</li>
<li>Mini quests to complete.</li>
<li>Random deterministic map generator.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2343920/Trackline_Express/" target="_blank">follow on Steam and there's a demo</a> available along with Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>Check out tactical dice-rolling roguelike combat in Slice &amp; Dice</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Slice &amp; Dice from developer Tann has recently arrived on Steam giving players a fresh tactical dice-rolling roguelike, along with Native Linux support. This looks like Slay the Spire meets dice instead of cards, so if that sounds like your sort of thing it might be time to go and pick up a new game.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="k5UBfPwqp7s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8aa2f4a4ee28e3cb91d4d6f06883f955.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/k5UBfPwqp7s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3D dice physics, choose which dice to reroll.</li>
<li>Simple turn-based combat.</li>
<li>Level up a hero or gain an item after each fight.</li>
<li>Randomly-generated encounters.</li>
<li>Ridiculous combos.</li>
<li>Undo actions as much as you like.</li>
<li>Each turn is like a mini-puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>128 hero classes (+99999?).</li>
<li>73 monsters.</li>
<li>473 items.</li>
<li>Too many modes.</li>
<li>∞ curses.</li>
<li>Weird modding.</li>
<li>Online leaderboards.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a demo available too but it looks like their Native Linux version has issues launching. It uses Java, so simply running the jar file <em>directly</em> with system-installed Java works. Or, you can just use <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> for now. They may need to add a launch script to actually use their bundled Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for the Linux version. I've let the developer know.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1775490/Slice__Dice/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Polychroma Games and Maximum Entertainment have announced the cinematic narrative adventure Until Then is going to release on May 23rd.</p>
<p>More: "A fateful meeting sets off a chain reaction, upending Mark's life. People disappear and memories prove unreliable. Uncover a hidden truth with Mark and his friends in this narrative adventure and race to unravel the mystery before it's too late."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer as this looks like something quite special:</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure what to expect from that trailer, but overall it looks quite gorgeous. Almost Anime like in a way, and with the mix of perspectives here it will probably be quite interesting to play through.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play out your own adventure.</li>
<li>Investigate the setting through everyday technology.</li>
<li>Explore themes of love, loss, and friendship.</li>

      <title>SDL 3 has a first preview release out with HDR and Vulkan for the 2D rendering API</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Fun times ahead for game developers, as the very popular SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) has a preview of the upcoming SDL 3 now available for feedback and testing.</p>
<p>What is SDL used for? It's a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware on many different platforms like Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Yesterday, March 24th, Sam Lantinga of Valve <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/prerelease-3.1.0" target="_blank">announced</a> the preview.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights of SDL 3 include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The API has been significantly reworked to be easier to use and more consistent</li>
<li>The 2D rendering API now has support for more advanced colorspaces and HDR rendering</li>
<li>The 2D rendering API now has a Vulkan backend</li>
<li>An example of hardware accelerated video playback using ffmpeg has been added in test/testffmpeg.c</li>
<li>The shaped window API has been replaced with transparent windows</li>
<li>Time and date functions have been added in SDL_time.h</li>
<li>Support for webcam video capture has been added in SDL_camera.h</li>
<li>Support for handling pens and tablets has been added in SDL_pen.h</li>
<li>Support for file open and save dialogs has been added in SDL_dialog.h</li>
<li>Cross-platform functions for working with files and directories are available in SDL_filesystem.h</li>
<li>A cross-platform abstraction for working with user and game data has been added in SDL_storage.h</li>
<li>Handling of main() has been moved to a header library and an optional callback-based program flow is available</li>
<li>Support for simple object properties has been added in SDL_properties.h. These properties are available on many SDL objects, and can be used for more advanced functionality.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, one thing that <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/pull/9345" target="_blank">seems to be changing</a>, is moving the default back to X11 instead of Wayland due to various issues that need solving.</p>

      <title>Mini Airways is like Mini Metro / Mini Motorways but for aircraft</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a interesting take on the strategy management sim? Taking a heavy dose of inspiration and naming from the very popular Mini Metro and Mini Motorways, a completely different developer is doing their take with Mini Airways. CCC Games are clearly big fans of the work from Dinosaur Polo Club.</p>
<p>It's a real-time management game with an air traffic control theme, as you continually expand and things can get a little busy with tons of planes taking off, landing and hopefully not crashing into each other. Actually seems like quite a nice take on it, and the developer recently added Native Linux support to the demo.</p>

<p>They might need to work on the English text a little, but hey at least with a demo you can provide some feedback on that.</p>

      <title>MangoHud manager GOverlay 1.1.1 released upgrading to QT6</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOverlay, the app you can use if you want a UI to manage overlays like MangoHud has a new release out that upgrades its insides and fixes some bugs. While MangoHud is pretty darn easy to configure, since it's just a text file, GOverlay is useful for those who just quickly want to tick some boxes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20933382701711359981gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20933382701711359981gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>What the developer said has been improved in 1.0.1 and 1.1.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>New: We've given our toolkit a snazzy upgrade to QT6.</li>
<li>New: Check out our shiny new icon and application logo!</li>
<li>FIX: Say goodbye to issues with changing FPS color—it now saves your config like a champ.</li>
<li>FIX: That pesky pcidev config option? Yeah, it's sticking around now.</li>
<li>FIX: Ever set AF filter or Mipmap filter to 0 and felt like it did nothing? Fear not, they'll now actually disable those filters as intended.</li>
<li>FIX: No more wandering windows—the main goverlay window now sits smack dab in the center of your desktop.</li>
<li>Cheers to smoother sailing and more streamlined experiences ahead!</li>
</ul>

      <title>Nature-expanding tile-stacking puzzler &#39;Preserve&#39; has a demo up on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Preserve looks very sweet. A tile-based puzzle game all about nature that features both horizontal and vertical building and there's a Native Linux demo now available to try out. The idea of connecting up a vertical network of interconnected habitats seems like a genuinely great idea for this.</p>
<p>More: "Preserve is a puzzle nature-building game that takes players on a journey into a harmonious ecosystem. The objective is to foster and sustain a thriving and diverse biomes, where each component coexists in a symbiotic harmony. By utilizing strategic thinking and a keen eye for balance, players are granted the power to position a wide array of plants and animals, curating an environment that caters to their preferences and aspirations."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Eldmbodjqzc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b274e07786a3a3cee8ebb7c17867eb17.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Eldmbodjqzc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertical map expansion - In Preserve, you can expand the map not only horizontally, but you also posses an ability to stack layers of nature, forming a vertical network of interconnected habitats.</li>
<li>Diverse biome habitats - From alpine forests and savannas to carribean reefs, each biome will have its own unique set of plants, animals, and environmental challenges to discover and overcome.</li>
<li>Multiple Game Modes - Besides regular harmony and puzzle game modes, creative mode lets you build the land without limitations and photo mode allows you to capture and share your creations at the end of each session.</li>
<li>Natural Wonders - Nothing can beautify your map more than natural wonders like the snowy Alps, lavender fields or redwood forests, which you can acquire thanks to a unique card upcycle system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just recently the developer added Linux and macOS support to the demo along with other various improvements. It also advertises Full Controller Support so it should be a nice sweet game for Steam Deck on the go too.</p>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109270/Preserve/" target="_blank">give it a look on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Backpack Battles, one of my current — uh, fixations shall we say, has managed to blow away expectations on Steam selling over 500,000 copies in only two weeks of Early Access.</p>
<p>The developer shared the news today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2427700/view/4150702828796072634" target="_blank">Steam</a>, which is quite a sharp jump from the 100,000 sold from March 9th so it's doing impressively well. They've also just released a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2427700/view/4150702828799589362" target="_blank">patch</a> for the game that overhauls the main menu screen along with various balancing adjustments to the various character classes to get them to match up better during battles.</p>
<p>Backpack Battles is one of those games that you really just want one more round on, especially when it's time to go to bed. A round couldn't hurt right? Buying up all the cool stuff in the shop, expanding your bag and then doing a PvP battle and suddenly it's 3AM, woops.</p>

<p>Another big success for <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> too! It has Native Linux support and works on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>2D soulslike adventure-RPG &#39;Tails of Iron 2&#39; launches later this year</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Odd Bug Studio are back with a fun announcement, as a sequel to their 2021 hit Tails of Iron is coming later this year with Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter. It will also have Native Linux support like the first game.</p>
<p>The game follows on from the brutal conclusion in the first game. In Whiskers of Winter players take up the mantle of Arlo – son of the Warden of the North – following a brutal attack by the Dark Wings, a new fanged threat from the frozen wastelands beyond. </p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-xniRGcL_wM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ee9b1582ea1e93575de188b8b7f71cf7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-xniRGcL_wM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>An expanded campaign of violence and revenge – </strong><em>Whiskers of Winter’s </em>‘tail’ of Arlo’s fight against the ferocious Dark Wing Bats is an intense experience, featuring a semi open RPG world set across six varied biomes to explore, and new animal factions to discover.</li>
<li><strong>Challenging combat </strong>– Building upon the series’ trademark hardcore combat, <em>Tails of Iron 2</em> features enhanced weapons gameplay, including four elemental effects (fire, ice, electricity, and poison) to imbue Arlo’s arsenal with unique abilities to use against foes.</li>
<li><strong>NEW Monster hunting gameplay – </strong>To tip the balance against the new fanged army of Dark Wing Bats,<strong> </strong>Arlo can track down and overcome 15 gigantic and challenging beasts to harvest their cadavers for rare upgrade materials.</li>
<li><strong>Improved base building – </strong>Construct and upgrade the devastated settlement of Winter’s Edge to gain access to more powerful items from the smithy, tastier meals at the kitchen, a wider range of powerful traps from the shoppe, and more!</li>
<li><strong>NEW Day and night system –</strong> Arlo will face different foes depending on the time of day, with more enemy types added as additional monsters are hunted down and vanquished.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“We are delighted to finally announce our return to Ratdom with Tails of Iron 2: Whiskers of Winter, and start a new ‘tail’ of bloodshed and medieval revenge. We wanted to build upon what we achieved with the first instalment and create a game that was more than just a straightforward sequel,” said Jack Bennett, Co-founder and Lead Designer, Odd Bug Studio. “We took on board the incredible community feedback on the original game and set about crafting a more intense experience than its predecessor. The new gameplay mechanics, the addition of monster hunting sidequests, together with improved crafting and base building, all work together to make Arlo’s crusade in the northern wastelands even more epic than King Redgi’s.”</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2473480/Tails_of_Iron_2_Whiskers_of_Winter/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Founder of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 developer blasts publisher greed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-blasts-publisher-greed-behind-layoffs" target="_blank">reported by Eurogamer</a> at GDC (Game Developer's Conference), during the Game Developers Choice Awards where Baldur’s Gate 3 won Game of the Year, Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke had some strong words to say about the games industry.</p>
<p>Here's what Vincke said:</p>
<p>"Greed has been fucking this whole thing up for so long, since I started," Vincke said, while collecting the GDCA Best Narrative award for Baldur's Gate 3. "I've been fighting publishers my entire life and I keep on seeing the same, same, same mistakes over, and over and over.</p>
<p>"It's always the quarterly profits," he continued, "the only thing that matters are the numbers, and then you fire everybody and then next year you say 'shit I'm out of developers' and then you start hiring people again, and then you do acquisitions, and then you put them in the same loop again, and it's just broken...</p>
<p>"You don't have to," Vincke went on. "You can make reserves. Just slow down a bit. Slow down on the greed. Be resilient, take care of the people, don't lose the institutional knowledge that's been built up in the people you lose every single time, so you have to go through the same cycle over and over and over. It really pisses me off."</p>
<p>Vincke <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/1770834130852315517" target="_blank">continued</a> on X to also add:</p>
<p>"For the avoidance of doubt - there are plenty of people in publishing I met who have their hearts in the right place. This message was for those who try to double their revenue year after year. You don't have to do that.  Build more slowly and make your aim improving the state of the art, not squeezing out the last drop.  And respect the people making the games. You'll find it brings you more joy."</p>
<p>It's clear that Larian Studios are a great game developer worth supporting. Larian also confirmed that no DLC expansion is coming for Baldur's Gate 3, it's a complete game and they will be moving onto their next game although Baldur's Gate 3 will still get patches to fix issues.</p>
<p>With the amount of layoffs this year, which have been ridiculous, it's nice to see some speak out like this at events. Just look at the chart <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-impact-of-16000-games-industry-layoffs-in-one-chart/" target="_blank">PC Gamer</a> put up showing the layoffs in early February (and there's been more since)…</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1881585801711107475gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1881585801711107475gol1.jpg"/></a></p>

      <title>GitLab takes down Nintendo Switch emulator suyu due to the DMCA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 22/03/24, 10:56 UTC</strong> - While GitLab have not responded to my email, the team behind suyu are continuing on. As one of their team posted in Discord, which seems invites are open for again:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9185408581711104934gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9185408581711104934gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So they will be sticking to <a href="https://git.suyu.dev/suyu/suyu" target="_blank">their own hosted Git</a> now.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Well, that didn't last long did it. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/nintendo-switch-emulator-suyu-continues-on-from-yuzu/" target="_blank">After a first release</a>, GitLab have already pulled down the Nintendo Switch emulator <a href="https://suyu.dev" target="_blank">suyu</a>, due to a DMCA hit as a result of it being forked from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" target="_blank">yuzu which Nintendo shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Even though the suyu team were doing it as a non-profit, with no way to donate, it seems this didn't matter because it's based on a project that was already taken down. The <a href="https://gitlab.com/suyu-emu/suyu" target="_blank">GitLab page</a> now just gives a 404 error — it's just gone. The suyu Discord is also no longer accepting invites, probably due to an influx of people wondering what's going on.</p>
<p>A few people managed to grab the notice that was sent to the suyu team like <a href="https://twitter.com/MrSujano/status/1770896278165004294" target="_blank">Mr. Sujano</a> on X:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7446463651711051396gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7446463651711051396gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>So it looks like this may very well be the end of the road for suyu on GitLab. At least for emulation fans, <a href="https://ryujinx.org" target="_blank">Ryujinx</a> is still going. Since yuzu was open source though, Nintendo will have plenty of trouble fully erasing it, since even a very quick Google search showed up plenty of it still existing on the web across various places. </p>
<p><em>I've reached out to GitLab for more info…will update if they reply.</em></p>

      <title>Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition out now on Steam - works on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Horizon Forbidden West Complete Edition has officially arrived on Steam, and thankfully it does work on Linux Desktop / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>In the Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2420110/view/4111296332057828808" target="_blank">release announcement</a> the developers noted "We will continue to make optimizations to improve compatibility on handheld PC gaming devices" so <em>hopefully</em> the experience on Steam Deck will get improvements in that. Additionally they're working on bringing AMD FSR 3 including Frame Generation in a future update.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/proton-experimental-fixes-up-classic-ea-games-and-fixes-more-regressions/" target="_blank">As reported earlier</a> by me, Valve released updates to both Proton Experimental and Proton Hotfix recently although there was no announcement on Proton Hotfix changes just yet, we can now see that at least on Steam Deck that Valve picked Proton Hotfix by default. So Proton Hotfix likely has some adjustments in it needed for the best experience.</p>
<p>Steam Deck shots provided by one of our <a href="https://discord.gg/AghnYbMjYg" target="_blank">Discord</a> moderators, running it on the default settings (click to enlarge):</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19971144231711040493gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/19971144231711040493gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11215660041711040494gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11215660041711040494gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Good to see another fresh release working thanks to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>! Early areas at least seem to give around 30FPS, but as we know from games this big, later areas may bring performance down just like the first game that can cause some issues.</p>
<p>You can buy it from:</p>

      <title>AMD FSR 3.1 announced with Vulkan support, upscaling quality improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>During GDC, AMD announced the latest big upgrade to come for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution with version 3.1 planned to launch in Q2 2024.</p>
<p>The main improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upscaling image quality improvements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved temporal stability at rest and in movement – less flickering and/or shimmering and “Fizziness” around objects in motion.</li>
<li>Ghosting reduction and better preservation of detail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Decoupling FSR 3 upscaling from frame generation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Allows FSR 3.1 frame generation technology to work with other upscaling solutions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New AMD FidelityFX API:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Makes it easier for developers to debug and allows forward compatibility with updated versions of FSR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vulkan</strong><strong> and Xbox Game Development Kit (GDK) support.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first game announced to be getting AMD FSR 3.1 is Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart. AMD included some example gifs on the improvement in the quality expected from AMD FSR 3.1 like a reduction in ghosting which you can see first in AMD FSR 2.2 below and then AMD FSR 3.1:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3944387861711039340gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3944387861711039340gol1.gif"/></a><br/>
AMD FSR 2.2</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/834957181711039339gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/834957181711039339gol1.gif"/></a><br/>
AMD FSR 3.1</p>
<p>AMD said that was Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart running at 1080p using AMD FSR 2.2/3.1 in Performance mode. They also once again reminded people that a 60FPS minimum is needed before Frame Generation will give the best experience in image quality and input latency.</p>
<p>Various other games have been announced to be getting AMD FSR 3 on top of Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart including Cyberpunk 2077, Dragon's Dogma 2, Dying Light 2 Stay Human, Frostpunk 2, Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut, NARAKA: BLADEPOINT, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p>

      <title>3rd party KDE Plasma Global Themes and Widgets can lead to data loss</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Uh oh. Seems there's been an issue lately with Global Themes for KDE, which has ended up causing a total wipe of data. The issue is that KDE Global Themes can run arbitrary code, so they can really mess with your system, so you're advised not to use them.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://floss.social/@kde/112128243960545659" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> the official KDE account put out a warning across multiple posts copied below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WARNING: Global themes and widgets created by 3rd party developers for Plasma can and will run arbitrary code. You are encouraged to exercise extreme caution when using these products.</p>
<p>A user has had a bad experience installing a global theme on Plasma and lost personal data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/1bixmbx/do_not_install_global_themes_some_wipe_out_all/" target="_blank" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/1bixmbx/do_not_install_global_themes_some_wipe_out_all/">https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/1bixmbx/do_not_install_global_themes_some_wipe_out_all/</a></p>
<p>Global themes change the look of Plasma, but also the behavior. To do this they run code, and this code can be faulty, as in the case mentioned above. The same goes for widgets and plasmoids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are calling on the community to help us locate and quarantine defective software by using the "Report" buttons available on each item in the KDE Store.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.kde.org/" target="_blank" title="https://store.kde.org/">https://store.kde.org</a></p>
<p>Please see the attached image to locate them.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11127118931711030368gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11127118931711030368gol1.png"/></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And more…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, KDE is taking measures to properly warn users before each download and we are also putting in place ways of auditing and curating what is uploaded to the KDE store.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/kde-store-content/" target="_blank" title="https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/kde-store-content/">https://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/kde-store-content/</a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, this will take time and resources. We recommend all users to be careful when installing and running software not provided directly by KDE or your distros.</p>
<p>And remember to report any faulty products you find!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As written up by David Edmundson in the blog link above, this specific case was not intentional but as a result of "a mistake in some shell parsing". Edmundson suggests that if you have used the KDE addon store give it a look over.</p>
<p>Quite a problem, that's going to need some proper long-term solutions to prevent this happening again.</p>
<p>This certainly isn't the first time we've seen issues with scripts nuking a Linux system. Like how a <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/3671" target="_blank">Steam bug</a> removed everything for a user back in 2015. Linux distros by default all really need more protections in place on the rm command.</p>

      <title>Red Dead Redemption 2 gets AMD FSR 2.2 and HDR10+</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A rare update for Red Dead Redemption 2 has landed, and for those who want a little more performance, you might like this one especially if you're on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Update version 1.32 from March 19th bumps the AMD FSR from 2.0 to 2.2 so not only will you get better performance with FSR, but now thanks to jumping two versions you should also see better visual quality at the same time. Nice to see a game originally released in 2019 for PC (2018 for console) continue to see such improvements and bug fixes multiple years later.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I added AMD FSR 3 with Frame Generation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>For those of you interested in getting the most out of The Last of Us Part I on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck, you may want to check out patch v1.1.3.</p>
<p>The latest update released March 19th has a small but mighty looking changelog:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for AMD FSR3 Super Resolution.</li>
<li>Added support for AMD FSR3 Frame Generation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Together the updates should bring a decent uplift in the performance, at the expense of visuals, although that is very much hardware and driver version depending. </p>
<p>Giving it a test on Kubuntu 23.10 with my AMD 6800XT with Mesa 24.0.3 at 2560x1440 using Proton Hotfix (Valve's default) the performance definitely gets a big boost with FSR 3 and Frame Generation turned on. First up without any FSR:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14192252301711027497gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14192252301711027497gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Then with AMD FSR 3 on Quality:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12639123351711027500gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12639123351711027500gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then turning on Frame Generation:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10206818021711027499gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10206818021711027499gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Pretty much seeing at least double the performance in some cases and it still looks really good too so it is quite impressive overall. The Last of Us Part I is rated Steam Deck Verified by Valve and Gold on <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1888930" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>.</p>
<p>Since the initial rough PC release, it looks like they've managed to turn it around quite well with the most recent user reviews on Steam being Very Positive although it only has a Mostly Positive rating overall.</p>
<p>If you've tried it out, do let me know your experience in the comments with AMD FSR 3 in The Last of Us Part I on Linux Desktop and / or Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 9-2 released, ULWGL gets renamed to umu (Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Thomas "GloriousEggroll" Crider has released the latest GE-Proton 9-2 with a bunch of upgrades, plus some news about the Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher.</p>
<p>As a reminder: GE-Proton is a community-built version of Proton, not supported by Valve, that often has fixes Valve can't distribute (sometimes for legal reasons, other times for more QA testing time). For GE-Proton 9-2 the changes are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge.</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git.</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git.</li>
<li>dxvk-nvapi updated to latest git.</li>
<li>upstream proton changes added.</li>
<li>upstream steamclient changes added.</li>
<li>ULWGL-protonfixes renamed to umu-protonfixes per upstream project.</li>
<li>previous noted wmv playback regression appears to be fixed now -- working with ultimate marvel vs capcom 3 again.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2645637131711025480gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2645637131711025480gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - ULTIMATE MARVEL VS. CAPCOM 3</em></p>
<p>ULWGL (Unified Linux Wine Game Launcher) as noted above has now been renamed to <a href="https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher" target="_blank">umu</a>. What is it? A unified launcher for windows games on linux. It is essentially a copy of the <a href="https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools" target="_blank">Steam Linux Runtime/Steam Runtime Tools</a> that Valve uses for proton, with some modifications made so that it can be used outside of Steam. So it's not a launcher in the sense of Heroic or Lutris, but a tool used by other launchers to properly run Proton outside of Steam.</p>
<p>About the renaming posting on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@gloriouseggroll/112130222897371739" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, we've decided on "umu" as the rename for ULWGL.</p>
<p>umu "oo-moo" -- A chamber used for baking or heating.</p>
<p>It fits the theme of pressure-vessel, steam, etc, and it's short, easy to say in a conversation, (and jokingly uwu).</p>

      <title>Halo Infinite added Easy Anti-Cheat - it&#39;s enabled for Linux / Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Halo Infinite had an update that amongst other things added in Easy Anti-Cheat, which thankfully has been enabled so it still works on Linux Desktop and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>I've tested it myself with Proton Experimental (Desktop) and it does work, with EAC loading just fine and online play works without issues. Although some of the graphics look a bit broken with textures not correctly loading in the environment and on Spartan suits (<a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21147795641711023144gol1.jpg" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9079030451711023528gol1.jpg" target="_blank">#2</a>) on Mesa 24.0.3. So your mileage may vary there. </p>
<p>Other improvements in this update include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overhauled network model, that should result in less rubberbanding movement, taking damage around corners, and other issues caused by becoming desynchronized with the multiplayer servers.</li>
<li>A refresh of Squad Battles with new maps made by players using The Forge:</li>
</ul>

<p>There's also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various weapon balancing.</li>
<li>The introduction of Firefight Custom, so modders can have even more fun creating things.</li>
<li>Various improvements to Forge.</li>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up classic EA games and fixes more regressions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A really fun release of Proton Experimental has landed for Linux and Steam Deck, fixing up some issues with a bunch of <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/command-conquer-the-ultimate-collection-launched-on-steam-and-other-classics/" target="_blank">classic EA games that recently hit Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For the release dated March 20th the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">changelog</a> is listed below.</p>
<p>Now Playable:</p>
<ul>
<li>SimCity 3000 Unlimited.</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2 and Yuri’s Revenge.</li>
<li>Command &amp; Conquer Tiberian Sun and Firestorm.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3238077441711021458gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3238077441711021458gol1.jpg"/></a><br/>
<em>Pictured - Red Alert 2 now running fine.</em></p>
<p>At last, I can re-live some fond memories with the C&amp;C classics. I grew up playing through all of them, it's so nice that Valve fix up everything possible in Proton to make them all work on Linux. The power of open source in action once again to play what you want on your favourite platform.</p>
<p>Other Fixes and Improvements in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Proton Experimental regression that made Total War: Three Kingdoms unplayable.</li>
<li>Fixed new prefix failing to initialize on filesystem that do not support copy_file_range systemcall.</li>
<li>Added support for Steamworks SDK 1.59.</li>
<li>Fixed a few 9.0 regressions:
<ul>
<li>Carmageddon: Max Damage is playable again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Proton Hotfix was also just updated but Valve don't seem to keep a formal changelog anywhere, so we'll have to wait for someone at Valve to announce what specific game was needed this time. I suspect it's probable it's for either Dragon's Dogma 2 or Horizon Forbidden West.</p>

      <title>Explicit Sync Wayland Protocol Merged, Wayland Protocols 1.34 released</title>
      <author>pleasereadthemanual</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you own a NVIDIA GPU and run a Wayland session, you might have experienced visual glitches with some applications. They can be minor or <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/10313" target="_blank">quite extreme</a>. This issue only seemed to affect XWayland applications and is explained in detail on the <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/issues/1317" target="_blank">xserver issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>It was explained that the NVIDIA driver does not support "implicit buffer synchronization", which is what is used across the open-source stack. This is why AMD and Intel GPUs don't face the same issues, as drivers for those cards have implicit sync support. That being said, explicit synchronization can benefit all graphics drivers.</p>
<p>While the NVIDIA driver <em>could</em> implement implicit sync support, it wasn't a complete fix and could have some downsides, so the conversation shifted to creating an Explicit Sync Wayland protocol. That merge request, which was opened two years ago and worked on by several people from different projects like GNOME, KDE, Wlroots, and NVIDIA, <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/90" target="_blank">was just merged on March 20th</a>.</p>
<p>That's not the end of it, though. Support needs to be implemented in compositors, <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/25709" target="_blank">graphics drivers</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/967" target="_blank">XWayland</a>.</p>
<p>Once all the merge requests that depended on this protocol are merged, <strong>the flickering issue on Wayland with NVIDIA GPUs should hopefully be gone for good.</strong></p>
<p>NVIDIA is targeting the 555 driver series for their Explicit Sync support.<strong> The Beta release of the 555 driver is <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland/pull/104#issuecomment-2010292221" target="_blank">expected on May 15th</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beta release is currently targeted for May 15. It will include support for both the Wayland explicit sync protocol for EGL applications and the counterpart X11 explicit sync protocol for GLX and Vulkan X11 applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KDE's Kwin compositor <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin/-/merge_requests/4693" target="_blank">has a patch ready to go</a> as soon as the NVIDIA driver is out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the matching Xwayland and NVidia driver updates are out, most problems with NVidia on Wayland will be gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GNOME's Mutter compositor also has <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/merge_requests/3300" target="_blank">a merge request</a> that seems to be almost-ready.</p>
<p>Additionally, wayland-protocols 1.34 has now been <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2024-March/043537.html" target="_blank">released</a> with these new staging protocols:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> * xdg-toplevel-drag</p>
<p>This protocol enhances regular drag and drop by allowing attaching a toplevel window to a drag. This can be used to implement e.g. detachable toolbars and browser tab drag behavior that can be seen in other platforms.</p>
<p> * xdg-dialog</p>
<p>This protocol allows setting dialog specific hints on a toplevel, more specifically marking them as modal.</p>
<p> * linux-drm-syncobj</p>
<p>This protocol will allow explicit synchronization of buffers using DRM synchronization objects. While being a protocol that is unlikely to be widely used directly by applications and toolkits themselves, it is an important building block for improving Vulkan and OpenGL drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's to a flicker-free Wayland future.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator suyu continues on from yuzu - first release is up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's a new Nintendo Switch emulator named suyu, which has been forked off from the original yuzu before <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/yuzu-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-2-4-million-and-will-entirely-shut-down/" target="_blank">Nintendo shut it down</a>. <em>A brave move, let's see if it pays off. </em></p>
<p>While yuzu had a Patreon campaign, and was pulling in somewhat big numbers, suyu is non-profit and does not accept donations of any kind. So that may help keep it away from Nintendo lawyers. That, and <em>not</em> having a lead developer jokingly post in a Discord about user piracy would help too. The suyu <a href="https://suyu.dev" target="_blank">website</a> is a bit barebones with no documentation, so you're very much on your own with this one for now. </p>
<p>The first <a href="https://gitlab.com/suyu-emu/suyu/-/releases/v0.0.2-master" target="_blank">release</a> is out now with the changes in suyu listed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Full rebrand.</li>
<li>ICNS Icon generation.</li>
<li>Error handling.</li>
<li>Qlaunch initial integration(buggy/requires further testing; requires V17.0.0 firmware or newer).</li>
<li>Gitlab ci for automated builds.</li>
<li>Require all keys to be user provided, along with firmware.</li>
<li>Improved Addons Manager.</li>
<li>Various crash fixes.</li>
<li>Initial work for MacOS support.</li>
<li>Fix for video playback AMD devices.</li>
<li>Enabled more features on AMD proprietary drivers.</li>
<li>Multiplayer API re-implemented.</li>
<li>Removed all telemetry.</li>
<li>New UI options/improvements.</li>
<li>QOL changes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you think Nintendo will attempt to shut this down too? Considering they haven't (yet) gone after <a href="https://ryujinx.org" target="_blank">Ryujinx</a> it may not be all that likely. Will have to wait and see.</p>

      <title>GNOME 46 is out now with experimental variable refresh rate (VRR) support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The release many GNOME fans have been waiting for is here and it's looking really fancy. GNOME 46 available now brings on experimental variable refresh rate (VRR) support. There's masses more of course!</p>
<p>While I'm a KDE Plasma user and fan myself, I'm still impressed by all the features and small touches the GNOME team manage to keep bringing to the table too. Competition is great, even for desktop environments.</p>
<p>Some of what you can expect to see includes performance improvements, bumped up security, rendering improvements for a better looking interface, a new global search feature, a big upgrade to the file manager with better performance and a sleek looking dynamic progress indicator for file operations, support for Microsoft OneDrive in their online accounts system, a new dedicated remote login option, tons of improvements to the system settings app, various accessibility improvements and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Check out their release video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="r_QyRJf3rtQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/69169f6dbf41730f96e616548d646936.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/r_QyRJf3rtQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Nice to see some of the funding from the likes of Sovereign Tech Fund and Igalia be put to good use across various features.</p>
<p>It's pretty safe to say this is looking like one of the best releases of GNOME for a while. Fantastic stuff. I really must resist the urge to desktop-hop because I need to be productive. But — new shiny things are calling.</p>

      <title>Funselektor (art of rally) and Strelka Games (Hell is Others) announce Golden Lap</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Golden Lap is a new minimalistic racing strategy game announced by the developers Funselektor (art of rally) and Strelka Games (Hell is Others).</p>
<p>This is not a racing game where you've got control, instead you'll be managing a team. From the press release: "In this strategy-driven motorsport management game you’ll step into the fashionable shoes of a legend in the making — although this time you’ll stay behind the scenes instead of sliding behind the wheel yourself. Golden Lap offers sleek, minimalistic visuals and an intuitive design as it hands you the reins to your very own iconic racing team during the golden era of open-wheel racing. This is your chance to prove your worth as a strategic mastermind by making pivotal decisions and shaping the destiny of your team to leave your opponents in the dust!"</p>
<p>Check out the first trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="f4AzzhL4ZKc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ed22a470a074a6052ea468d07779add9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/f4AzzhL4ZKc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>No platforms have been announced yet, so it's not clear if it will have Native Linux support like art of rally. I'm sure it will work in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> though if not.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052040/Golden_Lap/" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>DXVK version 2.3.1 released with more efficient shader code generation on NVIDIA GPUs</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Vulkan-based translation layer for Direct3D 9/10/11 used for Wine and Proton has a new release out, and it sounds like a good one if you're an NVIDIA GPU user on Linux.</p>
<p>In the version 2.3.1 <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases/tag/v2.3.1" target="_blank">release notes</a> they said if you have at least the Vulkan Beta driver version 550.40.55 or above and Proton Experimental, DXVK will use <code class="inline-code">VK_NV_raw_access_chains</code> "to allow more efficient shader code generation" which is "intended to close the gap to Windows performance drivers specifically in D3D11 games in GPU-bound scenarios" but not for every game.</p>
<p>There's also various other improvements with the full changelog below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed invalid SPIR-V being generated for Renderdoc internal D3D11 shaders.</li>
<li>Fixed undefined behaviour with out-of-bounds constant buffer loads with dynamic indices.</li>

<li>Reworked the <code class="inline-code">dxgi.syncInterval</code> option to also apply to D3D12 games.</li>
<li>Reverted the use of <code class="inline-code">VK_FORMAT_A8_UNORM</code> due to rendering issues in some games.</li>
<li>D3D9 games will now set the <code class="inline-code">VkApplicationInfo::applicationVersion</code> field to 1.</li>
<li>Reworked how dynamic system memory buffers are copied to the GPU in D3D9 games. (PR <a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3765" target="_blank">#3765</a>)<br/>
This improves performance in games such as <strong>Shank 2</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/3755" target="_blank">#3755</a>), <strong>Flammable Freddy</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/2375" target="_blank">#2375</a>) and <strong>Blood Rayne</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/issues/1828" target="_blank">#1828</a>).</li>
<li>Only enable alpha to coverage when rendering to a multisampled render target in D3D9. (<a href="https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/pull/3815" target="_blank">#3815</a>)<br/>

      <title>Respawn release statement and update on the Apex Legends hacking situation</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/apex-legends-global-series-postponed-due-to-mid-match-hacks/" target="_blank">Recently I reported</a> on Apex Legends pro players getting hacked during the Global Series tournament, and now the developer Respawn Entertainment has released a small statement.</p>
<p>This is after Easy Anti-Cheat washed their hands of it, saying basically it's nothing to do with EAC. There were lots of posts all across social media warning people to stay away from any EAC protected game, even with there being zero evidence it was an EAC problem.</p>
<p>The statement from Respawn was <a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1770285073688137762" target="_blank">posted</a> on X (not even on their Steam page) which reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Sunday, a few professional Apex Legends players accounts were hacked during an ALGS event.</p>
<p>Game and player security are our highest priorities, which is why we paused the competition to address the issue immediately.</p>
<p>Our team have deployed the first of a layered series of updates to protect the Apex Legends player community and create a secure experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8950347191710930919gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/8950347191710930919gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>I've verified that as of this update, it does still work just fine on Linux. So for now there should be no problems playing it on Steam Deck and Desktop Linux. Still hoping they don't add in EA AntiCheat, which blocks Linux, but you're good for now.</p>
<p>Apex Legends is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Stardew Valley 1.6 is out now - player count on Steam explodes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ConcernedApe has released the huge Stardew Valley 1.6 update now, and it's absolutely crammed full of new content. Time to get farming again?</p>
<p>The developer said it adds new content but focuses mainly on the valley but there's additions and improvements to almost all areas of the game. Plus various quality of life features, and bug fixes. This has caused a huge surge on Steam, with Stardew seeing a new all-time peak player count of 146,159 in the early hours of this morning. The previous all time peak of 94,879 was back in January 2021 (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/413150/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). Before this update, it was still regularly seeing a peak player count above 40,000 every single day. The staying power of Stardew is simply incredible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13920941701710930194gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>The non-spoiler additions in v1.6 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new major festival.</li>
<li>Two new mini festivals.</li>
<li>A new environmental event.</li>
<li>Hundreds of new lines of dialogue.</li>
<li>A new end-game skill system.</li>
<li>New crops, crafting items, furniture, and more.</li>
<li>A new farm type: Meadowlands Farm.</li>
<li>Multiple pets.</li>
<li>You can now have up to 8 players on PC.</li>
<li>Performance improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>So much more is included, that I won't spoil directly, but you can spoil yourself by reading through the rather lengthy patch notes on the <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-update-full-changelog/" target="_blank">official website</a>. Scrolling through it myself, there really is a surprising amount of additions!</p>
<p>Stardew Valley has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER releases May 16th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER, the sequel to 2064: Read Only Memories finally has a release date as you'll be able to get your hands on it on May 16th.</p>
<p>More about it: "Take on the role of ES88, a young esper employed by MINERVA, a powerful organization specializing in information science, neurotechnology, and extrasensory phenomena. She has been tasked with tracking down Golden Butterfly, a mysterious psychic entity hiding in and fragmenting the memories of Neo-San Francisco's citizens. Who are they? Why are they doing this? And how will you stop them?"</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-ljJbTUUfBA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1bfd42f9d58734f780b84ab879d6f2e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-ljJbTUUfBA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As far as I know it's still having Native Linux support like the first game, and clearly lists it on Steam, although the demo is only available for macOS and Windows. The developer hasn't replied to my email about it. If they drop Native Linux support, it should at least run well in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Sequel to 2064: Read Only Memories</strong> - The long-awaited sequel to 2064: Read Only Memories takes you back to Neo-San Francisco in an all-new "psy-fi" adventure. Meet new inhabitants and reconnect with old favorites from the world of Read Only Memories.</li>
<li><strong>A Mystery in Memories</strong> - Take on the the role of newly-qualified ESPer, ES88, to track down the mysterious Golden Butterfly. Work with the Neurodiver, ES88's psychic sidekick, to dive into people's minds and repair their wrecked recollections.</li>
<li><strong>Anime-inspired Pixel Art</strong> - Immerse yourself in the beautiful pixel art world that takes you around Neo-SF, the halls of the secretive Minerva agency, and within the depths of people's memories.</li>
<li><strong>A Cast to Remember</strong> - Beautifully drawn and animated characters are brought to life with superb voice-acting. New heroes and villains are joined by old favorites Lexi Rivers, Turing, and TOMCAT from 2064: Read Only Memories.</li>
<li><strong>Retro Fm Synth Music</strong> - Indulge your senses in the sharp and glossy retro tones of Neo-SF's FM synth soundscape as you dive deep into people's minds to track down the cunning Golden Butterfly.</li>

      <title>chiaki4deck PlayStation to Steam Deck streaming app v1.6.4 adds a few useful options</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>chiaki4deck recently put up another small update, to add in a couple of new options that sound quite useful for those of you streaming a PlayStation to your Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Here's what's new in version 1.6.4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adds create Steam Shortcut option for Linux and Mac</li>
<li>Allow setting console pin for console in settings</li>
<li>Add window type option in settings (fullscreen, stretch, zoom)</li>
<li>Fix issue causing extra blank ip manual console added when registering non-manual console</li>
<li>Add option to adjust when Wifi connection symbol appears based on % of dropped packets in 200ms interval</li>
</ul>
<p>There's an easy to use AppImage download available on the release notes on <a href="https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/releases/tag/v1.6.4" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Have you been using chiaki4deck? How's it looking now? I only have a rather old and dusty PS4, so I don't really have any need for it myself but I can imagine in a busier household with people hogging the TV this could be great to use.</p>

      <title>GOG team up with Amazon Luna for cloud gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>GOG have <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/more-ways-to-play-your-gog-games-were-teaming-up-with-luna-cloud-streaming-service/" target="_blank">announced</a> that they're teaming up with <a href="https://luna.amazon.co.uk" target="_blank">Amazon Luna</a>, to bring your existing GOG games over to their cloud gaming service.</p>
<p>Amazon Luna is currently available across the USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. It runs on Linux too, although it will likely give you a browser warning, it will still let you actually play games on Luna if you're using a Chrome based browser. </p>
<p>All you'll need is to own your games on GOG, and any that Amazon have on Luna will be yours to play in the cloud too on any compatible device. Seems like a great deal really. GOG also said you'll be able to buy games on Luna through GOG too, and they will stick in your GOG library. So really, this is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>They haven't given a public date yet on exactly when it will be live, only noting they will "share more updates about our collaboration in the future, and be sure that whether you enjoy timeless classics or modern hits, you’ll find such GOG titles on Luna soon".</p>

      <title>Knock knock. Who&#39;s there? More scam apps on Canonical&#39;s Snap Store!</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>No this isn't a joke, sadly. Canonical once again have an issue with scam apps appearing on the Snap Store, which is becoming a repeating problem. I wrote about this before <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/snap-store-from-canonical-ubuntu-hit-with-another-crypto-scam-app/" target="_blank">in February</a>, and again <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/10/snap-store-from-canonical-hit-with-malicious-apps/" target="_blank">previously in October 2023</a> and here we go again.</p>
<p>After the last issue, Canonical seemed to be slowly moving on the subject, with discussions being opened on their Discourse forum to chat about implementing more checks. So they uh, might want to speed up actually checking on app publishers.</p>
<p>Alan Pope has <a href="https://popey.com/blog/2024/03/exodus-wallet-part-three/" target="_blank">a great blog post</a> about the issue, talking about how another <em>ten</em> scam crypto wallet apps appeared from "digisafe00000". They were all removed, but uh, guess what? They're back again under a different publisher name this time it's "codeshield0x0000".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16002331521710845009gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16002331521710845009gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>A weirdly named publisher putting up 10 crypto wallet apps? You know, if there was proper human review here, someone might have actually thought "hey this is a bit odd, maybe I should do a little digging first?".</p>
<p>Since they're on the Snap Store, they will also show up in the Ubuntu Software app, which is quite a problem.</p>
<p>Pope dives into one of the apps in the blog post, noting the create an account function (obviously) doesn't work, since they just want you to "log in" with your current wallet details so they can poach it. As Pope says "It’s trivially easy to publish scammy applications like this in the Canonical Snap Store, and for them to go unnoticed." and it seems it really is. So right now if you want to scam users on Ubuntu — just publish a Snap of something!</p>
<p>Really not a good look for Canonical and Ubuntu. They need to get moving on this <strong>repeating</strong> problem.</p>

      <title>Valve tweaks WWE 2K24 for AMD GPUs like Steam Deck, looking into Red Alert 2 issues</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>WWE 2K24 released recently and at least for those with an AMD GPU (like the Steam Deck) there were various graphical issues, but it should now work better. Plus, Valve are looking into issues with Red Alert 2 in Proton.</p>
<p>For WWE 2K24, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1769853844559949928" target="_blank">posted</a> on X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A mitigation fix has just been deployed for a graphics corruption issue in WWE2K24 and will be automatically deployed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14191888681710843898gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14191888681710843898gol1.jpg"/></a>Pictured - WWE 2K24</em></p>
<p>I had to do a little searching around to figure out what was actually done, as it turns out they've set the "RADV_DEBUG=nodcc" Mesa environment variable by default which disables Delta Color Compression (DCC) on images. So hopefully that game should play better now.</p>
<p>Recently the Command &amp; Conquer The Ultimate Collection<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/command-conquer-the-ultimate-collection-launched-on-steam-and-other-classics/" target="_blank"> also released on Steam</a> but multiple titles in it have problems running on Linux with Proton. For Red Alert 2 issues in Proton in reply to a user on X Griffais <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1769855852973113522" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that the blank screen for a main menu is "currently being investigated".</p>

      <title>Steam Families announced with parental controls, no more library locking</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has finally done it! They've overhauled Steam Family Sharing with the new Steam Families set of features now <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4149575031735702628" target="_blank">available in Beta</a> and it fixes the most annoying issue with it.</p>
<p>Currently, with Steam Family Sharing, if one person is playing a game your whole library is locked. You can either boot them off, or wait. Now, that's changed. As long as you're playing different games - it's all good. Obviously if other members in your Family Group have a copy, multiple people can play the same game at the same time.</p>
<p>This new Steam Families replaces both Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View, putting everything under one banner and this introduces new features too. These new additions include new parental controls so you can set proper limits now including:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allow access to appropriate games.</li>
<li>Restrict access to the Steam Store, Community or Friends Chat.</li>
<li>Set playtime limits (hourly/daily).</li>
<li>View playtime reports.</li>
<li>Approve or deny requests from child accounts for additional playtime or feature access (temporary or permanent).</li>
<li>Recover a child's account if they lost their password.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Children can also request purchases for you to approve or deny!</p>
<p>Valve also clarified that if someone in your group got banned using your copy, <em>you</em> will <em>also</em> be banned.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4149575031735702628" target="_blank">full announcement on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>It took a long time for Valve to do this, many features here people have been requesting for a long time. Glad to see it land, at least in Beta for now. It's quite likely the Steam Deck gave Valve a little extra push to do it, as it has been a source of complaints there too. But as we've seen time and time again, Valve do react to feedback and constantly improve.</p>

      <title>Playtron plan to launch PlaytronOS, a Linux-based system for gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 13:34 UTC, 19/03/24</strong>: One of the videos Playtron supplied to The Verge, showcasing some tech used on mobile in the article linked below, wasn't even their own and was taken uncredited from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH0E0Un2NPY&amp;lc=UgzW8RxoJ1RM5NVsgyV4AaABAg" target="_blank">another</a> person on YouTube, who hit them with a copyright claim and had it taken down. Not a good look.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Playtron have teased their PlaytronOS, taking aim at the gaming space to compete with SteamOS with a Linux-powered system. Could be exciting times ahead.</p>
<p>They've managed to pull in developers from ChimeraOS, Box64, Heroic Games Launcher and more so they have some people involved who certainly know their stuff when it comes to Linux gaming. Their CEO is also Kirt McMaster, a name some might recognise from Cyanogen. Many others are involved who have developer experience previously from the likes of Google, Amazon, Red Hat, Meta, Samsung, SEGA and more. So they've built up quite an experienced team overall.</p>
<p>Unlike SteamOS, it's <em>not</em> going to be so tied to the Steam store. Although you <em>can</em> install pretty much anything in the SteamOS Desktop Mode, the Steam Deck is obviously a Steam-first device. Playtron saying it's "Locked to the Valveverse" is simply <em>false</em> though. Playtron say PlaytronOS aims to be "compatible with every game store" and to expect "many 3rd party integrations to come". </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11888282231710775231gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11888282231710775231gol1.png"/></a>Pictured - device mock-up from the PLAYTRON website.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>PlaytronOS plans to supports both ARM and X86 based PC architectures. And they say to expect "Playtron on Laptops &amp; PCs, TVs, XR and in Car in the coming years", so they're certainly aiming high with it. Potentially impossibly too high? Their current plan is to launch PlaytronOS for Steam Deck and other handheld gaming PCs "later this year" and that "Playtron 1st hand held PCs coming soon" — so we can expect to see some future handhelds launch with PlaytronOS.</p>
<p>Later this year they also plan some sort of "direct publishing" option for game developers.</p>
<p>Sean Hollister of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24090470/playtron-gaming-os-linux-handhelds-exclusive" target="_blank">The Verge</a> got an early look for a bit more info, and Hollister also noted Valve actually told them that they're finally working to bring SteamOS to more handhelds.</p>
<p>While exciting, they have a <em>huge</em> uphill battle here and will no doubt have to do a <strong>lot</strong> of convincing when it comes to hardware vendors to actually use it. So while exciting, right now it doesn't mean too much - especially until we actually see a first initial release (and even better - a hardware vendor actually releasing with it). One to keep a close eye on because it could be a game changer, but it could just as easily fizzle out.</p>
<p>More on <a href="https://www.playtron.one" target="_blank">the website</a>. They're also at GDC this year.</p>
<p>It's pretty clear at this point that the Steam Deck with SteamOS has really begun to change the gaming world. While there were obviously other handheld gaming PC vendors before, Valve really lit a fire didn't they. </p>

      <title>Steam now has over 100,000 games listed</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There really are a <em>lot</em> of games, and with more releasing every year, Steam has gotten rather large as a platform with it now listing over 100,000 games.</p>
<p>When you do a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?category1=998&amp;ndl=1&amp;ignore_preferences=1" target="_blank">search</a> specifically just for games on Steam the number Valve now give is 100,392, although on <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5BappType%5D%5B0%5D=Game" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> that number is 104,727 as they still show games that were unlisted (which you can still download if you purchased them). That's kind of ridiculous isn't it?</p>
<p>Going by the last few noted release years on SteamDB:</p>
<ul>
<li>2024 - 4,599</li>
<li>2023 - 14,337</li>
<li>2022 - 12,087</li>
<li>2021 - 10,994</li>
<li>2020 - 9,371</li>
<li>2019 - 7,669</li>
<li>2018 - 7,901</li>
<li>2017 - 6,106</li>
<li>2016 - 4,272</li>
</ul>
<p>How are developers supposed to get attention when there's tens of thousands of games being released on Steam each year now? When the release lists on Steam are constantly moving, like what happened with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/378690/Potions_A_Curious_Tale/" target="_blank">Potions: A Curious Tale</a>, with it being bumped right down the list due to various <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/command-conquer-the-ultimate-collection-launched-on-steam-and-other-classics/" target="_blank">classic EA games being released</a> all in one go with the developer <a href="https://twitter.com/RikuKat/status/1766261499574776089" target="_blank">posting</a> about it on X. A little brutal perhaps, but then relying on showing up in a list like that on Steam hasn't been the best idea for a long time.</p>
<p>I remember in earlier years, being able to quite easily follow the Steam overall news list every day, quite literally impossible to do so now.</p>
<p>Even with Steam constantly adding games there's still plenty finding success though. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-hits-1-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> just hit 1 million, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/palworld-has-now-sold-over-15-million-copies-on-steam/" target="_blank">Palworld</a> hit 15 million, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/last-epoch-crosses-1-million-early-access-sales-new-trailer-and-pre-order-bonuses/" target="_blank">Last Epoch</a> hit 1 million, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/11/core-keeper-10-planned-for-summer-2024-dev-says-its-had-2-million-downloads/" target="_blank">Core Keeper</a> around 2 million, <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/01/railway-network-designer-rail-route-releases-february-22nd-and-over-100k-copies-sold/" target="_blank">Rail Route</a> hit 100k and the list goes on and on that's just cherry-picking a few I've covered directly. There are plenty of ongoing success stories. So clearly some developers are doing well.</p>
<p>This brings me to an opinion piece by GamesIndustry.biz titled "<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/discoverability-is-a-problem-that-will-never-be-solved-opinion" target="_blank">Discoverability is a problem that will never be solved</a>", and it really does bring up some interesting questions. Worth a read! It also touches on the issue with Potions: A Curious Tale noted above. As Rob Fahey writes, "Discoverability is a battle that never ends", and Fahey is right. Valve do often tweak Steam, add new features and new ways to find games - but it won't ever end, and it will only get more complicated as more people make and release games seeing potential buyer attention spread ever-thinner.</p>
<p>I don't have any answer of course, I'm not some marketing guru, but every platform will end up with this problem. GOG, Epic Games and so on. The more they add, the more difficult it will be for future releases. PR teams and marketing folks certainly have their work cut out for them. Looking at my own inbox, I get easily between 50-100 emails weekly, some days are absolutely crazy with announcements all for games wanting some kind of attention.</p>

      <title>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars remaster hits over £400k on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars is getting a big fancy remaster in Broken Sword: Reforged, and it's currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter by Revolution Software. It will have full Linux support too, as confirmed by the developer.</p>
<p>Somehow I entirely missed the campaign had actually launched, with only 11 days left to go. Seems plenty of people are excited to replay one of the best point and click adventures around, in full 4K with the Kickstarter campaign noting a £50,000 base goal and it's currently on £404,303.</p>
<p>You can pledge to get a digital code (GOG / Steam), or go for two different special Collector's Edition Boxes that include things like a figurine, a USB-C key, a manuscript, game manual and so on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="AC-C6giohUQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/82c1a69620f02b5e512d19791ecf4e1f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/AC-C6giohUQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, they <em>are</em> using AI for the remaster. Here's what they said about their use of AI for it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What parts of your project will use AI generated content? Please be as specific as possible.</strong></p>
<p>Disclaimer: All training data comes from within Revolution Software. We wanted to use tools that were trained exclusively on our own data, and so we opted to write our own bespoke program in collaboration with The University Of York. Outputs from this tool have received significant intervention by our art team, ensuring that the final product receives the same level of attention to detail as any other artwork befitting the polished standards of a Broken Sword game.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have the consent of owners of the works that were (or will be) used to produce the AI generated portion of your projects? Please explain.</strong></p>
<p>Yes - the training data is comprised of sprites drawn by our animators.</p>

      <title>The Mirror aims to be a Roblox &amp; UEFN alternative and now it&#39;s open source</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Roblox and the Unreal Editor for Fortnite sure are popular, but you know what would be better? An open source project, where creators can actually own what they make rather than being attached to Roblox and Fortnite. The Mirror wants to change that.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11107317271710765186gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11107317271710765186gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the GitHub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Akin to "Figma" for game development, The Mirror is both tool and editor that let's you edit a game with friends in real-time. It's intended use can be extended because you have the source code. It can be used as a complete game base, to build what you want on top, you can use this to accelerate your game, get it built and released. This saves you time: imagine not having to write pesky things like infrastructure, backend code, asset management, and various systems from scratch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The extra fun part? It's made with <a href="https://godotengine.org" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>!</p>
<p>Considering that <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/game-over-for-roblox-on-linux-steam-deck-as-its-now-blocked/" target="_blank">Roblox recently blocked Wine+Linux</a>, and Fortnite has never worked on Linux, this is interesting. Hopefully people will actually take a look into it and give it a go, as a platform like this is only as good as the people building experiences for it.</p>
<p>And now, The Mirror itself has been made open source and you can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/the-mirror-gdp/the-mirror" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (MIT License). The app is available to download <a href="https://themirrorgdp.itch.io/the-mirror" target="_blank">via itch.io</a> for Linux and Windows.</p>

      <title>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor hits 1 million copies sold</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor from Funday Games and Ghost Ship Publishing has only been out for just over a month in Early Access, and it's already crossed over the 1 million mark.</p>
<p>Seriously impressive stuff, merging the idea of Vampire Survivors with the Deep Rock Galactic setting - it was bound to sell well, but I didn't think it would sell so much so quickly. In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/6273023611533844316" target="_blank">announcement</a> the developers said a first content update was due out this week too so it will be fun to see what they're going to add into the game, to keep players wanting to come back for more.</p>
<p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is rated Steam Deck Verified and works great on Desktop Linux with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>.</p>
<p>The developer also released a video of some of their favourite clips from content creators:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i2VblOdZ25I"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d43bbc72fa9c901b036e3ac764953f6c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i2VblOdZ25I" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Have you been playing it? What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments. It's on my list to eventually play the full game because the demo was awesome.</p>
<p>Even with massive competition, and ever more games releasing on Steam, we're seeing a lot of early success stories like this lately. Heck, even Stardew Valley sales seem to be <em>speeding up</em> with it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/stardew-valley-v16-confirmed-to-release-in-march-hits-over-30-million-sales/" target="_blank">hitting 30 million</a> recently. Steam isn't just growing in games though, the player counts have been rocketing upwards too with Steam just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-breaking-records-again-hitting-over-36-million-players-online/" target="_blank">crossing 36 million online only recently</a>.</p>

      <title>Apex Legends Global Series postponed due to mid-match hacks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Update 10:09 UTC, 19/03/24 — the official EOS Status account on X <a href="https://twitter.com/EOSStatus/status/1769841455193866367" target="_blank">posted</a> this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have investigated recent reports of a potential RCE issue in Apex Legends, which we have confirmed to be unrelated to Easy Anti-Cheat. We are confident THERE IS NO RCE vulnerability within EAC being exploited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Update 16:28 UTC, 18/03/24 — Easy Anti-Cheat release a <a href="https://twitter.com/TeddyEAC/status/1769725032047972566" target="_blank">statement</a> on X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have investigated recent reports of a potential RCE issue within Easy Anti-Cheat. At this time - we are confident that there is no RCE vulnerability within EAC being exploited. We will continue to work closely with our partners for any follow up support needed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>So it's likely then that the issue is within Apex Legends directly. Will update when we have more info.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Good Morning. Some interesting industry news for you here, as it seems Apex Legends has something of a hacker problem right now that has even messed up the Global Series esport tournament.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApexEsports/status/1769527345176621110" target="_blank">Announced</a> by the official Apex Legends Esports account on X they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the competitive integrity of this series being compromised, we have made the decision to postpone the NA finals at this time. We will share more information soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a few videos going around (<a href="https://twitter.com/Apryze_/status/1769516394138206277" target="_blank">#1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ImperialHal/status/1769525888721313920" target="_blank">#2</a>)  showing mid-match cheats suddenly happening to pro players during the tournament. <a href="https://twitter.com/AntiCheatPD/status/1769532511057584576" target="_blank">According</a> to the Anti-Cheat Police Department account on X (a volunteer group):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PSA: There is currently an RCE exploit being abused in <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex" target="_blank">@PlayApex</a>. It is unsure whether it comes from the game or the actual anti-cheat (<a href="https://twitter.com/TeddyEAC" target="_blank">@TeddyEAC</a>). I would advise against playing any games protected by EAC or any EA titles once they have fixed this or can comment. Currently, the RCE is being abused to inject cheats into streamers machines, which means they have the capabilities to do whatever, like installing ransomware software locking up your entire PC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though Linux is quite different to Windows, it's probably still best to avoid Apex Legends until the issue is resolved. While a lot of cheats and most malware / ransomware is designed for Windows - it still pays to be careful.</p>
<p>At time of writing neither EA nor Respawn have put up a statement on it.</p>
<p>This could end up being a problem for Linux and Steam Deck players too. Currently Apex Legends uses Easy Anti-Cheat, which clearly isn't defending against these attacks. We've seen other EA published titles move over to EA AntiCheat, which blocks Linux, so hopefully EAC will combat it and we don't get left with another broken game that moves over to EA's own tech for it.</p>

      <title>Steam breaking records again hitting over 36 million players online</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You all sure love your gaming huh? Valve has seen Steam repeatedly break records recently and yet again, another weekend saw another surge of players.</p>
<p>In early March <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-smashes-its-peak-players-online-record-to-over-34-million/" target="_blank">Steam first crossed 34 million</a> online, then <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/03/steam-broke-another-record-with-over-35-million-people-online/" target="_blank">a week later 35 million</a>, and now here we are another week later seeing a peak of 36,354,393 people online (from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>). At the time 11,576,186 players were actually in-game too.</p>
<p>Over the last 24 hours the top games for peak players were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Strike 2</li>
<li>Dota 2</li>
<li>PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS</li>
<li>Apex Legends</li>
<li>HELLDIVERS 2</li>
<li>NARAKA: BLADEPOINT</li>
</ul>
<p>One surprising game I saw rise up recently is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2670630/Supermarket_Simulator/" target="_blank">Supermarket Simulator</a> (launched February 20th), which hit a peak of 51,363 players on Sunday. You just never know what's going to be suddenly popular any more. </p>
<p>What do you think is causing such massive surges recently?</p>

      <title>VKD3D-Proton version 2.12 adds NVIDIA Reflex support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The project that implements Direct3D 12 on top of Vulkan, VKD3D-Proton, has <a href="https://github.com/HansKristian-Work/vkd3d-proton/releases/tag/v2.12" target="_blank">version 2.12</a> out now bringing with it more new features like NVIDIA Reflex support! Technology like VKD3D-Proton is used directly by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a>, to enable Windows games to run on Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement support for NVIDIA Reflex through <code class="inline-code">VK_NV_low_latency2</code>. Thanks to NVIDIA for contributing implementation.</li>
<li>Implement D3D12 render pass API (tier 0).</li>
<li>Implement ID3D12DeviceRemovedExtendedDataSettings stubs. Fixes some games that rely on this existing.</li>
<li>Implement <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_device_fault</code>. Makes it possible to grab fault information and vendor binary if supported.</li>
<li>Implement <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_swapchain_maintenance1</code>
<ul>
<li>Allows seamless transition between V-Sync and tearing present modes without stutter.</li>
<li>Implemented on both Mesa and NV drivers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Expose Shader Model 6.7 by default if<br/>
<code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_shader_maximal_reconvergence</code> and <code class="inline-code">VK_KHR_shader_quad_control</code> are supported.</li>
<li>Add optimized descriptor copy path on Intel Arc GPUs that support <code class="inline-code">VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer</code></li>
<li>Implement fallback for compute shader derivatives on NVIDIA Pascal and older GPUs. Allows exposing Shader Model 6.7 by default on Pascal as well (albeit with some known cases where it does not work). The workaround is expected to work with any known use of SM 6.6 compute derivatives in the wild.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also some game fixes for Atlas Fallen, Warhammer: Darktide, Resident Evil 4, multiple Unreal Engine 5 games, World of Warcraft and disabling of RT by default in Persona 3 Reload on Steam Deck.</p>

      <title>Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate now available for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally a Flash browser game from around 2008, Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate is a remastered and expanded quirky classic-style point and click adventure. And now it has an official Linux port too done by <a href="https://twitter.com/flibitijibibo/status/1768331863809028360" target="_blank">Ethan Lee</a>.</p>
<p>More about it: "Join Dangeresque, the world's greatest private eye/crooked cop, as he puzzles his way through 3 bite-sized roomisodes in this classic-style point and click adventure.</p>
<p>Each room is a separate, standalone mini-adventure with its own puzzles to solve, inventory items to collect, and other characters to interact with.</p>
<p>Roomisode 1: Learn to fake-solve a cold case to prevent The Chief from sending you to jail!<br/>
Roomisode 2: Team up with Renaldo to deal with car troubles at a seedy intersection!<br/>
Roomisode 3: Take a side-gig doing security consulting for Perducci!"</p>
<p>Official trailer:</p>

<p>The developer even <a href="https://twitter.com/StrongBadActual/status/1768323187605913836" target="_blank">posted</a> up a rather fun and silly special trailer for the Linux version on X, which you can watch below for those who find it easier to view:</p>

      <title>System76 refresh the Adder WS laptop, plus COSMIC desktop Alpha in May</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some exciting news for System76 fans here as not only have they now released the powerful refresh of the Adder WS laptop, but their COSMIC desktop environment is also approaching an Alpha release.</p>
<p>First up, the Adder WS, what System76 call their "career-starter of a laptop" with a HX-class Intel i9 CPU (now 14th Gen), NVIDIA 40 Series graphics, DDR5 RAM and PCIe 4.0 NVMe storage and Pop!_OS preinstalled. Starting at $1,749 it should cover pretty much everything you could need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU.</li>
<li>Up to NVIDIA RTX 4070 graphics, RTX 4050 base model.</li>
<li>Up to 96GB RAM, 16GB DDR5 base model.</li>
<li>1080p matte display, 144Hz refresh rate.</li>
<li>Up to 12TB storage, 500GB PCIe4 M.2 SSD base model.</li>
<li>2 USB-A, 2 USB-C, HDMI, and headset jack.</li>
</ul>
<p>See more on the <a href="https://system76.com/laptops/adder" target="_blank">System76 store</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally they announced in a <a href="https://blog.system76.com/post/cosmic-more-alpha-more-fun" target="_blank">blog post</a> that their COSMIC desktop now has an Alpha version due sometime in late May, after missing their initial plan for the end of Q1 and two alpha releases are currently planned. They're finishing up their Terminal and Text Editor, with significant progress on Files and the Application Store also done. </p>
<p>Font rendering quality was also improved, especially for dark text on a light background which they said is "thanks to the upstream iced toolkit’s new <a href="https://github.com/iced-rs/iced/pull/1888" target="_blank">color management</a>" (iced is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust) and that "The web-colors feature uses the same methods to render colors as web browsers":</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18813225121710513928gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18813225121710513928gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>Pictured: Image comparing font rendering quality in light mode between COSMIC Edit with (right) and without (left) iced's web-colors color management feature.</em></p>
<p>Numerous parts of COSMIC are finished including hybrid graphics support, minimize and restore, wallpapers, a tiling applet, input device settings and so on. Some other new recent additions include theming support for dark mode, light mode and user-configured accent colours.</p>
<p>The full release of the COSMIC desktop is still on target for later this year along with Pop!_OS 24.04.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>KONAMI are continuing to put out the fires from the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol 1 release on Steam, with v1.5.0 out now for MGS 1, 2 and 3. It's nice to see they do keep improving them, rather than just leaving them in the state they were. Now they should be much more playable than before.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5264658151710510878gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5264658151710510878gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131630/view/4128183566030086781" target="_blank">changes</a> below are for MGS 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in which certain cutscenes stopped playing.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which analog input did not work as intended.</li>
<li>Removed the "Download" option from the main menu.</li>
<li>Changed it so that Window Mode settings cannot be altered on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Fixed some other minor issues.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131640/view/4136064865397172216" target="_blank">Changes</a> for MGS 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added pause menu - Audio settings, screen settings, the online manual, resetting the game, and returning to the main menu can now be accessed via the pause menu.</li>
<li>Fixed a portion of in-game text.</li>
<li>Added Steam Input support.</li>
<li>Fixed some other minor issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131650/view/4140568465023848789" target="_blank">changes</a> for MGS 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added "ADDITIONAL SETTINGS" feature - Audio options, screen options, mouse sensitivity options, the online manual, and returning to the main menu can be accessed via "ADDITIONAL SETTINGS" within the Options menu.</li>
<li>Added "MOUSE SENSITIVITY" options - Mouse sensitivity can be adjusted via the Additional Settings menu.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a portion of character textures were displayed at a low resolution.</li>
<li>Fixed a portion of in-game text.</li>
<li>Added Steam Input support.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where inputs via the keyboard were registered in-game even while the Alt key was held down.</li>
<li>Fixed some other minor issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>One issue that did come was analog input in MGS 1 not working as intended, which they say they have also now fixed. However, you may need to verify the game files to ensure you've got the correct controller configuration available. More info on ensuring you've got the right config in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2131630/view/5921742839581758119" target="_blank">this Steam post</a>.</p>

      <title>Hilarious physics-platformer Mosa Lina has a Director&#39;s Cut update - dev passed the torch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Mosa Lina is one of my little favourites from last year, a physics-platformer gem that's just completely ridiculous. The original developer has given it a Director's Cut update and has passed the torch to another to continue it on.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2477090/view/6501581293006803431" target="_blank">Steam post</a> the original developer, Stuffed Wombat, they noted a few things were removed by default they weren't happy with (but can be turned on again in the options). They also did a rework of the settings to make them work better. This update was <em>supposed</em> to add content, as they originally thought Mosa Lina was "perfect for a live-service kind of development" but they ran out of energy for it as they were "deeply exhausted".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7313063471710503046gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7313063471710503046gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The good news is that it's not the end. The torch has been passed onto Rollin’Barrel who did the Level Editor, Steam Workshop, Button Remapping, Linux and macOS builds and more. So it seems there may yet be more to come for Mosa Lina, just the original developer is taking a deserved rest now. Rollin’Barrel also "made the new Menu that’s the cornerstone of this Update".</p>
<p>Other patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Gungun is heavier and bounces.</li>
<li>Menu system supports Submenus.</li>
<li>Settings are now saved between sessions.</li>
<li>Credits don't repeat untill exhausted.</li>
<li>More dynamic Sound &amp; Music settings.</li>
<li>Mouse aiming is now enabled through the settings.</li>
<li>Keyboard button remapping can now also be accessed throught the settings.</li>
<li>Background rotation can now be disabled in the settings.</li>
<li>Random Fullscreen disabled.</li>
<li>Director's cut can be disabled in the settings (Adding Backflip, Worm, Turtle, etc back into the game).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out my original video on the game:</p>

<p>It has Native Linux support and Valve rated it Steam Deck Playable.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477090/Mosa_Lina/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. </p>
