      <title>Get a free copy of Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition with Prime Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Subscribe to Amazon Prime? Well you can get a free copy of Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition thanks to their partnership with <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a>.</p>
<p>A good time to pick it up too considering Beamdog are still many years later still upgrading the game. Just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/many-years-later-neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition-is-still-getting-better/" target="_blank">recently</a> it had an update adding in a new cartoon shader and lots of optimizations. It's still going strong! It has a Native Linux version available, that Beamdog have supported well too.</p>
<p>How to claim it? Go to <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a>, login with your Amazon account and you'll see it in the list. You'll also need a GOG account as well of course. You have until July 19th to claim it. Since you'll be getting a copy on GOG, you don't need to keep your Prime subscription active - it's yours to keep.</p>
<p>If you also want an easy way to install GOG games on Linux, check out <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic</a> or <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a>. Both work great on desktop Linux and Steam Deck and just make setting up games from GOG much simpler overall.</p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>According to an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1647730/view/6488045762499366518?l=english" target="_blank">official update</a> posted on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1647730/Zool_Redimensioned/" target="_blank">Zool Redimensioned</a>, the 2021 reimagining of the 1992 platformer Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension, has now been granted Steam Deck Verified status.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The game already had <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1647730" target="_blank">a Gold rating on ProtonDB</a> and runs well on desktop Linux, but it's nice to see that extra bit of assurance that it works as it should on the Deck.</p>
<p>There was also an update in May which added three local multiplayer mini-games, which should be a good fit for the Steam Deck Dock!</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>

While they recently <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/overkill-drops-linux-support-for-payday-2/" target="_blank">removed</a> the Native Linux version, they have given a statement on their<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/payday-2-devs-to-ensure-it-works-with-proton-on-linux-and-steam-deck/" target="_blank"> plans to support it in Proton</a>. In my own testing - it did work perfectly with Proton!</p>
<p>In this bundle you can select to get just PAYDAY 2 or PAYDAY 2 + DLC across a 36, 50 or 64 item bundle. Seems like quite the steal to me overall.</p>

      <title>New Beta for Valheim adds in world modifiers letting you customize your game</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's here in Beta! A big upgrade for Valheim to let you change how you can play it, so here's a run over what's new and improved. This was teased recently and comes after a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/valheim-gets-upgraded-to-improve-performance-and-fix-major-bugs/" target="_blank">stable update that improved performance</a>.</p>
<p>When you go to start a game, you now have access to World Modifiers where you can change various difficulty options. This includes no-cost building, passive enemies, amount of raids, death penalty, combat difficulty and more. So for people who want it much easier and close to a creative mode - you can now do it. Want it to be even more difficult? You can do that too.</p>

<p>This should make the game a whole lot more accessible for many different types of players, great to see. Hopefully it won't be too long before it's rolled out for everyone.</p>

      <title>Steam UI scaling should work even better in the latest Beta</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Having Steam UI scaling issues? You may want to have a look at the Steam Client Beta that was released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6627657351330751106" target="_blank">June 15th</a> and see how you get on. Valve are constantly updating the Beta, and they only just <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-overhauled-new-overlay-steam-deck-big-stable-update/" target="_blank">launched a major update</a> with the new Steam Overlay but they're right back to it on the Beta with fresh upgrades and fixes.</p>
<p>For the Linux client here's what they've added:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Improved scaling for users running gnome.</li>
<li>Added an env var based override for scaling settings STEAM_FORCE_DESKTOPUI_SCALING=.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare crash when rendering an invalid texture.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented multiple DualShock 4 controllers from being connected at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So to use the env var, you could just run <code class="inline-code">STEAM_FORCE_DESKTOPUI_SCALING=1.5 steam</code> and have it bigger. Set it to whatever you want. As example here's how it would normally look on my 1440p monitor:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11588336111686912928gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11588336111686912928gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then with 1.5 scaling forced:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4488011631686912947gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4488011631686912947gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And then with 2.0 forced scaling:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20842370191686912977gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20842370191686912977gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Seems to work really nicely, and you can set it to exactly what you want. Nice to see Valve put some more attention into this, as it can really help at different resolutions and for people with vision issues.</p>

      <title>Soulstone Survivors a great Vampire Survivor-like has a huge skill tree upgrade</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Soulstone Survivors is one of my favourite games in the spirit of Vampire Survivors, and it just got a lot bigger with the new Path of Ascension upgrade. While similar to VS in basic gameplay mechanics and the loop, it expanded on the idea in a few ways with more skill-based gameplay.</p>
<p>More about it: "Soulstone Survivors is an action roguelite where you slay hordes of foes and face titanic bosses while learning powerful skills to enhance your character. Play as a Void Hunter, and with the spoils of every match craft weapons, unlock new characters, upgrade your skill tree and equip new runes, all in your quest for godlike powers. With deep RPG mechanics intertwined with Roguelite elements, Soulstone Survivors offers a condensed, yet deep Action RPG experience"</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17081913591686911933gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17081913591686911933gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The latest upgrade to the game in Path of Ascension gives you a massively expanded skill tree with character-specific nodes to unlock, with lots of new types of effects and over 200 new nodes to progress through for the Barbarian, Pyromancer, Hound Master, Spellblade, Arcane Weaver, Sentinel, and Paladin. Other characters will get the same treatment in a future update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6378639671686911988gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6378639671686911988gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>With this there's also 7 new weapons, 14 new active skills, 21 new runes to customize character runs, new enemies to face and a new auto-aim feature to save your thumbs a bit. The auto-aim might be my favourite new addition to be honest, I love these style of games but when the action gets ridiculously heated, having to manually aim various skills ends up killing me…and my thumb.</p>
<p>Available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2066020/Soulstone_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">on Steam</a> in Early Access.</p>
<p>You can see my previous Steam Deck gameplay below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_CCubu42vF0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7bd364dca0eb2987bea5f47355831f86.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_CCubu42vF0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It runs great on desktop Linux too, no complaints there! It has Native Linux support and it seems to be supported well overall so one not to miss.</p>
<p><em>While you're here: has the industry actually settled on a term for these games yet?</em></p>

      <title>Factorio adds controller support in experimental update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Good news for Steam Deck and gamepad fans, as official controller support is coming to Factorio and you can try it out right now. Released in <a href="https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=106660" target="_blank">experimental v1.1.83</a> they note you just need to change over the input method in the settings -&gt; controls menu. Then you will get proper gamepad controls and glyphs telling you what to do.</p>
<p>To access it on Steam simply go into the Properties -&gt; Betas menu and select at least version 1.1.83. You can also select to keep on the latest 1.1 experimental version if you wish.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4143860971686907984gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4143860971686907984gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17042827981686908066gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17042827981686908066gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Looking forward to kicking-back and relaxing some more with this. It's been a while since playing Factorio properly but gamepad support always makes me look at games again, it's so much nicer to relax with rather than feeling forced to sit at a desk after a long day.</p>
<p>Checking it today on Steam Deck the controls do seem to work quite well, although no doubt they'll be making improvements over time since this is only in the experimental build. Sometimes selecting the right building can be difficult when they're right next to each other but that's what testing is for right? Still getting used to it but after only a few minutes you can get pretty quick with the various binds.</p>
<p>Time to get started then…</p>

      <title>Removing non-Steam apps now cleans up on Steam Deck and Linux desktop</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A change that Valve missed in the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-overhauled-new-overlay-steam-deck-big-stable-update/" target="_blank">big recent upgrade</a> of the Steam client, is that on Linux systems either desktop or Steam Deck, removing non-Steam apps should now be cleaner.</p>
<p>Previously, if you added something into Steam that ended up making a shader cache and compatibility data, like running something with Proton, when you removed the shortcut from Steam it would leave everything behind. That should no longer be the case, as Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais mentioned on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1669489661507682305" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux change we forgot to call out in the new client: removing non-Steam apps now properly removes all related files like shader caches and compatibility data (which would previously be left as 'other' storage space)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So people can eventually stop asking "What's taking up all my "Other" storage?!", which has been an ongoing problem since the Steam Deck's release and especially a problem on the 64GB Steam Deck model.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/906223661686906148gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/906223661686906148gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>Even though Valve don't actually support non-Steam apps directly, it's nice to see them make steps to make the experience better.</p>

      <title>SNES JRPG inspired game Alterium Shift arrives July 6th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Inspired by SNES classics, the JRPG styled Alterium Shift plans to have an Early Access release land on July 6th and it's looking good.</p>
<p>More about it: "Embark on a retro-inspired adventure with Alterium Shift, a classic JRPG featuring immersive 2.5D graphics and pixel art combined with modern gameplay. Choose from three unique characters, each with their own skills and elemental powers to explore the living world of Alteria. Engage in turn-based combat and fun mini-games like fishing as you uncover the secrets of this magical land and shape the outcome of the story with your choices."</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="VkgBn6x6n0s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/59a6ff633afba23c2304d1c39534b665.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/VkgBn6x6n0s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>With the Early Access release they said it's about 50% done. With a full release expected up until the end of 2023, or into 2024 if some parts like localisation and porting to other platforms take longer. The full version will have configurable controls, full world maps to walk across, a bestiary, more settings (like CRT effects), battle enhancements and just general gameplay improvements.</p>
<p>Looks quite fantastic, excited for this one.</p>
<p>You can try a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586990/Alterium_Shift/" target="_blank">right now on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>AMD reveals initial open source openSIL code to replace AGESA Firmware</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>AMD is moving even further into open source, with their plans to have openSIL replace AGESA for their processors and they've now put up the initial open source code on <a href="https://github.com/openSIL/openSIL" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It's only currently a proof of concept, to start working more in the open with the community. Their current plan is to have openSIL available properly in some form beginning 2026. AMD has been collaborating with the likes of 9elements, AMI, AWS, 3mdeb, Datacom, Google, Meta and Oxide on this.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10582878451686830924gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10582878451686830924gol1.png"/></a><em>Image Source - AMD</em></p>
<p>I'll leave the explanation up to AMD on this one from their <a href="http://community.amd.com/t5/business/empowering-the-industry-with-open-system-firmware-amd-opensil/ba-p/599644" target="_blank">blog post</a> back in April:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AMD believes one of the ways to attain an improved security posture is to open Silicon Initialization Firmware architecture, development, and validation to the open-source community. AMD is committed to open-source software and is now expanding into the various firmware domains with the re-architecture of its x86 AGESA FW stack - designed with UEFI as the host firmware that prevented scaling, to other host firmware solutions such as coreboot, oreboot, FortiBIOS, Project µ and others. A newer, open architecture that potentially allows for reduced attack surface, and perceivably infinite scalability is now available as a Proof-of-Concept, within the open-source community for evaluation, called the AMD openSIL – Open-Source Silicon Initialization Library.</p>
<p>AMD openSIL adheres to simple goals of an agnostic set of library functions written in an industry-standard language that can be statically linked to the host firmware without having to adhere to any host firmware protocols. AMD openSIL is designed to be scalable and simple to integrate, light weight, low chirp and transparent, potentially allowing for an improved security posture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a nice win for open source and future system security with AMD CPUs.</p>

      <title>PAYDAY 2 devs to ensure it works with Proton on Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You may have <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/overkill-drops-linux-support-for-payday-2/" target="_blank">seen the news</a> recently that Overkill decided to stop supporting and updating their Native Linux build of PAYDAY 2. Well, they're now saying they will ensure it works with Proton.</p>
<p>For Steam Deck players, you shouldn't need to do anything, as it defaults to the Windows version running in Proton anyway. For desktop Linux players, you'll just need to force Proton in the right click menu Properties -&gt; Compatibility section on the game.</p>
<p>Addressing some issues that have come up since the latest update including matchmaking problems, they included a section on the future of PAYDAY 2 running on Linux (and so Steam Deck too). Here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/218620/view/3665414601842198623" target="_blank">what they said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linux is a complicated beast. To get the game working on both native Linux and at the same time updating the older version of the diesel engine that PAYDAY 2 for Linux was using proved unfeasible. This was one of the things we spent the most time trying to solve, yet didn’t reach our goals in the end.<br/>
Linux players can still access the game using Proton, we’ll keep testing new updates with Proton to make sure it keeps working for the upcoming patches and releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it's good news for people who don't care about what happens behind the Play button and just want to play their games. Support is what's important and they clearly say they're going to ensure it keeps working and will be testing it.</p>
<p>You could argue the issue wouldn't be a problem if they kept the Linux version on an up to date game engine, but there will be reasons why they haven't done this. We know that developers can see exactly how many players are in their games from each platform (Steam shows developers this), so they likely just saw there wasn't enough players using the Native Linux version to be worth ongoing support costs and upgrades.</p>
<p>I just tested it with Proton Experimental and it worked great.</p>

      <title>Steam gets overhauled with new overlay, Steam Deck big stable update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released the latest big update to the Steam client, which brings with it various UI updates and the new in-game Steam Overlay. This is the update they announced <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/huge-steam-beta-upgrade-with-new-overlay-screenshot-manager-more/" target="_blank">back in April</a>, with it being promoted from Beta to Stable.</p>
<p>While there's plenty of tweaks, Valve said the biggest changes aren't actually user-visible because they've changed "how we share code across the Steam Desktop Client, Big Picture mode, and Steam Deck" resulting in "quicker implementation and iteration of new features" and now much code is shared between them.</p>
<p>Some of what's new includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Various tweaks to the Steam App UI.</li>
<li>Richer notifications.</li>
<li>A whole new in-game overlay that lets you make notes, and pin windows on top of games.</li>
<li>Hardware acceleration for Linux and macOS.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of the new in-game overlay:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14414209981686825722gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14414209981686825722gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Really great update actually, the new overlay is many times more useful than the one before. The notes system is a good idea, and having it sync to your Steam account so you have it anywhere is really quite useful.</p>
<p>Check out Valve's overview video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e8jv24NjOWQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/83f1ebf0e6e4ff6cfe1466fbe1fc1590.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e8jv24NjOWQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Full Steam desktop app changes can be seen in their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/3687931965598906184" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Over on the Steam Deck, we finally have a fresh Stable Steam Client update as well, bundling together a whole lot of the tweaks and changes Valve has been putting out in Beta. Naturally, a lot of this is the same as what's found on desktop, since they are sharing code now but there's various specific Steam Deck tweaks like fixing the notorious issue of the Steam Deck claiming it cannot reach Steam servers when resuming from sleep. Most of it is bug fixing but there's also these additions and changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for notification types shown in the Desktop Client and Mobile app: Wishlist, Trade Offer, Steam Turn, Help Request, Major Sale, and Comment.</li>
<li>Added a bell icon to the header when there are new notifications, and a green indicator to new notifications in the notifications list.</li>
<li>Apply text filtering preferences in Guides in the Overlay.</li>
<li>Expand the hitbox of buttons in the footer to make them easier to click.</li>
<li>Improved performance of dual trackpad typing in the Virtual Keyboard.</li>
<li>Any button press will now cancel the Wake custom startup movie.</li>
<li>Changed game invitations to show the launch option dialog instead of using the first option in the list. If the user has selected an option and asked to remember it, that option will be used instead of showing the dialog.</li>
<li>Added support for Mouse4 (Back) as B button in the interface.</li>
<li>Search will now return tags in addition to games. You can search for categories like "Free to Play" or individual tags like "survival" or "zombies".</li>
<li>Enabled additional toast notifications that were previously only visible in Desktop mode.</li>
<li>Restored display of Special Offers in the What's New section of the home screen.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Total War: WARHAMMER III for Linux updated to v3.1</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After entirely skipping the 3.0 update for Linux, Feral Interactive has now upgraded their Linux port of Total War: WARHAMMER III to version 3.1. The 3.0 update originally released for Windows in April, with 3.1 landing in May. While it is nice to see we got the 3.1 update a bit quicker, two months between updates is not a good look if you're sticking to their Native build.</p>
<p>Main changes for 3.1 and 3.0 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chaos Dwarfs Endgame Crisis</li>
<li>Regiments of Renown IV</li>
<li>Bretonnia changes and rebalancing</li>
<li>Event notifications fixed</li>
<li>Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs</li>
<li>Mirror of Madness</li>
<li>Free Legendary Hero: Ulrika Magdova</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get an overview on what's changed in the two below videos:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IyJS1x2SeC4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/141b49ae4808b9943d21d5de31d8397b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IyJS1x2SeC4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>

<p>This update also brings support for the Forge of the Chaos Dwarfs DLC.</p>
<p><em>Full patch notes can be found for <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/tww3-update-300/" target="_blank">3.0 here</a> and <a href="https://www.totalwar.com/blog/tww3-update-310/" target="_blank">3.1 here</a>.</em></p>
<p>You can grab Total War: Warhammer III on <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/total-war-warhammer-iii?ref=gol" target="_blank">Fanatical</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/total-war-warhammer-iii?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>ICYMI: seems like Feral won't be doing any more Linux ports, after <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/total-war-pharaoh-announced-linux-port-from-feral-interactive/" target="_blank">Total War: PHARAOH</a> was initially announced with Linux support Feral quickly clarified this was in fact wrong and they're only doing it for macOS.</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 535.54.03 stable rolls out for Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has today released their latest stable driver for Linux version <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/205541/en-uk" target="_blank">535.54.03</a>, following on from their recent <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/nvidia-535-43-02-beta-for-linux-wayland-vulkan/" target="_blank">535.43.02 Beta driver in late May</a>.</p>
<p>Compared with the Beta, NVIDIA added in these extra bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused modesets to fail in some Wayland configurations.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused head-mounted displays (HMDs) to display black after a modeset.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented SLI Mosaic controls from being displayed in the nvidia-settings control panel when using GSP Firmware.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause image corruption when unbinding Vulkan sparse textures.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused head-mounted displays (HMDs) to display black after a modeset.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the changes are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the VK_EXT_memory_priority, and VK_EXT_pageable_device_memory extensions for Turing+ GPUs.</li>
<li>Improved the performance of Minecraft Java Edition on RTX 3000 series GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed a memory leak in the NVIDIA GLX driver, as reported at: <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/222697" target="_blank">https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/222697</a></li>
<li>Added support for driving very high pixel clock mode timings such as 8K @ 60Hz. Please see the "MaxOneHardwareHead" X11 ModeValidation token in the README for details.</li>
<li>Extended Dynamic Boost support on notebooks to include older Renoir and Cezanne chipsets, in addition to Rembrandt and newer AMD chipsets.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Vulkan X11 swapchain creation to fail on GPUs without a display engine when the VK_KHR_present_id extension is used.</li>
<li>Fixed console restore on legacy VGA consoles when using the NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules.</li>
<li>Added nvoptix.bin to the driver package. This data file is used by the OptiX ray tracing engine library, libnvoptix.so.1.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-compiler.so.VERSION from the driver package. This functionality is now provided by other driver libraries.</li>
<li>Added power usage and power limits information to nvidia-settings PowerMizer page.</li>
<li>Updated NV_CTRL_GPU_POWER_SOURCE NV-CONTROL API to report undersized power source.</li>
<li>Add support for version 4 of the linux-dmabuf wayland protocol.</li>
<li>Added NV-CONTROL attributes NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_MODE and NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_VALUE to allow syncing a Quadro Sync II card to different House Sync signal rates. This feature requires firmware version 2.18 or later; to download the latest firmware version, please visit: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/" target="_blank">https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/firmware/quadro-sync-firmware-driver/</a></li>
<li>Added support for the VK_KHR_video_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_queue, VK_KHR_video_decode_h264 and VK_KHR_video_decode_h265 extensions.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Added support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.</li>
<li>This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused incorrect reporting of presentation times when using the VK_NV_present_barrier Vulkan extension.</li>
</ul>

      <title>AMD GPUs to get Ray Tracing turned on for Mesa 23.2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The RADV driver in Mesa for AMD GPUs on Linux and Steam Deck is set to get Ray Tracing turned on by default for the upcoming Mesa 23.2 release.</p>
<p>Previously you could try it in certain titles, and there were ways to enable it manually but now you won't have to do anything as the code to turn it on has been <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/commit/374bd4e1bef25ba2aeef6016ac35b41df07f3a99" target="_blank">merged</a>. Once you upgrade to Mesa 23.2 after release (scheduled for August 2nd at the earliest) with an AMD GPU, you should find games able to use it.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming, so it's really great to see Ray Tracing really getting into shape for those with an AMD GPU. It also means it will be doable on Steam Deck whenever Valve upgrade SteamOS to have the newer Mesa version, although it likely won't run too well there in many titles.</p>
<p>You can read more on the behind the scenes work from developer Friedrich Vock on <a href="https://pixelcluster.github.io/RADV-Raytracing-ON/" target="_blank">their blog post</a>.</p>
<p>What are you looking forward to trying with it?</p>

      <title>Upload VR Showcase bundle has some good picks for VR fans</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a fancy VR headset and fancy picking up some new games? The <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/upload-vr?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Upload VR Showcase Bundle</a> has some interesting titles worth a look. I'll list each title along with any expected compatibility thanks to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/" target="_blank">ProtonDB</a>, with each being a Steam link if you need to go get more info first.</p>
<p>Included in the bundle are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/916840/The_Walking_Dead_Saints__Sinners/" target="_blank">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners</a> - ProtonDB Platinum.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1947500/The_Walking_Dead_Saints__Sinners__Chapter_2_Retribution/" target="_blank">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners - Chapter 2: Retribution</a> - No Reports.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481780/Dragon_Fist_VR_Kung_Fu/" target="_blank">Dragon Fist: VR Kung Fu</a> - One report note it works fine.</li>

</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/upload-vr?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">full bundle here</a>.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, SteamVR is currently just not working for me on Fedora KDE 38. When I load SteamVR it gives this error and the headset just flashes at me with no game output:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3517784281686744032gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3517784281686744032gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>If anyone has any good tips to solve it I would love to read your thoughts in the comments as I want to get back into it with my Valve Index. Once the summer heat has died off a bit at least… Used to work well in games for the most part before this, but now I can't get it to work at all.</p>

      <title>The Last of Us Part I upgraded and now Steam Deck Verified</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Last of Us Part I is finally getting to a level that's actually good, and the latest update is out now including bumping it up to Steam Deck <a href="https://twitter.com/naughty_dog/status/1668682177964556288" target="_blank">Verified</a> status.</p>
<p>Quite a surprise to see, considering multiple parts of the game previously on Steam Deck would drop pretty hard below 30FPS and it was not good to play. There were also issues I showcased in previous videos, where it would completely lock up the system.</p>
<p>So what have they done? For Steam Deck specifically here's the main changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Overall improvements to performance while playing on Steam Deck.</li>
<li>Addressed a memory leak issue that could cause crashes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain button prompts would be misaligned.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing (Options &gt; Graphics &gt; Graphics Preset) could trigger an intense lighting effect.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where in-game HUD did not match Steam Deck Performance Overlay FPS value.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur during loading screens.</li>
<li>Effects Density now defaults to Very Low instead of Low.</li>
<li>[Lakeside Resort] Fixed a crash that could occur at the start of a cutscene.</li>
<li>[Pittsburgh] Fixed a crash that could occur at certain checkpoints.</li>
<li>[The Outskirts] Fixed an issue where locked FPS could make it difficult to move pushable objects.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally they also added in a very low graphics preset, a new AI quality setting and a new dynamic light quality setting - all of which add up to make it a better fit on Steam Deck thanks to more tweaks. So it's not surprising it was able to get Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>What does that result in? Have a look in my video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="k4t21Z28Vgc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a77c987f41ea274a0006b961249a0dd.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/k4t21Z28Vgc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As noted in the video, unfortunately, there are still locations that will end up causing the RAM use to spike up to about 14.1GB drop the FPS down to basically nothing and completely lock up the Steam Deck. So that issue isn't <em>yet</em> solved but it's also an issue in <em>multiple</em> other games. Not everyone sees it (which can cause some confusion) but for Steam Deck and bigger games, it's quite problematic when it happens. <a href="https://github.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities" target="_blank">CryoUtilities</a> can work around it in some cases but not always. I'm hoping SteamOS 3.5 will help this issue and will be testing when Valve drop it into Preview.</p>

      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Moonstone Island from Studio Supersoft and Raw Fury looks sweet! It's a creature-collecting life-sim set in an open world with 100+ islands to explore and now we have more details.</p>

<p>They just recently announced they're planning to release it this Summer and there's a brand new trailer below:</p>

      <title>Portal Reloaded - The Cooperative Update is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready for one more run through the testing chambers? The free and very popular mod Portal Reloaded just recently had The Cooperative Update <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1255980/announcements/detail/3703693931382658082" target="_blank">release</a>.</p>
<p>The game already expanded on the Portal idea a fair bit giving you a triple portal gun, with the third portal being a time portal so it all got a bit wibbly wobbly…time-y wimey. With this latest update it goes a little further adding in the new co-op mode with 20 new testing chambers, co-op time travel mechanics, a new narrative, new music and a whole bunch of improvements to single-player too. They've also added Finnish, Italian and Ukrainian subtitle options now too.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>

<p>Available to play on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1255980/Portal_Reloaded/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, free for owners of Portal 2.</p>
<p>If you've played this latest update be sure to let me know what you think!</p>

      <title>SMITE now works on Linux and Steam Deck in the latest update</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 14/06/23</strong>: after some <em>more</em> testing, one thing I have found on Steam Deck is that you <em>can</em> use the built-in gamepad controls. However, they only work correctly in battles. The entire menu / lobby and god selection seems to not work with gamepad controls. So you can use touch screen, emulated mouse input or hold the STEAM button to activate mouse cursor. Seems this is a problem even on Windows going back <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/lmrwnd/controller_doesnt_work_on_main_menu_or_god_select/" target="_blank">years</a>. It does <em>not</em> have "Full controller support" as advertised on Steam, only Partial.</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Titan Forge Games and Hi-Rez Studios have updated their popular MOBA game SMITE, and with it an improvement to allow it to now work on Linux with Easy Anti-Cheat.</p>
<p>After playing a couple of games myself today, I can confirm it is working very nicely on my Fedora KDE 38 desktop. No performance issues anywhere that I could see and no kicking due to anti-cheat. This change to the Linux support status was mentioned officially in the <a href="https://www.smitegame.com/news/the-season-of-souls-10-6-update-notes/" target="_blank">release notes</a>, where they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SMITE will now run on Linux systems – Special thanks to the SMITE community for helping with this. A group of players in the r/smite discord made a big impact on this change</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>So that's some great news for gamers on Linux!</em></p>
<p>However, when it comes to the Steam Deck, there it's a bit different. SMITE's controller support doesn't seem to work properly as far as I could see. Even on desktop Linux just to double-check, it didn't work right there either. So you'll need to use a Community Layout in Steam Input that sets keyboard and mouse controls up or make a layout it yourself. And make sure you keep it set to keyboard and mouse with the <em>in-game</em> settings, otherwise it gets confused and just doesn't seem to work when in a battle. Trying out the most upvoted "Xbox One Style Controls" on Steam Deck - it actually worked quite well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19467179251686677332gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19467179251686677332gol1.jpeg"/></a></p>
<p>A bit annoying needing to learn the binds manually but doable certainly and after a few games once you get the controls down, it really does seem to work quite well on Steam Deck (and really smooth on Medium settings too). But hopefully the game developer can fix the issue, or perhaps Valve can with Proton to get controller support directly working. Given how many thumbs up the community layout has though, it's likely controller support is iffy on Windows too with so many using the custom layouts.</p>
<p>You can see some Steam Deck footage in my below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZRjtQSAlpkc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/75e632d7853720cff0b4b5ce69b49c3f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZRjtQSAlpkc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>On desktop Linux, apart from the controller issue, no other problems. Everything works as expected and performance was again very good. It felt perfectly natural to click and play so nothing to really report there.</p>
<p>SMITE can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/386360/SMITE/" target="_blank">found on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Nova Roma is a new city-builder from the Kingdoms and Castles developer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Kingdoms and Castles is a great city-builder but it seems Lion Shield want to do something a bit different, so they've revealed Nova Roma. It was announced at the PC Gaming Show.</p>
<p>Clearly building upon the work they did for Kingdoms and Castles, they're aiming a bit higher here with a whole bunch of new mechanics but it still looks a bit familiar. You will need to adapt to heavy rains that will causing flooding and damage, keep up with the needs of all your citizens through food and entertainment and even deal with the gods. If the gods aren't happy with you, then you might find they unleash punishment on you. With it being based on a Roman theme it will explore the cultural, political, and military trials of the era.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="st6OjBam4tQ"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ae79120405e3ce5ffb71a6744b0104f6.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/st6OjBam4tQ" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Innovative new water mechanics that can be manipulated via infrastructure.</li>
<li>Complex supply chains requiring constant expansion into resource-rich countryside.</li>
<li>Population needs that range from food and finery to coliseums and games to keep the people entertained.</li>
<li>Intricate city management through laws, edicts, and a tech tree.</li>
<li>A new day/night cycle.</li>
<li>Confront the dangers of the world, whether it be barbarians, gods, or the jealous machinations of the old empire.</li>
<li>Bigger, better maps, better terrain sculpting, and much more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>“We’re honored to be working with Lion Shield on its next project,” says Tim Bender, CEO of Hooded Horse. “Kingdoms &amp; Castles is a gold standard in city-building games, and we’re excited to publish the Roman-themed successor.”</p>
<p>“We’re pleased to work with Hooded Horse on Nova Roma, “ says Pete Angstadt, Creative Director and co-founder at Lion Shield. “We're building on everything we learned making Kingdoms and Castles and hope to create the best ancient Roman-era city builder we can, set in a world informed by both history and mythology."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2426530/Nova_Roma/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It should have Linux support just like their previous game.</p>

      <title>After eating up lots of game studios Embracer Group set to close a bunch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ah yes, game industry consolidation is great isn't it. What could possibly go wrong when one company acquires a ton of others and then screws up?</p>
<p>Embracer Group are known for going on acquiring sprees and currently own the likes of THQ Nordic, Coffee Stain, Gearbox, Plaion (formerly Koch Media), Saber Group and all the studios they control like Flying Wild Hog, Warhorse Studios, 3D Realms, New World Interactive, Tripwire Interactive, Aspyr Media, Beamdog and the list just goes on and on and on. Their own <a href="https://embracer.com/about/" target="_blank">website</a> lists 850 IPs either owned or controlled.</p>
<p>Well, they're having a few problems. They announced in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2023-net-sales-increased-by-79-to-sek-9356-million/" target="_blank">previous revenue report</a> that a "major strategic partnership that has been negotiated for seven months will not materialize", this deal included "USD 2 billion in contracted development revenue over a period of six years" - so it was a pretty huge hit to their plans.</p>
<p>Now less than a month later they're <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-with-immediate-implementation/" target="_blank">announcing</a> a "comprehensive restructuring program", that will see amongst other things the closing of various currently undisclosed studios and terminating various projects. In an <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/open-letter-by-embracer-group-ceo-on-restructuring-program/" target="_blank">open letter</a> the CEO Lars Wingefors mentioned their plan will "transform us from our current heavy-investment-mode to a highly cash-flow generative business this year".</p>

      <title>Noxious Weeds: Prologue is a farming themed Vampire Survivors</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>You retired and wanted to farm but evil creatures just won't leave you in peace, now you have to defend your farm with the help of some veggies. Noxious Weeds: Prologue is the latest take on the craze of Vampire Survivors. Inspired also by the likes of Brotato and Risk of Rain the developer says.</p>
<p>A Prologue is out now so you can try the idea free and I definitely like what I'm seeing here. Seeing evil Avocados running around firing bullets at me, while my little carrot minions fired back was quite amusing. That was funny enough but then giant evil speedy sunflowers start running around and it just keeps getting better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resist waves of enemies through nights and days.</li>
<li>20 minutes play sessions</li>
<li>A variety of upgradeable Tools to wipe out the swarm once and for all. Your belt can carry a maximum of 6; your choices will change the outcome.</li>
<li>Rescue and team up with the cutest companions. Some will heal you, while others will fight at your side.</li>
<li>Collect the perfect crop combination to achieve game-breaking builds.</li>
<li>Accessibility. Tweak monsters' health, speed, and damage to better suit your play style.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prologue content</p>
<ul>
<li>16 Tools to choose from.</li>
<li>2 Playable characters.</li>
<li>46 Harvest items for incredible builds.</li>
<li>3 Different companions.</li>
<li>Spring season difficulty.</li>
<li>1 Character and 3 crops unlockable through Steam Achievements.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It has a Native Linux build, although using OpenGL by default which crashed for me. However running it with "-force-vulkan" as launch option made it work perfectly. The developer is looking into it. <strong>Update</strong>: the developer is now using Vulkan by default.</p>

<li>Fixed a bug that would cause the GUI to not update when deleting the bottommost backup in the Manage Saves menu.</li>
<li>An automatic backup is made when starting a world in a new version, and a permanent backup is created when loading into a new world version</li>
<li>Fixed a world load issue between versions. (You can no longer load into a world from a game version that is newer than your current game version)</li>
<li>Fixed hitbox issue for close combat and spear throwing issue</li>

      <title>Klei Entertainment announced space survival game Dread Pilots</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I love pretty much everything Klei Entertainment make and Dread Pilots looks great, a space survival game where you're exploring a mysterious and hostile pocket universe called the Dread. From the creators of Don't Starve, Griftlands and Oxygen Not Included - you know it's likely to be good.</p>
<p>"The Dread is a pocket dimension somewhere between deep space and a nightmare. You face mutated, carnivorous plant life, mind-bending anomalies, living computers, fanatical cults, space vampires and more as you traverse its many regions in a desperate search for resources and allies. Explore dark infected caverns, soar past glistening technological landscapes, and navigate chaotic mineral fields, all animated in Klei Entertainment's signature hand-drawn 2D style."</p>
<p>Definitely feeling a fair bit of Sunless Seas / Sunless Skies in the gameplay here, check it out:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="OEnKDOZMf8U"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/66f92c3bbe447f3769f41e3aade82a59.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/OEnKDOZMf8U" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>When it comes to Native Linux support, in a reply on <a href="https://twitter.com/klei/status/1668003643700940800" target="_blank">Twitter</a> they mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like our other titles we'll explore that once we've got a bit farther on PC development to focus our development team, but exploring that is on our radar especially with growth of Steam Deck popularity. Too early to fully test and commit at the moment, but it will be explored!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be following this along with great interest, hopefully either way it will work on Linux (and Steam Deck) at least with Proton there's a good chance regardless.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1766500/Dread_Pilots/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Unsettling first-person exploration game Interior Worlds gets a Linux version</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Interior Worlds is a strange and unsettling liminal spaces game that arms you with a mysterious camera. It's quite atmospheric and full of secrets to discover. They recently put up a Native Linux build which didn't initially work due to some missing bits (Unity being odd) but they've now managed to solve the issues and so it works out of the box.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Interior Worlds; an ambient and unsettling first-person exploration game where you'll dive into strange, yet familiar spaces. Temporary gaps and portals we cross at some point or another - now yearning for a closer look. A look that can only be seen properly through the lens of an SLR camera."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="mSHPkTUvMSg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/6d78c17789b60e22d9c1bc5ee85dc89a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/mSHPkTUvMSg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your vintage and mysterious analog camera to capture stunning photographs of environmental anomalies throughout each space. Keep a sharp eye out while traversing the more... ominous locations.</li>
<li>Track and share your own in-game catalog of photos, timestamped and pre-filtered with subtle layers of maximum liminal crust.</li>
<li><strong><em>Ten unique thresholds to traverse</em></strong>. A roadside hotel, empty movie theater, dying mall, and many more. Every environment is hand-crafted in a loving throwback to late 90's and early 00's graphics.</li>
<li><strong><em>A multitude of ways to capture photos</em></strong>. Adjust zoom levels, increase/decrease lens focus, tilt left/right for a dutch angle, and more. Create perturbing compositions in hundreds of ways.</li>
<li><strong><em>Unparalleled interactivity</em></strong>. Activate vending machines, phones, sinks, televisions, or simply turn the lights on or off for a different photo-moment vibe.</li>
<li><strong><em>Immersive and unsettling soundscape</em></strong>. Melt into an eerie mix of low, rumbling drones and soft, stretched pads during the journey.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207970/Interior_Worlds/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. Also <a href="https://sodaraptor.itch.io/interior-worlds" target="_blank">itch.io</a> but I don't think that version is up to date.</p>

      <title>You&#39;ll be building your own dungeons in Quest Master</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quest Master is an upcoming dungeon-designing sandbox adventure from Skydevilpalm, Julian Creutz and Apogee Entertainment.</p>
<p>This one will allow you to be creative, as it's as much about building dungeons as exploring them. Taking inspiration from retro 16-bit classic dungeon crawlers but giving it a modern edge. You'll be able to face various dungeons alone or with up to 3 friends in local co-op.</p>
<p>With the built in level creator you'll be able to make anything from simple dungeons to fully overworld connected quests. Making it as easy or difficult as you like, you'll be able to create "lava-filled caverns, mountainous overworlds, grassy forests, desert dunes, and more" and even create your own little narrative with NPCs and all sorts.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="NX-J9kBKIs0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9be1deae6b76de04904790886dc16feb.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/NX-J9kBKIs0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>“Quest Master hands over the controls to the players to make whatever they want,” said Julian Creutz, Lead Developer of Quest Master. “The possibilities are endless, and we can’t wait to see all kinds of wacky dungeons and full-blown adventures players are able to come up with.”</p>
<p>Sounds like one to watch!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094070/Quest_Master/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. It will have Native Linux support.</p>

      <title>eXtremeRate put up their Steam Deck custom shell for pre-order</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ready to ship around the middle of June, eXtremeRate have now put up pre-orders for those of you brave enough to mod the entire shell of the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The current models they're offering right now are Clear Atomic Purple $35.99, Clear Custom (no colouring) $35.99, White $45.99, Clear Slate Black $35.99 and Chameleon Purple Blue $45.99. Seems like they're quite reasonably priced and they sure do look great.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10304364021686310761gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/10304364021686310761gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A reminder though: it's not easy to do, and requires taking apart pretty much the whole of your Steam Deck. The guide over on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Front+Shell+Replacement/149125" target="_blank">iFixit</a> shows just how long a process it is and they labelled it as "Difficult".</p>
<p>You can see them all on the <a href="https://extremerate.com/collections/steam-deck-shells" target="_blank">eXtremeRate website</a>.</p>
<p>The other company <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/a-fully-transparent-steam-deck-mod-seems-close-to-reality/" target="_blank">about to do it is JSAUX</a>, although we don't know when it will be sometime soon. Will you be picking one of these up to try and mod your Steam Deck?</p>

      <title>A Void Hope looks like a fun atmospheric adventure with a synthwave soundtrack</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Elden Pixels who made Alwa's Awakening and Alwa's Legacy have announced their next game, A Void Hope. An atmospheric puzzle adventure with a slick sounding synthwave soundtrack not to be missed.</p>
<p>"A Void Hope takes you on an atmospheric puzzle platforming adventure to find a cure for a collapsed city. Follow the story of a tormented couple as they try to decipher reality from nightmares and overcome the shadowy threats lurking in the dark."</p>
<p>Have to admit after watching the below trailer, I'm quite hyped by this one:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="D3K4n9FnXa0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e6bb2f527b486a4eecff846027430067.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/D3K4n9FnXa0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>Getting an almost Stranger Things vibe from it.</em></p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>An immersive experience - Solve puzzles, find items and progress through the story in this world brimming with mysterious ambiance.</li>
<li>Something lurks in the shadows - Crisp retro aesthetics combined with atmospheric lighting shows a world in darkness but with small slivers of hope.</li>
<li>Avoid combat, embrace exploration - Delve into an adventure filled with danger and make your way through the city avoiding the threats that come your way.</li>
<li>A haunting soundtrack - Composed by synthwave mastermind Waveshaper, an eerie and evocative landscape of music accompanies your every step.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A demo should be available for Steam Next Fest later this month. So be sure to check it out.</p>

      <title>Competitive party game Unspottable gets online play</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Unspottable was a lot of fun at release, giving you competitive hide and seek amongst the crowd gameplay but local multiplayer was pretty limiting. Now though, it has online play!</p>
<p>Had a lot of fun playing this with family but now perhaps more of you will have a look at it. The idea is simple, you each control a character that's the same as a bunch of wandering NPCs. It's the job of each play to figure out who is who, give them a little jab with their fist and hopefully get it correct - otherwise you'll need to quickly blend in with the crowd again. It's pretty chaotic and entertaining.</p>
<p>This big upgrade for the party game has a new trailer to celebrate online play:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZNkf4GFZ33c"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dcae12c6b5c0e6d39a64464ad35317db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZNkf4GFZ33c" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title">Fun for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple controls: easy to learn, hard to master.</li>
<li>Competition based on observation rather than action.</li>
<li>Tutorial to explain game mechanics to first time players.</li>
<li>Fun feedback. Ragdoll / Endgame nicknames based on stats / Camera shakes / Funny animations and designs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title">Competitive party game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competition from the start: in the home screen, players can already get used to the controls and fight each other.</li>
<li>No information given to the players about their position to push them to discuss, lie and add bluffing to their strategies.</li>
<li>All the players can control the level selection and fight to select the one they want.</li>
<li>Different side quests and mechanics with each level, to create new strategies!</li>
<li>Expert mode for more advanced players</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1243960/Unspottable/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Overkill drops Linux support for PAYDAY 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PAYDAY 2 came to Linux officially back in 2016 but as of today they've removed support for it, so it will no longer see updates on the Native Linux version.</p>
<p>They're also bringing the game to the Epic Games Store, although not exclusive, as it will remain on Steam and PAYDAY 3 will also be on Steam. As for why they're removing official Linux support they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/218620/announcements/detail/3667665767271115729" target="_blank">said this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that Linux users will not receive this update or any following updates coming to PC. In addition, Linux players will be unable to matchmake with other PC clients following this update.<br/>
We tried to find a solution, but ultimately found it unfeasible due to the Linux version being on an older version of the PAYDAY 2 engine.</p>

<p>It does, however, still work quite well with the Windows version via <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Steam Play Proton</a> on desktop Linux <em>and</em> is Steam Deck Verified against the Windows version in Proton. So while it's a loss of support for their Native build, it's still fully playable on Linux.</p>
<p>We've seen this a few times over the years, due to a mixture of reasons but the ultimate reason is pretty much the same as always — Linux and Steam Deck together hold a less than <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">2% user share</a> on Steam. For many developers, right now, it's not worth the extra overhead to continue Native support until there's more of a market.</p>

      <title>Check out the new trailer for Cyber Knights: Flashpoint a squad-tactics heist RPG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Currently in development from Trese Brothers who made Star Traders: Frontiers and Templar Battleforce, the upcoming Cyber Knights: Flashpoint looks exciting.</p>
<p>What is it? At it's core it's a fusion of turn-based tactical combat, with base building all about heists in a cyberpunk setting. Previously funded on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tresebrothers/cyber-knights" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, they're gearing up for a public demo in Steam Next Fest due later this month but to get you ready they've released a new trailer showing off all their work. As a big fan of anything resembling XCOM, I'm rather excited to get a chance to try this one finally.</p>

      <title>GuliKit reveal an upgraded anti-drift thumbstick module for Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>While the Steam Deck is a fantastic handheld devices, there's always going to be ways to make it better and GuliKit just revealed an upgraded version of their anti-drift thumbstick mod.</p>
<p>There's actually two different versions of the Steam Deck thumbsticks, and previously GuliKit had one for each but now they've combined them into one single unit. All you need to do is flick a little switch on the back of the new version, to point to which model your Steam Deck came with - nice.</p>
<p>On top of that GuliKit say this new version requires no soldering as it comes complete <em>and</em> it uses 50% less power compared to their previous version, so it sounds easier than ever to do the replacement.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7322363171686222321gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7322363171686222321gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>For getting a bit longer life out of your Steam Deck with intense gaming sessions, this is one mod that seems like it may be really worth looking into.</p>
<p>You can read more about it on their <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1026071.html" target="_blank">product page</a>. No exact word yet on when they will be come available to order so keep an eye on their <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/stores/GULIkit/page/FB794F67-E7B2-4C62-BA0D-5A6F42CABC95" target="_blank">Amazon</a> page. Their <a href="https://twitter.com/GuliKitDesign/status/1666738962323447809" target="_blank">Twitter</a> account simply said they're "ready" and they don't do sales directly from their own website.</p>

      <title>Fantasy buddy-cop RPG &#39;My Familiar&#39; looks great with a demo up</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Up for trying out a new buddy-cop RPG? My Familiar has a fantastic art-style and really looks like something that could be a bit special.</p>
<p>With a lighthearted take this fantasy buddy cop RPG is set in a world filled full of trash, and everything looks like it's falling apart. The art style is really what suckered me in here though as it reminds me of some real classics. Going straight onto my ever-growing wishlist of games, and it seems like it might have pretty good sound-track to go with it if the trailer is anything to go by.</p>
<p>The trailer looks pretty wild:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="KP3cg_C9g8g"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/635d9208e4e43ab241d9ccdd2ffcd89e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/KP3cg_C9g8g" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>How the developer describes it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yo! Welcome to 'MY FAMILIAR'.<br/>
In this RPG, wake up as a fresh familiar on the mean streets of Wish City, where the denizens are dark and corruption is king...<br/>
Fight, flee, and aggressively rap your way through a vibrant inner city gauntlet, chock full of dysfunctional demons, in flashy, over the top, turn-based battles.<br/>
<br/>
Cast of 6 playable familiars include:<br/>
A self-loathing party fowl...<br/>
a disembodied diva...<br/>
a remorseless sausage thief...<br/>
a totally jacked, luchador duck...<br/>
a self-righteous robber-baroness...<br/>
and some sort of weird, purple rabbit/goblin/rat thing...<br/>
<br/>
Cool, I guess?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do love how developers on Steam can pretty much write anything as their description.</p>
<p>Try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1502750/My_Familiar/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. There's a Native Linux build available too.</p>

<p>Imagine Earth from developer Serious Bros that originally released back in May 2021 just got upgraded, and now it has Native Linux support.</p>

<p>The best way to play Minecraft on desktop Linux and Steam Deck, especially for modding, is with the Prism Launcher see <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/10/minecraft-on-steam-deck-guide-with-prism-launcher-and-gamepad-support/" target="_blank">my previous guide for setting it up on Steam Deck</a>. However, the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download" target="_blank">official launcher</a> works quite well if you're not doing any modding. You might also want to know about a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/curseforge-and-bukkit-get-hit-with-malware-for-minecraft-mods/" target="_blank">recent security incident</a> for modding but anyone playing without mods are fine.</p>

      <title>Hearts of Iron IV: Arms Against Tyranny to focus on Scandinavia and Finland</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Scandinavia and Finland are a big focus in the newly announced Hearts of Iron IV: Arms Against Tyranny expansion releasing later this year.</p>
<p>Arms Against Tyranny is the latest immersion pack for Hearts of Iron IV, Paradox Interactive's best-selling grand strategy wargame about the years around World War II. In Arms Against Tyranny, you will encounter new alternate histories and National Focus Trees for the nations of Scandinavia and Finland, with a heavy emphasis on the Winter War and Finland's struggle against Soviet invasion. </p>
<p>Features of <em>Hearts of Iron IV: Arms Against Tyranny</em> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Finnish National Focus Tree: </strong>Walk the diplomatic tightrope of a democratic nation trapped between threats, develop a capable defensive army, or pursue alternate historical paths of collaboration with the neighboring tyrants.</li>
<li><strong>New Swedish National Focus Tree: </strong>Resource rich and fiercely independent, Sweden can be the center of a unified Scandinavian resistance, or a game-changing ally in the ongoing battle of ideologies.</li>
<li><strong>New Danish and Norwegian Focus Trees: </strong>With the benefit of hindsight, can you prepare these small nations for the storm of war that is about to wash upon their shores?</li>
<li><strong>Military Industrial Organizations: </strong>Customize your armaments industry by encouraging national corporations to specialize in the types of weapons and technology you desire for your armed forces.</li>
<li><strong>International Arms Market: </strong>Become the quartermaster of the world by selling arms and equipment to the warring nations, receiving civilian factory capacity in return.</li>
<li><strong>And more: </strong>New unit art, 10 new songs, customization of Special Forces units and greater divisional specialization.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get a good look at all the improvements coming in their <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/arms-against-tyranny-historical-finland.1588882/" target="_blank">new developer diary</a>. As always it will be accompanied by a free upgrade for all players named Stella Polaris. They're not giving out an exact date anywhere I can see on when it will be released as this is just the initial reveal.</p>
<p>Hearts of Iron IV also just celebrated its 7th anniversary, and clearly it's still going strong with it regularly seeing over 40,000 players on at a time each day making it one of the most popular Paradox games.</p>
<p>You can buy Hearts of Iron IV on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/hearts-of-iron-iv-cadet-edition?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/394360/Hearts_of_Iron_IV/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>GOG made it simpler to publish on their store, plus their Pride Month celebration</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> announced today they've taken a step towards making it easier to get games onto their store, and more clear on what they won't accept.</p>
<p>They've launched <a href="https://www.gog.com/submit-your-game" target="_blank">a new form</a> for developers and publishers of all kind to fill out, who wish to have their games released onto GOG. Over email they told me the entire process is simplified, with it offering up "more context and focusing on the most important aspects to ensure our team gets all the necessary information from the get go".</p>
<p>Historically, GOG has been a little odd in what they accepted and denied to be placed onto their store, I've seen various Twitter posts from developers over the years frustrated on it when GOG denied their game for no real reason. GOG is still much more curated versus the likes of Steam but perhaps this is set to change a little.</p>
<p>Additionally, the GOG team have put up a <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/benefits-of-releasing-your-game-on-gog-a-guide-for-indie-game-developers/" target="_blank">dedicated page</a> going over what they say are the benefits of releasing on GOG.</p>
<p>You can see the types of games GOG say they won't accept <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/11382878039197-Releasing-your-game-on-GOG-FAQ?product=gog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>In other GOG news they're also doing their own thing for Pride Month, and a little differently this time too. Instead of just one game collection, they've <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/2023_gog_pride_month_collection" target="_blank">made an entire page</a> to highlight games across various categories including Masculine romance representation, Female romance representation, Featuring transgender characters and more.</p>
<p>GOG's Summer Sale will also begin at the end of the week.</p>

      <title>Roguelite vehicle combat game REDLINE CROOKS is pure chaos </title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>REDLINE CROOKS from developer Alexander Golke is a top-down 2D roguelite about smashing vehicles into more vehicles. It's pure unfiltered chaos and I love the idea.</p>
<p>Combining together elements of a roguelite with completely ridiculous vehicle speed, it allows you to charge through entire walls of the map to then smash into other vehicles to build up a score and money for upgrades. Mechanically it's seriously over the top but once you've played a few minutes of it, the idea really comes into its own. You'll face all sorts, there's even tanks.</p>
<p>Have a look at the trailer to see how crazy it is:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4XI7-cCOPdE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/55bb6e933281cdf09ded787012b1d5c0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4XI7-cCOPdE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Pick one out of 9 playable convicts, each with distinct playstyles and character-specific upgrades.</li>
<li>Use the Boost to reach dangerously high speeds and blast through walls and enemies alike at the cost of your health.</li>
<li>Slam, blow up, launch, ram or otherwise destroy anyone looking to get you back behind bars, and be rewarded with cash and health.</li>
<li>Build an arsenal of powerful upgrades purchasable from the ever-trustworthy shopkeeper - there are over 100 items for you to mix and match, making every run unique.</li>
<li>Perform well to rank up, ramping up both the difficulty and the rewards you get using a God Hand-inspired difficulty scaling system.</li>
<li>Master the intricate mechanics and make it to the top of the online leaderboard, or just have a good time in this easy to play, hard to master experience.</li>
<li>Jam out to an awesome, original digital-fusion soundtrack by <em>father p</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That's going right onto my wishlist. The demo worked great on my desktop Fedora KDE 38 install too. On my Steam Deck it was pretty much a perfect experience there too, this could be an ideal game for Steam Deck fans to play on the go that will keep the battery going for a while too because it's really easy on the system.</p>
<p>My favourite is easily the character that drives what looks like a forklift, that can pick up other cars and throw them around. As shown in the below gif, which was actually taken from my testing of it on Steam Deck:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/398593091686143449gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/398593091686143449gol1.gif"/></a><br/>
<em>Glorious</em>!</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2454350/REDLINE_CROOKS/" target="_blank">demo on Steam</a>. It has a Native Linux build available.</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-4 is out now with game fixes and other upgrades</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">

You don't often actually need it. See more in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">my Steam Play and Proton guide</a>.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>While the Fall Guys fix was removed, there's still this note about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notes: On Fall Guys when the Epic Online Services installer is running on a clean prefix, you must hit cancel on step 2/2, otherwise Fall Guys will tell you the game is missing files and force you to exit.</p>
</blockquote>

      <title>Bullet hell game Survivors of the Dawn features mini campaign, text events</title>
      <author>Etienne Mahler</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><em>“Embark on a glorious odyssey where survival depends on tactically combining diverse weapon classes to annihilate the hordes. Beware of your choices traveling through the stars, the next combat can determine your destiny.”</em></p>
<p>Survivors of the Dawn – a game I stumbled upon by chance on Twitter – can best be described as a classic bullet hell or horde survival game.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="S10wcDdE_Kg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3ccafecd14a1ef7c3b47f36c9433e675.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/S10wcDdE_Kg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's important to note that what you’ll read and see here is not the finished game or even a demo, but an early playtest version currently provided by the developer for free. The game is currently in version 0.3, so in its alpha stage. I've tried the game on Linux Mint 21.1 with Proton Experimental and the Steam Deck without any tinkering, despite no official Linux support.</p>
<p>Survivors of the Dawn comes from the small studio indieGiant in Turkey. Like many other games of its kind, Survivors of the Dawn follows the typical gameplay loop of slaying monsters, levelling up, and slaying even more monsters... until we eventually run out of steam or hit points.</p>
<p>Despite sounding simple and familiar so far (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/a-genre-is-born-horde-games/" target="_blank">like many other horde bullet hell games</a>), Survivors of the Dawn brings a few fresh ideas that could set it apart from its competitors.</p>
<p>What's already in Survivors of the Dawn?</p>
<p>Like most other games of its kind, Survivors of the Dawn is about purely our survival from hordes of monsters. It doesn't really have a story – and I'm uncertain if the game will ever have one. However, in this type of game, the story doesn't play a major role, so I'll skip that part and talk about the gameplay instead.</p>
<p>As for the core gameplay, the playtest version currently only features one main weapon, a shotgun, which is a bit disappointing. So, I hope the developer upgrades this aspect before the game enters early access in July, as planned. </p>
<p>And yes, according to the Steam page, the current version of the game is just a glimpse of what's planned for Survivors of the Dawn. The developer intends to add more content over time, including additional weapon classes, synergies between power ups, randomly generated sectors, playable characters, and extra game modes. Currently, there is only one mode, but a second survival mode is already visible in the main menu.</p>
<p>Besides the initial main weapon, there are some interesting upgrades we can select and improve as we level up. These include a small striker drone as a companion, which constantly takes care of our enemies and becomes powerful at higher levels, exploding kamikaze spiders, rocket and grenade launchers, orbiting laser barriers, and lightsabers à la Star Wars.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12321016281686118041gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12321016281686118041gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And, if you already thought our protagonist looks a bit like a Stormtrooper from Star Wars, I agree – that was my first thought too.</p>
<p>Despite these obvious design inspirations – as well as gameplay inspirations from Vampire Survivors and Slay The Spire – Survivors of the Dawn also brings a few unique ideas that I haven't seen in other games of the genre.</p>
<p>The game features a kind of mini-campaign consisting of individual levels connected through a space map. We move forward with our spaceship and choose the next level, small text events, or a shop. The text events grant us either advantages like additional credits or disadvantages like starting with half of our hit points. It's unclear how much these text events contribute to a story, though.</p>
<p>In the current playtest version of the game, the campaign map is still relatively simple, but I spoke to the developer on Twitter, and he mentioned plans to expand it in the future. I really hope he does because I find this feature quite cool. Not only does the map create a sense of connected missions, but progress between individual missions also carries over. That means the weapons and upgrades we obtained in one level will carry over to the next one – and the same goes for the upgrades bought in the shop, of course.</p>
<p>Until the full version of the game is released, I hope some points will be improved. For example, currently it's quite difficult to regenerate hit points. There is a power-up between missions that allows us to regenerate hit points when we deal damage at the cost of 70% of our hit points, but it's not very effective. Besides that power-up, there are small green orbs on the map, but they are so rare that even with extreme caution, I hardly obtained any.</p>
<p>The overall difficulty of the game is acceptable. Although I initially found it somewhat easy, I haven't managed to complete the boss level entirely yet.</p>
<p>Currently, Survivors of the Dawn doesn't have controller support, but the developer stated that it will be added. This also means that the game isn't really playable on the Steam Deck at the moment.</p>
<p>However, I still took a look at the game on the Steam Deck, and it runs quite well already. In fact, despite the lack of controller support, you can already move around, but there is no way to control the crosshair except through the touchpad. Nevertheless, at this point, I would assume that Survivors of the Dawn will be playable on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21306752021686117919gol14998.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21306752021686117919gol14998.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The official demo is expected to be released on Steam no later than June 16, with the early access version coming in July. I can't provide exact information about the price of the game during early access presently, but I think it will be reasonable.</p>
<p>If you're interested in trying the game yourself, you can find the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2285630/Survivors_of_the_Dawn/" target="_blank">Steam</a>. There, you can either sign up for the ongoing playtest or, if you're reading this later, download the demo or the full game.</p>

      <title>CurseForge and Bukkit get hit with malware for Minecraft mods</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Just a bit of a PSA here for anyone diving into Minecraft modding, as recently there's been a problem on both CurseForge and Bukkit with malware.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of reports on this and the situation has been moving pretty quickly, but for now you should stay away from downloading any Minecraft mods from both platforms. The issue affects both Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>From the report on <a href="https://hackmd.io/B46EYzKXSfWSF35DeCZz9A" target="_blank">hackmd</a> and the <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/news/cf-compromised-alert/" target="_blank">Prism Launcher</a> post that references it, it seems a bunch of compromised accounts were used to update quite a number of popular mods to insert malicious files. According to the report the issue goes back multiple months, so it's not exactly clear just how wide-spread it truly is and work is ongoing by many people to figure it all out.</p>
<p>This malware seems to work across multiple stages, and both links above show you how you can check to see if you've been affected, which needs you to go hunting in a few places because it will make new files and folders on your system. However, if you were using the Prism Launcher via Flatpak on Linux the malware likely would have failed to work due to the sandboxing. Either way, checking is a good idea.</p>
<p><em>For a good place to download mods you can look to <a href="https://modrinth.com/" target="_blank">Modrinth</a> and the <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/" target="_blank">Prism Launcher</a>.</em></p>

      <title>Amnesia: The Bunker is stressful horror done the right way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Amnesia: The Bunker is the latest in a series of horror games from Frictional Games, one that feels a lot like Alien: Isolation with a WW1 theme. Definitely not a game for the faint of heart — like me. Wow, this was a stressful game to play. Note: key provided by Evolve.</p>
<p>The main game, aside from the intro, is set in a mysterious bunker during the first World War. The intro is really just a quick way to show you the controls but it's nicely done and really sets up the rest of the game, before you're told on-screen that you're now on your own and you awaken in The Bunker.</p>
<p>Here, something clearly terrible has happened (aside from the war setting of course), with no one left and the exit blocked your main objective is to get out alive by hopefully finding a way to blow a hole through some rubble. Easier said than done though, because you're being hunted by…something.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="5V3Si-MbUao"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/5389650448fde66defc478ad109d782f.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/5V3Si-MbUao" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For anyone who has played a game from Frictional Games before, you'll feel right at home. Poor choice of words probably, nothing about The Bunker is even remotely <em>homely</em>. Mechanically it has all the familiar bits like pulling open cabinets, drawers, picking up objects and throwing them, carefully opening doors and peaking around as you panic and run back in and lock the door because you heard a noise. Yup, it's a Frictional Amnesia game that's for sure. There's plenty of tweaks and upgrades they've included here though for The Bunker, with a fair bit more you can experiment with and some destruction to be had too.</p>
<p>Currently, I <em>cannot</em> recommend it on <em>Steam Deck </em>though. While it does perform well with a 40Hz lock with some tweaked settings, it has a rather glaring and immersion breaking graphical glitch with your left hand. Something you see constantly too, with glitches moving all over the hand it's just really off-putting. Your eyes just get drawn to it and it's annoying. Once that is fixed though, it would be an easy recommendation to buy and play there. I'm not entirely clear if it's a Proton bug, a game issue or an AMD GPU driver bug with Mesa but until that's solved, I would wait.</p>
<p>Valve actually gave it a Steam Deck "Playable" rating officially noting this problem and yes, it's playable, but I wouldn't say good enough with such a clear graphical glitch in your face for most of the game. Once I see it's solved, I'll let you know.</p>
<p>For <em>desktop</em> Linux though tested on Fedora KDE 38, at least with NVIDIA and Proton Experimental, the experience has been great. Performance is not an issue at all, apart from some loading bumps when going into specific sections it was an almost entirely silky-smooth 60FPS on max settings. You won't get any more than 60FPS right now either, as the game has a max locked FPS option of 60.</p>
<p>What's interesting here is the generator system. You <em>can</em> light up pretty much the entire bunker with a generator, which quickly becomes your new best friend. The problem is, it's very thirsty and will drink through fuel very quickly. So you need to be resourceful in finding enough fuel to power it up and get what you want done before it craps out on you - again. Especially so as your little wind-up hand-light is pretty rubbish because <em>of course it is</em>. Your torch is also very loud to wind it up because <em>of course it is</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2300098921686079406gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2300098921686079406gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The amount of times my torch ran out while I was in a room trying to figure out what to do, and as I began pulling the wire to power it up only to hear some crawling and growling, and nearly jumped out of my chair I've honestly lost count. The tension and foreboding atmosphere is so thick I could sit and hide inside it. This feeling of dread and panic only increases when you accidentally set off a trap, or catch a glimpse of the creature. On top of that there's minor tremors too, which really keeps that feeling of unease going even in quiet moments.</p>
<p>At one point the creature came at me when I made just a tiny bit too much noise, so I threw a grenade at it and somehow also set off a fire strap behind me and just my luck - the grenade completely missed. I was officially trapped between two horrifying ends. Death number…I don't even know anymore.</p>
<p>Everything about it is tense. Even when going through areas you already know, because you just never know when the noise you make is too much and where this <em>thing</em> will appear from. Certainly doesn't help with the manual save system, because I was often creeping back to it.</p>
<p>I like that you're actually given something resembling an arsenal here, so you're not entirely helpless, just <em>mostly </em>helpless. You have a gun, although ammo is limited and it won't kill the creature, only delay your probable demise. You have grenades, fuel that you can do some interesting things with, meat to try and get its attention and more. Death isn't the end here too, as long as you have a good recent save, just a setback on your path to freedom. The key is to be a quiet as possible, that gun and anything else noisy is a last resort.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8184642541686080419gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8184642541686080419gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>One thing I ended up doing is constantly barricading myself into a room I wanted to search — <em>and</em> covering up any holes. Just for that tiny extra peace of mind that it might have a little bit of a struggle to get to me, giving me a chance to get away. This is another part of what I love about Frictional and their physics and what makes The Bunker interesting, that you can move around various objects (and often you <em>need</em> to) as well using objects combined together or thrown around to break stuff to help you get somewhere.</p>
<p>As you go through it, you'll find all sorts of notes and photographs to collect. This is where you will gradually piece together the events leading up to where you are now. I won't go into all the details of course, because <em>spoilers</em>, but it's pretty easy to understand about digging big tunnels and unearthing something horrible. While the setting, theme and visuals are all quite fantastic and no complaints there, this game isn't really about the story at all it's the journey and how many different ways you can die trying to escape.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18872953411686081299gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18872953411686081299gol1.jpg"/></a><em>A little shot I like to call "nope".</em></p>
<p>I really can't see a reason <em>not</em> to suggest you pick it up if you're after a new horror experience on desktop. This is where I spent 99% of my time with it and there it really was an experience I won't be forgetting any time soon. The constant panic I felt, as I walked through dimly lit and often completely dark corridors in a very claustrophobic environment — yeah, that's going to stick with me. For Steam Deck, sit on it until the graphical glitch is solved.</p>
<p>I played most of it with bright sunlight (aside from replaying for some screenshots here), and it was still terrifying me and making me jump constantly. I'm not built for these types of games but I still somehow enjoy them. Apparently I just enjoy inflicting emotional pain on myself and if you do too then go grab it. For the absolute best experience put on some headphones, and dim the lights.</p>
<p><em>Once again Frictional have proven they know how to do horror.</em></p>

      <title>A fully transparent Steam Deck mod is on the way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>We've had transparent backplates for the Steam Deck for a while now but what about the front? Well, they're on the way from two different companies.</p>
<p>Firstly, <a href="https://jsaux.com/" target="_blank">JSAUX</a>, who make the most popular transparent backplates (<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/02/jsaux-makes-more-steam-deck-backplate-colours-available/" target="_blank">I showed off one here</a>) are working on their own fully transparent case for the Steam Deck. From speaking to JSAUX they told me this will be available in Krystal, Purple and Brown and they told me the backplate has a new design too as they've added new ventilation and improved the heat sink as well. Their first teaser posted to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/JSAUX/comments/13y957e/jsaux_updates_and_future_plans/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> can be seen below:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13191305301685959562gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13191305301685959562gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>In that same post, JSAUX also teased they're coming up with "several" new RGB-related stuff to make your Steam Deck look even more wild. So I'm very curious to see what they're cooking up, especially as I thought their <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/the-omnicase-2-from-jsaux-is-a-quality-usb-c-hub-worth-grabbing/" target="_blank">OmniCase 2 Pro</a> was fantastic.</p>
<p>On top of that, JSAUX just today showed off and sent me over a little teaser clip of what they will look like:</p>
<div class="ckeditor-html5-video" style="text-align: center;">
<video controls="controls" src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8350911171686068639gol1.mp4"></video>
</div>
<p>Looks really nice! Glad to see they've looked to improve the backplate at the same time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The other is <a href="https://extremerate.com/" target="_blank">eXtremeRate</a>, another company that makes various gaming accessories. They've begun teasing their own full shell for the Steam Deck, including transparent options but we don't know much more than what they showed in a brief GIF on <a href="https://twitter.com/ExtremeRate/status/1664649958606372867" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6176038981685959433gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/6176038981685959433gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>I wouldn't mind grabbing some backplates from eXtremeRate when they're available, to compare with what JSAUX have, especially since eXtremeRate don't seem to have the heat sink on the back which can get quite hot on the JSAUX versions.</p>
<p>Just a reminder: if you're going to take apart your Steam Deck - make sure you take out your Micro SD card. Don't snap it like me and many others ended up doing at some point. It's really easy to forget - so try not to, or you'll be sad and out of pocket.</p>
<p>The main issue here is that changing the frontplate is pretty intense, as you need to take the whole thing apart. Not something that's particularly easy and even iFixit note it down as "Difficult" to do in <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Steam+Deck+Front+Shell+Replacement/149125" target="_blank">their guide</a>. There's a fair amount you could mess up but still, no doubt many will go for it because it looks awesome.</p>

      <title>Dead Cells hits over 10 million sales</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Something that not many indie titles are able to do, Dead Cells has now managed to hit over 10 million sales and still going strong. This news was shared in a press release yesterday June 5th, via Tinsley PR.</p>
<p>It's not really a surprise though, Dead Cells is an absolutely magnificent game that keeps you coming back for more. It's had tons of free content upgrades, available on many platforms and a few DLC that have all been quite well received too. There's been updates from small additions to crossovers from other games and even the recent Return to Castlevania DLC which had plenty of positive reviews.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9448492901686057811gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9448492901686057811gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>From the press release: "Following the success of Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania, Evil Empire has been exploring the path forward for the title as a whole. With years of successful updates and expansions behind it after taking over live ops of Dead Cells in 2019, the studio is tinkering with its time-tested methodology, experimenting with ideas for future updates and new ways for fans to enjoy one of their favorite roguelikes."</p>
<p>Sounds like there's plenty more to come for Dead Cells…</p>
<p>Originally developed by Motion Twin, the studio has basically split into two with Evil Empire an off-shoot of people from Motion Twin but the two work closely together.</p>

      <title>Sandtrix is Tetris with sand - delightful, free and renamed after a DMCA</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Have a few minutes to kill here and there? Sandtrix could be what you need. It's free, has a Linux version and got the attention of Tetris Holding, LLC under the previous name Setris so it got a DMCA takedown but now it's <em>back</em>. But for how long?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2181415511686056406gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2181415511686056406gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The original page on itch.io for Setris is gone and just has a link to the <a href="https://itch.io/takedowns/2073998" target="_blank">copyright complaint</a> from Tetris Holdings, because the Setris name was so similar (and it noted the use of a "Russian Folk Song Registered Trademark") on top of that. So the developer has renamed it to Sandtrix and <a href="https://mslivo.itch.io/sandtrix" target="_blank">put it back up</a>. I wasn't even aware of it until now thanks to the DMCA so it's actually given it a bit of a boost.</p>
<p>Quite a fun spin on the basic idea of falling blocks. They come down in the usual shapes, but when they hit the bottom or some sand already there, they crumble into pieces. You need to cover an entire row from left to right in one colour to have it vanish and up your score. Really sweet to kill a few minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9759396161686056939gol1.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9759396161686056939gol1.gif"/></a></p>
<p>Head to the <a href="https://mslivo.itch.io/sandtrix" target="_blank">itch.io page</a> to check it out.</p>
<p>Looking around it probably got the attention of Tetris Holding because Kotaku and RPS both covered it recently when it was called Setris. So they must have people constantly looking around for anything resembling Tetris to strike.</p>

      <title>Transform creatures into tools in puzzle-platformer Transmogrify now with Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Released originally back in April, Transmogrify is a puzzle-platformer where you play as Chris — a janitor stranded at Future Perfect Labs where strange and deadly specimens have breached containment and overrun the facility. To help you get through it, you have access to the experimental Transmogrify device, which allows you to transform living creatures into tools and structures to get through various puzzles and platforming and hopefully escape the lab.</p>
<p>Just recently the developer added Native Linux support to the game, check the trailer below for more:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="oufdFenPFpk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/552950b2085589840482db6c4494321a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/oufdFenPFpk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Platform and puzzle your way through 75 levels across 4 unique worlds as Chris, the "courageous" janitor!</li>
<li>Overcome the bizarre experiments of Perfect Future Labs - and trust us, they get weird.</li>
<li>Solve the mystery of the emergency laboratory lockdown alongside your newfound AI companion, Grace.</li>
<li>Get that classic Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo feel with beautiful graphics, a unique mechanic, and a killer soundtrack.</li>
<li>Jump straight into the action - no long, drawn-out tutorials in this laboratory.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Speaking about the idea behind the game the developer said: "Transmogrify was conceived in the 2015 Ludum Dare game jam with the theme of ‘Unconventional Weapon’. A user on Twitter posted an added challenge of making the weapon non-lethal. I wanted to make something that felt different than the standard run-and-gun. We want players to feel smart as they teach themselves to solve puzzles, and discover new ways to do so. We want them to feel empowered as they act on their environment in different ways and to emphasize with Grace’s plight as the story unfolds within this facility."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/740310/Transmogrify/" target="_blank">buy it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental fixes up Halo MCC, Ubisoft Connect, Creativerse</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has released an update to Proton Experimental, bringing with it a few nice fixes for issues in various games so here's a run over what's changed.</p>
<p>This update was released June 6th as Valve continue to roll out upgrades to Proton Experimental first, before they merge them into the main Proton 8.0-x releases.</p>
<p>For newly supported games they're listing The Lord of the Rings: Gollum, not that I imagine many people are bothered by it with it being one of the worst releases this year. The more interesting changes are elsewhere that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed flipped videos in Secret of Mana and other titles.</li>
<li>Fixed Call of Duty 2 hanging when loading maps.</li>
<li>Fixed Creativerse hanging while exiting from a local game.</li>
<li>Fixed Ubisoft Connect intermittently having an invisible window.</li>
<li>Fixed a few Proton 8.0 regressions:
<ul>
<li>DJMAX RESPECT V is playable again.</li>
<li>Halo: The Master Chief Collection menus no longer are broken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Full changelog can be <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">seen here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Diablo 4 on Steam Deck is quite magnificent (and desktop Linux too!)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-gb/" target="_blank">Diablo 4</a> is just about to release for everyone, and after blasting through the Early Access I've been thoroughly impressed by how it runs on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you need to know how to install Battle Net on either Steam Deck or desktop Linux, I've covered multiple ways before. You can install it <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/heres-how-to-run-diablo-4-on-steam-deck/" target="_blank">directly using Proton</a> (no need for GE-Proton now though, just Proton Experimental is fine) or you can use the newer way with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/get-battlenet-ea-epic-games-and-more-on-steam-deck-the-easy-way/" target="_blank">the NonSteamLauncher script</a>. You could also try it through <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a>.</p>
<p>By default it will give you Low details but if you bump it up to Medium a little, lock it to 40FPS and turn on FSR 2 quality, you get a game that looks good and performs to a consistent level. Their FSR 2 implementation seems to be pretty great, and the reduced power drain will let you play for longer.</p>
<p>Here's a video and some thoughts on Steam Deck along with my settings:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j1jNbeM4Dlg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/19c29f927ec48ccf0ab75f7abda4786d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j1jNbeM4Dlg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Overall, it's an impressive show for performance and a lot of fun to play through. Nice to see another huge release working nearly to perfection on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Naturally I've been testing it on desktop Linux too where it also works. One issue I did have, was opening the map for the first time on desktop caused the game to lock up. Reloading and this wasn't a problem. Through repeated testing, it only seemed to happen the very first time. Apart from that, everything else on desktop with my NVIDIA 2080 Ti works as expected and I've been seeing over 100FPS at 2560x1440 in busy town areas, and much higher out in the open world. Overall, it seems to be great.</p>

      <title>Quasimorph is a brutal sci-fi extraction roguelike</title>
      <author>anewson</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quasimorph is a classic turn-based roguelike with an 'extraction' twist: you deploy into each mission with your clone, level up and collect equipment, then finish the mission to extract with your clone and loot.</p>
<p>It's a fantastic mechanic to add to the roguelike genre and makes for a natural metaprogression while preserving the brutality of classic roguelike games. Equip your high-level clone with all your best equipment only to make a mistake and die? Say goodbye to your gear and your clone. This, combined with other modern roguelike mechanics and an excellent visual aesthetic makes Quasimorph one to keep your eye on. The prologue is available for<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347110/Quasimorph_End_of_Dream/" target="_blank"> free on steam</a>, and runs flawlessly via Proton.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19009664191685908212gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/19009664191685908212gol1142.gif"/></a></p>
<p>Quasimorph takes inspiration from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/625960/Stoneshard/" target="_blank">Stoneshard</a> with a pain system that applies debuffs on damage received, body-part-specific damage, detailed character and enemy sprites that portray different armour and weapons, and light crafting and equipment maintenance mechanics. Be forewarned: also like Stoneshard, the game is <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>Visually, the game is a treat with great lighting effects and colourful maps. There are also excellent visual details: spent shell casings fly out of weapons and stay on the floor, walking over a bloodied corpse will have you trailing blood all over the place, doors and cover crumple under heavy fire, and empty loot containers look distinct from full ones.</p>
<p>Another excellent mechanic is the hunger system. Rather than simply being a passive requirement to occasionally eat food, your fullness acts as your energy store which you can use to take more actions per turn or regenerate health.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9908929661685908212gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9908929661685908212gol1142.gif"/></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>The story of the game also seems intriguing. You play a private military corp hired to find and extract the research data from a corporation that has just lost its war with your contractee (a particularly violently hostile takeover, your dispatcher notes).</p>
<p>Specifically, your employer is interested in extracting anything relating to "quasimorphosis," a technology relating to teleportation. It doesn't take long before you begin to discover some ugly truths about this research. Indeed, you'll realize something is off right in the first mission when you shoot a scientist only to have a skinless creature jump out of his corpse and hurtle towards you on all fours.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5182892341685908211gol1142.gif" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5182892341685908211gol1142.gif"/></a></p>
<p>The game isn't perfect; there are still some missing quality of life features like rebindable keys, simpler ways to interact with the UI, and some much needed features (shortcut for changing stance, splitting inventory stacks, and a force-move option to, for example, step on a corpse instead of looting it). The crafting system also fairly sparse, with around a dozen recipes available.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20622178571685908573gol1142.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20622178571685908573gol1142.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>The release date for Quasimorph is unknown. Due to Western sanctions (the development team Magnum Scriptum is based in Russia) the game is in something of a release limbo where the devs are unable to charge money for their game, but continue actively working on it.</p>
<p>An interesting side note: the devs refer to these sanctions (which are seriously impacting them) as "humanistic" in the steam forums, which likely gives you an inkling into their stance on the war in Ukraine. Trying the prologue is a great way to support this team and this game.</p>
<p>You can download the prologue<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347110/Quasimorph_End_of_Dream/" target="_blank"> free on Steam</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059170/Quasimorph/" target="_blank">wishlist</a> the full game.</p>

      <title>Canonical planning an immutable desktop version of Ubuntu</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This could be very interesting and exciting. Canonical has confirmed they're working towards an immutable version of Ubuntu for desktop users based on all the work they've done with Ubuntu Core.</p>
<p>Mentioned initially in a comment on <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/05/cups-snap-ubuntu-23-10#comment-6196766355" target="_blank">OMGUbuntu</a> with a target for the next LTS (long term support) release, later a full <a href="https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-core-an-immutable-linux-desktop" target="_blank">blog post</a> was put up on the official Ubuntu website going into more detail on their thoughts and plans. Don't worry though, the normal Ubuntu releases aren't going anywhere.</p>
<p>For those who don't follow what an immutable OS even is: in simple terms it keeps the main operating system as read-only, which is supposed to make it more stable, secure and easier to update with all your applications isolated from it with some sort of container system. So think like SteamOS on Steam Deck, Fedora Silverblue or Ubuntu Core and even Google's Chrome OS.</p>
<p>From the blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behind the scenes, the Canonical team has been actively exploring the benefits of Ubuntu Core beyond the realm of IoT, most notably in the context of developers and daily users.</p>
<p>The properties inherent to Ubuntu Core such as secure boot, recovery states and hardware backed encryption would bring significant improvements to the security posture of a user’s PC.</p>
<p>It also introduces the concept of modularity to the user experience, where users may experiment with alternative desktop environment snaps while remaining on a highly stable, signed and secure LTS base.</p>
<p>The use of snap channels also brings into the play the concept of ‘rolling’ certain elements of the distribution. Gamers, for example, might opt-in to a kernel channel that ships the latest NVIDIA drivers as soon as they are available, in the same way the Ubuntu Desktop team did for Mesa as part of our work on the Steam snap.</p>
<p>However, this level of stability and security comes with trade-offs for developers and tinkerers, restricting modification of the base OS in favour of a ‘just works’ experience. For developers who see their device as a platform for open source development, the solution is container-based environments similar to the LXD based Crostini. For tinkerers, the classic Ubuntu images would remain their preferred route to enable full control of (and responsibility for) their system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Ubuntu Core is meant for IoT OS for embedded devices, this is something different to give desktop users a potential taste of things to come. With the rise of more applications coming to the likes of Snap and Flatpak, this does make some sense and I think <a href="https://www.ypsidanger.com/the-distribution-model-is-changing/" target="_blank">Jorge Castro's blog</a> on how Linux distributions are changing is also a good read for what's to come.</p>
<p>Canonical has been expanding Snaps now for a while with the likes of the stable <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/ubuntu-2304-is-out-now-with-gnome-44-and-a-stable-steam-snap/" target="_blank">Steam snap for Ubuntu 23.04</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/05/cups-snap-ubuntu-23-10" target="_blank">CUPS</a> Snap and naturally plenty more to come.</p>
<p>How do you feel about an immutable version of Ubuntu with lots of Snap packages?</p>

      <title>NonSteamLaunchers adds support for the Minecraft Launcher and lots of bug fixes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The really interesting project NonSteamLaunchers to get all sorts of third-party launchers on Steam Deck like Battle.net, EA, Epic Games and more has now added support for Minecraft Launcher and fixed a lot of problems.</p>
<p>A project <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/get-battlenet-ea-epic-games-and-more-on-steam-deck-the-easy-way/" target="_blank">I recently showed off</a>, because it can really simplify and speed up the process of installing all these various launchers directly with Proton and automatically add their shortcuts into Steam.</p>
<p>Since I last covered it there's been a few new releases, one of which included a contribution I made to make it work properly on desktop Linux too. As of the latest release they've also added support for Minecraft Launcher (for Java and Dungeons), fixed various bugs, optimized the code, improved compatibility across the board, added support for the Glyph launcher, added a new logo and many other small adjustments to make it work better.</p>
<p>My previous video on it if you missed it:</p>

      <title>dbrand bring out a universal mount for Steam Deck Killswitch</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do you have the Killswitch case for your Steam Deck? Well dbrand have come up with their own universal mount so you can strap anything you want to the back of it.</p>
<p>It's equal parts fancy as it is simple. Fancy because it gives you a pretty cool (and slightly ridiculous) Valve to click into your Killswitch case, and the rest is just a simple strap that goes into it so you can hook up anything that will be able to fit into the strap. Seems like a pretty good idea.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9929168741685960060gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9929168741685960060gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can find the strap on <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/grip/steam-deck-cases?caseless=&amp;killswitch_umm_black" target="_blank">their store</a> available in Red pictured above or plain black costing $14.95.</p>
<p>Additionally, dbrand are now hiring and they announced it in the most dbrand possible way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the past year or so, we've had exactly one fear: Gabe Newell successfully infiltrating our knife-proof super fortress to exact revenge. A ridiculously specific fear, to be sure, but we've got some history. You see, we'd accidentally kidnapped him during the development of Project Killswitch. After his escape, our only recourse was to build the aforementioned super fortress. As an added precautionary measure, we've poured enormous sums of money into preparations for Gabe's inevitable assault - specifically, by assembling a knife collection to rival his own. During a recent meeting about Project Killswitch, our worst fear became a reality. Gabe Newell appeared before us, armed to the teeth with an assortment of blades. We had no time to prepare - it was as though he'd manifested out of thin air. In a moment of panic, we sacrificed the nearest scientist to appease Gabe's bloodlust. He was visibly confused. Turns out, he'd simply come to eliminate us for dethroning him as the world's leading knife connoisseur. To make a long story short, we gifted all of our blades to Gabe to make the problem go away. Incidentally, we're also short one expendible scientist. If you're looking for a job, <a href="https://careers.dbrand.com/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They're not the first to do this though. There's also the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/09/your-steam-deck-deserves-a-deckmate/" target="_blank">wonderful Deckmate</a> that allows you to stick anything to it, and JSAUX also have <a href="https://jsaux.com/products/modcase-for-steam-deck-pc0104" target="_blank">ModCase</a> that has a strap as well.</p>

      <title>Try the demo of Lueur and the Dim Settlers, a minimalist and relaxing survival builder</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With a minimalist art style and a more casual setting, Lueur and the Dim Settlers is a genuine little delight to play for those after a city-builder with survival elements but there's a more relaxed game mode too. Mentioned <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/lueur/" target="_blank">here on GOL recently</a>, there's now a demo available for you to give it a try and I think this one is truly worth some of your time. </p>
<p>After leaving Ubisoft, developer Darenn Keller has created something rather unique that sucked me right in straight away. Everything you do in Lueur is based on the tile system and there's many different types of tiles from forests to seas. Some may contain treasure, animals to farm and all sorts to discover as you go. You start off with only a small amount of tiles actually explored and as you expand, you don't know really what you're going to find so it has some fun exploration and mystery to it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12548784291685957969gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12548784291685957969gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Most tiles can be built upon and various buildings have adjacency bonuses too, so you're always thinking about how to best build up your city. In the survival mode it's pretty important too, since resources are constantly an issue and the timer is ever-ticking. Placing wheat fields next to a windmill would boost your food output for example, and so surrounding it with fields would be best but then you might not have space, so you might even need to demolish things you've already built. </p>
<p>My favourite feature are the little mini-games though. Say you need a quick bit of extra food or wood - so you find a tile with forest or animals, and do a little mini-game to collect the resources. Like the storms that come along to spread darkness, it's like a mini space-shooter where you're trying to defend against bullets coming down directly inside the little tile.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273311531685958215gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13273311531685958215gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It's a seriously clever idea just to make things a little bit different and quirky. I love it. The game will just keep surprising you as you play through and this is only the demo, it really does build up the excitement and intrigue for the full game that's now moving up quite a number of places on my wishlist.</p>
<p>The main thing is that it's not particularly long, or difficult. Even the survival mode is still pretty relaxed with the timer, events and exploration. The demo has one playable level available to play in three different modes, they estimate it will give you about 3 hours play time to finish it all and beat the challenges.</p>
<p>You can see their previous video to explain it better below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xCB-JrcixkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/8d3d44738be07ae9ffa7ffc1239181d2.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xCB-JrcixkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It has full Native Linux support built with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> and supports Steam Deck too. </p>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://system76.com/" target="_blank">System76</a> are the company behind the popular Pop!_OS Linux distribution, plus various laptops and desktops and now they're expanding once again. <em>Their Pop!_OS is in<a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/linux-hits-a-multi-year-high-for-user-share-on-steam-thanks-to-steam-deck/" target="_blank"> the top list for Linux</a> users on Steam.</em></p>
<p>For starters, they're going to be bringing out their own custom PC case for DIY builders. Carl Richell, the CEO and Founder, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@carlrichell@fosstodon.org/110471188327819605" target="_blank">mentioned on Mastodon</a> their new case is called the Nebula and it's set to arrive later this month for anyone who wanted a case inspired by their in-house custom-built Thelio desktop line. Here's what it looks like currently:</p>

      <title>Halls of Torment hits over 70K sales in the first week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a nice little indie success story for you! Halls of Torment from Chasing Carrots launched on May 24th into Early Access with Native Linux support and it works great on Steam Deck. They've announced that their launch week was pretty great!</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/aayph/status/1664192884990509056" target="_blank">Twitter</a> one of their team mentioned that they've had over 70,000 sales, 22,000 daily active users (with around 1,390 of those on Steam Deck) and over 29% of people played it over 10 hours. Great to see that even with so many games releasing on Steam all the time, with nearly 7,000 already this year, that we can see such a success so early for smaller games like this.</p>
<p>You can see my original <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/halls-of-torment-is-out-in-early-access-a-great-fusion-of-diablo-and-vampire-survivors/" target="_blank">release article here</a> and my video below:</p>

      <title>Linux hits a multi-year high for user share on Steam thanks to Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After some recent weirdness where March saw a big drop, the Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/?platform=combined" target="_blank">May 2023</a> is now showing the Linux share at a multi-year high.</p>
<p>Checking back over <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">our Steam Tracker</a> where we're keeping tabs on it over time, we've not seen the Linux user share being as high as it is right now in at least 6 years. The Linux user share is now on 1.47% with macOS on 2.39% and Windows at 96.14%,</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15843983561685710785gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15843983561685710785gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>When filtering the results over to just Linux here's the current most popular distributions for Steam gaming:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 25.32% + 2.55%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 9.99% + 0.20%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 9.72% - 1.12%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 7.27% - 0.34%</li>
<li>Manjaro Linux 64 bit 5.79% - 0.46%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 5.46% + 0.49%</li>
<li>Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS 64 bit 3.53% - 0.33%</li>
<li>Other 32.92% - 0.98%</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of absolute numbers we can take an educated guess here based on the last time Valve gave out their monthly active users, which they said was 132 million back in March 2022. So based on that 1.47% it would mean around 1,940,400 estimated monthly active users for Linux. However, Valve did <em>not</em> give out the number for the past year, and we know Steam is growing all the time, so in reality it's probably <em>much</em> higher.</p>

      <title>itch.io is hosting another big Queer Games Bundle for Pride Month</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>It's LGBT Pride Month which means there's another big bundle of games available in the Queer Games Bundle now on itch.io. Featuring 466 different items from 293 creators it's filled full with games, physical games, assets, soundtracks and more.</p>
<p>From the bundle page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we had the budget of an AAA game, we could give every solo developer in this bundle a livable wage multiple times over for a year and every single team a massive funding boost. Imagine what the developers and artists in this bundle could create a year from now if they weren’t worried about starving or how to pay their rent this month.</p>
<p>Purchasing the Queer Games Bundle is a direct action that you can take right now to support queer people in a life-changing way, and in exchange, you get over 450 amazing, heartfelt, fun, and radical games and artworks. </p>
<p>Help nurture our diverse queer arts community, fund the creation of the next great game you love, and find your new favorite game by purchasing the bundle today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's two different versions you can support the creators with the <a href="https://itch.io/b/1812/queer-games-bundle-2023" target="_blank">main bundle</a> and a <a href="https://itch.io/b/1813/queer-games-bundle-2023-pay-what-you-can-edition" target="_blank">PWYW bundle</a> ($10 minimum) for people who can afford less but still wish to grab it.</p>
<p>With this being the third year they've done the bundle, last year they managed to raise over $200K for all the creators involved across the two bundles.</p>

      <title>AirJet from Frore Systems could be great cooling for a Steam Deck 2</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If there's one thing I truly want from a Steam Deck 2 aside from the usual performance related upgrades, it would be better cooling and less noise. Perhaps the new AirJet from Frore Systems is what Valve could use.</p>
<p>What is it? According to Frore Systems the AirJet is a "fully self-contained active heat sink module, which is silent, thin, and light". This was revealed a little while ago at CES but interest in it is heating up again now, as they've <a href="https://www.froresystems.com/media-room/the-worlds-first-mini-pc-to-feature-airjet-r-launched-at-computex-2023" target="_blank">revealed</a> the first system coming with it in the ZOTAC ZBOX PI430AJ.</p>
<p>They're targeting many different types of devices including handheld gaming like the Steam Deck. Quite an exciting idea to have more space for other things since it's so small, a smaller slot would be needed for the intake and vent so less of your snack crumbs and dust would get in, reduced heat and being a whole lot quieter overall too. Although, it would push prices a bit no doubt.</p>

      <title>Proton Experimental update fixes &#34;many&#34; games on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has put out a small update to Proton Experimental, which should fix many games due to a <em>regression</em> that was hiding away. With this release they've updated the included version of DXVK, which is what does the Direct 3D 9 / 10 / 11 to Vulkan translation for Windows games on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>The changelog notes that it specifically fixes <em>Blazblue Centralfication</em> and <em>Kung-Fu Strike - The Warriors Rise</em> but they also mentioned a vague "many other games". It's one of those bugs their developers know would have hit numerous games but those are what they've re-tested and had reported working properly again. So if you saw a game that had some issues recently appear with Proton Experimental updates, time to check again.</p>
<p>Bugs that affect many titles is one of the fun parts of a translation layer like Proton, even a small change can potentially affect hundreds of games.</p>
<p>You can see the changelog <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How to change your Proton version:</strong></p>
<p>Steam Deck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a game in your Library and head to the little cog icon on the right.</li>
<li>Click Properties, then Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a Linux desktop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click a game, go to Properties.</li>
<li>Compatibility on the left.</li>
<li>Make sure the tickbox is done, then select Proton Experimental from the dropdown.</li>

      <title>Steam Deck OS update brings graphics driver fixes - ready up for SteamOS 3.5</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has now released two small graphics driver updates for Steam Deck OS (SteamOS) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3702568031445749185" target="_blank">3.4.8</a>, which means the Preview update channel is now ready for a big update to drop.</p>
<p>The updates included in 3.4.8 are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Updated graphics driver with a fix for a GPU crash in Splitgate.</li>
<li>Updated the graphics driver with performance improvements for STAR WARS Jedi: Survivor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These were left in the Preview channel for a while but now the Preview channel is <em>empty</em>, meaning the update many have been waiting for could be readying to drop into Preview real soon. We also haven't seen a major stable update in some time but Valve are constantly updating the Beta with client-side changes that eventually they will bundle into a stable update too.</p>
<p>SteamOS 3.5 is going to bring with it quite a lot including a Linux kernel upgrade, likely an updated KDE Plasma desktop version, more graphics driver upgrades, various additions to Gaming Mode like Soundtrack support and Screen Colour settings (teased in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyAmFvLdYbg" target="_blank">one of my videos</a>), adjustments to the performance overlay and no doubt plenty more.</p>
<p>Even Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais is doing a tiny little tease on <a href="https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1664081074300022785" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is out in Stable now, so Preview is nice and empty. 👀</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are you hoping that the new SteamOS upgrade brings with it?</p>

<p>Hello readers, it's been a while but it's time for a reminder that GamingOnLinux is funded by readers and it would be great to have your support!</p>
<p>GamingOnLinux is run quite differently to most other news sites. We're not littered with adverts everywhere and everything is open for everyone. There's no big backer and we're not part of a network with the same owner like a fair amount of other news sites.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It means we rely on <u>you</u> to keep the lights on! Want to help? Here's how you can:</p>
<p>Firstly, the best way is regular support via <strong><a href="https://www.patreon.com/liamdawe" target="_blank">Patreon</a></strong>. For Patreon, a suggestion is to pledge around the <em>start</em> of a month, as it charges at the beginning of every month. Sometimes there's special stuff to show early but generally the Patreon is just to have regular funding to keep bringing you the news (and videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/gamingonlinux" target="_blank">YouTube</a> - you can also be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamingonlinux/membership" target="_blank">YouTube Member</a>!). </p>
<p>All other donations, <em>without</em> any special rewards can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=P85ZZX9W8HFMW" target="_blank">Paypal Donations</a> <em>or</em> Monthly donation/sub: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-6MU983833N166101WL3ZRB5I" target="_blank">Supporter</a> - <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-54T30471MU837021GL3ZRCMY" target="_blank">Supporter Plus</a> </li>
</ul>

      <title>Physics be damned, go build some crazy stuff in Poly Bridge 3</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Dry Cactus have now released Poly Bridge 3, the latest in their multi-million selling physics-based bridge-building puzzle game series and it looks to be the wildest yet. As before, it comes with full Native Linux support.</p>
<p>The idea and the levels often look simple. Just build a bridge, to get vehicles over to the other side. However, it quickly throws in plenty of annoyances that will make you craft some of the most insane death-trap bridges ever made that would make an architect cry. "Suspension bridges, draw-bridges, multi-level bridges, crazy almost-bridges, bridges, bridges, bridges!" — as the developer says.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="e5tSnAh3P14"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2d7a96d57bfba549daefdbfe626b721d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/e5tSnAh3P14" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Campaign - Explore the new Open World Campaign with a dozen worlds and 100+ new levels. Jumps, Hydraulics, ‘Normal’ Bridges, and more giving you hours of gameplay to enjoy! Take a flying leap in Vaulting Towers or flex those hydraulic muscles in Bifrost Bend!</li>
<li>Sandbox - Let your engineering creativity flow with no restrictions in Sandbox mode, allowing you to push your bridge building skills to the limit. Challenge your friends and the community by designing intricate levels and publish them online for everyone to enjoy.</li>
<li>Community - Explore virtually infinite content and challenges designed by the community in the Steam Workshop. See what bridge designs other players come up with and show off your own in the Gallery. Challenge yourself and others by competing for the top spots in the cut-throat leaderboards and histograms.</li>
<li>Custom Physics - Our custom physics engine gives total control, reliability, and accuracy to your bridges. Sleep easy at night knowing your bridges will perform consistently every time!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There's plenty that's new in this latest release, other than over 100 levels of puzzles to build your way through. There's improved modding support, decoration objects, the ability to create all sorts for it from vehicles to random additional shapes to place throughout levels. In terms of gameplay there's now some that have "build zones" where the challenge is to build in a more confined space, new foundation materials for super-strong bridges (but they're expensive…) and pre-built materials to bring with you for a helping hand or even an additional obstacle.</p>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850160/Poly_Bridge_3/" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>New Stars is a slimmed down quicker Stellaris-like strategy sim</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Need your 4x space fix but find the likes of Stellaris just a bit too long? Perhaps keep an eye on the upcoming release of New Stars. It will have full Native Linux support at release.</p>
<p>"New Stars is a galactic 4X grand strategy game. Stranded on a new colony, and the last of your kind, you must advance your empire, from within and without. Go head-to-head with alien empires and build the greatest empire to survive the test of time, or be the last remaining in the galaxy to succeed."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/414831521685547637gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/414831521685547637gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Speaking to the developer asking them why someone would go for this game rather than an established name, this is what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) Relatively fast-paced - Each games last a few hours on average.<br/>
2) Straightforward mechanics - (Should be) Easy to learn with a new tutorial system.<br/>
3) Graphics - galaxy has improved since screenshots, with optimization for low-end devices.<br/>
4) UI - unique with elements inspired from a wide range of games.<br/>
<br/>
There are similarities to Stellaris, such as the fleet management and fleets in general, however the gameplay, mechanics, and pacing is a lot different. Civilization and Stellaris were originally the main inspirations for the game, but New Stars is it's own game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Highlighted Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customize your empire from world preferences, different ideologies with their own bonuses, hundreds of empire icons and more. Customize a unique galaxy based on your chosen settings. There are five different galaxy sizes to choose from.</li>
<li>Unique empires, species, and clans exist within a customizable and procedurally generated galaxy with limitless possibilities, and thousands of unique planets, stars and worlds. Some planets have valuable resources that can be collected.</li>
<li>Explore star systems and discover new secrets of the galaxy, and find clues to your lost home. Discoveries such as white dwarfs, ancient ruins, lost ships, and much more can be found between the abyss. Some planets have hidden features that increase their value.</li>
<li>Expand your empire across new stars to new frontiers, and build strong colonies that will power your galactic economy. Collect natural resources from planets and stars using starhubs. Beware of pesky barbaric clans that may plunder your resources for their own gain.</li>
<li>Merge ships into one fleet, and combine them against your adversaries. Defend against attacks by upgrading starbases, or fortifying your colonies. Research new ship types or advanced military capabilities to get an edge over your alien foes.</li>
<li>Declare wars, trade resources, make agreements, declare friendships, share intel, forge powerful alliances, and much more. Some empires may be openly hostile or require appeasing, others may be cooperative, and some may be integrated into your empire.</li>
<li>Construct modular starships from unlocked modules, and turrets. Unlock larger ships and more powerful ship types, sections, turrets, and more. There are almost limitless combinations to meet your empire's needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their latest progress report video can be seen on it below:</p>

      <title>The OmniCase 2 from JSAUX is a quality USB-C hub worth grabbing</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>A while ago hardware accessory maker JSAUX sent over the OmniCase 2 Pro, and it's a great USB-C hub worth grabbing if you need some extra ports for a Steam Deck, a desktop, laptop or anything in between.</p>
<p>This isn't a typical Steam Deck focused accessory from JSAUX that they've become known for over the last year, instead it has a wide target of anyone who needs the ports. However, they are doing a special Steam Deck stand just for it along with a laptop stand as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11263710001685544918gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11263710001685544918gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You can pick between two models of either the OmniCase 2 or the OmniCase 2 Pro, with the difference being that the Pro model has Display Port, an extra HDMI port and an extra USB-C port although the Pro model also has one less USB-A. So it really all depends on what ports your after to hook up some more devices.</p>
<p>It's all about the insides. Giving you space to store the wires, and storing any little cards you might need when on the go. The lid just pulls off and slots back on with low-powered magnets, same with the stand for the Steam Deck and also the laptop stand as well.<a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14106806221685544931gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14106806221685544931gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>With my time spent primarily using it on Steam Deck, it's been a perfect experience. I absolutely cannot fault this device. As a USB Hub, it does exactly the job you want it to while also being small enough to stick in your pocket and walk away with it to set up again somewhere else easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16905059371685544835gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This is actually the device I've been using exclusively for all my recent Steam Deck videos and footage, and it hasn't let me down at all over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>It sure is sturdy too - it's built like a mini-tank. If you drop it on your foot, that's going to hurt and it will laugh at you. Don't ask me how I know that. Probably the best build quality of anything JSAUX has sent over so far. There's really not a whole lot else to say - you get what's advertised and it's just plain and simply great.</p>
<p>Cost is the important question though of course and the normal price is about £49 for the OmniCase 2 and about £65 for the OmniCase 2 Pro. You can bundle it with different extras like the stands for more.</p>
<p>An easy recommendation from me for anyone in the market for such a device. It has come in very hand over here. A very tidy little device. You can find it <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jsaux/omnicase-2-the-usb-c-hub-for-gamers-and-digital-nomads" target="_blank">on Kickstarter</a> where it's already proving quite popular gathering close to £20K in funding in the first hour.</p>
<p>If you do go for it, you can expect to see it arrive August onwards.</p>

      <title>Heroic Games Launcher 2.8.0 adds a DLC manager for Epic Games, side-loading browser apps</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Heroic Games Launcher, my favourite way to get Epic Games and GOG on Steam Deck and desktop Linux released v2.8.0 with some great new features - here's a run over what's new and improved.</p>
<p>There's three headline features for this release: the first being a DLC Manager for Epic Games. Giving you more control over what you're installing, letting you pick from various DLC at install time to make it really easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12623992921685529467gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/12623992921685529467gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Also added in is support for side-loading browser apps and games, although DRM'd content like Netflix won't work for now. Testing it with Xbox Cloud gaming, the new side-loading feature there worked fine, so it could be useful for lots of different things. The app will also auto download Wine if it didn't find any on the system, which should smooth-over some rough edges for beginners.</p>
<p>Other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed installation/update progress reports to the frontend.</li>
<li>Numerous UI fixes in the Nord Light theme.</li>
<li>Added missing Sideload game cover when no URL provided.</li>
<li>Fixed Linux native games failing to add to the launcher.</li>
<li>Missing GOG download size in the download manager.</li>
<li>Fixed installation of games that have Selective downloads (Fortnite, Fallout NV, and others).</li>
<li>Made login screen more responsive.</li>
<li>Improved sidebar link effect.</li>
<li>Improved handling of shortcuts from the frontend without depending on the menu.</li>
<li>Updated translations.</li>
<li>Several other fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new browser side-loading is quite useful, here's a demo on Steam Deck but also tested on desktop:</p>

      <title>Get Battle.net, EA, Epic Games and more on Steam Deck the easy way</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>There's many different ways to get third-party launchers onto Steam Deck like Battle.net, EA, Epic Games and many others. Here's one way that does most of the work for you.</p>
<p>A developer has created a <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck" target="_blank">GitHub project</a>, with a simple script to download and run that will then download and set up the launchers of your choice - this even includes then adding their shortcuts to Steam. It's a fun idea and for those who prefer adding launchers to Steam directly to use Proton instead of using something like Lutris or Heroic, this can be a nice time saver.</p>
<p>Here's an example on Steam Deck with Battle.net and pre-loading Diablo 4:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="esD_Rk3JZP4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/933109e54a2541e3b5d8eee9c237a987.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/esD_Rk3JZP4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p><em>As with any third-party stuff, use at your own risk but I've tested it and it really does work great.</em></p>
<p>All you need to do is download the script, pop it on your desktop for convience and then run it and it will be self-explanatory when going through it. One Steam quirk I've seen is that the shortcut might not work right away or let you change the compatibility options, just reload Steam if that's the case.</p>
<p>For people on <em>desktop</em> Linux, it works just as well there, although I've made a <a href="https://github.com/moraroy/NonSteamLaunchers-On-Steam-Deck/pull/32" target="_blank">pull request</a> for it not to assume "deck" as the username for the Steam shortcut which will ensure it works properly. Until then, you can just adjust the username to match yours in the Properties of the shortcut on Steam in the Launch Options.</p>

      <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart hits Steam on July 26th as Sony continue their PC expansion</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Sony PlayStation, Insomniac Games and Nixxes Software are bringing Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart to Steam as Sony continue bringing more console games to PC.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here is that their feature list mentioned how it will have many graphics quality options so you can tailor the experience to "a wide range of devices, all the way from high-end PCs to portable PC gaming devices" — Steam Deck anyone? Hopefully this will work nicely at release with <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2019/07/a-simple-guide-to-steam-play-valves-technology-for-playing-windows-games-on-linux/" target="_blank">Proton</a> on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. It will have a pretty wide array of options like NVIDIA DLSS 3, AMD FSR 2, Intel XeSS, Ray Tracing, ultra-wide support and much more. Sounds like they're really going all-out on this one.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="i_jZ3BV6Adc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/c0b79677925a79e6c335f481dee2ffec.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/i_jZ3BV6Adc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Such an awesome time to be a gamer on PC, seeing many more previously console exclusive games arriving. Will this be something you'll be playing on desktop Linux or Steam Deck? Must admit it looks pretty good and the previous PlayStation reviews of it have been quite glowing.</p>
<p>You can follow it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895880/Ratchet__Clank_Rift_Apart/" target="_blank">Steam</a> where it's available for pre-order.</p>
<p><em>Note: the article originally stated it released on July 29th which was incorrect, it launches July 26th. Apologies on the error.</em></p>

      <title>Settlement-building strategy game Circle of Kerzoven is up on Kickstarter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Made with <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a> with full Native Linux support planned, Circle of Kerzoven is an upcoming settlement-building strategy game with some heavy simulation going on.</p>
<p>This isn't your typical city-builder with seemingly every element of it having something simulated that you need to take care of. Your people have individual needs, a specific home and place of work and then there's all the animals as they each need food and drinks, sleep and social interactions. Your actions will have a direct consequence on the lands - so animals can become extinct, or grow wildly out of control, there are seasons and weather that will affect your gameplay and the list seems to go on.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZiVEJ4QytSo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/e13a2b5bfc6888fd03b14089fdc5f386.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZiVEJ4QytSo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Unique deep simulation of the nature in a building strategy game with complex interdependence of humans in nature.</li>
<li>Manage simultaneously the acquisition, refining and distribution of resources on multiple maps in different climatic conditions.</li>
<li>Manage the needs of the citizens. They are “alive” and have a specific home, workplace, and unique needs.</li>
<li>Animals are looking for food, get thirsty, sleepy and form social groups to find their place in nature.</li>
<li>Plants grow and are affected by the actions of the humans, animals, and their environment.</li>
<li>The seasons and climatic conditions affect the gameplay, as certain plants only grow in certain conditions and temperature affects humans, animals, plants, and the environment.</li>
<li>Interact and trade with other factions where all items were crafted with same rules as for the player.</li>
<li>Create own maps and scenarios in the editor and extend through mod support.</li>
<li>Charming and calm low poly art style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The developer is seeking funding on their new Kickstarter campaign, where they're hoping to gather at least €15,000 EUR by June 29th. Currently Early Access is planned for Q4 2023 with a full release sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>I spent a little time with the Alpha Demo the developer sent a key over for and it's already pretty impressive. Although, I did find the UI a little on the small side <em>but</em> the developer is already showing up many others this early on, with a UI scaling option that works great. Once turned up a bit - it's all looking good. Nice atmosphere to it overall and you really can see the kind of simulation they're going for, with every person and creature clickable to see all their needs, like a hungry European Hare that keeps pinching my food.</p>
<p>Seems like a great start!</p>

      <title>NVIDIA driver 535.43.02 Beta for Linux updates Wayland support, new Vulkan extensions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has released the <a href="https://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/205050/en-uk" target="_blank">535.43.02 Beta driver</a> for Linux today, bringing with it support for multiple newer Vulkan extensions and extends Wayland support further.</p>
<p>The new Vulkan extensions support on Turing+ GPUs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_memory_priority.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_memory_priority</a></li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_pageable_device_local_memory.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_pageable_device_memory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Other extensions now supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_queue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_queue.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_queue</a></li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h264.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_h264</a></li>
<li><a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_h265.html" target="_blank">VK_KHR_video_decode_h265</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For Wayland the NVIDIA driver now supports version 4 of the DMA-BUF Wayland protocol, plus there's a Wayland fix for a bug that prevented PRIME render offload from working for Wayland applications when running on a system with an AMD iGPU.</p>
<p>This driver release also improves performance of Minecraft Java Edition on RTX 3000 series GPUs, adds support for driving very high pixel clock mode timings such as 8K @ 60Hz, extends Dynamic Boost support on notebooks to include older Renoir and Cezanne chipsets, adds nvoptix.bin to the driver package used with the OptiX ray tracing engine library and now support for suspend and resume when using GSP firmware.</p>
<p>All the other improvements and bug fixes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a memory leak in the NVIDIA GLX driver, as reported at: <a href="https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/asan-reports-memory-leak-in-libnvidia-glcore-so-515-57/222697" target="_blank">https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/222697</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Vulkan X11 swapchain creation to fail on GPUs without a display engine when the VK_KHR_present_id extension is used.</li>
<li>Fixed console restore on legacy VGA consoles when using the NVIDIA Open GPU Kernel Modules.</li>
<li>Removed libnvidia-compiler.so.VERSION from the driver package. This functionality is now provided by other driver libraries.</li>
<li>Added power usage and power limits information to nvidia-settings PowerMizer page.</li>
<li>Updated NV_CTRL_GPU_POWER_SOURCE NV-CONTROL API to report undersized power source.</li>
<li>Added NV-CONTROL attributes NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_MODE and NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MULTIPLY_DIVIDE_VALUE to allow syncing a Quadro Sync II card to different House Sync signal rates. This feature requires firmware version 2.18 or later.</li>
<li>Added an application profile to avoid performance problems in Xfce 4 when the OpenGL compositor backend is enabled along with G-SYNC.</li>
<li>Moved the nvidia-settings application icon into the 'hicolor' icon theme, which allows it to be customized by other icon themes selected in the desktop environment.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented nvidia-installer from recording kernel log output to the installer log in some module loading failure paths.</li>
<li>Changed nvidia-installer to no longer use the $XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable. XDG data files are now installed to a path specified by the --xdg-data-dir option, or /usr/share if not specified.</li>
<li>This fixes a problem when Flatpak is installed that caused the installer to place the nvidia-settings.desktop file in /root/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications.</li>
<li>Changed the behavior of glXGetRefreshRateSGI() for non-integer refresh rates to round to the nearest whole number rather than truncating.</li>
<li>Changed the compression format of the .run installer package from xz to zstd. This results in a smaller compressed package, and faster decompression performance. A fallback zstd decompressor is embedded into the installer package for systems which do not already have a zstd decompression program installed.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused nvidia-installer to mistakenly unload some already loaded non-NVIDIA kernel modules.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which caused incorrect reporting of presentation times when using the VK_NV_present_barrier Vulkan extension.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The Outlast Trials manages to sell over 500K in the first week</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Outlast Trials released from Red Barrels on May 18th was something a bit special, with it Steam Deck Verified and working great on desktop Linux with Proton.</p>
<p>After so many thoroughly broken and disappointing releases recently, it was very nice to see a release come out that not only worked properly but performed well and looked great too. Seems many took notice, as it managed to sell <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRedBarrels/status/1662179977486319627" target="_blank">over 500K</a> copies in the first week! A huge milestone for Red Barrels, showing many developers how it's done. At time of writing it has a Very Positive user score on Steam from 14,822 counted reviews.</p>
<p>You can see my previous Steam Deck video below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zF-WOfOCKpI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/67e687c0aec20289c707a7f1dc92457c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zF-WOfOCKpI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>"Set in the era of the Cold War, human guinea pigs are involuntarily recruited by the good folks at the Murkoff Corporation to test advanced methods of brainwashing and mind control. In a world of distrust, fear, and violence, your morals will be challenged, your endurance tested, and your sanity crushed. All in the name of progress, science, and profit."</p>
<p>Have you been checking it out? Let me know your thoughts on The Outlast Trials in the comments. Really great to see another good game, that's popular, working so well on Steam Deck and desktop Linux and it's only in Early Access so it's going to keep expanding.</p>
<p>It's a pretty surprising game and really puts me on edge playing it. The kind of game that you should play with headphones on in a dark room for the full experience. Scary stuff!</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/the-outlast-trials?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304930/The_Outlast_Trials/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Do some drifting with a cruise ship in Summer Trip Cruise</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Summer Trip Cruise looks like a fun little game, giving you control of a cruise ship that you need to keep afloat while avoiding various obstacles with on-screen controls. In a way, the idea looks little like <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/the-absolutely-genius-frick-inc-from-kenney-is-now-up-on-steam/" target="_blank">Frick Inc</a>. </p>
<p>"Take a cruise through different countries. Relax as you enjoy the views, and tourists take pictures of their favourite landmarks. Take it easy - or not so much! But most importantly: be careful. You will be able to navigate through different countries, each with its own architectural style, environment and music. Close your eyes and feel like you are there, but not for too long or the consequences will be catastrophic."</p>

<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use your mouse to drive with the on-screen controls.</li>
<li>Game driven by physics.</li>
<li>15 handmade levels set on 3 different countries.</li>
<li>Beautiful music unique to each country.</li>
<li>Scoring system (don't crash, take the photo and beat the time mark).</li>
<li>World leaderboards to see who is the fastest captain.</li>
<li>Twitch integration: join the cruise of your favorite streamer and cross your fingers that you won't die if the captain has to crash.</li>

<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">Seems like quite a fun idea for a game. Nice for those of you who like smaller more casual experiences for your coffee breaks perhaps.</span></p>

      <title>Valheim devs clarify stance on modding including a clear no to paid mods</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Iron Gate mentioned recently they've been getting many questions on their stance of modding Valheim, so they wrote a post to give their thoughts including the subject of paid mods.</p>
<p>Valheim doesn't actually have official modding support but that's never really stopped anyone has it? Mods help keep games alive for years after developer move on, so it's pretty much always a good idea to support it.</p>
<p>In their post on their <a href="https://www.valheimgame.com/news/regarding-mods" target="_blank">official site</a> (and also Steam), Iron Gate mentioned how they're "happy" to see people make mods and they find it "flattering" people wish to do it, however by not having official support they're not giving any kind of guarantees that mods will work between releases - so you do so at your own risk. </p>
<p>On the subject of paid mods though? They're not particularly happy about that as they do "not condone locking modded content behind a paywall" and they feel that charging money for a mod "is against the creative and open spirit of modding itself, and therefore we urge all mod authors to make their mods freely available to all who want to play them". They have no problem with donations but they don't want to see any part of a mod behind a paywall.</p>
<p>Additionally, they're asking mod creators to ensure they make it clear that their work is unofficial.</p>
<p>Every developer will likely feel different about this, as will a fair amount of gamers. How do you feel about paid mods?</p>
<p>Valheim is available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/valheim?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is Steam Deck Verified.</p>

      <title>Tactical RPG &#39;Radix Chronicle&#39; getting Linux support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Radix Chronicle is an in-development tactical RPG from Marcus Sanders, better known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@EpicNameBro/featured" target="_blank">EpicNameBro</a> for making videos about Fromsoft games and their own game will now support Linux.</p>
<p>Inspired by classics on SNES and early PlayStation classics, Radix Chronicle will bring with it some dark themes and bright characters with a fantasy setting that changes depending on how you fight. One bit that makes it interesting is that there's no RNG for the fights, no 99% hit chances that miss. Instead, every action has a timing trial you need to hit a bit like a rhythm game almost. The resolution is a bit cramped though, as it was originally designed for Android but they said it grew to the point of wanting to do a PC release.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="Jqus-OWqk54"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/ccae9a0285acd4c973afd9742c92dc04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/Jqus-OWqk54" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It's currently crowdfunding on Kickstarter and seems popular, as it still has 24 days to go and has nearly $40K pledged against the $33K goal so clearly gamers are interested.</p>
<p>Originally they said Linux support would be "probable" but in recent <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/enb/radix-chronicle/posts/3818396" target="_blank">public update</a> they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a very busy and very successful day, but we're not resting yet. First of all: we're going to officially offer Linux as a platform choice on Kickstarter now! This includes anyone who already backed it at a tier that features the game. Later in development, we will send out backer surveys (to you as an individual) about preferred platform and then use that to determine which version you get. </p>

      <title>Steam Deck hits South Korea retail via Electromart on June 1st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve's partner Komodo has announced that they're expanding the Steam Deck retail presence into South Korea on June 1st. They'll be doing this through Electromart through a partnership with SHINSEGAE I&amp;C, the leading retail tech company of SHINSEGAE, the largest retail group in South Korea. This will include the Steam Deck and the Docking Station at all of the Electromart stores nationwide.</p>
<p>This follows on from the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/04/steam-deck-hitting-retail-stores-in-japan-from-april-29th-south-korea-to-follow/" target="_blank">expansion into Japan</a> in late April plus <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/steam-deck-hitting-retail-in-hong-kong-taiwan-and-later-japan-and-south-korea/" target="_blank">Hong Kong and Taiwan back in March</a>.</p>
<p>From the press release:</p>
<p>Ricky Uy, CEO of KOMODO, said: </p>
<p>“We continue working towards our goal of bringing Steam Deck to as many customers as possible, and we are very pleased to be working with SHINSEGAE I&amp;C to launch retail sales in South Korea. We also plan to offer more Steam Deck trial opportunities in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Joon Jung, Vice president of SHINSEGAE I&amp;C, said:</p>
<p>“Based on our solid distribution channels and know-how, SHINSEGAE I&amp;C is continuously expanding its business portfolio in the gaming sector, from gaming device distribution to game IP and publishing. We look forward to working with KOMODO to introduce Steam Deck to a wider range of Korean gamers through SHINSEGAE I&amp;C’s various retail stores.”</p>
<p>Komodo also stated they have plans for plenty more promotions and events to come but not hints as to what.</p>

      <title>Nintendo blocked Dolphin emulator release on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 29/05</strong>: According to Pierre Bourdon on <a href="https://mastodon.delroth.net/@delroth/110440301402516214" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, who was Dolphin's treasurer for the foundation backing the project (Bourdon is stepping down), Valve actually initiated the conversation to check in with Nintendo on this. So this is not a DMCA takedown request but Nintendo said it <em>would</em> violate the DMCA anti-circumvention provisions, so Valve took it down. So there's technically nothing for Dolphin to counter here.</p>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-wii-emulator-dolphin-valve-piracy-1850482929" target="_blank">Kotaku</a> also got a statement from Nintendo on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nintendo is committed to protecting the hard work and creativity of video game engineers and developers,” a spokesperson for Nintendo told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. “This emulator illegally circumvents Nintendo’s protection measures and runs illegal copies of games. Using illegal emulators or illegal copies of games harms development and ultimately stifles innovation. Nintendo respects the intellectual property rights of other companies, and in turn expects others to do the same.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>The article title was updated to better reflect the situation.</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><u><em>Original article below for context:</em></u></p>
<p>Back in March the plan was announced for the Wii and GameCube emulator Dolphin to release on Steam, along with some useful Steam features but now that seems unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>The Dolphin team has now announced that their Steam page was taken down, as Nintendo sent a cease and desist notice to Valve about it. Here's the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/27/dolphin-steam-indefinitely-postponed/" target="_blank">statement</a> they released:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is with much disappointment that we have to announce that the Dolphin on Steam release has been indefinitely postponed. We were notified by Valve that Nintendo has issued a cease and desist citing the DMCA against Dolphin's Steam page, and have removed Dolphin from Steam until the matter is settled. We are currently investigating our options and will have a more in-depth response in the near future.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience in the meantime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a shame.</p>
<p>Why now though? Dolphin has been around since 2003 for GameCube, adding basic Wii support in 2007, so Dolphin was there during the time the Wii was still being fully supported. Nintendo also only went after the Steam page, not the project as a whole as it can still be found on <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/" target="_blank">official site</a>. According to a comment from the Citra developer on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/13ss1o9/comment/jlry1kq/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, it's due to Dolphin including decryption keys with the project.</p>
<p>Really, it's not going to do Nintendo much good, it's put Dolphin all over the news and even more people will now know about it and end up using it.</p>

      <title>Stone Age farming life-sim Roots of Pacha has returned to Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/roots-of-pacha-removed-from-steam-after-fight-with-publisher-crytivo/" target="_blank">messy situation</a> with their publisher, Soda Den has now split from Crytivo and Roots of Pacha has returned for sale on Steam.</p>
<p>What is it? Roots of Pacha is basically Stardew Valley but in the Stone Age. That is the simplest way to explain it and it's actually a really good description of it. There's plenty of additions and differences of course and it has been reviewing well so it was a shame when it vanished.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="9zX8OrNV4oE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/dac50ade19f2c6d7d17462e4a08569d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/9zX8OrNV4oE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Here's the statement shared in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past two weeks, Crytivo and Soda Den have worked tirelessly to achieve the common goal of restoring Roots of Pacha on Steam. We are happy to share we have reached an agreement and that Roots of Pacha has been restored to Steam for all to purchase.</p>
<p>We also would like to share that Crytivo and Soda Den have made the decision to amicably part ways under terms that are mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Soda Den sincerely thanks the Crytivo team for their efforts to support and market Roots of Pacha. Crytivo sincerely thanks Soda Den for their dedication and craft that went into the creation of Roots of Pacha.</p>
<p>Our collective priority has always been the fans. We hope that the restoration of the Steam store page brings you joy.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support.</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Crytivo and Soda Den</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed it they also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1245560/discussions/0/5617721963192270287/" target="_blank">added a Native Linux build</a>, mainly for the Steam Deck, where they believe it will work better overall. Now the situation is sorted, I'll be going and taking another look at it.</p>
<p>Available to buy on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/roots-of-pacha?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245560/Roots_of_Pacha/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Many years later Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is still getting better</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Originally released in 2002 and then later as Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition from Beamdog, many years on it's still getting major upgrades including a new Toon shader and loading speed improvements.</p>
<p>"Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition adds all-new enhanced features to the content of Neverwinter Nights Diamond Edition. Slink through the shadows as a deadly half-elven rogue, wield fearsome magics as a powerful gnomish sorcerer, vanquish your foes as an armor-clad dwarven paladin... whatever hero you create, incredible adventures await. Discover magic, wonder, and danger at every turn on your own or with friends in these classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventures."</p>
<p>Build 8193.35 was released on May 24th and here's what's new:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Spells and spell-like abilities now display a targeting indicator displaying their range and, if appropriate, their AOE shape and size.</li>
<li>Added support for up to 8 multiclasses, configurable per-module.</li>
<li>Improved area load times by up to 100x!</li>
<li>Added an in-game News UI that shows upcoming patches and community news.</li>
<li>NUI windows will no longer break input to the game (WASD, drag&amp;drop).</li>
<li>Added a new "Toon" postprocessing shader.</li>
<li>Hundreds of new functions and goodies for module builders.</li>
<li>Hundreds of bugfixes and optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For the new Toon shader, here's an example of the differences. First shot is normal, second on the Toon shader:</p>

      <title>If You Like... Left 4 Dead</title>
      <author>scaine</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>What’s this? An entirely new genre, you say? Well, arguably that’s exactly what Valve presented to the public in 2008 with the original Left 4 Dead, and its superlative sequel the following year. But was it really a new genre?</p>
<p><em>IYL will be a short series of articles delving into various genres and looking at the best examples in each. I’ll follow a standard layout. I’ll start with a bit of history about the most famous game representing the genre. Next, I’ll cover a game that’s very similar to the original, then (hopefully!) any games that have surpassed it since, and finally any games that do things in a unique way, but still tipping their hat to the original. Then it’s over to you to tell me how wrong I am, in the comments!</em></p>
<p>Well, that gets a little tricky, but I’m going to say yes. For example, the original Killing Floor, which has a similar basis, was originally a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004 and debuted in 2005. But true to the base game, Killing Floor didn’t feature a story, and the entire “mission” was a single area with random trader spawns after each “wave”. I’m not sure that formula justifies being called genre-defining.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Left 4 Dead launched with so many unique features, it’s hard to keep track of it all! Player characters had… character. They had multiple situational voicelines, prompts and interactions during play that went beyond the usual “RELOADING” scream. They had back stories which, while not relevant to gameplay, gave the whole world a sense of realism.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17159671141684876872gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17159671141684876872gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>A realism which was echoed by zombie animations which even today remain sensational. This was Havoc physics… but without the jank. In fact, it turns out that the Source’s physics engine that powers that animation, called <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VPhysics" target="_blank"><u>VPhysics</u></a>, is actually based on early Havoc builds, back before it was owned by Intel or Microsoft and was actually open-source. The good old days. Seeing the zombies lean into turns, stumbling out of fires, or tripping over objects is something you rarely see, even in modern games.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9980314741684876873gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9980314741684876873gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>And that physics engine is used everywhere - you can break windows, blow up barriers, see chairs or TVs flying around from the power of your gunfire. The zombie “tank” has a melee attack that sends cars flying - an instant KO if one hits your character!</p>
<p>Then there’s the dynamic lighting and shadows, the scene setting and sound design, the idle animations, the themed zombie types (military, hospital, etc) and the complete lack of a loading screen from the start of a mission to the end and an AI “Director” that changes the difficulty depending on how well you do, encouraging replay. Combined, it delivered an atmosphere that inspired a believable sense of dread and panic.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21125102471684876873gol573.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21125102471684876873gol573.png"/></a></p>
<p>And the multiplayer didn’t just stop at the survivors. No, Valve also let you play PvP, putting  you in the shoes of multiple types of “special” infected, from Hunters that leap huge distances, or Chokers who throw their tongues out from afar to reel in the player, to the slow moving but devastating bloater that will summon a horde of zombies to the player, even in death. This all makes for a fascinating blend of tense strategy, forced cooperation and genuine jump scares.</p>
<p>And as usual for these articles, I haven’t covered mods… but they’re there. Oh, they’re so, so there, all <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse?appid=550" target="_blank"><u>120 thousand</u></a> or so!</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>A direct clone - Back 4 Blood [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/924970/Back_4_Blood/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>And then there was Left 4 Dead 3! At least, that’s the reputation Turtle Rock Studios were flattered with when the mainstream gaming media proclaimed them the “creators of Left 4 Dead” and hyped Back 4 Blood, an attempt at modernising the Left 4 Dead experience.</p>
<p>It didn’t quite work out that way, however, when it launched in October 2021. Turtle Rock Studios are still asking £49.99 for Back 4 Blood, despite its “mixed” review status on Steam. Throw in a touch of Denuvo DRM, a <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/924970" target="_blank"><u>silver</u></a> rating on ProtonDB (including a lack of EAC support that kills the multiplayer), janky AI, and a complete lack of mod support and frankly, it’s amazing that quite a few media outlets rated it as high as 8/10. User reviews on metacritic were harsher, scoring it 5.4 overall.</p>
<p>I won’t spend any more time on this one, except to quote this comment from “Neon357” from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=EdRLNUGmFC8" target="_blank"><u>this daming Youtube video</u></a> which compares the two games.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best thing that Back for Blood accomplished was making people realize how good Left 4 Dead really was</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Games that do it better - Deep Rock Galactic [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>I nearly didn’t buy Deep Rock Galactic. As a man born in the 70’s, I grew up learning first hand what a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcb4_QwP6fE" target="_blank"><u>hive of scum and villainy</u></a> the internet actually is. It started with Doom, then Quake, Quake 2, Unreal Tournament and ultimately Call of Duty. It was probably CoD that finally killed any interest I had to play with “randos” (random people on the internet). And here was Deep Rock Galactic, a game that forces four randos together and the only hope of their survival is cooperation. That… just can’t happen these days, right?</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8774473041684876870gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8774473041684876870gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Rock and Stone, brother! I can’t explain it. I really can’t. But when you land in a hosted session in this game and burst out of your delivery pod, you press V to shout “Rock and Stone” and wave your axe in greeting, and instantly all other players will do the same. It’s uncanny. Yet so wholesome and heart warming. You’re a team, after all.</p>
<p>There’s rarely any voice chat in DRG either. Cooperation is instead enabled and encouraged through the use of your laser pointer with which you can tag resources or enemies, calling them out for all the other players. That cooperation is absolutely necessary too, as most hosts will enforce a balanced team, ensuring one player of each class - driller, scout, engineer, and gunner. The driller can tunnel through the environment, the scout can grapple and light the area up, the engineer can place pancake-like platforms and turrets, and the gunner… does what you'd expect, but also features a nice line grapple that can help navigate the depths, and a short-lived shield to protect his brother dwarves when the fighting gets thick.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3430470731684876870gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3430470731684876870gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You need all four to be successful, and somehow, it works. There’s no light in the dank caverns on the planet Hoxxes, so your dwarf throws a series of regenerating flares which slowly fade over time. The scout is crucial here, as they have a massive light flare that lasts much longer and lights up a huge area, but the tension created by frequently needing more light is superb. It encourages you all to stick together, and play together.</p>
<p>DRG’s replayabilty is next level too, with a variety of mission types, an often-complex mission structure for each, and random events, all coupled with an organic, random map generation system which can only be described as evil incarnate. I’ve lost count of how often I’ve made my way to the bottom of a mission only to realise that I don’t have any good way to get back out! Follow that digger, who will often drill as close to “straight up” as they can manage, while desperately trying not to overheat their drill bits, letting the rest of the team fight off multiple hordes before the timer runs out.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4620214431684876869gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4620214431684876869gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Meta progression is also superb. The perk system allows for gameplay choices to be made (run faster, carry more, sense enemies, etc) and each class will advance in levels allowing for gear unlocks and upgrades. Cash can also be spent on customising your dwarves with new hairstyles, beards, side burns, hair colour, caps, armour and more.</p>
<p>Even the simple hub area is a chance to bond with your squad before setting out on another mission, with games to play, beer to drink (for mission-based perks) and music to “dance” to.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1655024921684876868gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/1655024921684876868gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>And there’s so much more I haven’t really covered. The end-game “deep dive” missions, the weapon customisation, the hilarious voice acting, the boss fights, the single-player mode (if you simply can’t abide randos, even friendly ones), or Molly the “minecart”. If you haven’t tried DRG yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot. You owe it <a href="https://deeprockgalactic.fandom.com/wiki/Karl" target="_blank"><u>to Karl</u></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Something a little different: Aliens: Fireteam Elite [</strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1549970/Aliens_Fireteam_Elite/" target="_blank"><u>Steam</u></a><strong>]</strong></h3>
<p>Game over, man! How can I recommend Aliens Fireteam Elite when it barely scores higher than Back 4 Blood? Well, the simple fact is that I really, really bought into the Aliens atmosphere this game delivers in spades. Whether that’s the film-like military comms between you and Sergeant Herrerra in Tactical, the nicely recreated Aliens-style sci-fi bunkers and hangars, or the strong sound design recreating the sweet sweet rapid-fire of your M56 Smartgun, the whole thing <em>feels</em> like the films. There’s also the now-iconic echoing blip of your gun’s movement scanner to raise the tension. And the aliens’ elephant-like death scream just never gets old.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you’ve played Alien: Isolation, you’ll appreciate the Weyland Yutani synth units and their creepy, lifeless voices. Indeed, play single player and you’ll get two such combat synths to join you on your mission. And yep, I said two units - oddly enough, this is a three-player game, not a four-player game.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8209216191684876872gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/8209216191684876872gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>That incredibly authentic in-mission atmosphere does suffer a little when you get back to the main hub, a space craft in orbit around LV-895, an Engineer planet and the setting for the game. Despite Cold Iron Studios being a 60+ person outfit, and despite the excellent voice-acting, none of the character’s faces are animated, which is actually weirdly unsettling in a 2021 game. But many of the in-game dramatic reveals and set pieces are genuinely jaw-dropping, such as when Lieutenant Ko’s dropship clears a bridge of aliens as you run across it in a rocket barrage that can only be described as spectacular overkill.</p>
<p>There are only 3 missions plus a DLC mission, which each consist of 3 story sections, amounting to around 20-30 minutes per section of gameplay. Honestly, that’s pretty short and you’ll clear the bulk of the content in around 6 to 10 hours at the lowest difficulty. Sure, it’s reasonably priced at £25.99 (without DLC), and personally, I managed 65 hours in this beautiful shooter… but I can’t lie when I say I wanted more, which is actually an endorsement of how fun the shooting actually is! Sadly, the lack of mod support definitely hurts here, especially when there’s so little variety in playthroughs (minor randomisation only).</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20487546781684876871gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20487546781684876871gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>But there’s a lot to like here. Superb and meaningful progression for up to 7 classes (which play very differently), lots of mods for your weapons, heaps of perks that can be upgraded in a satisfying jigsaw puzzle as you level up. A large variety of weapons, from pistols to SMGs, shotguns to smart-guns, rifles to flamethrowers, there’s something for everyone. The clever “Battle Card” system is great too, introducing a massive variety of special buffs and debuffs for enhanced rewards. Some of these are incredibly inventive too, like the one that makes the whole mission look like the helmet-cams from the film, or one where if you move into a team mate, it stumbles them. Difficulty can be set too, introducing varying levels of friendly fire and intensity of the hordes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15623076661684876871gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/15623076661684876871gol573.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16264618921684876871gol573.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16264618921684876871gol573.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If you can find two friends to play with, it’s an engrossing experience.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>And the rest</strong></h3>
<p><em>World War Z [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/699130/World_War_Z/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>I haven’t played this one, but it gets decent reviews on Steam and certainly captures the sheer size of the hordes you see in the film of the same name. Some complaints about the grind, but definitely one to look into further.</p>
<p><em>Killing Floor 2 [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/232090/Killing_Floor_2/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Slicker follow up to the original game and features more classes and more progression along with a little more enemy variety coupled with new maps and bosses. Ultimately very, very similar and that’s going to be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your opinion on the first game!</p>
<p><em>Outriders [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/680420/OUTRIDERS/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>I’d love to describe this as a sleeper hit - it’s made by the same team that produced Painkiller Black Edition and Bulletstorm, it’s published by Square Enix, and yet no-one has heard of it. Truth is though, despite being excellent, it’s stupidly overpriced. I enjoyed it, it’s good, but it’s typically around £50… <em>on sale</em> for the full game (with DLC)! Worth checking out, but I only played for around 30 hours in the end, so I have serious reservations over the value for money I got.</p>
<p><em>Warhammer Vermintide 2 [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1125710/Gatewalkers/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>While the game itself plays fine to a platinum level, sadly Fatshark couldn’t wrap their head around how to enable the anti-cheat properly. So while you can host a game on Linux, you can’t actually join games. Fatshark <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/552500/discussions/0/2960544187643622408/?ctp=26#c3419936604888208895" target="_blank"><u>swear it’s either Epic, or Valve’s fault</u></a>, and with their new (largely panned) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361210/Warhammer_40000_Darktide/" target="_blank"><u>sequel</u></a> now out, it’s unlikely this will ever be fixed. Which is a shame, because there’s some nice progression and pretty graphics on show here. If you have 3 Windows-using friends and you’re prepared to host every session, this might be fun. For the rest of us though, it’s a pass.</p>
<p><em>The Anacrusis [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1120480/The_Anacrusis/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>Made by Stray Dog, a studio created by an ex-Valve staffer who worked on Left 4 Dead (sound familiar?) this is the true indie version of Left 4 Dead, complete with jank. It gets generally good reviews despite some lobby issues, and it looks like it captures the spirit of the game, if not the polish.</p>
<p><em>GTFO [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/493520/GTFO/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>A little bit different, this one! Yes, it’s 4 player-coop, yes, you fight off hordes of alien-like creatures and yes, it’s dark and full of horror. However, a lot of GTFO is actually based on stealth, and requires absolute coordination between players. Absolute. If you end up shooting for any length of time, your run is likely over! Steep learning curve but it has a cult following and still garners more players per day than Back 4 Blood. Also recommended by streamer, GTFO expert and GOL supporter, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Corben78/recommended/493520/" target="_blank"><u>Corben</u></a>!</p>
<p><em>No More Room in Hell [</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/224260/No_More_Room_in_Hell/" target="_blank"><em><u>Steam</u></em></a><em>]</em></p>
<p>This was originally a Half Life 2 mod, launched in 2011, but made it to a full release via Steam’s Greenlight scheme in 2013. It’s free to play and <em>still</em> supported today, with bug fixes and feature releases every few months. If this 8-player, native co-op shooter takes your fancy, keep your eyes peeled for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_In_Hell_2/" target="_blank"><u>upcoming sequel</u></a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Phew, we’re done. I feel like I need a lie down after all that tension. As usual, feel free to educate me on what I’ve missed or gotten wrong in the comments. I still lean towards single-player games, but writing this article has reminded me of all the fun to be had when you team up with some friends (or dwarves) for the greater good. Hopefully this gives you some ideas yourself!</p>

      <title>Modrinth make their own launcher for Minecraft modders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://modrinth.com/" target="_blank">Modrinth</a>, the open source modding platform that's gaining popularity, has now announced the first Alpha build of their own launcher to make modding easier for Minecraft fans.</p>
<p>There's no need to go dumping your other favourite launcher, it's just another option. Fully open source too just like the rest of Modrinth, focused on providing a good experience for gamers. Even though it's only the first Alpha, it's already looking pretty good and managed to get me into a modded game in no time at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13479181041685021732gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13479181041685021732gol1.png"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11949826711685021733gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11949826711685021733gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>With it being in Alpha, it's nowhere near complete so expect some issues and features that haven't made it in yet.</p>
<p>The source is on <a href="https://github.com/modrinth/theseus" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and Alpha access available via their <a href="https://discord.gg/EUHuJHt" target="_blank">Discord</a>. The Linux version is currently an AppImage and does seem to work well. Written in Rust, this is not yet-another Electron thing but instead uses Tauri and Vue.</p>

      <title>Wine and Wayland take another step closer with more code merged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The ongoing work bit by bit to get Wine and Wayland to fully work together on Linux has taken another step, with a third big <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/2712" target="_blank">merge request</a> accepted. <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/wine-84-rolls-out-with-initial-wayland-graphics-driver-work/" target="_blank">Wine 8.4 from mid-March</a> was the first development release to actually have some of the initial Wayland work in it.</p>
<p>From the merge request that's now accepted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This MR introduces the driver mechanisms to handle dynamic events from the Wayland compositor, using wl_output events as the guiding use case (i.e., we want to update the win32u display settings when the host settings change).</p>
<p>In this design we create a dedicated thread to read and dispatch Wayland events received from the compositor. If a Wayland event handler wants some code to be run in the context of a particular HWND's thread, it can add an internal event to a custom queue we have for each (GUI enabled) thread. The ProcessEvents driver callback processes internal events from that queue. In order to wake up waiting threads we use a pipe to notify about new internal events, with the read end acting as the thread's host queue fd. This is similar to how winemac.drv works.</p>
<p>We use the aforementioned mechanisms to queue win32u display device updates to the desktop window thread. Since there are many pieces that need to fall into place, this MR gradually reaches the final design:</p>
<ol>
<li>We first introduce the dedicated read/dispatch thread and handle events (and also display device updates if in the desktop process) in that thread.</li>
<li>We ensure access to Wayland output information is thread-safe and consistent (since in step 3 we will need to access it from a different thread).</li>
<li>We finally introduce per-thread internal event queues and, if we are in the desktop process, queue the display device update to the desktop window thread internal event queue. Note that the main portion of the wl_output event code is still handled in the dedicated read/dispatch thread.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Why is this actually needed? Well currently Wine uses X11, and so for anyone running Wayland it will then be run through XWayland, which is basically X running under Wayland like a compatibility layer. As Collabora said in their original announcement <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/12/collabora-announce-their-wayland-driver-for-wine/" target="_blank">back in 2020</a> talking about it they said it's "a source of complexity and possible inefficiencies" and so it would "be ideal if Wine could talk directly to Wayland to enable a leaner and more efficient stack on modern systems"</p>
<p>So the end result should be for users on Wayland, which will eventually be everyone, to have Wine work without the XWayland layer and have it all work nicely far into the future.</p>

      <title>Fedora Onyx voted in as a new official Fedora Linux immutable variant</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Much like Fedora Silverblue, Fedora Kinoite, and Fedora Sericea there's going to be a new immutable version of Fedora coming called Fedora Onyx.</p>
<p>These immutable versions of Fedora Linux work like SteamOS on Steam Deck, with the main system being the same across every installation, and it doesn't change. Upgrades are done over the whole thing, it's supposed to be faster and more stable and it's an increasingly popular way to use Linux.</p>
<p>Fedora Onyx comes with the Budgie desktop, and the <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Fedora_Onyx" target="_blank">proposal</a> from developer Joshua Strobl has now been <a href="https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2996#comment-857114" target="_blank">approved</a>, and so with Fedora 39 we should hopefully see its first release.</p>
<p>More about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fedora Onyx is an immutable desktop operating system, featuring the Budgie Desktop environment. Fedora Onyx leverages the same foundational technologies as other Fedora immutable variants such as Fedora Silverblue, Fedora Kinoite, and Fedora Sericea (flatpak, rpm-ostree, podman, toolbx). Fedora Onyx is built for people that are attracted to / find value in the Fedora computing platform and Budgie Desktop environment, but need the robust immutability and atomic capabilities that rpm-ostree provides, which are not be offered through traditional Fedora spins (e.g. Fedora Budgie Spin).</p>
