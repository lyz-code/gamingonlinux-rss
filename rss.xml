      <title>Roguelite shooter Arcadegeddon hits Steam with Steam Deck support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Arcadegeddon arrived on Steam recently from IllFonic after being an Epic Exclusive. It's flashy ever-evolving co-op roguelite shooter and the developers plan to ensure it stays compatible with Linux / Steam Deck. <em>Note: the developer provided a key to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4218320-GamingOnLinux/" target="_blank">our Steam Curator</a>.</em></p>
<p>Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="cnk3sn6iwLY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/3c998400c00be686a6edd5ff1c9b8f49.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/cnk3sn6iwLY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>About the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This ever-evolving co-op multiplayer, roguelite shooter allows you and up to 3 friends to explore multiple biomes, compete in mini games, find hidden chests, and battle a crazy cast of enemies and bosses. Arcadegeddon lets you play at your own pace with its mix of PVE and PVP gameplay. Speed into the action or take it slow, it’s up to you. As you get to know the town, you can dive into additional challenges from the local gangs that hangout in Gilly’s Arcade, earning you much more than just street cred. Though, the view from the top of the leaderboards must be pretty darn good...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Curiously, I have been unable to get it to launch on desktop Linux (Fedora KDE 38) so I've <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6941" target="_blank">logged a bug with Valve</a> on the Proton GitHub. Testing Proton 7, 8 and Experimental all gave me the same problem. However, it is "Steam Deck Playable" and it does actually launch properly on Deck with Proton Experimental.</p>
<p>Feels like a weird but entertaining mash-up between Fortnite in style, Borderlands in lots of the mechanics and plenty of its own spice. If you like co-op shooters so far it seems really great. Keeping it on the Medium graphics preset, with a 40Hz / 40 FPS lock so far seems like a good fit between performance and graphics while feeling good on the controls.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16433263531689882423gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16433263531689882423gol1.jpeg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13175277121689882644gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13175277121689882644gol1.jpeg"/></a><em>Running fine on Steam Deck. Click pics to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>I asked the developers about Linux / Steam Deck support for the game, in regards to anti-cheat since it does have an online focus (although you can play solo) and they said this:</p>
<p>"We have some of our own anti-cheat technology in place to protect against common ways of cheating/hacking. Without getting too far into the details, there are some systems to prevent memory modification and network traffic parsing. We are also server authoritative in multiplayer on dedicated servers. Our current in-house solutions were implemented with Steam Deck in mind, at the time there were not many options. Any future anti-cheat features or systems added will absolutely be implemented on Steam Deck as a requirement. We take our player reporting very seriously and hate to see anyone ruin the fun for the masses which is why we continuously do all we can to put a stop to cheating."</p>
<p>So there you have it. Great to hear they will ensure it continues working.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1515640/Arcadegeddon/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Wandering Village gets a big Ocean Update and you can win a key</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Wandering Village is a wonderful city-builder where you're building on the back of a massive creature. Currently in Early Access, Stray Fawn Studio just released a big watery upgrade. With Native Linux support and a Steam Deck Verified status, it's an easy choice to recommend from my own time spent enjoying the idea.</p>
<p>With the Ocean Update out now it's added a whole new biome to wander through, building upgrades, new decorations, a hostility modifier system, new buildings, new events, new locations and much more. Check out the new trailer below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ZLEiCdtpCbc"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6abb21e35900fa2780f9c153ceeef77.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ZLEiCdtpCbc" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They have a lot more planned to add into the game including new biomes, improved villager AI and an improved happiness system, flying merchants to trade with, birds you can tame, more buildings, more events, more locations and the list goes on. Lots of good systems in place they can keep expanding on so I'm keen to see how much more they add in but it's already a really fantastic combination.</p>
<p>Want to <strong>win</strong> a key? The developer kindly gave two to give away. To enter just leave a comment to say why you wish to win a copy of this game. Giveaway closes 9PM BST, Monday - July 24th.</p>
<p>If you wish to grab it now it's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1121640/The_Wandering_Village/" target="_blank">25% off on Steam</a> until July 27th.</p>

      <title>Starfox meets Vampire Survivors - Whisker Squadron: Survivor out August 21st</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well that's certainly one way to describe it. Whisker Squadron: Survivor is styled very much like the classic rail shooter Starfox but sprinkles in some elements popularised by Vampire Survivors.</p>
<p>I've been testing out the game for a little while, very much impressed by what I've seen from it. For anyone who likes retro styled 3D shooters like this you're definitely in for a bit of a treat. The developers, Flippfly LLC, have now announced that it will enter Early Access on August 21st and this is with full Native Linux support and it's Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The developer mentions that "you'll have a robust set of loadout choices for each run including pilot, ship, primary guns and missiles, each with unique gameplay attributes. During a run, the randomized upgrades include a mix of stat modifiers, passive abilities and attacks, and each run can play out in really unique ways".</p>
<p>Check out their new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_5Z6kYdF2P0"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f8b22114f1fbcb5b3064ad73439c25d0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_5Z6kYdF2P0" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embark on an ever-changing adventure across neon-laced roguelike levels featuring on-rails shooter runs that change with every 20-30 minute playthrough.</li>
<li>Design a fighter ship using randomized upgrades that can be built using scraps dropped throughout each level and Victory Points earned through play.</li>
<li>Change the way your runs play out by unlocking mods as you earn achievements.</li>
<li>Discover portals that will send you on a new and challenging secret path that will change the way you approach your run.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's actually an off-shoot of another shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1303400/Whisker_Squadron/" target="_blank">Whisker Squadron</a>, which will be launching sometime in 2024. </p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2140100/Whisker_Squadron_Survivor/" target="_blank">wishlist / follow on Steam</a> and there's a demo available.</p>

      <title>Keep an eye on Parkour Legends inspired by Olli Olli, Super Meat Boy and Celeste</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love fast-paced challenges? Enter Grip are working on Parkour Legends, a fast-paced side-scrolling parkour platformer and it looks like a lot of fun. It will be available with full Native Linux support, and the developer told me via email they've been making sure it runs great on the Steam Deck as well.</p>
<p>Blending together elements of Olli Olli, Super Meat Boy and Celeste it gives you all the stunts and tricks you might find in a skateboarding game but with parkour platforming. It's not an endless-runner though, with everything being hand-crafted by the developer with you having full character control.</p>
<p>Sounds like a fun idea. Check out the trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="og0e9nuAz2s"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/db976a6f2d0e9b28e4df5ffb541ddf3d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/og0e9nuAz2s" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<ul>
<li>Sprint, slide, roll, rebound, grab onto ledges, and run across walls</li>
<li>Kongs, tic tacs, lazy vaults. You name it. We got it.</li>
<li>Build up adrenaline with risky moves to get higher scores</li>
<li>Put your skills to the ultimate test with 250+ hand-crafted levels across multiple zones + hard modes for every level</li>
</ul>

      <title>Dolphin Emulator devs give up on Steam release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After all the ruckus recently about the Dolphin Emulator for Wii and GameCube coming to Steam, and then being blocked - the team has now <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/07/20/what-happened-to-dolphin-on-steam/" target="_blank">given up</a> with the Steam release.</p>
<p>They remained pretty silent on it since the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/nintendo-blocked-dolphin-emulator-release-on-steam/" target="_blank">initial announcement</a>, which caused a lot of speculation and confusion but now they're explaining their side and how they feel about it going forward after seeking legal advice. The good news, is that nothing is going to happen to Dolphin and development sounds like it's just continuing as normal. It's just not able to have a release on Steam since Nintendo asked Valve not to allow it on the store.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, after a long stay of silence, we have a difficult announcement to make. We are abandoning our efforts to release Dolphin on Steam. Valve ultimately runs the store and can set any condition they wish for software to appear on it. But given Nintendo's long-held stance on emulation, we find Valve's requirement for us to get approval from Nintendo for a Steam release to be impossible. Unfortunately, that's that. But there are some more serious matters to discuss, some that are much bigger than Dolphin's Steam Release.</p>
<cite>Dolphin Team</cite></blockquote>
<p>The big issue surrounds the inclusion of the Wii Common Key, which is required for the emulator to be able to run Wii games, which they said has been in their code for around 15 years without an issue.</p>
<p>The Dolphin team claim a lot of "armchair lawyers" talked about how foolish they have been for including it but they said "now that we have done our homework and talked to a lawyer, we are no longer concerned". They have no plans to remove it, as after getting legal advice they believe there's no issue since Dolphin itself is "not primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing protection".</p>
<p>After news about it spread around they claim they had "many requests, and even some demands, to remove all Wii keys from our codebase" but they don't think it matters and they think if they removed it and then relied on 3rd party applications it would "make the situation worse for everyone". Their message to the "armchair lawyers":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And to all the armchair lawyers out there, the letter to Valve did not make any claims that we were violating a US copyright by including the Wii Common Key, as a <em>short string of entirely random letters and numbers generated by a machine</em> <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf" target="_blank">is not copyrightable</a> under current US copyright law. If that ever changes, the world will be far too busy to think about emulation.</p>
<cite>Dolphin Team</cite></blockquote>
<p>Not only will development carry on as normal, so you'll just need to grab Dolphin as you always have done from elsewhere, but some elements from the Steam release will still be continued like the big screen interface that can be used directly with a gamepad. </p>

      <title>Gravity Circuit released paying tribute to classic platformers like Mega Man</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Gravity Circuit, a side-scrolling platformer that turns the action up to 11 and builds upon the legacy of popular console titles from the 1980s and 1990s has been released, and it has a native Linux version.</p>
<p>Released on July 13th by developer Domesticated Ant Games and publisher PID Games, Gravity Circuit sees the player guiding Kai, an upgradeable robotic war-veteran who is the user of the titular Gravity Circuit, as he seeks to take down the evil Virus Army and put a stop to their attempt at world-domination.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zj2SqGVQVdg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/cebbcd28551f217ec3e0e88710d25b9a.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zj2SqGVQVdg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Set in a future world populated by sentient robots, the game wears its inspirations on its sleeve and that's no bad thing, as it looks like a very slick reimagining of classic 1990s console platformers such as Capcom's Mega Man X, but with an even quicker pace and much more acrobatic movement. It seems to be finding favour with fans, too, with all reviews on Steam currently sitting at Very Positive within a week of release.</p>
<p>The official write-up provides more information;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Gravity Circuit</strong> - a flashy action packed 2d platformer in the spirit of console classics.</p>
<p><u>Mission: Stop the Virus Army’s Uprising!</u><br/>
In a futuristic world populated by sentient robots, its inhabitants are once more threatened by an old foe, the Virus Army. Defeated decades ago, it has re-emerged from the shadows with a unique goal, complete world domination. Severely weakened Guardian Corps are left with no other choice but to call upon a hero of the previous war: the lone operative, Kai, who harnesses the powers of the mysterious Gravity Circuit. As the world's last line of defense, journey through futuristic environments, and take down the evil mastermind behind this chaos.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of classic platformers from the 80s and 90s, with action dialed to maximum, channel your power into your fists and send foes flying, or grapple them to get up close and personal. In your quest you will acquire many new powers, which will allow you to go even further beyond!</p>
<ul>
<li>Action packed platforming</li>
</ul>
<p>By channeling your energy into devastating punches, perform satisfying combos and send foes flying, causing destruction and mayhem in the process!</p>
<ul>
<li>Save the innocent, and power up!</li>
</ul>
<p>Stages are packed with secrets and innocent civilians alike. Uncover and rescue them, and unlock new powers!</p>
<ul>
<li>Single player campaign with 12 stages</li>
</ul>
<p>Each with their unique set of mechanics, your platforming and combat skills will be tested against an armada of enemies and bosses!</p>
<p>Gravity Circuit is in active development by a small and dedicated core team. You can follow the game's development via <a href="https://twitter.com/GravityCircuit" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

      <title>Overwatch 2 heads to Steam making it even easier on Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Finally. One less extra launcher to become a nuisance? Blizzard games are finally coming to Steam with Overwatch 2 set to be the first on August 10th. Perhaps then it's no surprise Valve <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/proton-experimental-brings-fixes-for-gears-5-overwatch-2-phasmophobia/" target="_blank">fixed up an issue with Overwatch 2</a> in Proton Experimental for Linux / Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Announced in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/blizzard/23982127/overwatch-2-coming-to-steam-on-august-10" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<p>“It’s our goal at Blizzard to listen to players and try to exceed their expectations in everything we do,” said Mike Ybarra, President of Blizzard Entertainment. “While Battle.net remains a priority for us now and into the future, we’ve heard players want the choice of Steam for a selection of our games, starting with Overwatch 2 on August 10th. We’re happy to work with Valve to make that happen.”</p>
<p>"Gamers and developers are both going to benefit from Overwatch 2 coming to Steam," said Gabe Newell, Valve's president. "Gamers will have another platform where they can play a beloved game that utilizes the capabilities of Steam, and developers will benefit from the effects of having the talented team at Blizzard helping us evolve our supported features and functionality for Overwatch 2."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4640536001689787420gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4640536001689787420gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Exciting times to be a gamer!</p>
<p>It's not clear what other Blizzard games will be coming or when, but I'll let you know when I know. For Overwatch 2 you will need to connect up a Battle.net account, which enables full cross-play too. Blizzard said playing on Steam will give you all the usual Steam features like Steam Achievements, Steam Friends integration and the ability to invite people into your game.</p>
<p>Looking over their recent financial results, they said pretty clearly that Overwatch 2 was seeing a decline in "engagement and player investment" but with a Steam release and the Overwatch 2: Invasion update coming, maybe they can turn it around.</p>

      <title>Roto Force is a rotating twin-stick bullet-hell and it&#39;s glorious</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you're in the need for a new game to pick up and play I can happily recommend Roto Force to you. A high-energy 2D twin-stick bullet-hell where you rotate around little arenas and it's just chaos.</p>
<p>The developer sent over a key and it works great on Steam Deck and desktop Linux with full Native Linux support thanks to it being built with Java. Screenshots in no way do this game justice, you need to see it and feel it — pure fun. A fun twist on the bullet-hell genre, which I often find a lot of games are very samey but this thankfully feels new and fresh. Some good tunes to go along with it too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14071910401689786668gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14071910401689786668gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>You slide around the sides of each arena, and use your power to fling yourself across when you need to avoid fire, or pop through bubbles surrounding enemies and items. Plus you have an assortment of weapons, each with a unique type of fire - there's a lot to like in this one. Check out the trailer:</p>

      <title>Intel gives ASUS a license to carry on Intel NUC systems</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After news recently from <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-exiting-the-pc-business-as-it-stops-investment-in-the-intel-nuc/" target="_blank">ServeTheHome</a> that Intel planned to stop doing their Intel NUC systems directly, they've now announced they've agreed to let ASUS carry it on.</p>
<p>In an official <a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1634/intel-and-asus-agree-to-term-sheet-to-take-intel-nuc" target="_blank">press release</a> Intel stated ASUS now has a <em>non-exclusive</em> license to the Intel NUC product line designs, so they will now be manufacturing the 10th to 13th generation NUC systems. ASUS will also develop future designs and ASUS will establish a new unit called ASUS NUC BU to deal with it.</p>
<p>"Intel is pivoting its strategy to enable ecosystem partners to continue NUC systems product line innovation and growth. ASUS’s expertise and track record delivering industry-leading mini PCs to customers make it ideally suited to continue driving innovation and growth in NUC systems products." - Intel.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16240982501689763070gol1.jpg"/>Pictured - Intel NUC 13 Pro</em></p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what ASUS do with it, hopefully they won't suddenly inflate the pricing on it. With it being a non-exclusive license though, perhaps Intel are gearing up to announce more hardware vendors and we might see a little explosion in these tiny but powerful systems again?</p>

      <title>Portal: Prelude gets an NVIDIA RTX remaster, plus NVIDIA announced RTX IO</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>NVIDIA has announced another game to use NVIDIA RTX Remix to add in full Ray Tracing, this time it's a mod for the original Portal with Portal: Prelude RTX. Portal: Prelude is the highest rated mod for the original Portal and back in <a href="https://www.moddb.com/groups/2008-mod-of-the-year-awards/features/players-choice-best-released-mod" target="_blank">2008</a> it came number 3 on Mod DB's Mod of the Year contest. To play it free, you need to own the original Portal.</p>
<p>With the new refreshed Steam release it comes with Ray Tracing, DLSS3, Reflex and the newly launched NVIDIA RTX IO. The announcement also mentions it features "hundreds of new, fully upgraded materials and assets from David “Kralich” Driver-Gomm and Valerios “Fearell_Val” Tsoumpas, new voice acting by Jack “Amicus” McDade and Colin “SordidSpectacle” Zachariasen, and gameplay improvements from Nicolas".</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="zTf1YP6DV9E"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/b9cba2ab310049265465a3121c266b75.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/zTf1YP6DV9E" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Portal: Prelude RTX features</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nineteen challenging new test chambers</strong>, many improved from the original mod's release.</li>
<li><strong>A total graphical overhaul</strong> of the game's lighting and assets, powered by RTX Remix in partnership with NVIDIA.</li>
<li><strong>A cast of several fully-voice acted characters</strong> compared to the robotic voices of the original.</li>
<li><strong>A dramatic origin story</strong> for one of the most iconic villains and settings in gaming.</li>
<li><strong>An experience created by modders</strong>, helmed by modders, and released for fans of Portal to test their mettle.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At least to make it run with my NVIDIA GPU with Proton I needed to use this as a launch option in the Properties menu for the game: <code class="inline-code">PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI=1 %command%</code></p>
<p>Otherwise the game wouldn't launch at all, so try that if you also see the same.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2410180/Portal_Prelude_RTX/" target="_blank">find it on Steam</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>NVIDIA continue upgrading RTX Remix too with full support for skinned characters. So now RTX Remix will allow modders "to add more than 100 times the polygonal detail to characters, in addition to high fidelity PBR textures, with minimal performance costs". There's various other RTX Remix improvements you can read <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/portal-prelude-rtx-available-now-for-free/" target="_blank">about here</a>.</p>
<p>Another big announcement is <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-io-for-geforce-gpus-available-now/" target="_blank">NVIDIA RTX IO</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NVIDIA RTX IO leverages the advanced architectures of GeForce GPUs to offload dozens of CPU cores’ worth of work to your GPU, enabling faster game loading, and opening the door to a new era of large, incredibly detailed open world games. RTX IO is based on GDeflate, an open GPU compression standard <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-1-1-coming-soon/" target="_blank">contributed by NVIDIA</a>, which is utilized by both Microsoft’s DirectStorage and new Vulkan Extensions.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nice to see Vulkan being properly supported with it. NVIDIA announced that RTX IO will also be in the upcoming Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart launching on July 26th.</p>

      <title>Valve adds ability to see Steam Deck verification in desktop Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>In the latest Steam Beta Client update for desktops, Valve has added a new option to let you view Steam Deck Verified status. Valve's changelog for desktop notes they added "a setting to display Steam Deck compatibility information in the library while not on a Steam Deck".</p>
<p>You can find it in Settings -&gt; Library at the bottom with a checkbox to turn it on:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18643179931689758236gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18643179931689758236gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>When turned on, it will enable you to hover over any item in your Steam Library and see the Steam Deck Verified rating icon on the cover art as shown in the image below for Deep Rock Galactic. Hopefully they will add the option to just show it on them all without needing to roll your mouse around your entire library, they could definitely make that side of it more useful for users.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17499855341689758602gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17499855341689758602gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that, enabling the setting also shows it inside the main library page for each individual game like in the shot below, once again showing Deep Rock Galactic and you'll notice the Steam Deck Playable rating shown. However, to see this, you need to expand the details view with the information icon to the right of the page:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5819485651689758925gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5819485651689758925gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>See the full desktop <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/6245979991555027056" target="_blank">changelog here</a>.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck also had a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/5520900450309020909" target="_blank">Beta update</a> with these changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a case where the wrong FPS limit could be applied on startup.</li>
<li>Fixed a case where the controller input thread could operate at normal instead of high scheduling priority.</li>
<li>Fixed styling on the login error screen and made the retry button accessible to the gamepad.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Library</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to sort by date added to library to shelves and game grids.<br/>
Deck.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Developer console</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a setting to display timestamps in the Steam console window.</li>
<li>Changed Steam console window to keep the last several seconds of output even if that would exceed the normal buffer length.</li>
<li>Fixed command echo sometimes appearing on the same line as the previous output.</li>
<li>Fixed clear_console command not doing anything.</li>
</ul>

      <title>The modular Framework Laptop 16 opens up for pre-orders</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Framework have now put up the modular and customizable Framework Laptop 16 for pre-order featuring the latest AMD Ryzen CPUs and AMD Radeon GPUs. An exciting time to be a hardware fan because Framework do some great stuff.</p>
<p>They're again staggering the release with a batch order system though, so that they don't get completely overwhelmed. Ordering is open in US, Canada, Germany, France, UK, Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, and Australia with a refundable $100 deposit to grab a place in line.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21441875861689705336gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21441875861689705336gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Sounds pretty awesome too: "We’re not only using AMD Ryzen™ and Radeon™ silicon, but we developed this product in close collaboration with AMD as part of the AMD Advantage program. We’re leveraging AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series processors, the latest generation that we also use in Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen™ 7040 Series), this time with HS-class parts optimized for gaming and creation. Configurations start with the Ryzen™ 7 7840HS with 8 Zen 4 CPU cores at up to 5.1GHz boost, and we also offer the totally overkill, top of the line Ryzen™ 9 7940HS with up to 5.2GHz boost. We worked with Cooler Master to design a thermal system with dual 75mm fans, three heatpipes, and a liquid metal thermal interface, enabling 45W continuous processor load while also keeping the laptop cool and quiet. There’s fantastic graphics performance built in too, with Radeon 780M graphics with 12 RDNA 3 cores, capable of running a range of modern game titles."</p>
<p>Even though it's pretty powerful out of the box with the basic components, they're also doing a dedicated Graphics Module for their Expansion Bay that allows you to add in an AMD Radeon RX 7700S GPU. They say they've maxed out what it can do to give you 100W sustained TGP and 8GB GDDR6 at up to 18Gbps. Not only that but the module has its own dedicated heatsink and higher CFM fans, so that the CPU and GPU can run at full wattage simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can see AMD's own video on it below as well:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="L9Ww_7wwNkM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a31f99a8cca8885c704ee81063d796e0.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/L9Ww_7wwNkM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It also comes with a 16 inch 165Hz 2560x1600 display with FreeSync, an 85Wh battery, more powerful "quad" speakers compared with their previous model 13, WiFI 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, a 1080p webcam with dual mics and hardware privacy switches and there's also a fingerprint reader.</p>
<p>Pricing starts at £1,399 for the DIY edition where you build it and £1,699 for pre-built.</p>
<p>They do regular Linux testing for their devices with both the 13 and new 16 working great with Linux. They've also previously sent out hardware to a few Linux developers as well. Some compatibility details can be <a href="https://frame.work/gb/en/linux" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p>

      <title>Check out the mini Vampire Survivors documentary</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want a little more info on how Vampire Survivors came to be? The great people at Noclip have their next documentary up with the small team behind the absolute surprise smash-hit and it's well worth a watch.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors is currently number 5 on the <a href="https://steam250.com/top250" target="_blank">Steam Top 250</a> best reviewed games of all time. Pretty incredibly really considering how simplistic a game it is overall, but that is of course part of the hook and charm of it. Noclip spoke with the original creator Luca Galante, who is quite a private person and didn't want to be on camera and so they made a fun Muppets-style Dracula puppet with Galante giving it a voice over. Quite a sweet and clever way to get around it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="XQVdR8mJrds"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a6bc1d9ad98b60ec4aefc593be39f55e.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/XQVdR8mJrds" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>In the interview Galante mentioned how moving from Italy to the UK was difficult, and the only job they could get initially was at McDonalds when their English wasn't very good. After 2 years they managed to improve their English and went for programming jobs - the first being Gambling related and eventually rising in the ranks at the company to a mid-level management position. From there, Galante started late-night working on games as a creative outlet after being fedup and wanting to make their own games. Eventually after getting the game ready and releasing on itch.io and going unnoticed, Galante released it on Steam and by luck a big YouTuber picked it up and things just exploded from there.</p>
<p>You can buy Vampire Survivors on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/" target="_blank">Steam</a> for £3.99 / $4.99.</p>

      <title>Cinematic 2D puzzle-platformer Full Void is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Set in a dystopian future, Full Void from OutOfTheBit Ltd is out now with Native Linux support. It's a cinematic 2D puzzle-platformer telling the story of a young teenager alone in a hostile world controlled by a rogue AI. Fight your way through puzzles and obstacles to uncover the story that surrounds this broken, run down society, where only children are still free. But for how long?</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="g8QhWdWsjFY"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/395fbe1d1c6c81997d9b5adc44f157c4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/g8QhWdWsjFY" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: “After making fun arcade games such as Super Arcade Football and Super Arcade Racing, we really wanted to explore the puzzle platformer genre. With Full Void we wanted to tell a story and also convey a feeling to the player. It’s the feeling of helplessness and isolation many of us felt during the lockdowns of 2020 and 2021, and we tell this entire story without the use of words, except for a line of text on the very last screen of the game.”</p>
<p>The developers say that it should be suitable for most ages, as it has no gore or explicit violence as it was designed to provide a "thrilling atmosphere" above everything else that you can enjoy exploring and unravelling the story. Should work great on Steam Deck too which the developer teased in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsa2MUunliY" target="_blank">brief video</a>.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Environmental Storytelling;- Original, hand-drawn pixel art.</li>
<li>Interactive cut-scenes all hand drawn and animated.</li>
<li>Ability to hack machinery to solve puzzles.</li>
<li>Immersive and intense atmosphere.</li>
<li>Minimalistic sound design.</li>
<li>Compelling, Amiga MOD sounds.</li>
<li>Dynamic lighting.</li>
<li>Not too "retro-style" check points.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Exoprimal from Capcom tested on Steam Deck and desktop Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Capcom has now released Exoprimal, an online team-based shooter and thanks to Fanatical, I was able to take a look. Plus I have an <em>extra</em> discount on it for you.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am a Fanatical partner, but this is <em>not</em> sponsored in any way. Fanatical just randomly emailed me the key and a discount code. Being quite interested anyway, I decided to take a look. If you want you can <a href="https://www.fanatical.com/en/game/exoprimal?ref=gol" target="_blank">pick it up on Fanatical</a> and enter in the "<strong>GOL2OFF</strong>" code for some more monies off.</p>
<p>Now the good news - Exoprimal works out of the box with Proton 8 on Steam Deck and desktop Linux — it’s click and play. It does use Easy Anti-Cheat from Epic Online Services though but clearly Capcom have enabled the Linux and Steam Deck support as there's been no issues with online play.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2690948071689611998gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2690948071689611998gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Valve have given Exoprimal a Steam Deck Playable rating, so it’s not fully Verified, as their notes mentioned it sometimes shows keyboard icons and some text can be a little small. In my own testing i can agree with the rating, as some of the text is a bit blurry and small. Once again we need games to have more text and interface scaling options. We’re not all playing directly in front of huge monitors or TVs. It also has black bars above and below as no 16:10 screen support.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you’re going to play it docked, you <em>may</em> need you to manually swap an external controller in the Steam Deck menu. Valve said it won’t pick it up as number 1 by default but it worked <em>fine</em> for me.</p>
<p>For the recommended graphics settings on Steam Deck, I would suggest going with Medium and just tweaking it a little to turn off things like Motion Blur and turn on Variable Rate Shading (in-game setting). However, this is mostly a 30-40FPS game, so I would suggest keeping your Steam Deck on a 40HZ and 40FPS lock in the Performance Menu because you’re not really often going to get above 40 and this just helps keep it a little bit smoother. Although, there absolutely will be drops <em>just</em> below 30FPS at the seriously intense times so it may just be better to lock it to 30. Even on lowest settings, those drops still happen, so you may as well keep some bits on Medium and enjoy the style more. A power-hungry sucker too, you’ll be lucky to get even 2 hours out of it on a single charge so bring your favourite powerbank.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="x-cH2bSvvUk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/455563ec5c14e6ec6a45f4210b2ab4ea.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/x-cH2bSvvUk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Desktop performance (Fedora KDE 38, NVIDIA 2080 Ti, Ryzen 5800X): on highest settings at 2560x1440, it kept a silky-smooth 60PS <em>almost</em> the entire time except for a few loading stutters that went away. I wasn't able to get it to go above 60FPS, as even turning off the frame lock didn't work for me with Proton. So not sure what's going on there.</p>
<p>What’s surprising here is that for a big new CAPCOM game, it doesn’t exactly have a lot of players, with it only seeing around 3-4,000 currently at a time. It also only has a Mostly Positive rating on Steam from players.</p>
<p>I had to wonder why but it doesn’t take long to figure out as there are some issues with it. For starters it’s a full-price £49.99 online game that requires a 3rd party Capcom account which was a real <em>nuisance</em> to set up initially and link to Steam, and there’s a whole bunch of DLC available from Day 1 - something that just feels a little icky for a brand new full price game to have. Then there’s all the skins too, and a lot of them aren’t even particularly interesting <em>and </em>a extra paid battle pass.</p>
<p>It’s also crammed full of cutscenes, so it takes quite some time to truly get into the game. There’s the tutorial and then the intro mission and those together take a good 40-50 minutes or so before you’re then actually <em>properly</em> at the main menu to really get started. Then after you do matches, there’s still more cutscenes as you progress through the game.</p>
<p>Aside from that though, it is actually a lot of fun and if you like these team-based action games like I do I think you’ll also have a good time with it either on Steam Deck or desktop Linux. I’m always on the lookout for new team games to play with others, and Exoprimal looks like it might fill quite a nice gap for me for a while after burning out on Deep Rock Galactic (which is excellent) but I played a bit too much of it so I’m taking a long break.</p>
<p>The action is pretty great overall though, often really quite intense and the ability to swap out your special powered Exosuit is a nice touch to deal with different situations to help you finish the missions. With each suit having their own specialised role between assault, tank and support with various abilities to help the team.</p>
<p>Here you have two squads that race to complete objectives, either in PvP where you fight at the end with the opposing team or just PvE where it’s just against the dinos. You also get to pick specifically between PvP, PvE or leave it on random for extra XP. So it’s nice to see they’re not forcing either side of the game on players.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11850315211689612089gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11850315211689612089gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - Exoprimal on Fedora KDE 38</em></p>
<p>The missions also change and expand based on your main level progression in the game, so the early game feels quite samey but as you do it a couple of times and level up and unlock more story stuff, it will sprinkle in some different mission types. This is one thing I think that will make people bounce off it, because of how limited the first around 2-3 hours feel.</p>
<p>Exoprimal is like a really weird blend of games here as it clearly takes inspiration from other team based games but I quite like what CAPCOM did with this, they’re at least trying to do something a little different blending in PvP and PvE together in the team-based action space with class-based characters that you can customize and upgrade.</p>
<p>The story is pretty ridiculous though, let’s be real here the setting with timelines is just ludicrous with powered suits versus dinos. Why not though right? We all love dinos and big guns too so why not blend them together in a game like this.</p>
<p>So the good news is that it works out of the box on Steam Deck and desktop Linux, and with only a few tweaks to the graphics settings for Steam Deck it does work <em>quite</em> well. However it definitely could do with some more optimizations for the lower end like the Steam Deck. The problem will be the player-base, with it being an online live service game with seasons. Can it actually keep people playing? Does it have enough to compete with the great many other online games? I actually <em>hope</em> so because it’s quite a nice easy game to sink some hours into that isn’t overly deep while still having some great action to keep you interested, and another good multiplayer game choice to pick up and play on Steam Deck and desktop Linux is always welcome.</p>
<p>Capcom has a good base here to expand upon and improve so I’m keen to see what they add into it over time. Lots of hours to play through as it is though so you’re not going to run out of content, level ups and upgrades any time soon.</p>
<p>I think really, the biggest problem they have is the price. Capcom are a big name, and they do make some great games, but an online shooter like this for full price, with the live service seasons and DLC? That’s what’s going to make or break it. It’s brainless fun but not the kind I would have personally seen myself pay out £49.99 ($60) for and I think that’s really why they’re not seeing big player counts with it. I personally think they made a bit of a mistake on the pricing and monetization here but that’s just my honest personal opinion. And because of that i won’t outright recommend it, i have definite <em>mixed</em> feelings about this one.</p>

      <title>Dave the Diver is a big beautiful blue gem</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I’ve been playing through a game called Dave the Diver released on 28 Jun, 2023 from developer MINTROCKET. It seems to have taken Steam by storm with over 36,000 user reviews (and quickly growing!) giving it an overwhelmingly positive rating. After picking up a copy for myself and playing it, I can see why people love it so much.</p>
<p>Steam Deck Verified with Proton 7, it works pretty much to perfection with multiple hours of play on a single charge - I would say around 3 hours <em>without</em> any tweaks. It’s the perfect game to just pick up and play and sink a few hours into. There’s simply no need to dive into the settings on this one, a true click and play experience for anyone at home or on the go.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/14550365581689598325gol1.jpg"/></p>
<p>It also works great on desktop Linux too no problems there at all. Works exactly as expected. My testing there was on Fedora KDE 38 and all good. Performance is great and it looks fantastic.</p>
<p><em>So what is it?</em></p>
<p>Dave the Diver is an odd one to describe. You are Dave, and you’re going to do a lot of swimming around catching fish and all sorts of sea creatures. It’s a bit of a rogue-lite, with each time you dive into what they call the Blue Hole being a different layout with different fishies and loot to find. You have to watch your oxygen level, your depth and keep an eye out for nasty fishies that want to take a bite out of you. </p>
<p>You have a few different tools at your disposal to deal with the nasties though like your trusty harpoon, knives and shock sticks, a gun and more utilities you unlock as you progress though. There’s an upgrade system too, so you can keep making Dave just that little bit more useful.</p>
<p>I’ve been enjoying the carefully crafted progression system in this game, where you start off with basically nothing and it gradually sprinkles in more for you to do. It’s not just swimming around though, there’s also a sushi-bar restaurant mini-game where you’re gradually improving it and helping out delivering food and topping up peoples drinks. This is where you’ll actually make your money selling all your fish to then progress Dave as a character with the upgrades.</p>
<p>There’s a number of times it can feel like it gets a bit repetitive though, however, it doesn’t take long to start once again throwing a whole bunch of new stuff at you. The charm of the character interactions, the different missions types and the exploration just keeps Dave the Diver constantly shining and makes you just not want to put it down. The cut-scenes are delightful too, often quite comical as are the characters, it’s just such a real breath of fresh air in a big deep blue sea of games.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="6WJVsJiaeFw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/20a54d47d68117c70fd1cf7c6ee489e9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/6WJVsJiaeFw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Don’t be fooled by how <em>shallow</em> it feels at the start, because once you get a good few hours in there’s just so much to do that the initial repetitive loop fades away as you’re constantly doing various little jobs while swimming around from photography to mining, harpooning various types of fishies, opening chests, seahorse racing, there’s a collectible card game, lots of side-quests and it just keeps on throwing <em>more</em> at you. There’s even an underwater civilization! Dave the Diver has a little bit of <em>everything</em>. Seriously, you're never going to get bored with this one with the amount of content it is has it's pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Even the music is great, when swimming around it's the perfect match-up to keep you nice and relaxed after yet another fish got away or while you're being chased by sharks.</p>
<p>I’ve had such a wonderful time playing Dave the Diver, and I’m giving it a very firm recommendation for you to pick up too. A true shiny gem deserving a double thumbs-up from me. Easily one of the best more casual games I’ve played, heck it’s one of the best games this year by far. <em>Potentially</em> my game of the year.</p>
<p>Given how popular it is, I can easily imagine a lot of developers taking a look and getting some inspiration from it for their own games. </p>

      <title>Linux Mint 21.2 is out now with app upgrades, artwork tweaks, login improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Linux Mint 21.2 is out now as the latest distribution built on top of Ubuntu, coming with various careful improvements to the base software included.</p>
<p>Available with Cinnamon 5.8 / MATE 1.26 / Xfce 4.18, a Linux kernel 5.15 and an Ubuntu 22.04 package base with a plan to receive security updates until 2027. Until 2024 they will continue to use the same Ubuntu package base, so upgrades will be "trivial" to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21465305991689588402gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21465305991689588402gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>While it may not seem like the most exciting release, that mostly describes what Linux Mint do. They're not aiming to be the flashiest around as their aim is just to have a <em>good</em> desktop Linux distribution for everyone. For a quick highlight of some of what's improved in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touchpad improvements for login screen.</li>
<li>Multiple keyboard layouts for the login screen.</li>
<li>Keyboard navigation improvements for the login screen.</li>
<li>Wayland session support on the login screen.</li>

<ul>
<li>Better performance, faster image loading, faster navigation</li>
<li>Support for AVIF/HEIF and JXL formats</li>
<li>Improved support for GIF, RAW and TIFF images</li>
<li>Improved zoom controls</li>
<li>+ lots more</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Artwork and theme improvements. Like Cinnamon 5.8 having a whole new desktop styling system.</li>
<li>XDG Desktop Portal support to XApp to provide better compatibility with Flatpaks and GNOME apps.</li>
<li>Dark Mode global setting.</li>
<li>Gesture support for window management, workspace management, tiling and media controls.</li>
<li>Nemo file manager features multi-threaded thumbnails.</li>

      <title>FACEIT Anti-Cheat to support Linux / Steam Deck with BattleBit Remastered</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The developers of BattleBit Remastered have now given a much more clear answer to what their plans are for their anti-cheat and it seems it's great news for gamers on Steam Deck and desktop Linux.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/battlebit-remastered-anti-cheat-for-steam-deck-linux-is-concerning/" target="_blank">detailed previously</a>, their communication on it has been a little bit confusing with some conflicting statements and just generally unclear plans. Now, they're giving it to us straight and it's quite interesting! This news comes from their latest developer video where they said:</p>
<p>"We will not use the FACEIT that exists today. Like the current FACEIT that CS:GO uses, we will not use <em>that</em> FACEIT. The developers are making a new anti-cheat. They are making a fresh new anti-cheat that is different to their original anti-cheat that will support Linux - Steam Deck OS, it will have less restrictions to what CS:GO has but at the same time it will still be effective. It won't be as effective as what CS:GO uses because obviously the restrictions are there to squeeze any possibility but working with their team we can squeeze a lot more than what we have right now. It will be a completely new anti-cheat that we will be the first user of, and it will definitely support the popular versions of Linux and Steam Deck OS. So if you have bought the game and if you were playing on Linux or Steam Deck OS - you don't have to worry about that it will still be supported and FACEIT will ensure it's supported. They will troubleshoot any case if you have problems there."</p>
<p><em>Side-note: to be clear normal CS:GO uses VAC. However, FACEIT have their own competitive side of CS:GO with FACEIT Anti-Cheat. They're two separate online communities.</em></p>
<p>Listen on from 11:42 for the full statement:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="nIay2Aq2ars?rel=0&amp;start=702"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/02efdf68d76d672fbe7ef2f75116f04b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/nIay2Aq2ars?rel=0&amp;start=702" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>So that's good news for all fans of BattleBit Remastered, currently one of the most popular shooters available on Steam - it's not going to suddenly stop working. If it does, it's a bug and they should fix it.</p>
<p>Interesting though that they went from FACEIT to Easy Anti-Cheat, with plans to go back to FACEIT where they said they will also keep Easy Anti-Cheat but now they're working with FACEIT on a new anti-cheat that supports Linux. What a time to be a Linux gamer huh?</p>
<p>You can buy the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/" target="_blank">game on Steam</a>. I also did a <a href="https://youtu.be/clioxu6BmAs" target="_blank">quick news video</a> on this.</p>

      <title>CodeWeavers blog about their Linux / Steam Deck work on Proton with PooShooter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>PooShooter: Toilet Invaders, yes it's a real game and we all had a bit of a chuckle when we saw Valve noted it fixed in a Proton changelog recently. CodeWeavers, Valve's partner on Proton development, have a blog post up talking about <em>why</em> it was interesting to solve.</p>
<p>As I've said in the past, fixing up issues even in tiny games can have a big effect elsewhere. It's not always the huge exciting flashy AAA names that need fixing, as problems affecting multiple titles can be hiding anywhere — even in a 2D game about a "Bum fighting against vengeful Toilets". <em>Side-note: writing this might be the highlight of my day, not many jobs get you to talk about a buttocks fighting toilets. I should talk about this the next time someone asks what I actually do…</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11465904851689346896gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11465904851689346896gol1.jpg"/></a>Magnificent looking isn't it?</p>
<p>CodeWeavers' quality assurance team noted an issue with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/514390/PooShooter_Toilet_Invaders/" target="_blank">PooShooter: Toilet Invaders</a> having a black screen with Proton, although it reportedly worked with earlier versions. Things got weirder when they <em>couldn't</em> get it to work with any Proton version, even when they manually removed previous Proton files that might be sticking around. However, it did work when they used the "Delete Proton Files" option directly on Steam Deck in the developer menu.</p>
<p>Eventually they fixed the black screen rendering issue, which should also fix up some other titles <em>but</em> it also highlighted an issue with how the Delete Proton Files feature worked. As it turned out Valve had a bug in the Steam client where it <em>wasn't</em> removing files with filenames that had a colon (:) in them. Thanks to the work involved in fixing this tiny weird indie title, a bug that could have been causing numerous issues elsewhere was found — nice. It's also slightly hilarious that a game about bums and toilets, helped find an issue with a colon. Ah, simple pleasures. The jokes could write themselves at this point.</p>
<p>So the next time you need to clear some Proton files on Steam Deck just think - it's like flushing the toilet. Nice and clean.</p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/mjohnson/2023/7/13/why-fixing-pooshooter-toilet-invaders-on-proton-was-definitely-not-a-waste" target="_blank">full blog post here</a>.</p>

      <title>Retro-inspired JRPG &#39;Alterium Shift&#39; enters Early Access</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Love your classic JRPG-likes? Alterium Shift is another good looking entry that recently entered Early Access on Steam with Native Linux support. Built with the Unity game engine as far as I can see, it works great on Fedora KDE 38. <em>Note: the developer sent a key.</em></p>
<p>More about it: "Embark on a retro-inspired adventure with Alterium Shift, a classic JRPG featuring immersive 2.5D graphics and pixel art combined with modern gameplay. Choose from three unique characters, each with their own skills and elemental powers to explore the living world of Alteria. Engage in turn-based combat and fun mini-games like fishing as you uncover the secrets of this magical land and shape the outcome of the story with your choices."</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="UWQgUGNdqhk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/919100782b86e0f4db017674435496db.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/UWQgUGNdqhk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>From the developer: "Alterium Shift is the result of our unwavering passion, reflected in the intricately crafted world, engrossing storyline, and immersive gameplay. I'm thrilled to invite you all into this world we've built and am eager to collaborate with our community to further enrich this extraordinary journey!"</p>
<p>They estimate Early Access will last until the end of 2023 or early 2024 depending on what they need to do - they say it's currently about 50% complete. Not sure how I feel about playing through such an RPG when it's not finished, but as always it's a chance for you to try and offer feedback to make it a better game in the end and ensure it works well on Linux.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1586990/Alterium_Shift/" target="_blank">play it on Steam</a> and there's a demo available, with the full game having an option to skip the demo content if you've already done it.</p>

      <title>Cartridges game launcher adds support for Legendary for Epic Games and Flatpaks</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Remember Cartridges? The simple launcher that aims to be a sort-of all in one solution, to bring together games from all of your sources. Well, it just had a nice upgrade.</p>
<p>Mentioned in a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/cartridges-is-another-linux-game-launcher-and-its-super-clean/" target="_blank">previous article only recently</a>, since then the 2.0 release went out adding in direct support for the Legendary tool for Epic Games, and it now supports Flatpaks as well to import games from. So you can now import games into it from Steam, Lutris, Heroic, Bottles, itch, Legendary and Flatpak.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16677228001689334964gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/16677228001689334964gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Could be quite useful to just have that one place to launch stuff from. Especially nice with its integration with SteamGridDB to give you nice looking cover art. Given how many launchers there are now, all with strengths and weaknesses (especially since some stores don't offer direct Linux support), perhaps having them all in one place will stop me forgetting everything I have installed.</p>
<p>Check it <a href="https://github.com/kra-mo/cartridges" target="_blank">out on GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>Try out the new demo of the upcoming JRPG inspired Quartet</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following a success on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/somethingclassic/quartet-0/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, turn-based pixel-art JRPG inspired title Quartet now has a demo available with Native Linux support. The Kickstarter back in 2021 pulled in a nice $54,203 towards development so it's good to see some activity letting players experience a little of it.</p>
<p>About the game: A series of train robberies leads to evidence of a government conspiracy. A mysterious deck of cards gives a young girl a vision of another world. A fleet of deadly airships burns a path across the Imperial frontier. The world’s unlikeliest hero manifests tremendous magical power. These stories intertwine in the world of Quartet. Before it is all over, the eight heroes will uncover how a secret, centuries-old conflict literally reshaped the world. Then they will have their own decision to make about the destiny of magic.</p>
<p>Their most recent video is a bit old but should give some insight into what they're doing with it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="kGJXR1rgleI"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/7391cd8bd1ef6c5ca54fd922afb35d62.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/kGJXR1rgleI" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The developer also recently mention on their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1307960/discussions/0/3084382396886486568/#c3806154232469883930" target="_blank">Steam forum</a> they will "definitely have Linux (and SteamDeck) support at launch". Will be great to see another Kickstarted game release with the promised Linux support. It's due for a full release sometime in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307960/Quartet/" target="_blank">demo on Steam now</a>.</p>

      <title>New DLC info for retro-style beat-&#39;em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#39;s Revenge</title>
      <author>Pengling</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1361510/view/3691311568763608103" target="_blank">More information</a> and a new trailer have been published for the recently-announced Dimension Shellshock DLC for the native Linux beat-'em-up Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, revealing a new Survival Mode.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ioh0Cr1Lh7Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/a47788ef2f8a15fd80be9eac749f239c.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ioh0Cr1Lh7Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Players will be tasked with collecting crystals in order to progress through various alternate dimensions featuring increasing difficulty and new enemies that didn't appear in the main game - including an 8-bit one inspired by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles titles created by Konami for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new power-up will make it possible to temporarily morph into and play as popular enemy characters such as Bebop and Rocksteady, and, of course, Shredder himself! This is in addition to the previously-announced playable character, Miyamoto Usagi. A number of non-playable cameos for fan-favourites from throughout the franchise's history have been confirmed, too.</p>
<p>From the official blurb;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This all-new game mode will radically change your in-game experience with travels across the multiverse, hordes of enemies to defeat and multiple rewards to earn. Each dimension will challenge you and allow you to get and bring new pixel-perfect vibes to your radical adventure with Leo, Donnie, Raph and Mikey.</p>
<p>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge - Dimension Shellshock DLC will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>NEW playable characters including Usagi</li>
<li>NEW game mode: SURVIVAL MODE</li>
<li>NEW flashy alternative color palette options</li>
<li>NEW bangers composed by the one and only Tee Lopes</li>
<li>NEW easter eggs to spot in-game and more</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>An in-depth 11-minute video with developer commentary is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is0vIkJP3pI" target="_blank">available on YouTube</a>.</p>

      <title>Factorio upgraded with controller support - now in the stable release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Factory building and automation sim Factorio has a fresh stable release out, continuing years of free upgrades and it now has gamepad controller support. Becoming available first in the 1.1.83 experimental build that I wrote about previously, the developers continuing refining various bits in the game for a few more testing releases before pushing it out to everyone today.</p>
<p>The main differences from the last stable release to now include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added controller(gamepad) support. Change input method in Settings-&gt;Controls to play using a controller.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Minor Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added contextual hotkey hints. Enable it in Settings-&gt;Interface. Useful when playing using a controller.</li>
<li>When connecting wires to entities with multiple sides(combinator, power switch), the hovered side is highlighted.</li>
<li>Changed --dump-data to write infinite values as the string "inf" and "-inf".</li>
<li>It is now possible to blueprint entities of friendly forces.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updated SDL to version 2.26.5.</li>
<li>Replace "Version" column in mods install menu with "Last highlighted"</li>
<li>Disabled the Command+W keyboard shortcut for closing the game window on Macs. Command+Q will still quit the application.</li>
<li>On macOS, left and right variants of the Command and Option keys are differentiated when not bound as a modifier.</li>
<li>Improved sounds fading in and out on game resume and pause.</li>
<li>Allow "Pick up items" and "Drop items" actions to be fired at the same time as other actions, in keyboard and mouse mode.</li>
<li>"Pick up items" will no longer fire at the same time as other actions. This fixes character picking up items when flipping blueprints.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So now if you're on Steam Deck or desktop, you can relax and kick-back a little easier with it. Since the game actually has all the binds set up, along with on-screen controller glyphs. Making one of the best indie games ever made much more accessible to people.</p>
<p>To enable it go into Settings -&gt; Controls and at the very top click the box for Controller. I previously tested it working great on Steam Deck and it also works just fine with an Xbox Series X pad on desktop Linux too:</p>

<p>Factorio is available to buy on <a href="https://af.gog.com/game/factorio?as=1636858786" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/factorio?partner=gamingonlinux&amp;charity=12277" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>. It has Native Linux support and it is rated Steam Deck Playable by Valve - but that may need updating now.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine has a new funding platform and they&#39;re calling for help</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With Godot Engine moving over to being supported by the Godot Foundation directly, they've begun pushing for people to support their efforts via their new funding platform inspired by Blender.</p>
<p>Part of the reason they're announcing this now is that when Godot was smaller it was gathering more funds than it could use as they couldn't find developers to hire. Now, everything around Godot has grown significantly but now they're at a level of spending greater than what they're pulling in.</p>
<p>Previously they used Patreon, PayPal donations and one-time grants but they're hoping to be more self-sufficient if they can get enough people to come to them directly. To give an example of where some funding goes, they current have 10 either part or full time contracted to work on Godot directly which is costing $40,000 per month.</p>
<p>They have numerous other expenses to cover as well including hardware, travel costs, future hires for work needed to improve Godot in specific areas and more.</p>
<p>You can find the <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/" target="_blank">funding platform here</a> that notes they currently get €23,024 per month (around $25,794). However, they will be keeping their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/godotengine" target="_blank">Patreon</a> as right now they are relying on it but they hope to see future donations come direct so they have less fees.</p>
<p>Some other plans are in progress too like a paid asset store and merchandise.</p>

      <title>Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu makes some big progress in the latest report</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The incredible team building the Nintendo Switch emulator yuzu have a new progress report out for June 2023 and it's quite a doozy. Yes June, they're running over previous work. As usual, it's a lengthy read full of technical speak and exciting features and fixes so I'm here to summarise the important bits for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15993955401689263294gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/15993955401689263294gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Picture above is Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which now has <em>much</em> improved rendering thanks to all their working going into improving anisotropic filtering at higher values without rendering issues, improving image quality and it fixed up an old rendering bug for Mario Kart 8 too.</p>
<p>yuzu itself now ships with "virtually all" time zone data that the Switch has by default, so one less thing needed from a firmware dump.</p>
<p>They fixed a problem when "a memory page is being used by the GPU and written by the CPU at the same time" which solved various graphics bugs in Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &amp; The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, SUPER MARIO ODYSSEY, Xenoblade Chronicles 3, Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition and more games.</p>
<p>Improvements were also made for people with lower RAM, managing a "99.6% reduction" in RAM use for shader recompiling. Especially useful for people with 16GB or less RAM.</p>
<p>Games that use Unreal Engine 4 should no longer have broken textures with the Vulkan API (mostly an issue on NVIDIA), plus another improvement for UE4 games thanks to test the Pikmin 4 Demo that was crashing (and now solved).</p>
<p>One change that people with 4GB or lower VRAM might not appreciate is their Vulkan memory manager change. They adjusted it to "prefer (instead of require) using device local memory (VRAM) for image memory, which ends up allowing up to 50% of shared memory (system RAM) to be used by the GPU". This makes most UE4 games stable, but Tears of the Kingdom and other VRAM intense games may stutter more once VRAM gets close to full.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tears of the Kingdom, you can now safely upscale it higher without breaking the ambient occlusion effects.</p>
<p>OpenGL API rendering also saw some improvements, with the implementation of a local memory warmup shader for NVIDIA. They also extended persistent buffer maps from the texture cache to their buffer cache which they said "more than doubles the performance of OpenGL on NVIDIA hardware" and they said they expect to see similar results with Mesa on Linux too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17127999141689264254gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17127999141689264254gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p><em>They still suggest Vulkan for being smoother but keeping up OpenGL improvements helps older hardware.</em></p>
<p>A Linux-specific fix was also implemented recently to hopefully prevent you needing to adjust the vm.max_map_count setting in your system for longer play sessions.</p>
<p>For the exact details head along to the <a href="https://yuzu-emu.org/entry/yuzu-progress-report-jun-2023/" target="_blank">yuzu blog post</a>. There's a lot more, I'm just cherry-picking some fun stuff.</p>

      <title>AMD opens up the FidelityFX SDK and it&#39;s now on GitHub</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Helping game developers integrate various AMD FidelityFX technologies into their games, AMD yesterday open sourced the FidelityFX SDK.</p>
<p>This SDK includes the likes of Blur, Depth of Field (DoF), Lens, Combined Adaptive Compute Ambient Occlusion (CACAO), Contrast Adaptive Sharpening (CAS), Super Resolution (FSR 1 and 2), Luminance Preserving Mapper (LPM), Parallel Sort, Single Pass Downsampler (SPD), Stochastic Screen Space Reflections (SSSR), Variable Shading (VS), Hybrid Reflections and Hybrid Shadows.</p>
<p>AMD mentioned that as their collection of effects grew and became more widely used, they needed to improve how developers could actually integrate them. So this SDK is the result to bring " simplicity, structure, and consistency" for FidelityFX.</p>
<p>Some highlighted features they noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A consistent standard and style that is much more user-friendly.</li>
<li>Easier application spawning letting us focus on core algorithm details rather than boilerplate setup code.</li>
<li>A re-architected graphical framework that is not only more robust and ready, but is also API agnostic, allowing us to develop our effects across intended targets simultaneously.
<ul>
<li>This also doubles as a great how-to in creating a custom backend implementation for developers’ own multi-platform engines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://gpuopen.com/manuals/fidelityfx_sdk/fidelityfx_sdk-index/" target="_blank">Extensive documentation</a>.</li>
<li>And lastly, we’ve taken a lot of the guesswork out of implementation steps by offering complete pre-built solutions for all of our effects. Most of which can be supported in under 20 lines of code.
<ul>
<li>That being said, if you were a fan of taking the code we put out and manually integrating yourself, you are still free to do that. We’ve taken nothing away. All we’ve done is moved things into a more coherent structure on disk, and cleaned up the code to make it more consistent in style.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

      <title>After being removed from Steam, Betrayer is now free on GOG</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After vanishing from Steam quite a while ago in 2021, Betrayer from Blackpowder Games has <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/betrayer" target="_blank">resurfaced on GOG</a> and it's free to add to your account.</p>
<p>This is a bit of an odd one. The developer seemed to go silent, and then have it delisted on Steam. Their official Twitter account was also silent on it. However, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220818035044/https://www.blackpowdergames.com/blog/blackpowder-games-acquired-by-john-ruth/" target="_blank">Wayback Machine</a> shows that Blackpowder Games via their own official blog was acquired by John Ruth and then got turned into some odd news website.</p>
<p>However two days ago it resurfaced as a free game on GOG.com, with no explanation as to why. The official GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/release_betrayer_available_to_play_for_free" target="_blank">news post</a> doesn't clarify anything either, it just thanked Tyler "tfishell" for helping bring it to GOG and that's it. Weird.</p>

<p>Testing it on desktop Linux with Fedora KDE 38, thanks to the use of <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> to easily download GOG games it appears to work quite well with Wine-GE. Although, with my NVIDIA GPU I do see a few minor graphical glitches with shiny things like the water having weird spots over them. Apart from that, it performs well and looks good. Another free game to add to your collection - why not.</p>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Explore large, open environments teeming with danger and discovery. Chart your own course in search of clues and treasures.</li>
<li>Switch between two distinct worlds featuring different enemies, obstacles, and threats.</li>
<li>Wield early 17th century weaponry including muskets, bows, crossbows, and tomahawks. Upgrade your arsenal by purchasing or finding faster, deadlier, longer-ranged weapons.</li>
<li>Charge headlong into battle with guns blazing or pick enemies off quietly. A novel, movement-based stealth system lets you hide in plain sight or use the wind to mask your footsteps.</li>
<li>Equip ability-enhancing Charms to complement your play style, granting anything from extra health to faster movement to improved stealth.</li>
<li>Play with the default visual style for maximum eeriness and tension or customize the color and contrast settings to suit your tastes.</li>
</ul>

      <description><div class="content group e-content">

<p>They will be bringing updates from various games (and actually not just FPS') like the hotly anticipated classic RTS <em>Tempest Rising</em>, action-adventure FPS <em>Phantom Fury</em>, immersive sim <em>Core Decay</em>, sci-fi horror FPS <em>RIPOUT</em>, dark-fantasy FPS <em>GRAVEN</em>, dieselpunk action-rpg <em>Combustion</em>, the <em>Ion Fury: Aftershock</em> expansion and some surprises.</p>
<p>Additionally this year some other partners will appear including New Blood Interactive, Running With Scissors, Slipgate Ironworks, HYPERSTRANGE, Dread XP, Hellforge Studios, Fulqrum, and Retrovibe, as well as THQ Nordic, Prismatika Games and many more making their debut into the show. They also said to expect some interviews and maybe "a bit of the ol’ ultraviolence".</p>
<p>Check out the event trailer:</p>

      <title>Tabletop inspired roguelike adventure Abalon adds Linux &amp; SteamOS support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Abalon (formerly known as Summoners Fate), a roguelike adventure game inspired by tabletop classics recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1681840/view/3647401472403677755" target="_blank">announced</a> official Linux and SteamOS support. They mentioned the Native port should offer "a dramatic performance increase and better build stability over running via Proton".</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7547245921689169987gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7547245921689169987gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>More about it: "Abalon draws its inspiration from classic tabletop games like Hero Quest, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic: The Gathering, combining tactical combat with thoughtful events decided with the trusty roll of a D20. Exploring Abalon is done in real-time, allowing you to uncover lore scrolls, shop for powerful cards and even attend a goblin's birthday party (don't forget your gold).</p>
<p>Combat brings Abalon into a turn-based game where unit positioning is as important as your spell casting. These tense encounters play out in arena-style maps where the environment isn't just for show, it's a key part of the battlefield. Equip powerful armor from a statue mid-fight. Slam your foes into a wall of spikes. Transform a tree behind enemy lines into an allied fighter. How you control the battlefield is your choice."</p>
<p>Nice to see more developers go for Native Linux support where it makes sense for them and they're able to do it easily enough. Seems the developer had requests from a few players so they decided to just do it. The developer also mentioned a major update is coming soon adding in Challenge Modifiers, new artifacts and thematic shops.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer below:</p>

      <title>Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands releasing August 8</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Following the Kickstarter success in 2019, Deathbulge: Battle of the Bands finally has a released date and it's coming soon on August 8th. The Kickstarter pulled in 2,247 backers pledging $59,202 - so hopefully we're about to see another great game.</p>
<p>What is it: A role-playing game featuring musical themes with an affinity for the sick and righteous. The story revolves around a deadly battle of the bands contest, where entrants can attack and be attacked with music. Based on the <a href="https://deathbulge.com/comics" target="_blank">Deathbulge comic</a> from Dan Martin.</p>
<p>Check out the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="hXEP4cm7Res"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/de3f7bdec9ee22fbfa7b9e8b05f1dc04.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/hXEP4cm7Res" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Customise the band with 9 musically-themed classes to choose from, each with their own attacks, perks and sensational appearance.</li>
<li>Kick down every single door you come across, regardless of how unlocked they might be.</li>
<li>Some doors will be too strong to kick down. That's why you gotta kick down weaker doors to level up your door kicking skill until you're strong enough.</li>
<li>Fancy combat system that focuses on BAR EFFECTS. What happens BETWEEN turns makes all the difference, bringing real-time elements into the turn-based combat.</li>
<li>Sew patches of band logos onto your BATTLE JACKET for extra perks in BATTLE.</li>
<li>No Random Encounters! Monsters will be shown on the field for your avoiding leisure.</li>
<li>Original soundtrack that'll make you say things like SIIICK and OH RIGHT ON.</li>
<li>Bursting at the seams with humour, absurdity and a wide variety of colourful characters, armed with an abundance of dialogue faces to express themselves TO THE MAX.</li>
<li>A rich world packed with well over 100 unique NPCs.</li>
<li>Even the ITEMS have personality. Say bye bye to the generic "HEALTH POTION". Local NPC Barry Friendly is taking care of the soothing beverages around here. Sink into a warm cup of BARRY FRIENDLY'S TEA whenever your health is low. Maybe you'll even have the pleasure of meeting Barry at some point.</li>
<li>One of the enemies you fight is a skateboarding platypus.</li>
</ul>

      <title>Vampire Survivors switching to new game engine on August 17</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The smash indie hit Vampire Survivors is planning to finally move over to their newer and upgraded game engine on August 17th.</p>
<p>A big change for the game to go from Phaser to Unity but it should hopefully be well worth it. This will bring with it better cross-platform support, big performance improvements and give the developers a better platform to continue expanding the game as time goes on - like for the upcoming local co-op mode.</p>
<p>The news was announced on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1794680/announcements/detail/3650779172120262146" target="_blank">Steam</a> where they've also noted that Steam Trading Cards are now live, plus <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7muK6D2Mvfk&amp;t=5870s" target="_blank">IGN</a> recently got a co-op hands on with an unfinished build that might answer some questions for you. The developers say they're still working on it, trying to put in as many co-op options as possible along with a special item only in co-op.</p>
<p>On top of that they're also hosting a real-world co-op event hands-on in early August in London (UK). More details on that when they announce it.</p>
<p>The original co-op trailer if you missed it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-j2budq0Qpo"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f6c3fac23889a68c971fddc53dabb366.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-j2budq0Qpo" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">buy on Steam</a>. It is Steam Deck Verified and works great on desktop Linux with Proton too. It does have a Native Linux version in Beta but it's not really clear what they plan to do with it there.</p>

      <title>Microsoft wins against FTC to buy Activision Blizzard</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Well, the results are here. In the USA the FTC was trying to block Microsoft from acquiring Activision Blizzard but Microsoft has won the fight. Now Microsoft are one big step closer to actually properly closing the deal, and a rather big consolidation of the gaming industry given how big Activision Blizzard are.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.413969/gov.uscourts.cand.413969.305.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">decision</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been described as the largest in tech history. It deserves scrutiny. That scrutiny has paid off: Microsoft has committed in writing, in public, and in court to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for 10 years on parity with Xbox. It made an agreement with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to Switch. And it entered several agreements to for the first time bring Activision’s content to several cloud gaming services.</p>
<p>This Court’s responsibility in this case is narrow. It is to decide if, notwithstanding these current circumstances, the merger should be halted—perhaps even terminated—pending resolution of the FTC administrative action. For the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content. The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore DENIED.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means the temporary restraining order against the acquisition will be removed on July 14th, unless the FTC obtains a "stay pending appeal from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals".</p>
<p>Microsoft still have a fight ahead in the UK though, since the CMA (Competition and Markets Authority) blocked the deal but naturally Microsoft is appealing the decision with a hearing set to begin on July 28th. So they're not completely out of the woods yet but it's probable Microsoft will end up winning there too. <strong>Update</strong> 16:21 UTC - Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President Microsoft, put a statement on <a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1678796043545350144/photo/1" target="_blank">Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After today's court decision in the U.S., our focus now turns back to the UK. While we ultimately disagree with the CMA’s concerns, we are considering how the transaction might be modified in order to address those concerns in a way that is acceptable to the CMA. In order to prioritize work on these proposals, Microsoft and Activision have agreed with the CMA that a stay of the litigation in the UK would be in the public interest and the parties have made a joint submission to the Competition Appeal Tribunal to this effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do you think to this outcome?</p>

      <title>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun now fully playable on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun was updated by Auroch Digital recently, and now it should be properly fully playable on Steam Deck and desktop Linux. <em>Note: Focus Entertainment previously sent me a key.</em></p>
<p>Even though Valve listed it as Unsupported for Steam Deck, as <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/05/warhammer-40000-boltgun-is-absolute-boomer-shooter-joy/" target="_blank">reported before</a> it does work and you can get it to perform well enough to be a really fun time. However, the videos <em>didn't</em> play. With an update released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2005010/view/3655282771736075121" target="_blank">July 6th</a>, the developer has adjusted it so the videos now play with just Proton 8 and no other changes. Testing on desktop Linux (Fedora KDE) and the videos work just fine there too now.</p>
<p>Performance also seems to be on the whole a lot smoother, hitting far closer to 60FPS more of the time now.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><em><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2596883951689083316gol1.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2596883951689083316gol1.jpeg"/></a>Pictured - Boltgun on Steam Deck</em></p>
<p>So if you like your boomer shooters, and especially the Warhammer setting, this seems like an ideal time to go and pick it up. You're in for a good time if you do.</p>
<p>You can see my previous video on Boltgun below for more footage:</p>

<p>Nice to see more games getting improvements for Proton and Steam Deck.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/warhammer-40000-boltgun?partner=gamingonlinux" target="_blank">Humble Store</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005010/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>The Khronos Group seeking paid devs to work on OpenXR runtime Monado</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Khronos Group who oversee various standards like OpenGL, Vulkan and OpenXR announced recently they've put up a "Request for Proposals" to fund work on Monado.</p>
<p>To back up a bit: OpenXR is a royalty-free, open standard that provides high-performance access to Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)—collectively known as XR—platforms and devices. While Monado is an open source XR runtime supporting Linux, Windows and Android with an aim to be a fully conforming implementation of the OpenXR API.</p>
<p>Like any standard, the idea for OpenXR is for developers to target that to have better cross-platform support and Monado should make XR better on Linux (eventually).</p>
<p>The Khronos Group are looking for developers to work on Monado with a budget of $72K USD, and they want the work to be done within 6 months of starting. Any company is "welcome to respond" to their call. They also expect the code to be "properly commented source code integrated into the existing Monado GitLab repository which uses C and C++".</p>
<p>See their official <a href="https://www.khronos.org/news/archives/the-khronos-group-has-issued-a-rfp-for-monado-improvements" target="_blank">news post</a> and the documentation on exactly what they want <a href="https://members.khronos.org/document/dl/30516" target="_blank">here</a>. They want all responses sent over to them by August 3rd.</p>
<p><em>Could be quite exciting especially if it helps OpenXR support overall on Linux.</em></p>

      <title>Valve release new stable update for Steam Deck and desktops</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Valve has bundled up all the recent Beta updates for Steam Deck and desktop Steam into a fresh stable update so here's a list of what's new. Pretty much all of it is shared between Steam Deck and desktop because this is just a normal Steam Client update.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21071622571689072205gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21071622571689072205gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Just for <strong>Linux</strong> here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Add a setting to improve compatibility with window managers that send an unfocus event before every pointer click event, e.g. openbox. This setting can be found in "Settings-&gt;Interface-&gt;Enable context menu focus compatibility mode". Enabling this setting will fix dropdown menus being unclickable on these window managers.</li>
<li>Fix incorrectly spawning a file chooser instead of a directory chooser on systems with xdg-desktop-portal FileChooser version 2.</li>
<li>Fix a case where the overlay could have dpi scaling applied twice.</li>
<li>Fix login window having the wrong dimensions when dpi scaling is enabled.</li>
<li>Fix a case where menus could get clipped if dpi scaling is enabled.</li>
<li>Fix a case where disabling dpi scaling via settings wouldn't have any effect.</li>
<li>Restrict a workaround that prevents a crash on Nvidia GPUs to only activate when we detect an Nvidia GPU. Side-effects for this workaround include window flashing and focus stealing when a steam window is closed, which should no longer affect Intel/AMD users.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>General</strong></p>

<li>Fixed window control positions on chat settings popups.</li>

<li>Fixed the tops of some context menus not being interactable if they overlap the title bar.</li>
<li>Removed incorrect date display on some DLC hovers.</li>
<li>Properly show an error when failing to load existing awards given when showing the award dialog for user generated content, reviews, discussion posts, and comments.</li>

<li>Added battery indicator to the desktop overlay when running on laptop or handheld device with battery.</li>
<li>Fixed soft-lock when a game requested that asynchronous game notifications be enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed issue causing desktop overlay to not render properly in macOS CS:GO.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where viewing a user's profile was not working in some older games (e.g Left 4 Dead 2).</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the overlay was not responding to mouse input when there was a controller configuration loaded that included virtual menus.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the "Invite Friend to Game" dialog didn't work while in a Steam group voice chat channel.</li>
<li>Fixed overlay windows showing in pinned state when overlay is activated for some games (e.g. Warhammer: Vermintide 2).</li>
</ul>

<li>Fix bug where configurations could fail to get deleted.</li>

</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Screenshots Manager</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy dropdown selector for local screenshots will now remember the last selection.</li>
<li>Clicking the large image in the right panel will now open a larger popup of the screenshot.</li>
<li>Fixed issue where the screenshot manager might popup after closing a game when no screenshots were taken for that gameplay session.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Friends &amp; Chat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed chat window not being raised when clicking a chat notification while docked mode is enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed minimize/maximize buttons not working for chat windows created minimized.</li>
</ul>
<p class="plain-list-title"><strong>Server Browser</strong></p>
<ul>

      <title>Star Wars Dark Forces source port The Force Engine gets upgraded</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Another fresh release went out recently for The Force Engine, a rebuilt game engine to play STAR WARS - Dark Forces and eventually Outlaws nicely on modern systems.</p>
<p>This is not a remaster though, like many open source game engine reimplementations it's to try and keep the original feel but just make it better for modern gaming. Some of the existing improvements include a mod loader, high resolution support, a GPU renderer and various additional quality of life improvements.</p>
<p>A first release went out in December 2022, with this latest being a bunch of bug fixes to clean it up before the planned big 2.0 release.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/401581711689071508gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/401581711689071508gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Here's all that's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug when there are too many entries in Jedi.lvl.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with display bounds when selecting the correct display.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash if the HUD pieces do not load.</li>
<li>Added a confirmation for loading a game from the Load Menu.</li>
<li>Added mod filtering for the Mod Loader, to make finding mods easier.</li>
<li>Mods are now alphabetically sorted (once the list loading is complete).</li>
<li>Fixed issues with the "No Game Data" message being incorrectly displayed.</li>
<li>Separates out errors because files aren't found, versus files are invalid.</li>
<li>Fixed a memory overwrite bug in Dark Tide 4, level 3 - due to having too few "texture vertices" set.</li>
<li>Fix Vue Logic sprite yaw to match vanilla.</li>
<li>Hopefully fixed Steam path detection when the game is installed on a different drive than Steam itself or the ACF files cannot be found.</li>
<li>IMuse: clamp priority parameter to 127 (Manuel Lauss).</li>
<li>Linux: improve crash handler (Manuel Lauss).</li>
</ul>

      <title>Linux hit over 3% desktop user share according to Statcounter</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Do my eyes deceive me? Apparently not. According to Statcounter, the Linux share on the desktop has actually now passed 3% for the first time.</p>
<p>While it has been close a couple of times, the trend according to their stats is pretty clear that Linux use has been slowly rising over the last few years. This does <em>not</em> include ChromeOS, even though it's based on Linux, as they track that separately so this is just plain desktop Linux.</p>
<p>As always, keep a big pinch of salt ready though for any such survey. Statcounter gather this data from around "1.5 million sites globally". Still, just like the <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">Steam Survey</a> that we regularly look at for trends, it's an interesting measure to keep an eye on for the overall picture.</p>
<p>Across this year their stats show for Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>January - 2.91%</li>
<li>February - 2.94%</li>
<li>March - 2.85%</li>
<li>April - 2.83%</li>
<li>May - 2.7%</li>
<li>June - 3.07%</li>
</ul>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 30: Imperial Purple</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/07/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-29-the-odyssey/" target="_blank">Part 29: The Odyssey</a></strong></p>
<p><em>War! Age of Imperialism</em> was in the first instance a board game, designed by Glenn Drover of Eagle Games. Players assume the role of a colonial empire intent on subjugating the rest of the world. Having an established ruleset left a solid foundation for one-man band Donohoe Digital to work with, not to mention a wealth of graphics assets in the form of a game board drawn by prolific illustrator Paul E. Niemeyer, as well as the indvidual game pieces themselves.</p>
<p>The Linux version of the game was sold directly by Donohoe Digital from their website starting in December 2003 up until the bankruptcy of Eagle Games, with Donohoe Digital themselves ceasing operations in 2015. That website does remain online today, and it even still hosts both the war-demo.bin.gz trial installer, as well as the war-aoi-1-3.bin.gz installer for those who had previously purchased the game. This is not kept behind a paywall, but a valid activation key is required.</p>
<p>Thankfully second hand boxed copies of <em>War! Age of Imperialism</em> for Windows and Mac can still be found, and the activation keys included therein are compatible with the Linux version of the game. Or at least they would be, if not for the fact that the activation key server seems to have been taken down. I thought this might be another dead end like <em>Marble Blast Gold</em> proved to be, but I eventually discovered a way to get around the key check.</p>
<p>Simply blank the "settings.online.server" line found in the client.properties configuration file, and then try to activate your key. The window will stop responding, but upon killing the process and launching the game again, the key will be accepted. This of course is a violation of the license agreement, but I am not going to lose any sleep over it. Donohoe Digital's other <em>DD Poker</em> title was made freeware before the studio's closure, so I doubt Doug Donohoe himself wants to see his games dead.</p>
<p>The setup uses the Java based InstallAnywhere package by Zero G Software, an alternative graphical installer to the traditional Loki Setup tool which is rather spiffy and is still being sold to this day. <em>War! Age of Imperialism</em> is also written in Java, much like the <em>Risk</em> inspired <em>Aevum Obscurum</em> and the <em>Lux</em> series of games which were its contemporaries. Coverage at the time directed much praise to the game's artificial intelligence, which does make for a canny computer opponent.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/7245986991689012331gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/7245986991689012331gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4626125801689012332gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/4626125801689012332gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>In fact, the first game I managed to win was only accomplished by my expanding outwards from Central Asia, holding Persia up to the Urals. This meant that I could concentrate all of my military forces at one of the narrowest points on the map, split among just the three provinces, while also ensuring that my rival would become bottled up in the Far East. I was then able to send forth Explorers to entice all of Europe and Africa to my empire, while my rival floundered taking the rest of the Steppe.</p>
<p>I had selected the house rule that dissuades the computer from investing in a navy in the early game, so we both had ships in the water by the time we had our sights set on the islands of Southeast Asia and Australia. They met in the Timor Sea, with the ship carrying my brave Explorers being sent to the bottom of the ocean in a sneak attack. Of course you know, this means war! The sound actually cut out then after several hours of play, muffling the climatic battles that followed.</p>
<p>My second successful attempt had me take a similar strategy by holding Palestine, with my navy blockading the computer to hold them to just their African heartland. The artificial intelligence still managed to impress, as after starting my invasion the computer executed a successful feigned retreat, baiting me to keep advancing forward and creating the conditions ripe for a potential encirclement. Only by not taking the bait and pulling back did I ward off heavy losses.</p>
<p>The game still has a much greater degree of complexity on offer, as so far I have just been playing with weak natives who do not revolt or need westernization, and with technological discoveries and purchases disabled. One rule that I will insist on using going forward is "Empty Region Worth 5 PP", as otherwise you can end up paralyzed despite holding territory. It is also odd that by default the game asks you to roll the dice for computer players, but this can be changed with the "Quick AI" settings.</p>
<p>My Pentium III 500 Mhz just barely meets the minimum system requirements for <em>War! Age of Imperialism</em>, and the game does indeed chug on the hardware, but being turn based this never proved to be much of an issue. It also spontaneously quit on me at one point, although I did not mind too much as the only thing distancing me from my last save was a number of unfortunate dice rolls. <em>War! Age of Imperialism</em> is well worth taking a punt on, if you can get past the key check.</p>

      <title>I&#39;ve spent way too much time playing Lost for Swords</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Lost for Swords is an in-development turn-based roguelike card game with a unique twist, playable in your browser via itch.io it has sucked away a fair amount of my time recently. It has downloads for Windows, which I haven't checked via Wine, because it works great in the browser.</p>
<p>It's a dungeon crawler where the twist is that the items you pick up can only be used once, so it's all about thinking and planning ahead as much as possible to make it to the next floor. Monsters also only move and attack when you interact with a card, so you get plenty of time to think about the best positioning and moves possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5404873861689003783gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/5404873861689003783gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Each game shuffles all the equipment cards and other cards and then gets spread around, so it's a slightly different challenge each time. Between floors you can also upgrade your equipment to try and get the best possible deck built.</p>
<p>A simple well executed idea that has a lot of charm to it. I'm keen to see how this one continues to expand during development as we're only seeing a slice of what's possible right now. I'm getting a mixed feeling here between Slay the Spire and Dicey Dungeons and I think this will work out quite well when it releases in full. </p>
<p>Well worth a go. Check it <a href="https://maxbytes.itch.io/lost-for-swords" target="_blank">out on itch.io</a>.</p>

      <title>Amazon Games support is coming soon to Heroic Games Launcher</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The Heroic Games Launcher currently supports GOG, Epic Games and manual side-loading but Amazon Games support is also being worked on.</p>
<p>We're also really close to the next major release of Heroic, which was due out towards the end of last month but got held up by some last minute bugs. So expect it quite soon!</p>
<p>As for Amazon Games support going by the in-progress Pull Request on <a href="https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher/pull/2831" target="_blank">GitHub</a> it will support displaying your games, installing, updating and running them all through Heroic thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/nile" target="_blank">Nile</a> project. Which will be quite nice, since you can pretty regularly get some great free stuff via Prime Gaming.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20072562421689002599gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20072562421689002599gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The developer working on it mentioned it has been tested working across Linux, macOS and Windows and it will work on Steam Deck too via Flatpak.</p>
<p>This is the great power of open source, people come together to build something to make grabbing games from other platforms really easy. Nice to see Heroic continue to get even better.</p>
<p>Find out more about Heroic on the <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">official site</a>.</p>

      <title>SteamVR improves controller support in v1.26</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>SteamVR will now play better with various types of controllers, thanks to the release of SteamVR version 1.26 bringing with it automatic controller rebinding.</p>
<p>Valve mentioned that they've expanded on the work started in SteamVR v1.24, where you could mimic actions from different controllers. Now they've added a whole bunch of default remappings for popular controllers, and new controllers coming out will then get instant compatibility with the majority of SteamVR games with no work needed from game developers.</p>
<p>In my own testing today, I can also <strong>finally</strong> play SteamVR on Fedora Linux again. I had been seeing a 109 error for quite some time completely breaking it, but today it loaded up and worked fine. Nice to see it working again. The main additions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added automatic rebinding for controllers without native bindings. For SteamVR Input and OpenXR games we will attempt to rebind to a supported controller type.</li>
<li>A handle has been added to the dashboard, allowing it to be positioned in space. The position is reset whenever it is summoned.</li>
<li>Dashboard recenter button now recenters both seated and standing universes, instead of just the current universe of the scene application.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused audio devices with emojis in the name to break the settings UI.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused low framerates with 3rd party headsets while using AMD graphics cards if hardware was unplugged/replugged after session start.</li>
<li>Added new tracker roles: Wrist (L/R), Ankle (L/R)</li>
<li>Added ‘autoremapping’ to the Automatic Rebinding files to simplify component remapping.</li>
<li>The binding UI's style has been refreshed.</li>
<li>Display an error when any required actions haven't been bound, instead of failing silently.</li>
<li>Improved performance of workshop binding loading.</li>
<li>Fixed "Show Old Binding UI" button not working in controller settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Such a fantastic app to have available on Linux. Too many companies still just don't care to make all their device features work on Linux. Shame it has to be left to the community but I somewhat prefer that over individual apps for different devices don't you?</p>

      <title>Free sandbox game inspired by Minecraft &#39;MineClone2&#39; v0.84 is out now</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>MineClone2 continues getting better and better as a free and open source replacement of Minecraft, with version 0.84 out now. Here's a run over what's new and improved. To play it you need <em>Minetest</em>.</p>
<p>Another of my favourites to keep an eye on, since there's really no barrier to entry here and for those of you who don't want to be forced into a Microsoft account like Minecraft now requires this is a good safe bet. Such great modding support in Minetest too, with MineClone2 being able to work nicely with many other mods.</p>

      <title>Fedora considering adding in &#39;privacy-preserving&#39; telemetry</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Quite a controversial topic currently floating around is that a <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f40-change-request-privacy-preserving-telemetry-for-fedora-workstation-system-wide/85320" target="_blank">change proposal</a> has been made for Fedora Workstation 40 to have some "privacy-preserving" telemetry to "enable limited data collection of anonymous Fedora Workstation usage metrics".</p>
<p>This has generated quite the buzz across pretty much everywhere I look, with many people on both sides jumping in to argue about it. One thing to remember though, is that this is a proposal, nothing has been set in stone and the whole idea could be scrapped or changed a lot as discussions go on.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fedora is an open source community project, and nobody is interested in violating user privacy. We do not want to collect data about individual users. We want to collect only aggregate usage metrics that are actually needed to achieve specific Fedora improvement objectives, and no more. We understand that if we violate our users’ trust, then we won’t have many users left, so if metrics collection is approved, we will need to be very careful to roll this out in a way that respects our users at all times. (For example, we should not collect users’ search queries, because that would be creepy.).</p>
<p>We believe an open source community can ethically collect limited aggregate data on how its software is used without involving big data companies or building creepy tracking profiles that are not in the best interests of users. Users will have the option to disable data upload before any data is sent for the first time. Our service will be operated by Fedora on Fedora infrastructure, and will not depend on Google Analytics or any other controversial third-party services. And in contrast to proprietary software operating systems, you can redirect the data collection to your own private metrics server instead of Fedora’s to see precisely what data is being collected from you, because the server components are open source too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for what they might actually be collecting there's all sorts but they're not yet being exactly clear on what, because approval for it hasn't happened as it's early days for the proposal. If they do get approval, it seems then they will work out a clear idea of what to collect. They did suggest some of it may be things like what IDEs are popular, the click-through rate of recommended banners in GNOME Software, what panels are most used in gnome-control-center, what type of hard drive you have, count how many users use a particular locale so they can optimize language support and so on.</p>
<p>Telemetry is <em>not</em> actually a bad thing but the way it has been used in the past is what gives it a bad name. Some companies absolutely abused data collection in the past, and plenty <em>still</em> do. There <em>are</em> ways to do it properly though which they seem to be trying to do by fully informing people here.</p>
<p>What's a little <em>confusing</em> though is their part about opt-in versus opt-out. The way it has been explained could have been better. It seems they want to go for opt-out, with it turned on to collect the data by default but <em>not</em> actually upload anything until you've gone through a privacy page when installing Fedora to confirm it. Disabling it will then send them nothing but it will still collect it locally ready for if you turn it on later. For existing users upgrading, it will be opt-in though, as they don't currently have a mechanism for getting user consent through upgrades. This opt-in / opt-out also has <a href="https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/opt-in-opt-out-a-breakout-topic-for-the-f40-change-request-on-privacy-preserving-telemetry-for-fedora-workstation/85395" target="_blank">it's own discussion</a> area since it's a big thing.</p>
<p><em>How do you feel about this idea? Let me know in the comments.</em></p>

      <title>Meta announced &#39;IGL&#39;, a high-performance cross-platform graphics library</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Available under the MIT license, Meta (as in Facebook) have released IGL (Intermediate Graphics Library) for developers. This was officially <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/meta-uses-khronos-open-standards-in-new-intermediate-graphics-library" target="_blank">announced</a> on The Khronos Group blog (who oversee various open standards), written by Meta developers.</p>
<p>Supporting OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL, Vulkan and Metal and it's cross-platform for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows and WebAssembly. They hope to see developers using it across the industry whether you're "working on a game, a 3D modeling application or any other project that requires top-notch graphics" they say that "IGL has got you covered".</p>
<p>Key features of Meta's IGL:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-platform compatibility:</strong> In addition to the functionality mentioned above, IGL also provides a shell library, allowing users to compile and run on the most popular platforms including Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Android and WebAssembly.</li>
<li><strong>High-performance rendering:</strong> IGL is optimized to provide lightning-fast rendering, even when dealing with complex and detailed graphics.</li>
<li><strong>Easy-to-use API:</strong> An intuitive and easy-to-use API means that IGL is simple and straightforward to work with. Rather than introducing RHI as part of the high-level engine abstraction or mimicking one graphics interface behind another, IGL takes a new approach to abstracting RHI by creating a new modern interface, which is close to Vulkan or WebGPU on the abstraction layer, but general enough to avoid being engine-specific.</li>
<li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> IGL was built with extensibility in mind, allowing users to easily add new features and functionality as their needs evolve.</li>
<li><strong>Open source:</strong> IGL is completely open source and can be used for any project, commercial or otherwise, without any licensing restrictions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They have an interesting <a href="https://github.com/facebook/igl/blob/main/ROADMAP.md" target="_blank">roadmap</a> of what they hope to bring to it too including a multi-threading API, asynchronous loading of resources, a synchronization primitives API and more. Going by the GitHub page they say it has already been "battle-tested" used with Android, Quest 2 / 3 / Pro with OpenGL / Vulkan and their own apps.</p>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/igl" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <title>MicroProse now publishing Dying Breed a retro RTS like Command &amp; Conquer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Announced today, Dying Breed from Sarnayer that blends together the classic style and gameplay in the original Command &amp; Conquer but with Zombies is now being published by MicroProse. Seems quite fitting to have a name like MicroProse attached to it.</p>
<p>Taking you back to the glory days of the classic RTS experience with a 90s electro-metal soundtrack and even those brilliantly silly FMV live-action cut-scenes. Set in a post-apocalyptic world it has the usual base-building and resource gathering but the action also looks great.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="ydjeE15DYy8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/fcacb22a6597b87d82c3cd1eb637a2e4.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/ydjeE15DYy8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>It will have Native Linux support at release. Yeah, I'm excited for this one. I grew up on C&amp;C, Red Alert and the likes so this one really speaks to me. Can't wait to see more of it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088550/Dying_Breed/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. There also for now still some old demos on <a href="https://sarnayer.itch.io/dying-breed" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a setting to improve compatibility with window managers that send an unfocus event before every pointer click event, e.g. openbox. This setting can be found in "Settings-&gt;Interface-&gt;Enable context menu focus compatibility mode". Enabling this setting will fix dropdown menus being unclickable on these window managers.</li>
<li>Restrict a workaround that prevents a crash on Nvidia GPUs to only activate when we detect an Nvidia GPU. Side-effects for this workaround include window flashing and focus stealing when a steam window is closed, which should no longer affect Intel/AMD users.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, the Steam Deck changes are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/3650779172105465673" target="_blank">basically the same</a>, since this is a Steam Client update.</p>
<p>Is there a particular bug you're hoping to be solved soon? Or something you feel Steam is missing? Let me know in the comments box.</p>

      <title>Imagination GPUs now support OpenGL 4.6 thanks to Zink</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Here's a fun bit of driver and hardware news as Imagination announced their GPUs now support OpenGL 4.6 up from OpenGL 3.3 and it's thanks to the open source Zink driver. In their announcement they mentioned how they worked with <a href="https://www.collabora.com/" target="_blank">Collabora</a> to make this happen, the open source consulting firm that has many developers working all across Linux including the kernel, graphics drivers and much more.</p>
<p>As they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Support has been achieved by working alongside the open-source specialists at <a href="https://www.collabora.com/" target="_blank">Collabora</a>. Collabora’s Zink is a layered OpenGL® implementation, part of the open-source Mesa project, that allows OpenGL® 4.6 content to run on top of a native Vulkan driver. For Imagination GPUs, this is a win-win. While OpenGL® is now being used less frequently by developers who are preferring newer APIs such as Vulkan and DirectX, due to its previous popularity there are numerous legacy applications that wouldn’t work on Imagination hardware if we didn’t have driver-level support for its final version. Delivering support for OpenGL® 4.6 via our Vulkan drivers is as elegant solution that keeps our graphics stack simple.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They also showed off a demo of it:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="qS_oLxS7wdM"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0950b9b9dd8b447ff60b38520dc70aca.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/qS_oLxS7wdM" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>See their <a href="https://blog.imaginationtech.com/imagination-gpus-now-support-opengl-4.6" target="_blank">announcement here</a>.</p>
<p>Really great to see so many companies moving more towards making use of open source, and working with others to make it happen. This is how it should be done. I'm sure it won't be long before we start seeing this sort of thing as the norm, as OpenGL use falls off with more moving to modern rendering APIs using Zink is a great solution that continues to improve all the time.</p>

      <title>Godot Engine 4.1 brings a detachable script editor, Vulkan pipeline cache</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot 4.1</a> has been released today for game developers who want a cross-platform free and open source game engine. Bringing with it plenty of new features. This is part of their commitment to more regular releases to work on stability, performance, and polish.</p>
<p>Some of what's changed includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better performance for adding and removing child nodes.</li>
<li>Experimental multithreading for scenes.</li>
<li>The Vulkan renderer got a pipeline cache.</li>
<li>GDScript now has static variable support.</li>
<li>More parts of the UI can be detached and moved around like the script editor.</li>
<li>The Project Manager now lets you assign tags to projects for better filtering.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3089913491688650043gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3089913491688650043gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Even more changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Particle turbulence got reworked to give more control.</li>
<li>AI navigation upgrades.</li>
<li>And much more in the <a href="https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-1-is-here/" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get a bit of an overview in the below video:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="PAtG_fHhIx8"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/46852d29497c35770fd662af491ed8a9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/PAtG_fHhIx8" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Sounds like they need some more funding too, as they stated plainly in the release blog post that their "monthly expenses remain higher than monthly donations" and so they're quite dependent on large one-time donations from various companies. With that in mind you can learn how to <a href="https://godotengine.org/donate/" target="_blank">support them here</a>.</p>

      <title>ChimeraOS 43 out now adding ASUS ROG Ally support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ChimeraOS 43 has been released today adding in support for running this SteamOS inspired Linux distribution on the ASUS ROG Ally handheld. Quite an exciting release, since Linux projects like this can help extend the lifespan of devices like the ROG Ally well past when the original vendor moves on.</p>
<p>The initial ROG Ally support includes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Audio support (With DSDT Override enabled).</li>
<li>Functional WiFi.</li>
<li>Functional face buttons.</li>
<li>Functional Bluetooth.</li>
<li>Experimental partial TDP control in OpenGamepadUI.</li>
<li>Suspend functionality is still a work in progress. We recommend disabling auto suspend on the ROG ally and shutting the unit down after each gaming session.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17259636701688648266gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17259636701688648266gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>On top of that they've also added support for fan control on the AOKZOE A1 Pro, games should boot up faster overall, the ability to switch ChimeraOS update channels via the Steam UI and they've added support for the following handhelds using HandyGCCS (Handheld Game Console Controller Support):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>AOKZOE A1 Pro</li>
<li>ASUS ROG Ally</li>
<li>AYANEO 2S and GEEK 1S</li>
<li>AYN Loki Max</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>OpenGamepadUI has been updated with a new CardUI, support for many more handhelds, and numerous bug fixes that improve the user experience. Additionally, Lutris and Yuzu plugins have been added to the plugin store. See the OpenGamepadUI <a href="https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> to review the full list of changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DSDT overrides can be enabled for the AYANEO 2021 series and the GPD WinMax2 series that will enable the gyro to properly load in the BMI-160 driver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blackscreen issues for multiple handheld devices have been resolved by forcing gamescope to see some built-in panels as a external monitors. This has the effect of exposing the resolution options in the display settings in the Steam UI. <strong><em>Do not change the resolution from these options or the device could be forced into an unsupported resolution.</em></strong> Changing the UI Scale is the preferred way to adjust the readability of UI elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The AMD P-State driver will now be used on supported devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a Thai font.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users will no longer experience errors that falsely indicate an upgrade failure during future upgrades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added screen rotation quirk for the AYN Loki Max and AOKZOE A1 Pro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intel OneXPlayer devices should now have much better compatibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Fab retro-fuelled FPS &#39;Selaco&#39; gets a demo upgrade for Steam Deck / Linux</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Selaco is one that really needs to be on your wishlist, a retro-fuelled FPS powered by GZDoom with some impressive world design and fantastic combat. The developers recently updated the demo too! No word yet on when it will release but one things for certain — it's filled me full of hype for it after playing the updated demo.</p>
<p>More about it: "Selaco is a brand new original shooter running on GZDoom, featuring thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart AI and a fleshed out story taking place within an immersive game world. It draws inspiration heavily from F.E.A.R. in terms of action set pieces, while mixing traditional retro-FPS elements from QUAKE and DOOM, along with some more modern features. Together with professional artists who work in the industry, several having worked on successful throwback FPS games in the past, Selaco is a fully fleshed out world full of character, action, and mystery."</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3182584971688582290gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3182584971688582290gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Running great on desktop Linux - Fedora KDE</em></p>
<p>What they improved in the new demo:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Significant improvements to Engine Stability.</li>
<li>Improved Steam Deck and Linux support.</li>
<li>Full Controller Support for SPACE BRO.</li>
<li>Improved Smoke performance.</li>
<li>Slight tweaks to Pathfinding (the full game will use a completely new system that is more reliable and more performant).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They do note the full game will perform a lot better, as they didn't pull in all in their recent development work, just some specific bits to make it work a little better.</p>
<p>With the new demo one issue I did encounter is that it would crash since I had it previously installed. If you had the same issue, remove the Selaco installed folder and re-install it. Some left-over files cause issues as Steam doesn't remove them all for some reason.</p>
<p>Some new Steam Deck footage:</p>

      <title>Black Dragon Mage is my kind of bullet heaven survivor-like insanity</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Black Dragon Mage from developer Datablob Studio looks absolutely nuts! Taking inspiration from all the bullet heaven games like Vampire Survivors, Brotato and pulling in some elements from Path of Exile and even…Bomberman? Apparently so.</p>
<p>All the usual insane action you've come to know from the survivor-likes, with all the crazy abilities you can get as you fight off the hordes but they're teasing something about dragon eggs and their contents. Hmm. With 16-bit inspired visuals, plenty of creatures and big boss fights it looks like a lot of fun. </p>
<p>Yes, this is likely to be the next game to sucker away all of my free time. Releasing sometime in Q4 this year with Native Linux support and they said it will work great on the Steam Deck too as it was "Designed and developed with Valve's Steam Deck in mind" they told me.</p>
<p>Check out their brand new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="BYszW_blUV4"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f913bf62fd3f619bab2bbad53194334d.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/BYszW_blUV4" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Feature Highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Decimate legions of demonic enemies</strong> with magic projectiles and area damage that only grows more powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Channel your inner wizard</strong> to aim and cast your spells with pinpoint accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Forge your own path</strong> by experimenting with combinations of powerful <strong>defensive and offensive abilities</strong> such as the <em>Shield of Frost</em>, <em>Summoned Flame</em>, <em>Cardinal Strike</em>, and <em>Fiery Pentagram!</em></li>
<li><strong>Level-up</strong> and tweak your build until it reaches dizzying heights of power; every run brings a fresh perspective!</li>
<li><strong>Turn the environment</strong> to your favor using your <em>(often outrageously explosive!)</em> strategic genius, outmaneuver your foes by leading them into deadly traps!</li>
<li><strong>Endure</strong> the relentless waves, or...</li>
<li><strong>Perish</strong> and return stronger by unlocking <strong>meta-upgrades and fresh weaponry</strong> in the <em>Temple of Relics</em> with the gold you've gathered during your tireless runs!</li>
</ul>

      <title>ProtonUp-Qt v2.8.1 improves Heroic Games Launcher support</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>ProtonUp-Qt is the app that allows you to install the likes of GE-Proton, Wine-GE, Luxtorpeda and more for Steam, Lutris, Heroic Games Launcher and Boxtron.</p>
<p>A new release is out with v2.8.1 that brings with it support for installing Wine-GE, GE-Proton and D8VK for the Heroic Games Launcher. There's also now an Italian translation and translation support can now be done through the popular Weblate.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21459954561688565671gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/21459954561688565671gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Other changes behind the scenes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Increase Gamepad deadzone to five percent.</li>
<li>Improve logic for detecting the Steam root folder.</li>
<li>Account for D8VK's rename of the master branch.</li>
<li>Load more Proton-Tkg releases if none found on the first batch.</li>
<li>Fix wrongly displayed Lutris Wine Fshack versions.</li>
<li>Overhaul of the UI and internal functions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See all on the <a href="https://github.com/DavidoTek/ProtonUp-Qt" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>I've shown it off numerous times now like with my <a href="https://youtu.be/6doaQNnHR60" target="_blank">Steam Deck guide</a>. It's so ridiculously simple to use! Just download it either via the AppImage or Flatpak, load it up and select to install what you want and it does the rest of the work for you. Really nice to have such simple helper apps like this.</p>

<p>Who knows what the industry will look like in another 14 years. Will we have some sort of chip in our brains? Will Valve count to three finally? How about a new living room Steam Machine? Perhaps we will be on the Steam Deck 5 by then and everyone will be running Linux on their desktop. One can dream right?</p>

      <title>Get a free copy of Prey with Prime Gaming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Want another free game? If you have Amazon Prime you can now claim a free copy of Prey from Arkane Studios / Bethesda Softworks with their <a href="http://gog.com" target="_blank">GOG</a> partnership.</p>
<p>This is done through <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home" target="_blank">Prime Gaming</a>, where they regularly put up different games for members to claim. Quite useful to keep an eye on it, as sometimes there's a good few gems in there to get. You can claim Prey on it for another 19 days and since it's with GOG you get easy access to it.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="xlUA3p_kG0Q"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/9a8dfb84e2baa46c9b27c12349189bab.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/xlUA3p_kG0Q" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>You can <em>also</em> still claim a copy of Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition with GOG as well for another 14 days.</p>
<p><em>Want help managing games you've got on GOG? The likes of <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank">Heroic Games Launcher</a> and <a href="https://lutris.net/" target="_blank">Lutris</a> help with that.</em></p>
<p>There's various other games on Prime Gaming but they all need the Amazon Games app for Windows. There's no really ideal way for that on Linux / Steam Deck just yet but work is in progress to add support for it into Heroic. You could also try the work in progress <a href="https://github.com/imLinguin/nile" target="_blank">Nile</a>, which Heroic will be using.</p>

      <title>Character-driven tactical RPG &#39;Arcadian Atlas&#39; releasing July 27th</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>If you love your turn-based tactical RPGs with an interesting story to follow, anything perhaps like Final Fantasy Tactics and the like you'll want to take a look at Arcadian Atlas. The team just recently announced that it's going to release on July 27th, this is along with Native Linux support following their <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1266693296/arcadian-atlas-tactical-rpg-inspired-by-classics/description" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> back in 2016.</p>
<p>"Watch your back in the world of Arcadia, where a kingdom is tearing itself apart and forces more dark and ancient than the soil are about to awaken. Experience deep tactical battles across vast and treacherous landscapes as you build an army of powerful troops, customizing their classes and skills to gain every advantage against monsters, ruthless men, a daughter scorned, and a queen so cruel she’d kill her own husband to gain the throne."</p>
<p>They announced this along with a new very brief teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="j9ndtm4mI80"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/df2c885f00d234b5ffc161391850e960.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/j9ndtm4mI80" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More about it: "Play as two lovers brought together by war and torn between the queen they’ve sworn fealty to and the charismatic illegitimate daughter who’s risen up to take back a throne denied her—civil war threatening to engulf the destitute and desperate as battle lines are drawn and swords unsheathed. And amidst it all, a young girl caged behind castle walls her entire life stumbles upon the Atlas, a power she cannot hope to contain. With the help of a roguish magician she’ll uncover the forces that built the world, but can she control them? Or will they engulf her and the very world you’re trying to save."</p>
<p>Sounds really interesting, can't wait to see what the finished product is like. Nice to see more crowdfunded projects bear fruit. If it has good controller support it could be another sweet game to play in bed with the Steam Deck too.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/691790/Arcadian_Atlas/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>7 Days to Die gets another huge overhaul in Alpha 21</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>7 Days to Die has surged in popularity thanks to a huge new upgrade coming amount, with developer The Fun Pimps bringing some pretty surprising stuff to the game.</p>
<p>Rated Steam Deck Playable and it has Native Linux support, it's good to see development on it still going well. Thanks to this update it has shot up the Steam charts once again going from ~30K players to over 80K putting it on par with the likes of Modern Warfare 2 for player counts on Steam in the Top 10.</p>
<p>As for what they've added some of it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of visual improvements.</li>
<li>New types of Doors.</li>
<li>A respawn near backpack option.</li>
<li>Many locations expanded and overhauled.</li>
<li>Points of interest now show you their name and difficulty tier on screen</li>
<li>A better intro for new players</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11589112461688488078gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11589112461688488078gol1.jpg"/></a><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/11717558981688488080gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/11717558981688488080gol1.jpg"/></a><em>Pictured - 7 Days to Die Alpha 21 on Fedora KDE, click to enlarge.</em></p>
<p>Even more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perk system overhaul.</li>
<li>The Spear now has a power-attack rather than being thrown.</li>
<li>Recipe tracker so you don't lose sight of what you're gathering.</li>
<li>A HUD-less mode.</li>
<li>Lots of performance optimization work.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which can be <a href="https://7daystodie.com/a21-official-release-notes/" target="_blank">read in detail here</a>. Safe to say it really is a massive update!</p>
<p>Check out a quick Steam Deck video below where it works quite well:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="IIoNQmflN80"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/86770a5e3cc7fb96bdef709f914a5bb9.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/IIoNQmflN80" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>For desktop Linux with NVIDIA, I was not able to get it to run with Vulkan with this release. The game just crashes and quits when swapping to Vulkan in the launcher. Hopefully they will eventually get that sorted with their gradual Unity game engine upgrades so we're not stuck with OpenGL. Seems the Steam Overlay was also not working on desktop Linux for with 7 Days to Die right now.</p>
<p>Have you been playing the new Alpha? Be sure to comment and let me know what you think.</p>

      <title>Samurai Survivors gets Steam Deck Verified with gamepad improvements</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Samurai Survivors is another in the somewhat long list now of bullet-hell horde styled games, that exploded thanks to Vampire Survivors. It has Linux support and now it's Steam Deck Verified too. Released back in April, I'm not sure how I entirely missed it given my absolute love of these simple games that really sucker you in. </p>
<p>Over the last couple months the developer worked on fixing up bugs, improved text readability, improved gamepad support, fixed scaling issues at 16:10 resolutions and more. Thanks to all that, Valve slapped a Steam Deck Verified sticker on it with the Native Linux build.</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="EcJuEqdML8o"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/2f1351de649be808cbbb5835eaabed58.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/EcJuEqdML8o" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Game Features:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hours of intense slicing &amp; slashing survival!</li>
<li>21 unique attacks with incredible synergies!</li>
<li>Interesting enemies with unique mechanics. They don't just increase in health!</li>
<li>Different maps with map-specific enemies and mechanics!</li>
<li>Unlockable weapons &amp; attack techniques!</li>
<li>Future updates! New content like techniques, maps, and enemies will be added!</li>
<li>Continue playing the game after you beat the time with increasing Ascension Levels!</li>
<li>Custom-made Japanese medieval musics!</li>
<li>Lots and lots of juicy gameplay!</li>

      <title>Morrowind modern game engine OpenMW 0.48 is readying to release</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>OpenMW is a modern free and open source game engine for Morrowind, and it's really getting close to a release of version 0.48 now with another Release Candidate ready for more testing. The whole point of OpenMW is to get Morrowind working nicely on modern platforms, with a whole bunch of improvements to how it looks and feels.</p>
<p>The last release for OpenMW was back in <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/openmw-brings-many-new-features-for-morrowind-in-the-new-0470-release/" target="_blank">November 2021</a>, so it's been a long time coming and as you can imagine a lot of work has gone into this upcoming new release. Going through Release Candidates means it's closing in on release, and needs some testing for any final touches needed and to find any major bugs. The first RC went up back in September 2022, with a fresh one going up just recently.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9800035521688477098gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/9800035521688477098gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>They haven't yet put up an official list of what's changed but the public GitLab does have an ongoing list, and it seems plenty is already readying up for the release after this too. Some of the new features coming in this release include which I've cherry-picked from their GitLab include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom levels of the world map.</li>
<li>A tab in the launcher for handling different data folders.</li>
<li>Post processing.</li>
<li>Support for FBO Rendering.</li>
<li>Support for FFMPEG 5.</li>
<li>Windowed fullscreen support.</li>
<li>Exponential fog.</li>
<li>Sky blending.</li>
<li>Add support for controller gyroscope.</li>
<li>Shader-based object texture blending.</li>
<li>More realistic raindrop ripples.</li>
<li>Allow users to easily change font size and ttf resolution.</li>
<li>Unique object identifier.</li>
<li>And lots lots more!</li>
</ul>
<p>OpenMW <a href="https://openmw.org/2022/openmw-0-48-0-is-now-in-rc-phase/" target="_blank">download links are here</a> for the latest RC build. Remember though you do still need to own a copy of Morrowind for that data files that you can grab <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_elder_scrolls_iii_morrowind_goty_edition" target="_blank">from GOG</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22320/The_Elder_Scrolls_III_Morrowind_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p>

      <title>Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms - the huge OpenRA mod adds more missions</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Easily one of my favourite game packs made with OpenRA is Command &amp; Conquer - Combined Arms, bundling together the Allies, Soviets, Nod, GDI and the Scrin. A new release is out in v0.91 expanding the content a fair bit.</p>
<p>Free to download and the main project is open source, using the freeware assets from the free releases of earlier Westwood RTS games that EA put up officially years ago. You've got nothing to lose but time here as it will suck you in if you love your classic real time strategy action. You can play it in single-player in the campaign, skirmish battles and online against others too.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2275311431688474732gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2275311431688474732gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>A summary of the main points changed in this release:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

      <title>Half-Life Alyx NoVR continues to impress and evolve</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Half-Life Alyx NoVR is really coming together and a fresh update is out now to make the experience even better for those without a VR kit. I will say that it's still one of my favourite experiences ever in gaming with the Valve Index, but given how Half-Life is a much loved series, more people deserve to be able to play it. These modders are a dedicated bunch that's for sure!</p>
<p>To go along with the update they also released some new trailers:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="4KYOkcyTQqU"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/62bd98d94f65324384d2555aacdd171b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/4KYOkcyTQqU" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="-PhufWZjLSw"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/0bf9e04552d6aa971939ea4d826ee0d7.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/-PhufWZjLSw" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>What's in the latest update:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added Alyx's pockets (not available on Steam Deck yet).</li>
<li>Improved collision in various levels so players cannot skip areas.</li>
<li>Unsupported mods no longer crash the game when going back to the main menu.</li>
<li>Added new supported mods.</li>
<li>Improved viewmodel sway and bob.</li>
<li>Improved interactions throughout all levels.</li>
<li>Easier to use ladders.</li>
<li>Crash fixes.</li>
<li>Steam Deck stability improvements.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>They're also now providing a dedicated version for the Steam Deck, although that will potentially not be needed once they add support on Steam Deck for everything. From what I tested in a previous build on Steam Deck it was very promising and desktop too - so I can't wait to see this finished.</p>
<p>For the mod support it now works with Levitation, Extra-Ordinary Value, Resident Evil Alyx: Biohazard, Goldeneye Alyx - 007 - Dam, Belomorskaya Station, Overcharge and Red Dust.</p>
<p>See all the info in their <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr/news/half-life-alyx-is-on-sale-new-update-new-trailers" target="_blank">news post on Mod DB</a>. A good time to try it as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/" target="_blank">Half-Life: Alyx</a> is currently on sale on Steam with 60% off in the Summer Sale.</p>

      <title>Skullgirls got review-bombed on Steam after some art changes</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Skullgirls 2nd Encore from Hidden Variable Studios and Autumn Games is having some community issues lately, with it getting review-bombed after a recent update.</p>
<p>What's going on exactly? Skullgirls now has a Mostly Negative recent user review rating on Steam, and you can clearly see the masses that have been flocking to the Steam page to let their feelings be known:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20078745701688466705gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/20078745701688466705gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>The why: on June 26th the developers announced some changes to existing content in the game and the Digital Art Compendium. The full list of changes can be <a href="https://skullheart.com/threads/official-content-updates-and-revisions.11921/" target="_blank">seen here</a> and it's not a long list so it's an easy overview. The developers made a <a href="https://forum.skullgirlsmobile.com/threads/official-skullgirls-content-updates-revisions.20180/" target="_blank">longer post</a> a few days before to explain why.</p>
<p>Reading through the updates were done "in the spirit of better reflecting our values and our broad vision for Skullgirls moving forward" which include removing Nazi-like depictions including armbands and symbols, adjusting some character artwork to remove sexualization of younger characters and racial stereotype issues they believed to be in poor taste.</p>
<p>Overall, the tweaks they've made seem quite small but this hasn't stopped the wave of negativity with user reviews complaining about "censorship" and going "woke". It's not entirely negative though, as a few hundred have also come along to leave a positive review but not enough to stop the overall recent review score looking really bad.</p>
<p>This YouTube video does a good look at some of the changes. Some are really a blink and you'll miss it type of deal and most players probably wouldn't even notice:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="wL18fryeqUg"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/1ca817524de04b3b94f90d431c1adf7b.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/wL18fryeqUg" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Since the update around 3,449 negative reviews have been posted against 868 positive reviews, and it looks like the initial reaction is now dying off.</p>
<p>It does also bring up the interesting topic of how in the age of the internet and the likes of Steam, even games 10 years old can suddenly have changes you really might not like. Even when they're not technically some online-only "live service" type of thing.</p>
<p><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px">Skullgirls certainly hasn't had the best history, with the original studio Lab Zero collapsing after a </span><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/08/devs-quit-skullgirls-and-indivisible-studio-lab-zero-games-issues-with-studio-owner/" style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); font-size:16px" target="_blank">bunch of developers quit</a><span style="background-color:var(--article-main-background); color:var(--font-color); font-size:16px"> accusing the owner Mike Zaimont of various counts of inappropriate behaviour.

      <title>Quantum: Recharged from Atari gets a new trailer</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Ahead of the upcoming release of Quantum: Recharged, the latest in the series of retro remakes from Atari and SneakyBox, a new trailer is live now.</p>
<p>Time to relive a classic? There's quite a few in the Recharged series now including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2114990/Missile_Command_Recharged/" target="_blank">Missile Command: Recharged</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1630960/Centipede_Recharged/" target="_blank">Centipede: Recharged</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2213980/Caverns_of_Mars_Recharged/" target="_blank">Caverns of Mars: Recharged</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2019990/Yars_Recharged/" target="_blank">Yars: Recharged</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1700890/Asteroids_Recharged/" target="_blank">Asteroids: Recharged</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1905430/Gravitar_Recharged/" target="_blank">Gravitar: Recharged</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714180/Black_Widow_Recharged/" target="_blank">Black Widow: Recharged</a>. All of which have Native Linux support and this latest will too. Doesn't seem like many of them have sold all that well though, with each having less than 100 user reviews on Steam.</p>
<p>Check out their new teaser trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="o-QbTiXmW6M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/d75609a9fbaa6f6d153ff8c7d5145bda.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/o-QbTiXmW6M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>More: "Over 40 years since its arcade debut, Quantum: Recharged warps the classic arcade title with modern flourishes that have become a staple among the Recharged series. Defeat waves of enemies using your ship to circle around them and create a punishing deadzone. By removing the traditional ability to shoot enemies, this title challenges players to avoid taking damage and progress through increasingly difficult levels.</p>
<p>This Recharged release expands on the classic gameplay with a wider variety of deadly enemies and some new moves to even the odds. Accelerate to make some distance between you and a stalking Neutron and use your dodge to avoid the Quarks’ deadly laser attacks. With two modes of play, you can chase for high scores in both the endless arcade mode or 25 curated levels designed to push your reflexes to the limits."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2460490/Quantum_Recharged/" target="_blank">follow it on Steam</a>. No release date has been given other than "later this year".</p>

      <title>Building a Retro Linux Gaming Computer Part 29: The Odyssey</title>
      <author>Hamish</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Return to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-1-dumpster-diving/" target="_blank">Part 1: Dumpster Diving</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Continued from <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/03/building-a-retro-linux-gaming-computer-part-28-losing-my-marbles/" target="_blank">Part 28: Losing My Marbles</a></strong></p>
<p>It was one of my regular readers, Grzegorz Budny, that let me know about the driving simulation <em>Odyssey by Car</em> first released by the German independent developer Oliver Hamann back in 2001. The website for the game was taken down not long after, but a demo contained in the odysscar.zip archive can still be found online from places such as the Internet Archive. Apart from having to provide executable privileges to the "odysscar" and "res/uslproc" files this launched without issue.</p>
<p>Included was the first of six maps found in the full version of the game, with it showing decent performance for me in OpenGL or even software rendering with a drawing distance of up to about 200 metres or so. This was more than enough to pique my interest in the game, and with further help from Grzegorz Budny, I was able to get in contact with Oliver Hamann himself who very kindly agreed to send me a copy of the full version of <em>Odyssey by Car</em> to cover.</p>
<p>I was a touch concerned that it was the later 1.04 version from 2008 I was sent, but it does still work just fine for me on Red Hat Linux 7.3 Valhalla. The only issue I encountered is that <em>Odyssey by Car</em> now looks for the libXxf86vm.so.1 legacy library from Xorg when starting full screen, and I am running XFree86 still, but I was able to work around this by pulling the library from an RPM package for Fedora Core 2 and just preloading that to pass the library check.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to navigate a car through a three dimensional environment, collecting all of the waymarkers in a level before the timer runs out. This is complicated by the game's intensive simulation of real world driving mechanics and physics, requiring a greater degree of finesse to control than is the case in most arcade styled racers. I would still hesitate to describe the simulation as fully realistic, as based on my showing here, I should never be allowed on a public highway again.</p>
<p><em>Odyssey by Car</em> defaults to using a manual transmission, with automatic being offered as an option for us neophytes, but this concession did little to help stop me from oversteering off cliffs or going headlong into barriers. I did wrestle more control once I learned to pump the accelerator and apply more brake on turns, but I still found myself spinning out whenever I went much past what would be an actual posted speed limit, always keeping me just short of the timer even on the first level.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/13212828011688409432gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/13212828011688409432gol6.png"/></a> <a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17859031071688409433gol6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17859031071688409433gol6.png"/></a></p>
<p>Thankfully the level timers remain fixed even in two player games, meaning I could share the workload. As such, I waited until my brother was off work during his spring vacation to see if we could tackle our way through <em>Odyssey by Car</em> together. He got to grips with the controls far faster than I did, which I suspect is due to him operating forklifts for a living. Doing this we managed to reach all the way to the penultimate level, before hitting another roadblock.</p>
<p>It is from here that basic driving and navigation proves to no longer be sufficient, with the levels now expecting you to perform stunts in order to collect all of the waymarkers, just as the worlds become more fantastic. <em>Odyssey by Car</em> starts rural with the grandest feature being a castle, before giving way to more dense urban environments, and then to space age locales such as a shuttle port and the Martian surface. The final map even has you racing on top of rainbows.</p>
<p>To accommodate two players and to lean further into the simulation, I was able to attach a Logitech Driving Force E-UC2 racing wheel originally designed as a PlayStation 2 controller; being a USB device, it was as simple as ensuring the joystick package was installed and then running "modprobe joydev" to get the wheel recognized under Linux. Further configuration can then be handled from within the game itself, with your status kept in the hidden .odysscar.sav file in your home directory.</p>
<p>While playing my brother and I even discovered a few tricks of our own. Since you can crash your car in multiplayer without the game resetting the level, you can use this to jump back to the start of the map, cutting down on transit times. One grievance we did have is that the level timer does not show in two player split screen, nor does the map built into the heads-up display; the full map can still be toggled, but this only shows the position of one of the cars.</p>
<p>Oliver Hamann still sells a version of the game for Android from Google Play under the title <em>3D Turbo Car Driving Odyssey</em>, but given that <em>Odyssey by Car</em> still runs great on my main Arch Linux computer apart from full screen, it seems to me that even the original game would be a fantastic fit for a platform like itch.io with just a bit of modernization work. The stylized vector looking graphics lend a timeless quality, leaving it a shame that more players will not get to experience the odyssey.</p>

      <title>Nearly 40% of Linux gamers on Steam are on Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The latest Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey is out for June 2023, and it shows just how much the Linux share is now influenced by the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Overall the Steam Deck has kind of taken over Linux gaming and June 2023's statistic are pretty <em>striking</em>. For the last few months SteamOS was sitting in the low to mid 20% but it seems there's been a big uptick over the last month because it's jumped rather a lot.</p>
<p>According to Valve's stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>SteamOS Holo 64 bit 39.33% +14.01%</li>
<li>Arch Linux 64 bit 8.33% -1.66%</li>
<li>Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS 64 bit 7.87% -1.85%</li>
<li>Freedesktop.org SDK 22.08 (Flatpak runtime) 64 bit 6.02% -1.25%</li>
<li>Linux Mint 21.1 64 bit 4.55% -0.91%</li>
<li>"Manjaro Linux" 64 bit 4.37% -1.42%</li>
<li>Other 29.54% -3.38% </li>
</ul>
<p>We can expect that SteamOS Holo count to increase again, considering <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/steam-deck-now-the-global-1-top-seller-on-steam/" target="_blank">how well the Steam Deck is selling</a> during the Steam Summer Sale 2023. Something to keep in mind though, is that for a lot of people the Steam Deck will be an additional system, not their only one used by Steam but you usually only get the survey on one machine.</p>
<p>The overall stats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 96.77% +0.63%</li>
<li>OSX 1.79% -0.60%</li>
<li>Linux 1.44% -0.03%</li>
</ul>
<p>Going by what Valve list that puts Linux use almost as high as the remaining Windows 7 and 8 machines noted in the survey results. </p>
<p>Latest details of the Linux user share over time can be seen on our <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/steam-tracker/" target="_blank">dedicated Steam Tracker page</a>.</p>

      <title>Evolution sim Thrive v0.6.3 gives a glimpse of the future</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Free, open source and scientific! Thrive is an in-development evolution sim, with a new release out now adding in some more big prototypes for later-life stages.</p>
<p>After the last release adding in a prototype for being on land and seeing a civilization start to appear, this release goes even further. Now there's a prototypes for going from a single cell all the way into space. Sounds exciting but the keyword is <em>prototype</em>, don't expect anything fancy-looking. Thrive as a whole is still under heavy development. It's more the developers just showing off a bit and laying the groundwork for what's to come, to give you a sneaky peek at their wider plans.</p>
<p>On top of the new prototypes there's a few other changes:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Added a new toxin damage sound (instead of reusing the emit sound).</li>
<li>Improved the placeholder tree and rocket graphics for the prototypes.</li>
<li>Added a system for window panels to reorder this makes draggable windows go on top of other such windows when they are moved around or opened.</li>
<li>Added a new feature to the museum screen to delete fossils.</li>
<li>Added miscellaneous fun screen filter shaders.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See the new trailer:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="V6qKN8F5I1M"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/671fe51743be12532a264bad880b89e3.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/V6qKN8F5I1M" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>They said that now all the main prototypes are in, they'll be going back to once again expand the microbe stage which is currently the most complete.</p>
<p>I love watching this game grow, it's already really fascinating in the early game and what they're doing with it is showing a lot of promise. Mechanically very interesting but they just need to keep iterating on the design to find more of the fun.</p>
<p>You can buy it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1779200/Thrive/?curator_clanid=4218320" target="_blank">Steam</a> to support development or download it <a href="https://revolutionarygamesstudio.com/" target="_blank">direct</a> or via <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.revolutionarygamesstudio.ThriveLauncher" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</p>

      <title>BattleBit Remastered is good fun but anti-cheat for Steam Deck &amp; Linux is concerning</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>BattleBit Remastered is the current game climbing the ranks on Steam, made by a tiny team of only 3 people it has regularly seen tens of thousands of players. It works on Steam Deck and desktop Linux but the anti-cheat may turn into a big problem.</p>
<p>It's been seeing somewhere between 60 to 80 thousand people playing it each day at the same time, making it <em>constantly</em> in the top 5 most played games on Steam. Clearly people were after a Battlefield-like that isn't from EA and with the graphical style, it can run on pretty much anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18732598381688397217gol1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/18732598381688397217gol1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>Currently it uses Easy Anti-Cheat, but they previously announced plans to switch to FACEIT, which would break it on Steam Deck and Linux desktop with Proton. On the Steam forum, one of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/671860/discussions/4/6717729816414777432/?ctp=34#c3814034622527114302" target="_blank">their team noted</a> that's not quite the plan now, as they're going to look for something "in between EAC and FACEIT Anti Cheat in terms of requirements" - so it could still end up being something that doesn't work on Linux.</p>
<p>To make things more confusing, I spoke to the developer today and they said "Despite we have intentions to switch to FACEIT, we will keep the EAC as an option and still have servers that support EAC." — so they actually <em>are</em> still looking at FACEIT which will be a problem. Although keeping EAC will be good for Steam Deck / Linux, it may cause other problems. Using multiple anti-cheat may not be an easy thing to keep up for a tiny team.</p>
<p><em>So if you're looking at picking it up, just something to keep in mind.</em></p>
<p>See my video talking about it below:</p>

      <title>GE-Proton 8-6 is out now fixing up more games for Linux and Steam Deck</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom" target="_blank">GE-Proton</a> has another release available (two actually) so here's a run over what's new for this community-maintained translation layer. This is the version of Proton <em>not</em> supported by Valve, so it may have issues at times the official Proton does not. However, it also at times pulls in fixes a bit quicker and can do things sometimes that Valve cannot do.</p>
<p><em>To sum up: use it if you need it for specific games, otherwise sticking with the official Proton is the best idea.</em></p>
<p>Just recently both GE-Proton 8-5 and 8-6 were released. Here's what's changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fixed FFXIV Hydaelyn new player intro video not playing (again)</li>
<li>Gears 5 now works with EAC without any workarounds needed. If you previously used proton-ge to play, go into the game folder and remove these folders:<br/>
/GearGame/Binaries/Steam/EasyAntiCheat-backup/Engine/Binaries/ThirdParty/GFSDK_Aftermath</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Then verify the integrity of the game files so that it re-downloads the originals.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>protonfix added for Two Worlds audio (thanks marciocr)</li>
<li>protonfix added for APB Reloaded (thanks telqor)</li>
<li>dxvk updated to latest git</li>
<li>vkd3d-proton updated to latest git</li>
<li>wine updated to latest bleeding edge</li>
<li>staging patches rebased</li>
<li>steam_helper updates imported from upstream</li>
<li>imported kaldi, openfst, vosk-api modules from upstream</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't actually need GE-Proton for Gears 5 though to be clear. The <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/gears-5-gets-updated-to-improve-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank">game was updated</a> and it works with Proton 7.</p>
<p><strong>Text Guide to install GE-Proton:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Download
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: head to the <a href="https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/" target="_blank">official website</a>, scroll down and pick your favourite download option either AppImage or <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.davidotek.pupgui2" target="_blank">Flathub</a>.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: simply download ProtonUp-Qt from Discover in Desktop Mode (Steam Button -&gt; Power - Switch to Desktop).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Load ProtonUp-Qt.</li>
<li>Make sure it's set to Steam at the top and select to install GE-Proton.</li>
<li>Reload Steam to update the compatibility layer list.</li>
<li>In Steam:
<ul>
<li><u>Desktop</u>: right click a game and go to Properties.</li>
<li><u>Steam Deck</u>: find the game in your library, go to the little cog on the right and then select Properties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compatibility menu -&gt; Tick the box, select GE-Proton from the drop-down</li>
</ul>

      <title>Reminder: Update your PC info for our statistics page</title>
      <author>gamingonlinux</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>This is the public once a month reminder to make sure your PC information is correct on your user profiles. A fresh batch of statistics is generated around the start of each month. Also a good reminder of our stats system for people who don't know about it. There's now a <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/forum/topic/5707/" target="_blank">dedicated Forum Topic</a> for <em>ongoing</em> discussions and you can <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/users/statistics" target="_blank">view the statistics on this page.</a></p>
<p><em>You need to be logged in to see when you last updated your PC info!</em></p>
<p>PC Info is automatically purged if it hasn't been updated, or if you don't click the link to remain in for 5 years. This way we prevent too much stale data and don't hold onto your data for longer than required. If this is still correct and it has been a long time since you updated, you can simply <strong><a href="#" id="pc_info_update" target="_self">click here to continue</a> to be included</strong>. If this isn't correct, <a href="/usercp.php?module=pcinfo" target="_blank">click here to go to your User Control Panel to update it!</a></p>
<div class="all-ok" id="pc_info_done"></div>
<p>This is now going out at the start of each month, to give people a chance to talk over the stats from a fresh month where it makes a bit more sense. And gives more time to adjust anything based on feedback for the next one.</p>
<p>Recently a few newer GPUs were added and some incomplete GPU naming was corrected based on feedback.</p>

<p>No surprise on many there really but it's a great example of the many different types of games people are playing. The Steam Deck is just so versatile, as long as you're willing to turn down some settings in the most recent releases.</p>

      <title>Steam Deck now the global #1 top seller on Steam</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>With the Steam Summer Sale 2023 now in full swing, and with a big discount on the Steam Deck, it has risen back up the Steam charts. It's not a big surprise really, especially the top end model at a 20% discount marking the price down from £569 to £455.20. That's a pretty huge saving on one of the best PC handhelds around.</p>
<p>Looking over the stats today that Valve publishes, globally the Steam Deck has moved from fifth to first place. In the UK all models are currently listed as out of stock too, although they were all in stock yesterday when the sale went live. </p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4098533281688130326gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/4098533281688130326gol1.png"/></a></p>
<p>Check stock in your own country <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank">here</a>, or on <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp" target="_blank">Komodo</a> for certain regions in Asia.</p>
<p>For the UK, this likely stings a little for people who were about to purchase, as the 64GB and 256GB model have been constantly out of stock for some time now. Valve did not reply to my previous email asking about plans for increasing stock on those models in the UK.</p>
<p>Good news for Valve though as it shows how ridiculously popular the Steam Deck remains. Even before the sale, it has been consistently in the Top 5 on the global sales list. The list is by <em>revenue </em>though, not units sold, but when you note that it's up against games that sell multiple hundreds of thousands (and millions at times) — they're shifting a lot for what is still quite a niche device overall.</p>
<p>Did you pick one up? </p>

      <title>Part 4 of the Wine work for Wayland is now merged</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>The <a href="https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/merge_requests/2944" target="_blank">fourth part</a> of an ongoing series of submission to Wine to get full Wayland support has been merged in. The merge request was opened 4 weeks ago, and it was merged into the Wine project on June 29th.</p>
<p>With the focus of this most recent work to give the "minimum necessary infrastructure to display the contents of some simple, software rendered windows" as detailed by the developer it involved two major steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Associate a window with a Wayland surface and give it the <code class="inline-code">xdg_toplevel</code> role, so that the compositor can display it. We also have to implement the required initial <code class="inline-code">xdg_surface</code> configuration sequence to be able to safely (i.e., without the compositor disconnecting us with an error) attach buffers to the surface in step (2).</li>
<li>Implement the <code class="inline-code">window_surface</code> interface for the Wayland driver. For now we provide a simple (and suboptimal) <code class="inline-code">window_surface_flush</code> implementation: for each flush we create a new <code class="inline-code">wl_shm</code> buffer, copy the whole window contents (ignoring damaged bounds for now) into it and attach it to the target Wayland surface. In the next MR I will optimize this implementation in multiple ways: a. implement a buffer queue to avoid constantly allocating new buffers b. respect the damaged bounds of the <code class="inline-code">window_surface</code> to minimize copying of data from the <code class="inline-code">window_surface</code> to the SHM buffer (and also for correctness) c. communicate damaged surface regions to the compositor to (potentially) allow more efficient texture uploads.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to this work many software rendered applications can now actually display dynamic content on screen with Wayland but you can't interacct with them just yet. Small steps but it's a pretty big project to get moving from X11 to Wayland.</p>
<p>For those of you not clear on why it's needed: Wine currently needs X11 and so if you're on Wayland you'll be running things through XWayland (basically X running under Wayland like a compatibility layer). This adds more complexity to it and more ways performance could be reduced. Obviously the ideal situation is to just have Wine and Wayland talk directly with no extra middle layer.</p>
<p>The end result will mean Wine will work on Wayland without needing XWayland. This work should be in the next release with Wine 8.12 due out next weekend with their usual bi-weekly development releases.</p>

      <title>Valve appear to be banning games with AI art on Steam (updated)</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p><strong>Update 01/07/2023</strong> - Valve sent over a statement here's what they said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are continuing to learn about AI, the ways it can be used in game development, and how to factor it in to our process for reviewing games submitted for distribution on Steam. Our priority, as always, is to try to ship as many of the titles we receive as we can. The introduction of AI can sometimes make it harder to show a developer has sufficient rights in using AI to create assets, including images, text, and music. In particular, there is some legal uncertainty relating to data used to train AI models. It is the developer's responsibility to make sure they have the appropriate rights to ship their game.</p>
<p>We know it is a constantly evolving tech, and our goal is not to discourage the use of it on Steam; instead, we're working through how to integrate it into our already-existing review policies. Stated plainly, our review process is a reflection of current copyright law and policies, not an added layer of our opinion.  As these laws and policies evolve over time, so will our process.</p>
<p>We welcome and encourage innovation, and AI technology is bound to create new and exciting experiences in gaming. While developers can use these AI technologies in their work with appropriate commercial licenses, they can not infringe on existing copyrights.</p>
<p>Lastly, while App-submission credits are usually non-refundable, we're more than happy to offer them in these cases as we continue to work on our review process.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr/>
<p><em>Original article below:</em></p>
<p>Here's an interesting one on Steam publishing for you. Valve appear to be clamping down on AI art used in games due to the murky legal waters. AI art is such a huge topic of discussion everywhere right now, as is other forms of "AI" like ChatGPT and it's just — everywhere. I can't seem to get away from talk on it from people for and against it.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/142j3yt/valve_is_not_willing_to_publish_games_with_ai/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, a developer who tried to release their game on Steam got word back from Valve that they have denied listing it. Here's what they sent the developer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all of the necessary rights.</p>
<p>After reviewing, we have identified intellectual property in [Game Name Here] which appears to belongs to one or more third parties. In particular, [Game Name Here] contains art assets generated by artificial intelligence that appears to be relying on copyrighted material owned by third parties. As the legal ownership of such AI-generated art is unclear, we cannot ship your game while it contains these AI-generated assets, unless you can affirmatively confirm that you own the rights to all of the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create the assets in your game.</p>
<p>We are failing your build and will give you one (1) opportunity to remove all content that you do not have the rights to from your build.</p>
<p>If you fail to remove all such content, we will not be able to ship your game on Steam, and this app will be banned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That developer mentioned they tweaked the artwork, so it wasn't so obviously AI generated and spoke to Valve again but Valve once again rejected it noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience as we reviewed [Game Name Here] and took our time to better understand the AI tech used to create it. Again, while we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all of the necessary rights. At this time, we are declining to distribute your game since it’s unclear if the underlying AI tech used to create the assets has sufficient rights to the training data.</p>
<p>App credits are usually non-refundable, but we’d like to make an exception here and offer you a refund. Please confirm and we’ll proceed.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the current issues with AI art and how it's generated, this really seems like a no-brainer for Valve to deny publishing games that have AI art unless the developers of the games can prove fully they own the full rights. Their own <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect" target="_blank">guidelines</a> are pretty clear on it, developers cannot publish games on Steam they don't have "adequate rights" to.</p>
<p>That said, this is a difficult topic to fully address. With the tools Valve will be using to flag these games, how will they be dealing with false positives? It's not likely Valve will be individually personally going over every game with a human checking it, and algorithms can be problematic. It's going to be interesting to see how this develops over time. Seems like more developers will need to have everything they need ready to ensure they can prove ownership of all artwork.</p>
<p>I've reached out to Valve to see if they have any comments on it to share.</p>
<p><em>What do you think about this? Let me know in the comments.</em></p>

      <title>AMD RADV gets feature to help emulation and translation layers</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Some fun news for AMD GPU owners with the open source RADV (Vulkan) Mesa driver, as it recently gained support for fragment shader interlock. This will be useful for emulation and translation layers.</p>
<p>The merge request for this work was opened <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/22250" target="_blank">back in April</a>, with it being merged into Mesa a few days ago so it should hopefully be available in the Mesa 23.2 release due out in August. From the developer: "This merge request adds an implementation of <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock.html" target="_blank">VK_EXT_fragment_shader_interlock</a> (Primitive Ordered Pixel Shading — POPS — in AMD hardware terms), a <a href="https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/AMDVLK/issues/108" target="_blank">highly demanded</a> feature in the emulation community (including for the Xbox 360 emulator I'm working on, Xenia), and one of the requirements of Direct3D feature level 12_1."</p>
<p>Where is it actually used? According to the dev various translation layers, emulators and games have support for it including: DXVK, VKD3D-Proton, the Zink driver, the Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx, the Xbox 360 emulator Xenia, the PlayStation 2 emulator Play!, a few games need it too like A Plague Tale: Requiem, GRID 2, Just Cause 3 and so on.</p>
<p>Overall it clearly seems rather useful to have and should make the gaming experience on AMD GPUs with RADV even better</p>

      <title>Steam Summer Sale 2023 is live with the Steam Deck up to 20% off</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Today the Steam Summer Sale 2023 is live once again, where a great many developers put up big discounts for their games. You know the drill right? Your wallet is already hiding from you.</p>
<p>Not only are lots and lots of games on sale but the Steam Deck is as well. You can pick up the 64GB model with 10% off, the 256GB model with 15% off and the 512GB model with 20% off right now. Interestingly, the two lower models have been out of stock in the UK for a while but now they're back in stock - I wonder if Valve were hoarding a bunch ready for the sale expecting many to get sold at once.</p>
<p>Valve also put up a special <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/decktop100" target="_blank">Top 100 page for the Steam Deck</a> so you can easily scroll down through a nice list with discounts and expected compatibility with Deck Verified ratings. You can also get the Steam Deck on sale on <a href="https://steamdeck.komodo.jp/" target="_blank">Komodo</a> for select regions.</p>
<p>Valve made a trailer for the event too:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="sWevbtmmTVk"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/af6bb83415c5625fd70e497c84072947.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/sWevbtmmTVk" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>As always - if you find a particularly good deal for a game that works on Linux or Steam Deck be sure to comment and give over your own recommendations. I'm currently going over my own wishlist but my pile of shame is already rather long at this point.</p>
<p>For a few quick picks I can recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/" target="_blank">Valheim</a> (40% off, highest discount yet), I will also never not recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/" target="_blank">Deep Rock Galactic</a> (67% off) both great co-op games. Now that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank">Dead by Daylight</a> (60% off) works great I can also suggest that as great fun.</p>
<p>Valve also has a few little treats with a free sticker to claim each day, a new seasonal badge in the Points Shop, two new Artist Profiles and some chances to earn Summer Sale trading cards to level up your Summer Sale Badge.</p>
<p>Check out the sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">the Steam store</a>. The Steam Summer Sale 2023 lasts until July 13th at 10am PT / 5pm UTC.</p>

      <title>System76 reveal the &#39;Nebula&#39; a new PC case for everyone</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>After building up their in-house manufacturing capabilities with their custom Thelio desktop and their Launch keyboards, System76 are now expanding into PC cases for everyone.</p>
<p>I always loved the look of the Thelio, as did many others, and people have been asking System76 for quite some time to provide <em>just</em> the case and so the Nebula is their answer. Available across three different sizes based on their Thelio, Thelio Mira and Thelio Major desktops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nebula 19: $199 - 12.87′′ × 8.15′′ × 11.46′′ (327 × 207 × 291mm) - Mini ITX</li>
<li>Nebula 36: $269 - 17.18′′ × 9.96′′ × 12.56′′ (436 × 253 × 319mm) - Mini ITX, MicroATX, and ATX</li>
<li>Nebula 49: $329 - 18.15′′ × 10.28′′ × 16.06′′ (461 × 261 × 408mm) - ATX and EATX</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of them has a customizable accent stripe too:</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><a data-fancybox="images" href="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/17115642621688027946gol1.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/2998397271688027932gol1.png"/></a><br/>

<p>System76 say they were designed for easy access to all components, with a removable lid giving you easy access from multiple angles. "Nebula’s a pleasure to work in," says Thomas Zimmerman, System76 Happiness Team Manager and experienced PC builder. He added that often when working with cases from other brands, he’d come away with cuts on his hands. Not the case with System76, who sees repairability as an important consideration for a final product.</p>
<p>Plenty of room for GPUs too with the <em>19</em> fitting up to 272.3mm, <em>36</em> up to 312mm and <em>49</em> up to 390.5mm. So the top end model should be big enough for practically any GPU with room for future-proofing.</p>
<p>With this being a specially designed case, there's some extras you can get for it too. System76 offers an upgrade where you get their CPU coolers, additional GPU intake fans and a SARA backplane for drive hot-swapping.</p>

<p>Talking about thermals, here's what System76 had to say: "Thermal engineering plays a role in power yield, too. As your system heats up, components become throttled and reduce performance. To get the most out of the components you have, System76 offers an upgrade for Nebula which includes the tested and recommended CPU coolers and additional GPU intake fans used in THELIO desktops. Nebula features separate CPU and GPU cooling systems. The CPU is cooled with a dedicated intake vent and duct with a series of fans pulling cool air across the CPU cooler and pushing hot air out of the exhaust. Vents at the end of the CPU duct allow GPU heat to radiate into the hot air portion of the duct for additional GPU exhaust. GPUs are cooled with a large 140MM bottom intake fan and an optional 120MM side intake fan. A guide on recommended fan placement will be available upon setup."</p>
<p>Max size of the air cooler it will fit when using their CPU duct:</p>
<ul>
<li>nebula19: 125mm H (148mm H w/o duct) × 95mm W × 68mm D</li>
<li>nebula36: 160mm H (190mm H w/o duct) × 137mm W × 80mm D</li>
<li>nebula49: 160mm H (200mm H w/o duct) × 137mm W × 120mm D</li>
</ul>
<p>Liquid cooler support:</p>
<ul>
<li>nebula19: not supported</li>
<li>nebula36: 120mm radiator</li>
<li>nebula49: 120mm radiator</li>
</ul>
<p>At the top of the system you'll also get a few easy-access ports including USB-C, USB-A, mic-in, and headphone-out.</p>
<p>Really great to see System76 continue to expand their hardware. I look forward to more from them! What do you think to this case, would you be interested in picking one up? If so what size would you be going for?</p>

      <title>The SHARGE Disk could be a useful Steam Deck storage sidekick</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>I'm currently keeping an eye on the SHARGE Disk, a really small M.2 NVMe SSD enclosure that can plug directly into the Steam Deck (and many other devices). Mentioned briefly in my <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2023/06/a-round-up-of-recent-steam-deck-news-for-you/" target="_blank">recent news round-up</a>, this device looks like it could be really useful.</p>
<p>There's many different types of SSD enclosures and it's not a new idea <em>but</em> it does look good. The compact size and portability, plus the cooling fan and drop-proof casing all add up to a device that I feel like I need to carry around with me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SHARGE Disk is an ultra-lightweight and small portable M.2 NVMe SSD with Active Heat Dissipation System, with 2TB (Maximum) capacity and high read/write speeds of up to 1000 MB/s. It features an aluminum shell and a silicone case for any unpredictable circumstances. SHARGE Disk is the perfect choice for those who often carry EDC devices, such as phones, cameras, and laptops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently it's being funded via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shargetech/sharge-disk-the-ultimate-storage-solution-for-edc-device" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, with around £327,682 in pledges from 3,603 backers so there's a fair bit of interest in this little device. Their trailer even shows it with a Steam Deck:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="lPNTY9ZWClA"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/f74461e7cf98798c059c6aa532a8bb40.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/lPNTY9ZWClA" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>The full kit with the drop-proof case and wrap-around cable costs around £42 but just the enclosure will be about £32. Seems like quite a reasonable price. Check it out on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shargetech/sharge-disk-the-ultimate-storage-solution-for-edc-device" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you find it useful? One thing I seem to always been running out of is drive space, so this could prove very useful in a pinch to get some more games with me.</p>

      <title>Cassette Beasts adds new monsters, plus multiplayer and DLC coming</title>
      <author>Liam Dawe</author>
      <description><div class="content group e-content">
<p>Cassette Beasts is easily one of the best releases this year, and possibly one of the best creature / monster collecting games in modern times too. It's also about to get bigger!</p>
<p>Not only have they just release the free 1.2 Catacombs Update which gives players a new hidden location to find with eight new monsters including: 3 alternate remastered forms of existing monsters, 4 new monsters to discover in the world and 1 secret unique monster. There's also 10 new moves that include: a new attack, several around status effects and 4 new passives. Update trailer is below:</p>
<div class="hidden_video" data-video-id="_HR4rkbXNpE"><img alt="YouTube Thumbnail" src="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/cache/youtube_thumbs/44714f99bd27e3031d44ae8a910a90a8.jpg"/><div class="hidden_video_content"><a href="https://yewtu.be/embed/_HR4rkbXNpE" target="_blank">See video</a></div></div>
<p>Even more exciting though, is that big things are coming to the game including multiplayer! You'll be able to explore, trade and do raids together with up to 8 people. There's no exact date yet for it, because implementing multiplayer is quite a big thing for a small team. Not just that, an expansion has been teased with Pier of the Unknown.</p>
<p>This was announced during their Cassette Beasts Showcase that you can view below:</p>
